<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000407"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> It is somewhat fresher than it was this morning,
but perhaps our discussion will generate some heat because we have hit
the part of the Bill that relates to the substance of the disagreement
on Second Reading. We have genuine differences over the way in which
the scheme should be structured and the type of scheme that we are
trying to create.</div> <a name="06061416000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments restore powers to enable a redress scheme to be established
with the structure originally intended by the Government and reverse
amendments made in the other place. Clauses 6 and 11, as amended there,
would separate the fact-finding investigation under the redress scheme
from the assessment of liability and quantum. The scheme authority
would have no role in the investigation and provide no guidance or
advice to scheme members about investigations. The opportunity to have
a unified scheme would be lost.</div>
<a name="06061416000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 8, which was
tabled by the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), is even more
clearly intended to confine investigation under the redress scheme to a
fact-finding investigation, preventing consideration of issues of
liability in law, both civil and criminal, rather than issues of tort
alone. The amendment is in keeping with the amendments made in another
place and entrenches the separation, rigidly splitting the
scheme.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 42</div><a name="06061416000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main matter before us is
clause 12, and I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to amendment No.
6, which would delete it. It is important to spend some time on that to
understand why the Government seek to remove the clause and restore the
scheme to its original envisaged structure.</div>
<a name="06061416000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 12 requires the
Secretary of State to make provision for the appointment of patient
redress investigators and for the Healthcare Commission to maintain a
list of investigators and oversee them. The amendments made in the
other place seem to intend that a panel of patient redress
investigators should be created, but that is not specifically laid out
in the clause. Indeed, it does not answer many other questions, and I
urge the hon. Gentleman to give us some of the detail of the scheme
envisaged. How many patient redress investigators do the Opposition
have in mind? Who will they be? How will they go about investigating
the facts? Who will pay their wages? Those are serious questions, and
those who advocate the structure in clause 12 need to put the
detailsbefore us.</div>
<a name="06061416000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are several serious
problems with the clause, not least that it adds an additional layer of
bureaucracy and works against a primary aim of the Bill, which is to
encourage and facilitate local learning.</div>
<a name="06061416000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000408"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Baron</b> (Billericay) (Con): Let us start our debate by
discussing the Government&#146;s line that we are adding to
bureaucracy. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are accepting
the structures that are in place. All we are doing is trying to
simplify process by separating fact finding from fault finding. That is
not adding to bureaucracy. The bureaucracy would have to exist anyway
under the scheme as the Government would like it to be. All we are
saying is that there should be an independent person at the top to
guarantee its independence. That is not adding to
bureaucracy.</div>
<a name="06061416000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000409"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will develop that
train of thought, because I do not believe it possible to say that the
proposal will not increase bureaucracy. We have in mind a single,
unified scheme whereby the NHS can provide a fast-track settlement
system out of court, so that redress can be provided to individuals who
seek it for harm done in the course of their health care.</div>
<a name="06061416000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 12 and the related
amendments seek to create a split in that scheme, in that an army of
investigators would be accountable to the Healthcare Commission, and,
separately, the NHS Litigation Authority would examine the findings of
their work and be responsible for them. Will the hon. Gentleman tell me
in clear terms how those proposals do not add a layer and a brake in
the scheme? I would be grateful if he explained. As far as I can see,
they clearly do.</div>
<a name="06061416000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000410"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> The Minister must accept that his scheme, as
envisaged, is a two-stage scheme anyway. According to the Secretary of
State on Second Reading, the trust will first investigate the facts,
then pass the case to the NHS Litigation Authority for assessment of
liability. Even within the Government&#146;s scheme, there is a
two-stage process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 43</div><a name="06061416000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">All we are saying is that we
want a one-stage process. We want the fact-finding stage only, to
ensure that lessons learned are not lost in the system and the national
health service. Fault finding can be determined by the NHS Litigation
Authority&#151;that option exists&#151;or the patient can go
elsewhere to a resolve-type scheme and so on. The bottom line is that
the Government scheme, as presently constituted, involves a two-stage
process anyway, as confirmed by the Secretary of State on Second
Reading.</div>
<a name="06061416000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000411"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I do not disagree with that point. The hon.
Gentleman and his colleagues have made great play of the point about
separating fact finding from fault finding. The scheme, as envisaged,
has a separation between those two functions, in that an investigation
will be carried out at local level by the organisation concerned, which
would be followed by decisions on liability, taken by the scheme
authority, and subsequently on quantum, if relevant, on the basis of
the facts of the investigation. There is some separation of functions,
but within the structure of a unified, single scheme.</div>
<a name="06061416000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be clear that a
significant number of investigators would be required if they were to
be able to investigate the volume of complaints made. Last week, I
answered a parliamentary question from the hon. Member for Hornsey and
Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone), and the number of complaints handled
every year by trusts was detailed trust by trust. The volume is huge,
and the data will be provided to Committee members for reference. We
would be talking about an enormous volume of work, should that be
passed to an independent body of investigators.
</div><a name="06061416000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
proposes that the investigators should be accountable for their work
and overseen by the Healthcare Commission. That is separation between
their function and the assessment of liability and quantum by the NHS
Litigation Authority.</div>
<a name="06061416000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000412"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> The Minister talks about a massive increase in the
number of investigators, but fails to recognise that the apparatus,
structure and administration are already in place. All we suggest is
that at the top we have one person, an NHS redress investigator, who is
truly independent and oversees the fact-finding stage. In other words,
we are simplifying the process. I do not think it can be claimed that
we are adding to bureaucracy or cost because, in essence, we are
changing one person at the top to ensure the independence of the
investigation. I think that the Government have misunderstood our
proposals.</div>
<a name="06061416000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000413"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Maybe, and it is for the hon. Gentleman to
convince me that we have not. Clause 12, which we did not want, talks
not about a single investigator who is responsible for the scheme but
about investigators:</div>
<a name="06061416000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State
shall by order make provision for the appointment of suitably qualified
patient redress investigators who shall have conduct of the
investigation of the facts of cases in accordance with section
6(2)(a).&#148;</div> <a name="06061416000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take that to
mean that those people will be permanently employed in that role. If
they are to be independent, is the hon. Gentleman saying that they
cannot be employees of the organisation of which they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 44</div>are investigating a complaint? He has not risen to correct me, but
clearly if he is saying that investigators have to be independent, it
follows that they would not be employed by the organisation. That will
give rise to all kinds of cost and
bureaucracy.</div>
<a name="06061416000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000414"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):
Why?</div><a name="06061416000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000415"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks why, but his hon. Friend
the Member for Billericay said the investigations are already being
done and that things are already in place. It is not so. There is not
an independent patient redress investigator assigned to each trust or
region of the country; they do not exist. The function to be created
under clause 12 will add cost. On Second Reading either the hon. Member
for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) or one of his hon. Friends
talked about suitably medically qualified patient redress
investigators. If he could explain how and where that is replicated in
the current system, I would be interested. Comparisons were drawn with
the coroner system, no less. The Opposition are not proposing something
that replicates, reassigns or repackages what happens at a local level
but an extremely different scheme. I would be interested to know how
the hon. Member for Billericay feels that I am wrong in drawing that
conclusion.</div>
<a name="06061416000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000416"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> The Minister raised two issues. The first was about
clause 12(1) and its mention of &#147;investigators&#148;.
Obviously, we cannot have just one investigator in the whole country to
determine such issues. A number of investigators around the country
will fulfil the role, but it will result in only one investigator per
scheme. That brings me to the Minister&#146;s point about cost. We
must not forget that the cost is not additional but inevitable, since
there has to be an investigation whether it is carried out by the NHS
Litigation Authority, the trust or independent investigators. The cost
is established, but the question is who sits at the top and who
oversees the fact-finding stage. We suggest that NHS redress
investigators are at the top, independently chosen and independent by
nature, to ensure that the scheme is given independence.</div>
<a name="06061416000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The structure exists anyway,
and the redress scheme has an inevitable cost. There has to be an
investigation, and it is merely a question of who sits at the
top.</div> <a name="06061416000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="06061416000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000417"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman is merely confirming that
neither he nor his Friends in another place have thought the scheme
through. The terms of clause 12 suggest that all cases would be
investigated by a patient redress investigator who lays out clearly
that they shall have conduct of the investigation of fact in accordance
with clause 12 (2)(a), which says that a patient redress investigator
shall</div> <a name="06061416000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;conduct the
investigation of the facts of a case in accordance with the rules of
natural justice; and... produce a report on the principal findings
of the investigation.&#148;</div><a name="06061416000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot understand how one or two investigators in a region could do
that for every case. The hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div>Gentleman also said the proposal was not additional, but it clearly is.
He just said that these people would be put in place in a particular
region to carry out a particular contract.</div>
<a name="06061416000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The major objection is not to
the cost. The proposal envisages a very different scheme from the one
we have in mind. It would replicate in the NHS redress scheme the style
of investigation carried out under the legal process, but the whole
point of the scheme is to create a breathing space; a period in which
the NHS can face up to its failings and make appropriate redress. The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal would create a substantially different
scheme that does the same job that would now follow from the legal
process.</div><a name="06061416000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000418"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Si&#244;n Simon</b> (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab): I do not
know what point my hon. Friend has reached in his remarks and how much
else he will go on to say, but it is worth making the point that he has
chosen to focus on clause 12 as the substance of the issue. Lots of
outside organisations have taken an interest. It does not seem to me
that clause 12, or the Tory scheme, is the substance of the issue at
all. The Tory scheme seems at best to be a distraction, and probably
most realistically a rather opportunistic and ultimately irrelevant
separate scheme for the sake of having a separate scheme.</div>
<a name="06061416000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The substance of the issue is
how we can best amend a very good Bill, going with the grain of some
very progressive developments, by introducing an element of
independence. Unlike the Tories, I do not mean a whole army of
investigators. I mean some sort of jointly instructed medical expert
who is independent. I will come on to that should I catch your eye
later,Miss Begg. Opposition Members may mean all kinds of
things by independent schemes but I do not think very many people take
this seriously and I urge the Minister to not get too bothered about
it.</div><a name="06061416000041"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000419"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> My comments on clause 12 should not give the
impression to my hon. Friend and others that I am in some way
dismissing the principle of some independence within the scheme. I am
certainly not doing that. I would be happy to continue to have a
dialogue with him and others as to how investigation of the facts could
be done in such a way that people can have confidence and trust in it.
That will define the success or otherwise of the scheme. If people feel
that it has been done fairly, fully and impartially, they will more
likely accept the conclusion. I am grateful to him for making that
distinction and would be willing to talk to him about how one can
combine more impartiality or more confidence-building into the scheme.
I will come to that later, and in clause 8 we will touch on independent
legal advice that would be available to patients.</div>
<a name="06061416000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend mentioned
jointly instructing experts. That is something that we will come on to
in discussing the scheme and which could give confidence to an
individual patient. I am happy to work with him on these matters, and
he is right to dismiss the army of investigators for the nonsense that
it is.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div><a name="06061416000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000420"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The Minister has said to his. hon. Friend the
Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) that he is prepared to
discuss the idea of independence being injected into the system.
Notwithstanding the regrettable tone with which the hon. Gentleman
commented on our proposals, there is nothing in the idea of patient
redress investigators that requires them to be full-time
investigators.</div> <a name="06061416000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we
want independence injected into the system, there is nothing to stop
investigators who currently conduct investigations from being
independent, as the Minister said, which is odd, considering what he
told the hon. Gentleman. If we want independence, the investigators
should not be employed by the organisation. One simple improvement to
the Bill would be for the people who currently investigate not to do so
for the organisation by which they are employed. Independence would be
put in place, at no great expense.</div>
<a name="06061416000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Calling the investigators
patient redress investigators would help reinforce that point and be an
entirely constructive move. It could not be less opportunistic if it
tried. I hope that we can take a more cross-party approach to injecting
proper values into the debate.</div>
<a name="06061416000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000421"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> It is important to be clear about what is meant
by clause 12. I do not disagree that it is important to have an element
of independence, but I am not giving something new. The scheme that we
propose binds in elements of independence all the way through. Free
independent legal advice will be provided to patients at the point at
which a decision is made about whether to accept the offer of redress
under the scheme. That is independence and, as I said to my hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Erdington, provision has been made for the
scheme member, jointly with the patient, to instruct an independent
expert. There is independence in the
scheme.</div><a name="06061416000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I read
clause 12 differently from other hon. Members, but it says that a
patient redress investigator will conduct an investigation in every
case. We have in mind a different scheme. The scheme that we envisage
is not one in which there is an adversarial atmosphere or a climate of
fear or suspicion of an investigator coming in to conduct an
investigation and put people on their mettle. The purpose of the scheme
is for the NHS to face up at an early stage to something that has gone
wrong, to encourage staff to be open and up front about it, and to
enable them to come forward about what has gone wrong.</div>
<a name="06061416000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is for the NHS to
take ownership of the issue, for the patient and the NHS thereby to
have a more positive experience, and for a learning culture to be
promoted in that organisation, rather than for the investigator just to
arrive and begin his investigation. As hon. Members know, from other
aspects of public service, that does not necessarily produce the right
spirit or culture within an organisation, in that it tends to make
people turn inward and become concerned, rather than making them feel
that the environment is supportive and that they are going to get to
facts in a way that neither points fingers nor apportions
blame.</div>

clarify who, in his vision for the Bill, will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div>investigate a complaint and how that will differ from what currently
happens? Will a different person conduct an investigation or will the
same person who conducts one now do so, albeit under a slightly
different guise? I am slightly confused and would be grateful if the
Minister clarified that point.</div>
<a name="06061416000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000423"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that NHS
trusts are carrying out that work at present. Clause 10(2)(h)
requires</div> <a name="06061416000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a member of
the scheme to charge a specified person with responsibility for
overseeing the carrying out of specified functions conferred on the
member under this Act and advising the member about lessons to be
learnt from cases involving the member that are dealt with under the
scheme&#148;.</div> <a name="06061416000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">That says
clearly that one individual in a trust will be given responsibility for
overseeing and carrying out the specified functions under the scheme.
The scheme authority would use staff already in place to do that work,
at trust level and at the level of the NHS Litigation
Authority.</div>
<a name="06061416000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000424"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> In essence, therefore, it formalises what already
happens. It does not seem to be a big shift from what happens now. If
so, why should patients have any more confidence in the system than
they have now? I know that some Labour Members share my
concern.</div><a name="06061416000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000425"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> That is a fair question. As I said to my hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington, it will create a different
space in which we hope such matters can be resolved to
everybody&#146;s satisfaction. The hon. Gentleman will have had
constituency cases, as have I&#151;they can be confusing&#151;when
constituents come to us with complaints. There can be a slight
stand-off if it is not clear whether the patient is considering taking
legal action. If a person has commented that he will take his case to
the lawyers, a difficult period can follow during which the trust is
not clear exactly how the complaint will go forward.</div>
<a name="06061416000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the deficiencies of the
current system mean that people feel that they have no option but to
take legal action. They believe that the system does not seem to be
listening to them; they want the machine&#151;the system&#151;to
hear what they are saying; and, my goodness, we all know that from time
to time the machine does not hear what they are saying because we hear
of cases that make us all concerned. Because they do not feel that they
get proper engagement, people believe that their only option is to go
down the legal route, and the whole point of the Bill is to try to
create a different culture when handling such matters. That is the nub
of the matter.</div> <a name="06061416000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill will create a local space to help people who have been involved in
an adverse incident; it will allow an open process whereby the facts
can be put on the table and a learning experience can happen within the
trust. That will allow people to find out what went wrong and why,
rather than immediately retreating against the threat of legal action,
with staff thinking about recovering positions and about protecting
themselves from action. That is absolutely the purpose of the
Bill.</div> <a name="06061416000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) made an important speech on
Second 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>Reading, when she spoke about the effect on nursing and clinical teams
when such incidents take place. Although we talk endlessly about
patients&#151;it is a patient-focused scheme&#151;we must have
regard for the effect on NHS staff involved in such cases. It is not
necessarily in their interests, or in the patients&#146; interests,
that a long legal process should ensue as we attempt to find out the
facts of the case. That is the nub of the
matter.</div>
<a name="06061416000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000426"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): The Minister is
indeed addressing the nub of the matter. Following the line of
questioning introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr.
Walker) if the right to pursue the matter in court is not being taken
away, and if what the Government propose is a process of fact finding
that is basically the same as it is today, what is it that will
transform the culture of &#147;never say sorry&#148; mentioned by
the hon. Member for Crawley on Second Reading? What is the catalyst for
change within NHS
staff?</div><a name="06061416000369"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="06061416000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000427"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> It will happen because the scheme formalises that
process of investigation, explanation and apology&#151;it is in the
Bill, in primary legislation. That separates out the confusion,
referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley, about what we
could say if there were a legal problem and we said sorry about
something. The amendment would make the scheme very
different.</div> <a name="06061416000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I see
it, the scheme creates and carves out a breathing space in which that
process can happen. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)
and other Conservative Members seem to have a pessimistic view of the
scheme and believe that the NHS will not be capable of coming to a fair
conclusion. In my view, underlying the amendment are a basic lack of
trust and a pessimism about the ability of the system, on the back of
the scheme, to come forward with a fair and impartial judgment and then
an apology and explanation. However, we are doing something
different&#151;creating a climate in which NHS staff can feel that
they are operating in a different culture.</div>
<a name="06061416000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the important point. I
hope that I am not an eternal optimist; I do not believe that I
am.</div><a name="06061416000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000428"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> The Minister is absolutely right in the sense that
this issue is the nub of the problem and of what should be discussed.
However, there would be more chance of an open, transparent,
independent process if the adversarial aspect were taken out. That is
what we propose. We are saying that the fact finding must be separated
from the fault finding and that the investigation should simply find
the facts.</div> <a name="06061416000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government intend to bring into the scheme the concept of determining
liability and awarding compensation. However, that would not make for
an open, transparent investigation because part of the process would
involve determining liability. If we took that out and simplified the
process, we would be more likely to have an open and transparent
investigation and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr.
Walker) pointed out, a better chance of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>transforming or changing the culture in the NHS so that it was open and
addressed the issues at hand.</div>
<a name="06061416000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are more likely to achieve
that if we take the issue of determining liability out of the equation.
People tend to close and clamp up a little as soon as lawyers are
involved and there is the threat of litigation and determining
liability.</div><a name="06061416000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000429"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> We have a genuine disagreement. In my view, the
scheme as we envisage it takes the adversarial element out; the
creation of the patient redress investigators would reintroduce it in
an unhelpful way that would not be conducive to the open and
constructive resolution of complaints.</div>
<a name="06061416000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is absolutely crucial that
the process of redress under the scheme should be integrated with the
other functions that scheme members will continue to have, such as that
of handling complaints, risk management procedures and clinical
governance, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull,
North (Ms Johnson) rightly drew attention this morning.</div>
<a name="06061416000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The work will complement all
the other work that the trust, with the National Patient Safety Agency,
has under way to improve patient safety. The provisions sit properly at
that level. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s scheme would introduce the
adversarial element that we seek to
remove.</div><a name="06061416000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000430"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> This point of difference between us about how best
to ensure openness is so fundamental that it is important to dwell on
it for a second. Appointing an independent redress investigator would
replace a role that would have been taken by somebody within the system
anyway, so there would be no question of cost arising. The cost of the
investigation is fixed and inevitable; the only issue is about who
carries out the investigation. All we suggest is that it should be an
independent redress investigator.</div>
<a name="06061416000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely the Minister accepts
that if lawyers are involved in determining liability in a redress
scheme, and the NHS Litigation Authority is also deciding on issues of
compensation, it is far less likely that there will be an open,
transparent investigation than if it is confined simply to fact
finding, very much along the lines of the Inquiries Act 2005. The
scrutiny of that legislation has been well documented. I am conscious
that this is an intervention, but I shall just quote the explanatory
notes to the Act, which state
that</div><a name="06061416000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;inquiries under
this Act have no power to determine civil or criminal liability and
must not purport to do
so.&#148;</div><a name="06061416000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, they are
empowered to investigate the facts. That is not adversarial, and
therefore investigations are more open and
transparent.</div><a name="06061416000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000431"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I am afraid that we will simply have to disagree
on this. I could give the hon. Gentleman examples of trusts that have
effective ways of integrating complaints and claims handling, infection
control and patient safety&#151;issues that are properly dealt with
at local trust level. I shall disagree with him on this possibly until
we have dealt with this Bill. I do not believe that we can do anything
other than createa culture of defensiveness&#151;the hon.
Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div>Beverley and Holderness also mentioned this&#151;if somebody from
outside the organisation comes in to carry out &#147;an
investigation&#148;. I do not for the life of me understand how that
can create a situation in which people feel that the organisation is
opening up to mistakes and failings, taking ownership of them and
wanting to make proper
redress.</div><a name="06061416000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000432"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): Givenclause 12(2),
I cannot understand how the system will work in such a way that the
facts are totally distinguished from liability. As one reads it, a
report will be produced that will
include</div><a name="06061416000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any lessons to
be learnt in accordance with section
10(2)(h)&#148;,</div><a name="06061416000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">which will
provide the basis for considering any assessment of liability in tort.
I do not see how those elements can be divided in the way set out in
the clause. I would like to ask the hon. Member for Billericay exactly
what counts as a suitably qualified patient redress investigator. Is it
a lawyer or a medically qualified
person?</div><a name="06061416000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the question of what would make the scheme work. In the tragic case to
which I referred this morning of my constituents whose daughter died of
meningitis, they immediately went to the papers asking for an inquiry.
They did not realise that there was a possibility of having something
independent. I have a primary care trust that was desperate to carry
out an inquiry to get to the bottom of what happened, because it was
critical to do so. We have just had another case of meningitis in the
same school, and people have died of it in my constituency, so it is a
big issue. The PCT was desperate to investigate and the family were
desperate to have an inquiry but they did not know that there was a
process for that, and there was a danger of their taking the legal
route.</div> <a name="06061416000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">When both
sides want the same thing, it is important to give them reassurance and
to know that the independent assistance that they could have would help
them to set out the facts of their concerns. That is provided for in
the Bill. As I understand it, the legal advice provided for in the Bill
is about establishing whether any offers that are made are reasonable.
Obviously people would want to know that in order to decide whether to
adopt their other rights of using the legal process to get a better
result, but in this tragic case it would have helped if my constituents
had knownthat it was possible to have an inquiry to the
benefitof all concerned without immediately getting into
defensiveness.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000433"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right to make that
point. The whole purpose of the scheme that we have in mind is to
provide resolutions quickly and for the nature of the problem to be
quickly understood. Regardless of the issue of independence versus
local people taking ownership, a quality investigation is far more
likely to be done quickly by people who understand, or were involved
in, the case, because they will clearly understand the facts and will
be able to establish them quickly.</div>
<a name="06061416000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not accept for a moment
that it will simply be a case of handing the facts down to patients and
saying, &#147;Accept them.&#148; As I said at our previous sitting,
I often find that patients who go through the current process 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>enter into a dialogue with the trust. The letter will come back, and
they will say, &#147;Oh, no, that didn&#146;t happen. I went to
ward X, not ward Y. I was waiting there. This is what they said to my
husband.&#148; They go through a process of challenging the facts,
and I see no reason why the same will not happen under the scheme
before us&#151;indeed, I am sure that it will. As my hon. Friend
rightly said, those who do not have confidence in the facts at the end
of the process&#151;this comes back to the trust point that I made in
response to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Erdington&#151;will seek another route by which to gain
redress.</div> <a name="06061416000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thing we
must not lose sight of is that the scheme is about giving those who
are, let us say, less articulate, less wealthy and less likely to go to
an MP access to the justice that they do not currently get&#151;that
is the crux of the scheme. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness
asked what was new in the scheme. What is new is that it puts a duty on
scheme members to take an active approach to identifying cases that
might be eligible, triggering investigations into them and making
redress where appropriate. The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)
was right to ask whether patient consent should not play an important
part, and of course it should, but what is new and different about the
scheme is the duty that I described. That is what we think makes it
extremely attractive for patients and the
NHS.</div>
<a name="06061416000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000434"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Would the Minister take us carefully through how
the investigation under the Government&#146;s proposals would differ
from that under the Opposition&#146;s proposals? He suggests that the
investigation would be more expensive, bureaucratic and adversarial
under our proposals. We have dealt with the adversarial point, but
would the investigation be more expensive because an independent
investigator would be more thorough? Would it be more expensive,
fundamentally, because somebody independent came in, as opposed to
someone inside? I am unclear why the Minister believes that,
fundamentally, it would be a more expensive process. If the
investigation were of the same thoroughness, regardless of who carried
it out, exactly the same quantum of work would be involved, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Billericay said. The person establishing the
facts would simply be independent.</div>
<a name="06061416000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said that his
scheme&#151;he makes this sound like a strength of his argument, but
it is the opposite&#151;would help those who are less articulate and
who might be put off by a legal process. He also said that things would
happen more quickly if the investigation were carried out by people
involved in the case. He has said on the record, therefore, that people
involved in the case might do the investigation and then present the
facts as they saw them to somebody who was not articulate and who had
nobody else to help them establish the facts because no independence
was involved in establishing them. How can that be an improvement?
Would the Minister explain?</div>
<a name="06061416000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000435"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I shall begin with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
last remark and perhaps clarify it. Perhaps I gave a misleading
impression, but I am not saying that the individual who led the
procedure should be asked to inquire into what went wrong. I am saying 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>that it makes sense for somebody in the trust who has a working
relationship with that person to talk to them and to get to the bottom
of what went wrong. It is much better for a colleague who works in the
trust, whom the person knows and with whom he or she has had a long
working relationship, to establish the facts of the case than it is for
some unknown person to arrive and be the investigator. I am not saying
that the individual who led the procedure should be the judge and jury
and say, &#147;This is it, like it or not,&#148; because there
would be a conflict of interest. I did not say that.
</div><a name="06061416000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000436"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> You did, but I accept
that.</div>
<a name="06061416000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000437"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Okay. I am happy to have the chance to clarify
the matter. It is important that those who know and work with people
can work with them to get to the facts.</div>
<a name="06061416000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="06061416000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000438"></a><b class="B">Laura
Moffatt</b> (Crawley) (Lab): Does my hon. Friend the Minister
agree that while, initially, it seems attractive to have a second team
that is able to do the investigation, that would not address what the
Bill is attempting to do, namely change the culture within the NHS so
that it can grow up and understand that things go wrong and people want
proper redress, quickly? If we go back to business as usual, and a team
comes in to do investigations, we will be back to square one and will
not have tackled the basic problem of
responsibility.</div>
<a name="06061416000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000439"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> My hon. Friend speaks far more authoritatively on
these matters than ever I could. I agree entirely that the scheme is an
attempt to change the way in which things are done. In direct response
to the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, I would argue that if
we are to achieve that which all members of the Committee profess to
want&#151;more learning and more openness at local level&#151;it is
vital that scheme members play a fundamental role in identifying and
investigating possible mistakes. The two are indivisible. The point
about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s scheme is that we can still have the
other scheme, the independent process that ends in the courts; nobody
signs away his right to that process should he not get redress under
this scheme.</div>
<a name="06061416000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000440"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> The Minister makes a good point. Let us focus for
a second on the patient, who is very upset. He has just lost somebody,
or something has gone badly wrong. Who will advise him on the processes
and opportunities open to him to bring a complaint? How will the trust
conduct the process, and who will be responsible for making the first
contact with the
patient?</div><a name="06061416000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000441"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. As I just
said to his hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness, the
Bill creates a new duty to get the process under way without waiting
for a complaint to be made. That is part of the new culture, to which
my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley rightly draws attention. It is
not a case of getting away with it if nothing comes in, and hoping that
a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div>complaint is not made. The point is that the system will trigger an
investigation when it is known that things have not been satisfactory.
It will require patient consent for a matter to go fully through the
redress process, but this is an attempt to create a different
system.</div> <a name="06061416000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make no
apology whatsoever for saying that this scheme will help those who do
not feel inclined to take legal action or to go to their MPs but who,
nevertheless, feel that they have been on the receiving end of poor
care and are deeply dissatisfied about their experience. One of the
main justifications for a scheme of this kind is that it broadens the
access to justice of people in that
position.</div>
<a name="06061416000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000442"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> The Minister said that one aspect of independence
is that patients will still have a right to go to court if they are not
happy. Is not the point of the redress scheme to provide an alternative
to going to court? It would be absurd if the key to the success or
fairness of the alternative were a right to appeal to the
original.</div>
<a name="06061416000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000443"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Earlier today, the hon. Gentleman said&#151;I
agreed with him&#151;that most people will come forward because they
do not want the thing that happened to them to happen to somebody else.
Let me put it to him that procedures and practices are more likely to
be changed if an organisation has carried out its own investigation
into what went wrong. I would argue that our route is more likely to
achieve the principal aim of the scheme, on which he and I agree, than
is the system that he envisages.</div>
<a name="06061416000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000444"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point about the need
for change in the NHS. We agree on that. However, we are saying that
there is a better chance of encouraging change if we take out the
adversarial aspect of the investigation and leave it to the
fact-finding
stage.</div><a name="06061416000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
credibility, I think that the Minister underestimates the importance of
independence to credibility. Lessons must be learned, but the most
important thing is that patients place credibility on the scheme. If we
allow an organisation to investigate its own affairs, there is the risk
that patients cannot be sure that it is fair. That would hurt the
credibility of the
scheme.</div><a name="06061416000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister accept that if we want credibility, if we want the scheme to
work and the nature and culture of the NHS to change, above all else it
must have the credibility of independence, otherwise many other
questions fall from
it?</div><a name="06061416000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000445"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I do not take that point. On Second Reading, the
hon. Gentleman and his colleagues talked about a system along the lines
of the coroner system for the patient redress role. I think that they
envisage a fundamentally different scheme. Effectively, he is asking us
to endorse the principle that we have the adversarial scheme currently
provided under the legal system, but at an earlier stage, under an
organised NHS scheme. So I think that he is asking us to embrace 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div>something different, and to endorse an adversarial investigation as part
of the NHS redress
scheme.</div><a name="06061416000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000446"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="06061416000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000447"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> No, let me answer in
full.</div><a name="06061416000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would
create defensiveness, and would not aid the full establishment of the
facts. The independence comes when people are offered legal advice at
the end of the redress process. Only they will know whether they feel
that the explanation given to them, as required by the legislation,
meets with the experience that they suffered. If it does not, they can
carry on with the process, and seek redress via the legal route. If
they are able to, they will qualify for legal aid to do
so.</div><a name="06061416000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000448"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I shall make my point again because Opposition
Members are in effect repeating their same point&#151;I am conscious
that the Minister keeps hearing it and is obliged to keep replying to
it.</div> <a name="06061416000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Bill
and the proposed scheme, it will be perfectly possible to introduce an
element of constructive independence into the system. When those of us
who would have supported amendment No. 19, which we are discussing in
this group, and who disagree profoundly with clause 12, talk about
independence, we mean within the context of the scheme proposed in the
Bill, in which the NHS will investigate itself. However, at a certain
point in that process, if certain ideal situations are not reached,
some element of independent arbitration, presumably commissioned
jointly by both parties, would be the most constructive way forward.
When we talk about independence, we are talking about writing that
possibility more strongly into the Bill, as amended in the other place,
in order to make such independence a right for people who reach that
stage in the proposed scheme, within the NHS culture, as explained by
the Minister.</div> <a name="06061416000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not want the Minister to get the impression that Opposition Members
have a monopoly on the argument for independence; they do not.
Independence means something more constructive when used on the
Government side, than when it is used on the Opposition
side.</div><a name="06061416000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000449"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> What is this partisan
nonsense?</div><a name="06061416000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000450"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I hear the shouts from Opposition Members, but I
agree with my hon. Friend. In making our decisions on the scheme, we
need to create sufficient confidence in the process that happens under
it. Let us be clear that no two cases will be the same. Some cases will
be more deserving of the kind of extra scrutiny to which he refers than
others. There will be some cases where it would not be appropriate. In
such cases, the facts can be readily established, the explanation can
be given and an apology can be made. Cases will differ.</div>
<a name="06061416000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right that we come on to
amendment No. 19, because it raises important points. I shall happily
move on in a moment, once we can move off these other issues. My hon.
Friend is correct that we are not setting our face against
independence. The crux comes when the person is asked to accept the
offer. If they decide that they cannot do so and it is at the point
before they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 55</div>sign any waiver with regard to their further legal rights, they will be
offered the independent legal advice. We believe that such a provision
crucially gives a measure of
independence.</div><a name="06061416000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
aware that my hon. Friend would probably want us to go further, but in
considering this matter we must be careful that we are not replicating
the process on the other side of the line. We should not create a
system where unnecessary legal advice is given or where advice is
commissioned to create a veneer of independence. The point is that we
are trying to do something different. We are trying to get quickly to
the point where redress can be offered rather than there being
obfuscation and delay by the NHS as it seeks to investigate a complaint
against it. The crucial point is when the independent advice is offered
to the patient. My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head in many
ways. It is how we reconcile that balance within the scheme proper so
that when we reach the point of redress being offered, patients are
confident that things have been done fairly and
properly.</div>
<a name="06061416000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000451"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I should like the Minister to
move on, because I think that we are making heavy weather of this. A
distinction between facts and liability seems to be at play. I have
certain philosophical difficulties, as one can always be established
independently of the other. I do not know whether negligence is a fact
or a judgment on responsibility, but I suspect that it will probably be
described as both. If those philosophical difficulties are set aside
for a moment, if there are facts and liability and they are separate
things, is not the fundamental discussion that we are having at the
moment about whether things should be done by one agency or by two
different ones.</div><a name="06061416000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
one agency is the agency being complained about. I do not think that
there is disagreement on either side that if we were to opt for two
agencies rather than one in-house agency, we would change and denature
the scheme. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked what the
difference is between what is proposed by Opposition Members and what
is supported by the Minister. If there is no difference, or if we
cannot find any, he certainly should not be supporting an amendment on
the subject.</div><a name="06061416000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is offering a scheme that everyone agrees is different from
what is proposed by the Opposition. The Minister is robustly sticking
to it. He regards what he has as a good thing but Opposition Members
regard it as a bad thing. Unless the Minister has a change of heart and
wishes the NHS to make a different offer, we are, in a sense, stuck
repeating the same arguments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000452"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman in the nicest possible way is
helping me to move on, and I am grateful for his invitation to do so. I
shall do so by picking up the important point about bureaucracy. Were
we to go down the path that the Bill as it stands lays out, the scheme
would create unnecessary bureaucracy and cost. The Healthcare
Commission would be responsible for overseeing the investigation stage.
The scheme authority would be responsible for the second stage, which
is determining liability and appropriate level of compensation. No
single body 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div>would have overall responsibility for the oversight of the operation of
the redress scheme as a whole.</div>
<a name="06061416000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our view, the scheme
authority would be compromised and would have no power to ensure that
the overall scheme operates effectively. The crucial point to which we
keep returning is that we would weaken the vital link between
investigation and learning, which was provided by the Bill before it
was amended. I agree with the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06061416000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition have a further
problem, in that the Healthcare Commission says clearly that it is
neither qualified nor inclined to take up the role envisaged for it by
clause 12. Opposition Members should give careful thought to
that.</div>
<a name="06061416000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="06061416000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000453"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> We and the Liberal Democrats in the other place met
the chief executive of the Healthcare Commission. The commission is
happy to take on the supervisory role, but the Minister is right that
it did not want the secretarial role, so I would ask him to double
check his facts in that
regard.</div><a name="06061416000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
Minister&#146;s point on costs, he still has not explained how or why
they would be substantially increased under our proposal. The cost of
an investigation is fixed and inevitable. I repeat the point because he
seems somewhat unwilling to address it. If the cost of an investigation
is fixed and inevitable, the only issue is who carries it out. If we
are simplifying the role of the scheme to one of fact-finding, it
cannot be claimed that we are adding to the
bureaucracy.</div><a name="06061416000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000454"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Let me pick up on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
first point. If he is saying that the Healthcare Commission is ready to
take on the role, but has caveats about the scope of that role, why has
he not taken the time or trouble to try to amend the Bill to give the
Healthcare Commission a role that it feels it can carry out? Clause 12
(5) requires it to</div>
<a name="06061416000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maintain and publish a list of
patient redress
investigators&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06061416000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
maintenance of such a list seems to me to be a duty that requires
proper safeguards and checks to ensure that people are appropriate to
be an investigator&#151;and
to</div><a name="06061416000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have responsibility
for overseeing the carrying out of the functions of such
investigators.&#148;</div>
<a name="06061416000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon. Gentleman is saying
that the Healthcare Commission does not accept the full role that the
Opposition envisage, why has he not tabled amendments to curtail that?
The role envisaged is broad and would involve supervision of the
operation of the scheme. The Healthcare Commission would be responsible
for all the redress investigators and the work that they carried out.
That is the guts of the scheme. I return to the point that I have no
confidence that that amendment has been properly thought through, or
that there is any detail to support the proposals.</div>
<a name="06061416000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members might
express surprise, but I have yet to find out how many patient redress
investigators they envisage, although I heard on Second Reading that
they would be akin to coroners. We are left in the dark on all kinds of
things. If the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>commission does not accept the role as it stands, why on earth have the
Opposition not tabled amendments to change
it?</div><a name="06061416000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000455"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Has my hon. Friend heard Opposition Members give
any description of the patient redress investigators other than,
&#147;It&#146;s the person at the top.&#148;? That fills me with
horror about the pay involved and so on. Until we know how many there
will be, what they will be and whether&#151;as I asked
earlier&#151;they will be lawyers, medically qualified people or
maybe like coroners, we can have no sense of whether the proposals are
bureaucratic or costly and whether they make any
sense.</div><a name="06061416000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that a
separate tier will be created. As my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley
said, it will stop the NHS taking responsibility for its own mistakes
by accepting that responsibility, which is what the scheme that was
previously proposed
did.</div><a name="06061416000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000456"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I agree. There is such a lack of detail about the
proposals and a wooliness of thinking that it makes one despair that
such stuff should be brought forward and we could be asked to consider
it
seriously.</div><a name="06061416000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000457"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I have resisted making the point, but it leaps out
at me. I invite the Minister to agree that the proposal from the
Tories&#151;and I think the Liberals too&#151;seems extraordinarily
Napoleonic. It is an incredibly inquisitorial, Napoleonic, continental,
un-British and foreign way of going about things. One wonders what the
Tory party has come to when it can recommend something so profoundly
continental and foreign as a good
idea.</div><a name="06061416000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000458"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): You were right first
time: you should not have made the
point.</div><a name="06061416000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000459"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> At moments such as this, I am glad that the hon.
Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) is not on the Committee, because the mere
mention of a continental-style scheme could have had him out of his
seat. It feels to me distinctly un-Conservative to propose the creation
an army of bureaucrats who are empowered to go round the country
snooping, investigating and looking into the affairs of NHS trusts. It
seems unusual for the Opposition to propose such a scheme. If they are
wedded to that proposal, I would be grateful if they made available the
supporting detail. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington
is right to draw attention to that sheer lack of detail.</div>
<a name="06061416000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns have been raised about
the cost ofclause 12. Modelling work undertaken by the
Department projects a possible cost of independently investigating all
redress cases of as much as &#163;41 million in the first year. That
is the estimated additional cost of the scheme envisaged by the
Opposition.</div>
<a name="06061416000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000460"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> My Lib Dem friends have been rumbling away on
opportunity costs, but I am slightly confused. Why would it cost any
less for the NHS to investigate its mistakes than for someone who was
not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div>part of the NHS hospital management structure to do exactly the same
job? The Minister&#146;s mathematics&#151;or, dare I say, the
mathematics of his civil servants&#151;is intriguing and a little
confusing on that
point.</div><a name="06061416000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000461"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I shall go through the detail for the hon.
Gentleman. Opposition Members might find it uncomfortable, but the
figure that I quoted is the figure that has been arrived at. The hon.
Member for Billericay called our figures spurious on Second Reading, so
I hope that he will have cause to reflect on that when I give him some
of the detail.</div><a name="06061416000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point that the Opposition might not like to accept is that they
envisage a new function that is different from what is done now, so how
can they dismiss the notion of additional cost? They propose that the
function be performed by an independent investigator, not by somebody
employed by the trust and working within it on patient safety, clinical
governance and the complaints
system.</div><a name="06061416000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
tell us that they envisage a number of people working at the regional
level, which is additional to what is provided. Our modelling, based on
the information, shows that the average cost of independently
investigating a complex complaint, such as one that might be made in a
clinical negligence case, is &#163;2,500. The number of claims
settled for less than &#163;20,000 represents approximately 75 per
cent. of settled claims. We expect a similar proportion to be covered
by the new scheme, although exact numbers are hard to
predict.</div><a name="06061416000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
behind the scheme, however, is to make seeking redress more
straightforward. We therefore expect more people to come forward.
Modelling work based on patient safety data suggests that improved
access to justice under the scheme could cause claims to rise by
anything from 2,200 to 19,000 a year. We expect the number of cases
falling within the scheme to range between 5,800 and 16,600 in year
one.</div><a name="06061416000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Making each case
subject to independent investigation would result in a total cost of
&#163;41 million, based on the figures that departmental stakeholders
have provided to us through independent investigations. On the lowest
estimate of 5,800 cases, the additional cost to the NHS would be
some&#163;14 million, but we expect significantly more cases
to be identified under the
scheme.</div><a name="06061416000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000462"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> Those figures are completely spurious and I
sincerely ask the Minister to check them with his civil servants. The
bottom line is that the cost of investigation is fixed and inevitable;
the issue is who carries out the
investigation.</div><a name="06061416000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we
are simply deciding on the change regarding who will carry it out to
ensure that there is independence, how does the Minister get the figure
of &#163;41 million when all we are saying is that the person at the
top should be independent and should replace the person whom the
Minister no doubt
envisages?</div><a name="06061416000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask hon.
Members to bear it in mind that fact finding is essential to fault
finding, and that under the Government&#146;s proposals the
fact-finding stage will have to be gone through anyway before the point
of determining liability is reached. All we are saying is simplify the
scheme by restricting it to fact finding, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>ensure its independence by having redress investigators. How can that
add &#163;41
million?</div><a name="06061416000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000463"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Let us take the lowest estimate, and suppose that
there are 5,800 cases in year one. We are confident that the figures
are not spurious. The scheme has been created carefully, with an eye to
how many cases will come forward based on historical trends in clinical
negligence cases under the limit that we are setting and on the fact
that the scheme is likely to encourage more people to come forward who
may not otherwise pursue a case. The figures are not plucked out of the
air, but are grounded in
fact.</div><a name="06061416000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Member for Billericay is saying that there is no additional cost to
investigating all those cases independently, I strongly disagree. I do
not accept that it is exactly the same and that it requires simply that
people be reallocated to different
duties.</div><a name="06061416000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
investigators are to be independent of thescheme members, as
the hon. Gentleman envisages, and medically qualified&#151;the point
that he and the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) made
on Second Reading&#151;it is inconceivable that there would not be
significant extra costs to the
scheme.</div><a name="06061416000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
there would be significant extra administration involved in setting up
such a group of people, which would be accredited and maintained on a
database, as outlined in the proposal made by the hon. Member for
Billericay. When I mentioned the figures, Opposition Members fell about
laughing, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to tell me what the figure
should be. If Opposition Members are saying that they have it
absolutely proven that there would be no additional cost, will they
give me the details? As it is, they want it both ways: they are not
providing any detail, but they are rubbishing our
figures.</div><a name="06061416000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000464"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Is my hon. Friend becoming as confused as I am
by the hon. Member for Billericay? Did he not just say that only the
person at the top would be independent? If so, does my hon. Friend now
understand the hon. Gentleman to be saying that the person at the
top&#151;the independent investigator&#151;would simply supervise
all the staff doing the fact chasing, or would that person have their
own staff? The hon. Gentleman has referred to that person only as the
person at the top. Who would be the staff under him, those doing the
investigations?</div><a name="06061416000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000465"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I do not mind admitting that I am deeply
confused, but I am not the only person in this room who is deeply
confused about the nature of the scheme that the hon. Member for
Billericay proposes. He said that the independence would come from the
person at the top, but the Bill creates something entirely different.
Indeed, on Second Reading, the Opposition talked about something
entirely different in introducing these changes, but it is for them to
answer those
points.</div><a name="06061416000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it is, we
have no clarity whatever. As I understand it, under the scheme proposed
by the Opposition, the investigators must be new people from outside
NHS organisations&#151;that is, not employed by the scheme members.
Higher salaries would have to be paid if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div>those people were to be medically qualified, because many of those who
currently carry out the work at trust level are not medically
qualified. People might not want to be reminded of that, but it is
true. If those staff had to be relocated in order to carry out their
functions, there would be further extra
costs.</div><a name="06061416000372"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="06061416000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000466"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I find it difficult to follow the
Minister&#146;s logic. He seems to be saying that the cost of an
independent investigation is something like &#163;2,500, but it is
not clear whether he thinks that that is the extra cost. Clearly,
within that figure, which he seems to have extrapolated according to
the predicted number of cases, there is an amount that an investigation
would cost anyway. We believe that the Department&#146;s maths might
be at fault, but I shall give the Minister the benefit of the doubt at
this point.</div>
<a name="06061416000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000467"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> If an independent organisation carries out an
investigation, the costs fall to the structure that is supporting that
investigator in carrying out that particular function. We have heard a
lot of noise from Opposition Members, but nobody has said who is to
employ the investigators. If Opposition Members can tell us who is to
be the employer of this army of investigators that is to set out to do
the work, we might be able to bear down on the precise additional costs
of the scheme. However, we have not had that level of detail, and at
the moment we are simply considering a requirement that each case will
be independently investigated by a patient redress investigator. Going
by departmental figures, the average cost of an investigation into a
complex clinical negligence claim is &#163;2,500. People at trust
level will continue to work on clinical governance. Those people should
play that role, and they will do so once we delete the clause. However,
it is right that we should have this discussion and, in the absence of
anything else from the Opposition, demolish this ridiculous
proposal.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000468"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> There is a paradox in what the Minister says. He
claims that his civil servants have carefully and meticulously modelled
the proposal almost to the last penny, but that he barely understands
the scheme. He cannot claim both things. Can I test his understanding
of the modelling? Is there a presumption behind it that providing for
independent investigators is in some way mirroring what is done by
hospital managers who might, in a more adversarial climate, follow
cases in some detail themselves? One could argue, prima facie, that
hospital managers, freed from the chore of having to investigate a
number of really complex cases, could do something such as getting
their deficits down. However, if they are still consumed with issues of
clinical negligence, the Minister has a better
point.</div>
<a name="06061416000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000469"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point, in
the absence of any detail it is difficult for anybody to support the
clause, or for us to begin to have a proper discussion. As I have said,
we know that the people should be independent. We were told on Second
Reading that they must be medically qualified. A parallel has been
drawn with the coroners system, and we have heard different
suggestions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div><a name="06061416000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been told from the Chair
that this is not a new clause; it is part of the Bill. In the absence
of any detail, I hope that the Committee will agree that it is right
that, in considering whether it should remain part of the Bill, we
should rigorously test whether the costs are justified. Our figures,
properly put together by the Department, suggest that those costs are
likely to be close to &#163;41
million.</div><a name="06061416000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000470"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I have been listening carefully to the Minister,
and he rests his case on a distinction in the understanding of
independence, but above all on a comparison of costs and the
introduction of new costs under the clause that he thinks are not
supportable. If he is genuine in believing that he has a truly
comparative set of figures&#151;apples with apples, whether medically
or non-medically qualified, because neither in the clause nor in his
scheme do the people have to be medically qualified&#151;and putting
to one side the underlying suspicion that using an organisation that
has to generate profit is bound to cost more than using those employed
in the public services, because I am sure that he would not want to be
so tendentious as to argue that, is he right to expect us to debate the
subject without putting his calculations in the Library so that we can
examine them? It strikes me&#151;perhaps he will confirm
it&#151;that he is comparing the full employed costs in the
Opposition&#146;s proposals with the marginal costs used for the
purposes of his own calculations. That is not comparing apples with
apples.

commitments without costings to support them. In fact, I would have
been sacked as a health researcher had the then Opposition supported
such a thing.</div> <a name="06061416000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

investigate in a year? He should clarify the matter so that we can
consider the costings that he seeks to impose on us under the clause.
In the absence of that detail, we cannot be categorical about saying
that it will be that much. I am confident that the independent
investigation would place additional costs on the service, but we would
lose the benefits&#151;the local ownership of the problems, people
facing up to the problems, the positive learning culture at the local
level. I argue directly that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal would
give us extra costs but take away the benefits of the scheme. On that
basis, I think that we should reject it out of
hand.</div>
<a name="06061416000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000472"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I do not want to detain the Minister on the
clause&#151;surely we have done it to death by now&#151;but I ask
him to confirm my understanding, which is that opposition to the
proposal does not rest on the cost. It is anything but that; the
argument rests on the fundamental flaws of a silly add-on to a sensible
Bill. The Minister cannot be expected to take a completely vague set of
proposals with no detail and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>assume that they will not have a cost. It seems to me that the
Opposition have come up with a wide range of numbers. They completely
refuse to put any detailon their proposals. The hon. Member
for Southport (Dr. Pugh) says that the Minister cannot have it both
ways; by the same token, nor can the Opposition. They cannot give us a
half-hearted half clause with half a set of proposals and then damn the
Government for not costing them exactly.</div>
<a name="06061416000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000473"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Absolutely; I could not agree more with my hon.
Friend. I do not object to the proposal on grounds of cost. The
question is whether what is proposed is worth paying for, and I say
that it is not. Indeed, it is worse than that. It damages a consensual
partnership-based scheme, replacing it with something that has the
costs but not the benefits. I doubt whether the Opposition want to hear
this, given the way in which they are flannelling around, but they have
failed to hit the nail on the
head.</div><a name="06061416000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may, I
shall move on to amendment No. 19, which has rightly been mentioned.
The amendment enables the scheme to make provision for the independent
assessment of the eligibility of cases for redress under the scheme in
specified circumstances. Clause 11 requires the Secretary of State to
make provision in the scheme for the scheme authority to have functions
in connection with the scheme. It is intended that the scheme authority
will be an existing special health authority&#151;the National Health
Service Litigation Authority&#151;which will be able to build on its
existing experience and expertise in handling clinical negligence cases
to support local organisations in delivering redress. The NHSLA has the
resources, expertise, experience and skills mix to oversee delivery of
the redress scheme. It has the systems to administer claims for
clinical negligence against NHS bodies and an existing relationship
with every trust in England as a result of its work on the clinical
negligence scheme for trusts. That unique relationship means that it is
in a strong position to be the scheme
authority.</div><a name="06061416000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 19 would, in effect, provide for powers to enable decisions about
eligibility to be made by a person or body other than the scheme
authority. It would seem to be intended to allow an appeal against the
scheme authority&#146;s assessment of eligibility in specified
circumstances, and I shall resist it because we have put in place
sufficient safeguards, as I shall explain.</div>
<a name="06061416000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise that there are
real concerns that there should be independent oversight of the
investigation so that it is not a purely in-house investigation. We
have provided sufficient safeguards to address those concerns, but I
shall continue to listen to what my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Erdington has to say on the issue. The Bill puts in place a
complaints mechanism for the redress scheme and provides for
independent oversight of the investigation. In cases of
maladministration, the health service ombudsman will ultimately
determine whether cases have been dealt with appropriately.
Maladministration has been interpreted to cover a wide range of
bureaucratic bad practice, and that will enable the ombudsman to
investigate allegations that individual cases have been poorly
investigated. That is a lever to ensure proper consideration at local
level.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div><a name="06061416000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000474"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way, because the
issue of how we guarantee independence is important. Does he not
accept, however, that the ombudsman can look only at the administrative
and procedural, not the substantive aspects of the process? How can he
claim that the ombudsman will guarantee independence when she will
investigate only administrative and procedural
matters?</div>
<a name="06061416000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000475"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct that the ombudsman
has no formal power to enforce her recommendations, but as he will
know, those recommendations are almost always followed. The ombudsman
will have a particular duty to report, not on whether the right
conclusion was reached with regard to liability, but on the process and
on the way in which the scheme is handled. That is only one of the
measures that we are putting in place to ensure that there is
independent oversight of the scheme. If I may make a point that was
made on Second Reading, the current health service commissioner has
welcomed the fact that the operation of the scheme will fall clearly
within her jurisdiction, subject to the conditions set out in the
Health Service Commissioners Act 1993. She says:</div>
<a name="06061416000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I hope that the fact
that an independent review...will be available will give
reassurance to both complainants and the NHS bodies
involved&#148;.</div><a name="06061416000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned the intention that the Secretary ofState will devise
a new national NHS standard relating to redress and that the Healthcare
Commission will devise assessment criteria against which the operation
of the scheme will be reviewed. That approach willalso provide
an independent overview of the redress scheme at local level. Putting
in place further provision for independent assessment would duplicate
the ombudsman&#146;s role and add unnecessarily to the bureaucracy
and cost of the scheme.</div>
<a name="06061416000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, as we have made
clear throughout, the redress scheme will not remove a patient&#146;s
right to go to court. That right will remain throughout the process, up
to the point where an offer is accepted. The scheme aims to fast-track
deserving cases through the system and to make savings on unnecessary
legal costs. It is to no one&#146;s advantage to reject deserving
claims and to force them into the courts. Doing so would work against
the aim of the Bill and the scheme that we hope to
create.</div>
<a name="06061416000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="06061416000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
long debate on the point of these amendments. I hope that I can soon
bring my remarks to a conclusion. One claim made by the Opposition in
<i class="I">The Times</i> today, no less, is that the NHS would be acting as
&#147;judge and jury&#148;, as the quote would have it. We have had
a long discussion about whether there should be more independence and
whether the NHSis capable of coming up with a fair conclusion.
I fundamentally believe that it is.</div>
<a name="06061416000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">While it is true that there is
a judicial authority requiring separation between fact finding and
fault finding, that applies only where rights are being determined. It
is crucial for Members to understand that no rights are determined
under our scheme. Neither the NHS nor the NHS Litigation Authority is
acting as a judge; the NHS may merely make offers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div>that may satisfy a patient&#146;s rights. There is no determination of
whether they have the rights; it is simply that an offer may be made to
prevent a legal process from taking
place.</div><a name="06061416000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall, I
firmly believe that the difficulties inherent in the proposed scheme
structure currently laid out in clause 12 create confusion and will
lessen the effectiveness of the redress scheme. The Government
amendments that I propose would work to reverse the amendments made in
another place: they would put back in place the strong links between
scheme members and the scheme authority, reduce unnecessary bureaucracy
and associated cost, and enable the scheme to fulfil its aims of better
meeting the needs of patients harmed in the course of their health care
and of enabling scheme members to learn from mistakes and improve
service delivery.</div>
<a name="06061416000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000476"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call speakers in the debate, may I just
clarify a procedural point in the light of something that the Minister
said at the beginning of his speech? Government amendment No. 6, which
proposes to &#147;leave out Clause 12&#148;, has not been selected.
Instead, should clause 12 stand part be pressed to a Division, at that
stage it would be up to individuals who want it to be left out to vote
against the clause standing part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="06061416000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000477"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> On a point of order, Miss Begg. Will you clarify
that the clause 12 stand part debate will therefore be taken when
clause 12 is reached in the course of our deliberations, despite its
being grouped at this point for the convenience of
discussion?</div><a name="06061416000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000478"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is open for discussion under this group, but
the vote will be taken as we proceed through the Bill in the correct
order.</div>
<a name="06061416000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000479"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to you, Miss
Begg.</div><a name="06061416000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000480"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I do not doubt that the Government&#146;s
proposals are well intentioned, but other Conservative Members and I
believe that they will not be beneficial to patients. They will create
confusion. The Bill, in its original form, made a number of errors that
I shall, I hope, highlight during the debate on this clause. I welcome
interventions from the Minister on the cases that I am sure that he and
others&#151;</div><a name="06061416000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000481"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Even if no one else
will.</div><a name="06061416000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000482"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> Yes.</div>
<a name="06061416000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000483"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div>
<a name="06061416000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000484"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> No, I would like to make some progress
first.</div> <a name="06061416000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know
that reform is needed. The Conservative party approves of the spirit
and intentions of the NHS Redress Bill. As we know, the state of
clinical negligence is largely fuelled by legal aid. We also know that
it is in a mess, and is protracted, costly, complex and wasteful. I do
not think that any disagreement exists between us on those issues. A
claim can typically 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>take several years, with legal administrative costs often exceeding the
money paid to the claimant.</div>
<a name="06061416000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The present system also does
not reflect patient priorities. As we have discussed in this Committee,
what is often required by the aggrieved patient is an explanation and
apology, where due, and a reassurance that whoever committed the
clinical error acknowledge his or her wrongs, that lessons are learned
and that they have not been lost for the benefit of other patients.
However, the system as it operates is not achieving that
goal.</div><a name="06061416000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The system is
also widely viewed as unfair. Most clinical negligence cases are
legal-aid funded but most people are not eligible for legal aid. Of the
vast majority who cannot access legal aid, many are put off pursuing a
negligence claim because of the cost involved regardless of whether the
grievance is legitimate.</div>
<a name="06061416000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NHS is often in a no-win
situation, as we know. Even the costs of winning a case are
irrecoverable if the claimant is funded through legal aid, which might
result in cases being settled out of court regardless of their merits
because it is cheaper to do so that to contest them. Last year, some
6,200 legally aided clinical negligence cases concluded and it is not
surprising to learn that 2,754 of those went beyond the investigation
stage, with a substantive benefit in 56 per cent. of
cases&#151;roughly 1,400&#151;and an overall success rate of 23 per
cent. The hope is that the scheme will deal with that
unfairness.</div> <a name="06061416000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
is important because it partly explains the chequered history of the
Bill, the origins of which go back to June 2003 when Sir Liam Donaldson
published &#147;Making Amends&#148;, which considered the problems
of the clinical negligence system and the options for change. As an
aside, &#147;Making Amends&#148; was highly critical of the concept
of tort, but its trouble was that it blamed the law for the ills of
clinical negligence litigation when the real trouble was with the
lawyers, or rather with their abuse of the legal aid system.</div>
<a name="06061416000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have come full circle
because tort-based liability is what the Bill will be about if the
Government have their way. There is nothing inherently bad about tort
law. It is part of the law of this country and applies generally. There
is no reason why clinical practice in this country should not be
subject to its scrutiny, but the redress scheme is not the place to do
it. It is not a court and therefore it is not appropriate to determine
civil liability. Determinations might not, therefore, be legally
binding and it will replicate a court system without bringing closure,
certainty or finality.</div>
<a name="06061416000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Making Amends&#148;
contained 19 recommendations, but the Bill gives effect only to
recommendation 1; the other 18 are not addressed. As we know, the
Bill&#146;s objective is to create a scheme for efficient and speedy
redress for NHS patients who have suffered through negligence while
receiving treatment. It is a laudable aim which we can all
support.</div> <a name="06061416000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intended
scheme provides investigation when things go wrong, remedial treatment,
rehabilitation and care when needed, explanations and apologies, and
financial compensation in certain circumstances. Its scope is ambitious
and the Bill proposes a package of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div>remedies&#151;a one-stop shop, if I can put it that way&#151;but it
is the underlying policy that gives rise to our concerns.</div>
<a name="06061416000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NHS redress scheme seems
mainly to be concerned with compensation, since it can apply only where
there is a qualifying liability in tort. It appears to be conceived as
an in-house settlement-making process, rather than an independent
judicial investigative process. In contrast to what the Minister has
said, I would argue that it is adversarial rather than inquisitorial,
because the Bill in its original form aims to involve determining
liability.</div> <a name="06061416000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liability
is to be assessed by the NHSLA rather than being determined by an
independent tribunal, and compensation is to be offered by the NHSLA
rather than awarded by an independent tribunal. Any offers, according
to the Government, will be made without prejudice and neither offers
nor settlements are to be regarded as an admission of liability for the
purpose of any subsequent litigation. There can be no appeal as the
process is not judicial. Offers are to be accepted or rejected on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis.</div>
<a name="06061416000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concept of a one-stop shop
is superficially attractive, but on closer inspection the Bill was
found to be fraught with problems. It was over-ambitious, attempting to
combine conflicting functions. It confused fact finding with fault
finding, inquisitorial with adversarial and open proceedings with
without prejudice proceedings. The Bill was fundamentally flawed as it
did not provide what was needed, which was an open, independent
fact-finding investigation that reflected the interests and priorities
of patients. That is why we combined forces in another place with the
Liberal Democrats and Cross Benchers to force amendments on the
Government that ensure that the Bill provided for an independent
investigation. Indeed, our amendments ensured not only that the
investigation would be independent, but that it would be confined to
establishing the facts, and not concerned with fault finding. We
believe that our amendments are good for patients and the
NHS.</div><a name="06061416000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill, as
amended, now addresses one of our key concerns: the need for an
independent investigation. Otherwise, the Government&#146;s proposals
would have had the NHS investigating itself as judge and jury in its
own court&#151;a modern star chamber. That would have represented a
clear conflict of interest, with the NHSLA being asked to take
responsibility for running the scheme, determining liability and
awarding
compensation.</div><a name="06061416000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take
issue with the Minister&#146;s suggestion that, by various measures,
independence is guaranteed. During his introduction, he suggested that
there will be independent legal advice at the time that an offer is
made. That will not guarantee independence in the process itself.
Having a lawyer&#151;an additional cost, by the way&#151;advising
on an offer does not guarantee that the process itself is
independent.</div> <a name="06061416000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister went on to say that patients will still have the right to go
to court if they are not happy. That is bizarre; I put it to the
Minister that the point of the redress scheme is to provide an
alternative to going to court. It would be absurd if the key to the
success of the alternative were a right to appeal to the
original.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000485"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Further to my hon. Friend&#146;s point about the
need for independence in the fact-finding stage, I draw his attention
to the parliamentary brief on the Bill, supplied by the Law Society,
which states:</div>
<a name="06061416000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;It will be difficult
for solicitors to advise applicants on the fairness of an offer unless
such queries&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="06061416000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">this is about fact
finding&#151;</div><a name="06061416000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are
resolved at the Investigation stage and prior to the issue of an
offer&#148;.</div><a name="06061416000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">That makes my
hon. Friend&#146;s point entirely. The Law Society supports the view
of the need for an independent understanding of the
facts.</div><a name="06061416000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000486"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. Having
lawyers advising at the end of an offer does not guarantee independence
of the process
itself.</div><a name="06061416000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
went on to say, however, that there could be an appeal to a health
ombudsman, while the Healthcare Commission oversees the scheme&#146;s
implementation.</div><a name="06061416000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000487"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I agree with the hon. Member for Beverley and
Holderness that independent legal advice needs to come earlier in the
process, in order for the scheme to work, be more meaningfully
independent, and be perceived as such. I do not think that having legal
advice at the end empowers sufficiently potentially wronged patients to
make decisions during the process of interlocution with the
trust.</div><a name="06061416000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the hon.
Gentleman agree with me that were such a change to be made and the
Government to move slightly in that direction, the scheme would have a
measure of independence that would provide the credibility that the
scheme needs? Would that not obviate the need for the kind of huge
apparatus involving examining magistrates crawling the country that
Opposition Members have joined together to dream
up?</div><a name="06061416000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000488"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I shall follow convention and thank the hon.
Gentleman for his intervention.</div>
<a name="06061416000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us start with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s last point. He has totally misunderstood the concept
of NHS redress investigators, and if he would like to discuss it in
another place outside, I would be happy to do
so.</div><a name="06061416000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">On lawyers, our
point is that if we want a more open structure and to encourage a
culture change in the NHS, we need open and transparent proceedings.
That is best provided by separating the fact finding from the fault
finding because involving lawyers in the scheme to determine liability
does not make for an open, transparent and honest
investigation&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Let me
finish.</div><a name="06061416000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does not
make for an open, transparent and honest investigation into what went
wrong and what should be done to put it right. I am pleased that the
hon. Gentleman agrees that simply having lawyers at the end of the
process advising on an offer can hardly be described as guaranteeing
the independence of the process as a
whole.</div><a name="06061416000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="06061416000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000489"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I think that there is still a misunderstanding
here, which I hope to clear up. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 68</div>scheme, as envisaged, would separate fact finding from fault finding in
that, locally, it is for the NHS body to carry out the investigation
into the facts, and it is then for the scheme authority to consider
whether there is liability and, if so, what it should be. In our
scheme, there is a separation. The difference is that the hon.
Gentleman envisages a scheme in which&#151;this point was made by the
hon. Member for Southport&#151;two different authorities control the
first and second parts. It would not be a unified scheme with a link
between investigation and conclusion. That is the point that we are
dancing
around.</div><a name="06061416000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000490"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I am pleased that the Minister made that
intervention, because that is the point that I made to him earlier. The
Government&#146;s scheme is already a two-stage process. If
Conservative Members are suggesting that the redress scheme should
confine itself to the fact finding, it is difficult to argue that our
scheme would cost a lot more than the Government scheme, because the
Government&#146;s suggestion would have the NHS also trying to
determine liability, and there are many costs involved with that. If we
are saying that it should be confined to fact finding, the whole
concept of that &#163;41 million, to which I shall return, is thrown
into the melting pot. I am pleased, however, that the Minister
clarified the point about the Government&#146;s scheme being a
two-stage process.</div>
<a name="06061416000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000491"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman nowsaying that
the &#147;suitably qualified&#148; patient redress investigators
will not be lawyers? What does &#147;suitably qualified&#148; mean,
and what qualifications would such lawyers be required to have? Is he
talking only about the person at the top? If so, who will do the bulk
of the detailed work in investigating cases, who will employ them and
what qualifications will they have? We really need some clarity on
these points to understand whatis
discussed.</div>
<a name="06061416000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000492"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> We will come to some of those details later, and I
shall address them then, but it is important to remember that we are
dealing with enabling legislation. That is why there was little detail
in the Government&#146;s original proposals. Can the hon. Lady find
the extent of detail that she is asking of our proposals in the
Government&#146;s original Bill? If so, I would be interested to see
it. We are talking about principles and how best we can ensure
independence.</div> <a name="06061416000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might not be obvious to the Government, but it is obvious to us that if
one restricts the functions of the scheme as we would envisage it,
without adding, and simply confines it to fact finding, and does not
involve it in the second-stage process, it is difficult to argue that
it will cost more. The system is in place; a system of fact finding has
to be in place. The Minister has just accepted that we have to have a
fact-finding stage before we can get to the fault finding. All we are
saying is: restrict the system to fact finding. The question is who
should run it. I shall return to the point about costs in a while.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I think that I shall regret this but I will give

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000493"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Gentlemanfor giving way. He told me that I completely
misunderstood the Conservative provisions, and
suggested&#151;slightly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 69</div>unconventionally, I thought&#151;that he should explain them to me
outside. I am happy to talk to him outside any time he likes, but
sticking with the convention that we should talk about these things
inside, I must say that, having read the clause that he has written, I
think that I understand perfectly well what it means. It does not make
great sense to me but, in a spirit of constructive consensus, I take
the point that this is an enabling Bill that does not contain a lot of
legislation. It would, therefore, be reasonable for the Opposition to
table a clause that was similarly enabling and not packed with detail.
However, this clause does not sit happily and comfortably within the
framework of the rest of the Bill, and no reasonable person could claim
that it does. It does not go with the grain of the Bill, but sets up a
completely different structure that virtually negates the thrust of the
Bill. In that case, it is not unreasonable to say that I do not
understand. The hon. Gentleman should explain to us&#151;here,
inside, rather than outside&#151;how he can sincerely say that the
clause goes with the grain of the Bill and sits comfortably with what
it is trying to do. Many of us would like to see it
improved.</div>
<a name="06061416000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000494"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I shall come to a number of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s points. First, let me make just one point to him. It
is going with the grain because it is simply focusing on fact finding.
The Minister has, rightly, acknowledged that, as was said on Second
Reading, the Government&#146;s suggested Bill contains a two-stage
process: a fact-finding stage undertaken by the trust, and a
fault-finding stage undertaken by the NHSLA. All that we are saying is
that we should restrict the Bill to the fact-finding stage and then, by
having the redress investigators, guarantee independence in order to
give that fact-finding stage credibility in the eyes of patients. That
suggestion is not going against the grain of the Bill at all; if
anything, it is going with the intentions of the Bill. It is just
beefing up the independence side of things, which is terribly important
if we want the scheme to have credibility in the eyes of
patients.</div>
<a name="06061416000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue on which I take issue with the Minister is that of independence,
and the Government&#146;s claims about it. There would be an appeal
to the health ombudsman and the Healthcare Commission, but they, as the
Minister acknowledged, would be concerned with the administrative and
procedural aspects of cases, not with their substance. It is important
to understand that, because that does not itself guarantee
independence. Here we have promises about lawyers at the end of the
system advising on the offer; patients having the right to go to court;
and appeals to the health ombudsman and the Healthcare Commission.
However, if we look at them in detail they are all leaky buckets. They
do not hold water. They do not, individually or collectively, guarantee
independence. The best way to guarantee independence is to have
somebody independent sitting at the top to examine the facts.</div>
<a name="06061416000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make a
little more progress. I refer the Minister to the Constitutional
Affairs Committee report, &#147;Compensation Culture&#148;,
published on 1 March, which states, in paragraph 93:</div>
<a name="06061416000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are concerned that
if the organisation which is responsible for defending trusts and
hospitals is also charged with running the scheme, there may be a
perception (whatever the reality) of a conflict of
interest.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 70</div><a name="06061416000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">However diligent the NHSLA is,
the patient will never have absolute certainty that he or she has been
dealt with fairly, so the process will lack credibility. That is a key
point. I know that we have kicked it around a bit, but it is terribly
important. If the scheme has little or no credibility, we really are
pushing uphill in trying to change the culture of the NHS. Justice must
not only be done, it must be seen to be done. Independence is a basic
principle of natural justice, enshrined in the rule against bias that
no man may be judge in his own cause. However, that is exactly what the
Bill did in its original form. I must tell the Minister that we
consulted widely on the issue, and there was widespread concern about
the lack of independence in the Government&#146;s original proposal.
That was the view of the Law Society, the Association of Personal
Injury Lawyers, the Bar Council, AVMA and various senior practitioners
in law and medicine. The Minister himself referred to the article in
the law section of today&#146;s edition of <i class="I">The Times, </i>which
made that very point.</div>
<a name="06061416000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">As amended, the
Bill provides for a robust, independent investigation that is limited
to fact finding. As we have discussed many times, fact finding is the
first stage, which must precede any consideration of fault. The
investigation should be conducted by independent NHS redress
investigators as an inquisitorial process, and the coroner&#146;s
inquest provides a model.</div>
<a name="06061416000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, the
investigation that we envisage complies with the spirit of the
Inquiries Act 2005, which provides that inquires may be wide ranging,
although limited to fact finding, and that they may not consider legal
liability. That should not, however, prevent fault from being inferred
from the determination of fact. Those provisions are in operation up
and down the country, having undergone parliamentary scrutiny and been
passed.</div>
<a name="06061416000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me read out a
couple of sentences from the explanatory notes to the Act to help the
Committee. The explanatory notes to section 2 state:</div>
<a name="06061416000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The purpose of this
section is to make clear that inquiries under this Act have no power to
determine civil or criminal liability and must not purport to do so.
There is often a strong feeling, particularly following high profile,
controversial events, that an inquiry should determine who is to blame
for what has occurred. However, inquiries are not courts and their
findings cannot and do not have legal effect. The aim of inquiries is
to help to restore public confidence in systems or services by
investigating the facts and making recommendations to prevent
recurrence, not to establish liability or to punish
anyone.&#148;</div><a name="06061416000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Basically, we
are arguing that the Act&#146;s provisions operate up and down the
country, and the investigation process that we envisage might provide
the basis for any explanation, apology, recommendations and assessment
of civil liability.</div>
<a name="06061416000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our vision for the
redress scheme is based on principled policy and actual practice. The
separation of powers is a fundamental principle of our constitution.
The judiciary and the Executive are separated, and the separation of
functions that we envisage derives from that basic principle. In other
words, we suggest that there should be an independent, inquisitorial
fact-finding process, in which no legal rights are asserted or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 71</div>defended, and which is therefore not adversarial. That is the key point
of difference between the Minister and Opposition Members. For some
reason, the Minister claims that our scheme, in which the investigation
would be limited simply to fact finding, is more adversarial, but it is
not. We aim to separate fact finding and fault finding and to keep the
determination of liability out of the scheme. That is not
adversarial.</div>
<a name="06061416000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000495"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div>
<a name="06061416000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000496"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I hope that we are not going to rehearse the
previous arguments.</div>
<a name="06061416000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000497"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I have listened carefully to the argument that
the hon. Gentleman is developing. Can he tell us in clear terms how his
scheme could be inquisitorial but not
adversarial?</div><a name="06061416000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000498"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I have just read out how such a scheme operates
under the Inquiries Act. One can have a scheme that examines the facts
and tries to determine what may have gone wrong and what should have
happened, but without determining liability. Such a scheme is in
operation under the Inquiries Act.</div>
<a name="06061416000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000499"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that the Act deals
with grave and enormous matters of public interest, but we are dealing
with cases of redress that might involve a narrow set of issues. It is
highly spurious to draw a comparison with the Act&#151;this is an
entirely different process. I fail to see how he can argue that there
is a parallel between the individual complaint brought by an individual
citizen about an adverse incident and an inquiry into a major public
disaster or major failing such as the situation at Alder Hey or at the
Bristol Royal. It is a different matter
entirely.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000500"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> With respect, the Minister is trying to set up Aunt
Sallies. Those things are not mutually exclusive; we are talking about
the principle of finding the facts. If the Minister has trouble with
the Inquiries Act 2005, he could perhaps examine how a coroner&#146;s
court operates. He must not forget that some cases could be serious and
attract the kind of headlines to which he referred in some of his
examples.</div> <a name="06061416000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
referring to the 2005 Act because it has been enacted, undergone
parliamentary scrutiny and is in effect up and down the country. It
clearly established the principle that one can try to establish the
facts and go all the way through the process, including trying to
determine what should have happened, without going the extra step of
determining liability. Will the Minister examine that Act, because it
may help him better to understand what we are trying to suggest with
regard to the concept of limiting the redress scheme simply to fact
finding. I say that genuinely.</div>
<a name="06061416000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is no legal issue to
be investigated, it is difficult to see the need for lawyers to be
involved. We are dealing with medical facts, not with legal
liabilities. The question of independent assessment for eligibility 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div>for compensation under the scheme therefore does not arise, since such
eligibility is an internal matter for the NHS Litigation
Authority.</div> <a name="06061416000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State characterised our proposal as a two-stage
scheme&#151;the Minister has confirmed that in some of his
interventions&#151;involving two administrative bodies. That is
misconceived. The investigation that we envisage does not require
another bureaucracy; it requires the same administration, only
operating under the direction of an independent person for the purpose
of the fact-finding investigation. The key concept is the separation of
function. I politely suggest that the Minister&#146;s suggestion that
our proposed scheme involves duplication of effort is misconceived.
There are essentially two different functions: fact finding and fault
finding. We simply suggest that we separate them so that they are
performed by different
persons.</div><a name="06061416000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
19 has been tabled by the Liberal Democrats. If we accept that
splitting fact finding and fault finding is appropriate, that amendment
is not necessary because it replicates the courts system within the
redress scheme. I thought that we had agreement in the House of Lords.
I am a little disappointed that the amendment was tabled, given the
co-operation between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the
other place on the importance of separating those two different
functions. The determination of liability by an independent body
confuses the issue. If we accept that fact finding and fault finding
are separate, such an amendment is superfluous to requirements, and I
again refer hon. Members to the wording of the 2005 Act.</div>
<a name="06061416000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall briefly mention
amendment No. 8 because that is all that is required. It is consistent
with the 2005 Act. We want a purely fact-finding investigation, and the
fact-finding exercise must therefore not exclude just tort but any
legal liability.</div>
<a name="06061416000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other advantages to
the Bill as it stands. I say that in defending clauses 6 and 12. Under
our proposals, the investigation of the facts will be open; it will be
with prejudice, which means that the findings of fact will be robust
and might have evidential value outside the scheme. By contrast, the
Government propose that any offer or settlement should be without
prejudice and not considered as evidence or admission of civil
liability. That must mean that the proceedings leading up to the offer
are either without prejudice or privileged. An investigative process
can hardly be described as transparent if its findings are not open,
but that will be the consequence of the Government&#146;s proposal to
mix up fact finding with fault finding.</div>
<a name="06061416000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an offer is rejected, under
the Government&#146;s proposals the findings of the investigation
cannot be used for any compensation claim outside the redress scheme.
Separating fact finding from fault finding would make the findings of
fact by independent investigators open. Thereafter, patients would have
a range of options available to them for settling disputes in
appropriate cases. In addition, the NHSLA may offer compensation on the
basis of its own privileged assessment of its liability.</div>
<a name="06061416000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We stand a better chance of
changing the NHS and making its culture more open if proceedings are
transparent and confined to fact finding. Introducing the lawyers
complicates the issue, and we will stand less chance of
succeeding&#151;I mention them, because the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div>Government&#146;s proposed scheme would try to determine liability as
well as establish the facts. Introducing the lawyers does not make for
an open, transparent investigation for the benefit of patients and the
NHS.</div><a name="06061416000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Compensation
under the amended redress scheme is as in the original Bill. However,
our proposal would provide patients with a range of options at the end
of the fact-finding stage, should they wish to seek compensation. They
may accept an offer under our proposed redress scheme, seek to
negotiate or mediate a settlement, or enter into a scheme. The courts
are available as a last resort. Different cases may require different
approaches and
procedures.</div><a name="06061416000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000501"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman has just mentioned a further
scheme&#151;a resolve-type scheme. I am in danger of believing that
the arrangements that he is proposing would be deeply confusing to the
public. He seems to envisage people being able to go down all kinds of
avenues and for the scheme to be administered by two different bodies.
I fail to follow why the scheme would be anything other than deeply
confusing. Can he give us more detail on the further resolve-type
scheme that he has in mind?</div>
<a name="06061416000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000502"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I ask the Minister to consider the proposals more
carefully. It is simple: at the end of the fact-finding stage, the
patients would have a choice of options open to them. There is no
confusion about that. If they felt that they wanted to accept the offer
proposed under the redress scheme through the NHSLA, they would be at
liberty to do so. Alternatively, they may seek to negotiate a mediated
settlement, or enter into a resolve-type scheme. That would be up to
them. The point is that different cases might require different
approaches and procedures. Choice and flexibility should be
available.</div> <a name="06061416000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover,
the fact-finding investigation that we propose could provide the basis
for settlement and assessment of liability for any proposed claim. We
propose that a Mackenzie-type friend should be available to provide
support and guidance for any intending claimant.</div>
<a name="06061416000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill as currently drafted,
particularly clauses 6 and 12, more accurately reflects
patients&#146; priorities. As we all know, research has shown that
when something has gone wrong, patients often want only an explanation,
an apology and an assurance that lessons have been learnt for the
benefit of others. That point has been made a number of times.
Compensation does not rank very high, and the open, independent
fact-finding investigation that we propose reflects those priorities.
Patient safety is promoted by ensuring that lessons learnt are not
lost, which is terribly important. The Government&#146;s focus on
compensation does not reflect patient priorities, however, and could
subvert the purpose of the investigation. It also means that the
importance of the explanation and of any lessons learnt risks being
relegated.</div> <a name="06061416000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
spurious claims, I would argue that the original Bill would have
provided a demand-led, open-ended, cost-free and risk-free scheme for
claiming compensation. That would have proved unnecessarily 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 74</div>costly&#151;there is no downside in someone having a go under the
Government&#146;s proposals&#151;and it would have been
unnecessarily wasteful. The money would be better spent on patient
care.</div> <a name="06061416000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
the Government state in the regulatory impact assessment that</div>
<a name="06061416000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the vast majority of
opportunistic claims will be easily
rejected&#148;.</div><a name="06061416000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
will struggle to provide evidence for that. The success rates in
clinical negligence litigation are modest, and experience shows that
spurious claims are not easily rejected. Indeed, claims without merit
may be compensated because it can be cheaper to settle a claim than
contest it.</div> <a name="06061416000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise,
the Government&#146;s original redress scheme, under which the
claimant would have been entitled to free legal assistance to help him
pursue his claim against the NHS, provided every incentive for people
to pursue opportunistic cases. I mentioned to the Minister on Second
Reading that the Government are concerned about the matter; he will no
doubt be aware that last year another Minister talked of introducing
conditional fee arrangements as a way of ensuring that only claims with
merit were taken forward. However, that idea was shelved.</div>
<a name="06061416000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government say that their
costings suggestthat our scheme would cost the taxpayer a
maximum of &#163;41 million more than if the Bill was left in its
original form. That figure is totally spurious. There are all sorts of
holes in that claim. For example, their estimate of additional cases
has a ten-fold range from 2,200 to 19,000. I would argue that the cost
is not additional but inevitable, as there would have to be an
investigation, whether by the NHSLA or by independent investigators.
Indeed, it could be argued that our scheme, as presently envisaged,
could result in cost savings. For example, there would be no need to
pay a lawyer to oversee and give advice on an offer. It would not be
required under our scheme.</div>
<a name="06061416000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to the point that if
we simplify the scheme and confine it to fact finding, and not have
that additional stage and the expense of determining liability, it
would be difficult for the Government to argue that our scheme would
somehow be more expensive than what they originally
proposed.</div>
<a name="06061416000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000503"></a><b class="B">Ms
Diana R. Johnson</b> (Kingston upon Hull, North) (Lab): On
Second Reading, I asked the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, the
shadow Secretary of State for Health, the same question as that raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber). I asked
what qualifications would be needed by those who held the title of
patient redress investigators, and whether they would be clinicians or
lawyers. If I recall it correctly, he said that he thought that they
might be lawyers, but might be clinicians. We have heard a lot this
afternoon about lawyers being expensive; if we are going to have
clinicians and lawyers, the costs of the redress system envisaged by
the hon. Gentleman will increase automatically, and might reach the
figure given by my hon. Friend the
Minister.</div>
<a name="06061416000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000504"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> There is every likelihood that medically qualified
individuals will sit as NHS redress 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 75</div>investigators. Indeed, that point was made on Second Reading. The bottom
line is that we are pushing hard on the concept of redress
investigators because we think it the best way of ensuring
independence. I have tried to make the point to the Minister that the
other guarantees of independence proposed by the
Government&#151;whether a lawyer advises on the offer at the end of
the scheme or it is done on the take-it-or-leave it basis envisaged
under the NHSLA scheme, or if a referral or appeal is made to the
ombudsman or the Healthcare Commission&#151;do not, even in their
entirety, guarantee independence. The best way to do that is to have
someone independent of the trust determining the facts of the
case.</div> <a name="06061416000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
makes an interesting point because we must not forget that the NHS has
always had the power to settle claims without resorting to litigation.
To characterise the redress scheme as providing a sort of novel,
genuine alternative to litigation is misleading because the alternative
has existed, and will continue to do so, regardless of the redress
scheme. Patients are entitled to treatment by the health service if it
is clinically indicated. Remedial treatment is thus a matter of
entitlement, and it is difficult to see why that should form part of
any redress package; it is there by right and should not form part of a
redress package. There is nothing novel about the Government&#146;s
proposals.</div><a name="06061416000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="06061416000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
oppose parts of the Bill dealing with those items, but it is only right
that we place on the record our recognition that they are fallacies.
Indeed, ideally we would have removed compensation from the Bill
entirely because that will be dealt with outside the scope of the Bill
by established
mechanisms.</div><a name="06061416000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
return to the issue of cost and address some fallacies. We must not
forget that the cost of the scheme itself and of the investigation is
fixed and inevitable. Our investigation would be limited to fact
finding, whereas the Government&#146;s figure includes the assessment
of legal liability, which would be an additional cost.</div>
<a name="06061416000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, we believe that
our proposals, and the Bill as currently constituted, put patients, not
the health service, at the centre of the redress scheme. By confining
the investigation of a case to fact finding by an independent process
and by separating fault finding, we largely avoid the problems of the
Government&#146;s original Bill. Patients&#146; interests are
safeguarded by independence, and there would be a greater chance that
patients would have confidence in the
system.</div><a name="06061416000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposals
reflect patient expectations and priorities, and comply with the
principles of natural justice. They are prudent, yet fair. They will
simplify an over-complicated and over-ambitious Bill. We believe that
they will allow patients access to a fairer, and perhaps better
result.</div> <a name="06061416000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said on
Second Reading, no scheme will be perfect when dealing with such a
complex subject, but we believe that our proposals are a substantial
improvement on the original Bill presented to the House of Lords last
October. It goes without saying therefore that we will oppose
Government amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 5 and amendment No. 19, and I ask
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div>Committee to consider supporting our amendmentNo. 8. Otherwise,
we ask the Committee to leave the Bill
alone.</div>
<a name="06061416000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000505"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I start by apologising for not having previously
declared to the Committee my interest as a trustee of Action Against
Medical Accidents&#151;AVMA&#151;the country&#146;s leading
patient safety charity. The Minister mentioned it at the top of his
opening remarks, which perhaps put me off, and I did declare it on
Second Reading. I hope that no one has been under any illusions about
why I said some of the things that I said. Once again, I
apologise.</div><a name="06061416000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The line
that has come into my head most often in the past hour or so is one
from Aeschylus that I read recently: &#147;The Gods so hard to
wrestle down obliterate us all&#148;. That is not particularly
related to patient safety, but it is how I feel as we approach the
sixth hour of the debate. With that in mind, I shall try not to detain
the Committee too
long.</div><a name="06061416000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad that
we have had a lot of time to debate such important issues. We have said
often, although it was said more often on Second Reading&#151;the
Minister repeated it several times&#151;that all of us as Members of
Parliament get letters about patient redress through our doors all the
time. It is important stuff and has an impact on more than 100,000
people a year.</div><a name="06061416000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
had a generally constructive and fairly consensual debate about the
Bill, today and on Second Reading, but clause 12 and the debate on it
stand outside that consensus and spirit of constructive co-operation.
The clause is not a serious effort to improve the Bill, and the fact
that it springs from an unholy alliance of the Tories and the Liberals
in the House of Lords bespeaks politically motivated efforts to make a
point for political consumption, rather than constructive efforts to
improve things. I do not decry Opposition Members&#146; wish to make
such points, because that is their job, and all credit to those in the
other place for doing it so successfully. Nevertheless, we should call
a spade a spade and be clear what we are dealing with. The Bill is
important, and there is a lot of agreement about taking constructive
measures to improve it. It can be improved, of course, but clause 12 is
not a serious attempt to do so. It goes completely against the grain of
what the Bill tries to do and does not sit comfortably within its
provisions. However, I do not propose to say more about it than
that.</div><a name="06061416000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to talk
about amendment No. 19, on which we have a serious problem of
understanding and nomenclature. It was tabled by the hon. Members for
Romsey and for Southport, and I obviously cannot speak for them.
However, many outside organisations, including AVMA, the patient safety
charity, of which I am a trustee, would have tabled a similar
amendment. What they would have meant by it, and the way in which I
choose to read amendment No. 19, is completely different from the
interpretation of the Government and the official Opposition. The
amendment talks about the independent assessment of eligibility, and
the Government take that to mean some sort of additional apparatus or
extraneous add-on to the mechanisms envisaged in the Bill.
Understandably, that is also how the hon. Member for Billericay read
it, but that is not how I read it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div><a name="06061416000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should have liked the
amendment to be read as providing some guarantee that somewhere in the
process, under certain circumstances, there would be some element of
independent assessment of eligibility for redress. The kind of things
that I want to see are those that the Government introduced in their
amendments in the House of Lords, which provided for what we generally
call joint instruction. The amendment refers to independent assessment,
and I would like to make a recommendation to the Government. Under the
Bill, there is already a stage at which the redress procedure as
envisioned has been gone through, albeit unsuccessfully, and the
Government allow for the joint instruction of independent medical
experts by the claimant and the trust. At that quite late stage in the
process, I would like to see strengthened in the Bill the possibility,
already envisaged, of the patient having a right to require some kind
of joint instruction arrangement. That would be a safety net, should
the procedures in the mainstream, which the Minister talked about in
reasonable detail, fail. That is within the spirit of what the
Government have stated as their intention. The emphasis is still on the
NHS trying to recognise its own errors and to provide redress where
appropriate. The safety net is needed only where there is disagreement
between the patient and the NHS about
eligibility.</div><a name="06061416000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have previously resisted amendments on the issue because
they were frightened of them being too prescriptive and detailed. They
did not want that level of detail in the Bill. That is why, as I
conceived it, the amendment was relatively open but it seems to me that
it has ended up being drafted in too open a way and has been
misinterpreted as a call for an entirely separate apparatus, which I do
not think it is.</div> <a name="06061416000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not expect the Minister to accept the amendment or to change the
Government&#146;s position but I wanted to explain that that is how I
would choose to read it. The independence that we need is not based on
entirely new apparatus but is, as the hon. Member for Billericay said,
more along the lines of the resolve pilot. That was a Government pilot.
It was positively evaluated. The speedy resolution pilot now ongoing in
Wales is, by all accounts, being positively evaluated. Part of the
positive evaluation includes a considerable saving to everyone
concerned. I think that the saving is, on average, &#163;7,000 a
case.</div> <a name="06061416000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
the resolve pilot is that, conceptually and initially, it comes from
within the Department. It sits entirely within the spirit of what the
Government are trying to do in the rest of the Bill. Indeed, the Bill
allows for such arrangements. What I am asking for in amendment No.
19&#151;I will meet the Minister tomorrow to talk about
this&#151;is for the Government to reflect on the issue and come back
on Report with a strengthened version of what is in the Bill to
introduce some independence in a way that gives more of a right for an
appellant at a late stage in proceedings than is the case
now.</div> <a name="06061416000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate that
the Bill is a good one. It has an opportunity to do a lot. Many of us
who take an interest in such matters are reasonably relaxed about the
Government&#146;s desire not to have an over-prescriptive Bill or to
drown the NHS in bureaucracy. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 78</div>As constituency MPs, we all see how easily bureaucratic masses can weigh
us down. If we could have a little&#151;I genuinely mean a
little&#151;more prescription in the Bill, it would do an awful lot
to reassure external organisations; there is a big coalition of
patient, medical and legal organisations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000506"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I can help the hon. Gentleman out. He says that he
does not want to be too prescriptive and add to the administration, but
resolve-type schemes can exist outside the scheme as envisaged if the
Bill and the redress scheme is restricted to fact finding. Resolve-type
schemes can exist outside that. They have done so in the past and, no
doubt, they will do so in the future. We do not have to bring the
resolve-type scheme within the redress
scheme.</div>
<a name="06061416000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000507"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> My point is that the Bill allows for resolve-type
schemes but does not create a situation in which a resolve-type scheme
is a legal right for a claimant who has not received the redress that
they want through the scheme as envisaged in the rest of the Bill. The
hon. Gentleman has had frequent interchanges with the Minister on
whether final recourse to legal proceedings is a satisfactory answer. I
say that it is not.</div>
<a name="06061416000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">To bridge the gap between final
recourse to legal proceedings and the mechanisms as they stand, there
should be a legal right in the Bill, for claimants who have not managed
to resolve their claims through the mainstream processes, to some kind
of what I have been calling independent schemes, but which we are now
calling resolve-type schemes. I believe that such schemes are generally
called joint instruction. It would be better to have such a right in
the Bill than to leave it to regulation. I am relaxed about the
Government covering most matters in secondary legislation, but having a
little more in the Bill, particularly on this issue, would go an
awfully long way toward reassuring many organisations outside the House
that take a strong interest in this on behalf of a lot of sadly injured
people.</div><a name="06061416000377"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="06061416000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061416000508"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): We have probably done to death the
arguments about which scheme is better. I simply want to reiterate that
there is a substantial point of difference between both sides. The
Opposition believe that it is important that there is a greater element
of independence in the process. I know that the Minister did not like
the phrase &#147;judge and jury&#148;, but the public&#146;s
perception will be of an in-house cover up. As we have had such a long
debate with many interventions on the Minister, in which points were
put very carefully by the Conservative spokesman, I do not propose to
go over those points yet again for the sake of stating them on the
record.</div> <a name="06061416000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall speak
briefly to Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 19 and
20.</div>
<a name="06061416000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000509"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I remind the hon. Lady that we will
debate amendment No. 20 next, so she should speak only to amendment No.
19.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 79</div><a name="06061416000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000510"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> Thank you for clarifying that,Miss Begg.
That means that my remarks will be even shorter. The hon. Member for
Billericay is right to say that there is no need for an amendment to
this part of the Bill because we are happy with it, but I took the
rather pragmatic approach that the Government would try to delete
clause 12. I thought that it might be useful to table a probing
amendment to allow a debate on the issues raised by the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington.</div>
<a name="06061416000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would provide a
guarantee that in specified circumstances there would be an independent
assessment of eligibility for redress. In the other place, the
Government introduced an amendment making it possible that independent
medical experts might be jointly instructed to report on cases. The
word &#147;might&#148; is important. It is also possible that
patients will be provided with legal advice or representation. Although
that is a welcome move, there is no assurance that that will be a
right, in any circumstance, and that is a problem. Neither is there any
guarantee that the findings in a medical expert&#146;s report will be
a determining factor in establishing eligibility. That differs
substantially from what happens in the resolve pilots, or the speedy
resolution pilots in Wales. The point that intrigued me was that those
schemes seem to be widely regarded as having been successful, so I was
interested in the Government&#146;s thinking behind their apparent
different approach to this Bill. Some clarification on that would be
very useful.</div> <a name="06061416000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has
been pointed out by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington, the
amendment would provide a safety net for those cases that are not
proactively settled by the NHS. That safety net will be needed only
where there is disagreement between the NHS and the patient over
eligibility.</div> <a name="06061416000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has suggested that there is no problem because such matters
can be dealt with easily by the NHSLA, but it is worth bearing it in
mind that the authority&#146;s current job is to defend the NHS
against clinical negligence claims, and it is effective in that. It is
difficult to see how it can suddenly and effectively take on a new
role, change tack and be on the side of the patient, too. How can the
NHSLA perform that role with impartiality? That goes to the heart of
the debate that we have had throughout this sitting about justice being
done and being seen to be done. I hesitate to use the point about
&#147;judge and jury&#148; yet again, but the NHSLA is not used to
such work and will probably have to expand in some way, with extra
costs. Have those been factored in? That point needs to be addressed by
the Minister.</div>
<a name="06061416000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000511"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I shall try to keep my contribution fairly short,
and to be better at honouring that promise than some other spokesmen
have been today.</div> <a name="06061416000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has become increasingly clear as the debate goes on that the
Government&#146;s proposal will create a system in its own little
cul-de-sac. The initial fact-finding is to be shared with wronged
patients on a without-prejudice basis, so it cannot go forward. The
Minister is right to suggest that the Opposition&#146;s inclusion of
Liberal Democrat proposals splits the scheme, but that ensures a
thorough, independent investigation of the facts that will give public
confidence. With respect to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div>others on the Labour Benches, that is why so many organisations outside
this place have emphasised the need for independence. I shall quote the
Law Society again. Its parliamentary brief states:</div>
<a name="06061416000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Society...considers that both the reality and perception of
independence and impartiality throughout any procedures under the
scheme are paramount to its
success.&#148;</div><a name="06061416000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Erdington, the Minister might want to dismiss
the Opposition&#146;s opportunism or other low motives, a dismissal
which is completely unwarranted, but as he struggles to take the
message from the Opposition, the message from the Law Society is that
the reality and perception of independence and impartiality are
paramount to the success of the scheme.</div>
<a name="06061416000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000512"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06061416000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000513"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I hope that the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington will recant his earlier hostilities and come over to a more
balanced view of the
situation.</div><a name="06061416000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000514"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I reiterate that I do not blame the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party for a shameless piece of politics, but it is
important to point out that it is a piece of politics rather than any
attempt seriously to improve the legislation. Does he admit that,
although the Law Society is an important partner in this debate, it is
not necessarily the ideal sole arbiter of exactly the best way to do
these things? It is the only outside organisation that I have heard
quoted from Opposition Benches, but I could recommend factoring in the
views of a whole string of patient-based, patient safety
charities.</div><a name="06061416000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000515"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention,
particularly as it allows me to deal with one of the many canards that
have been thrown up by Government Members. The Opposition have
mentioned all sorts of groups. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that
AVMA, of which he is a trustee, has stated the need to have an
independent means of deciding the merits of a case, as have Which?,
Witness, Alert, MRSA Support, Patient Concern and several other
organisations.</div><a name="06061416000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000516"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that
point?</div><a name="06061416000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000517"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> No, I shall not give way. I shall answer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. We have already mentioned the Bar Council and
Rethink, and there are many other organisations. The last thing I would
suggest is that the Law Society should be taken as the sole arbiter,
but that august organisation has commented on the reality and
perception of independence. Despite the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
twisting efforts to maintain loyalty to a
Government&#151;</div><a name="06061416000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000518"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000519"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> No, I will not give way. The Government say that
independence is paramount to the scheme&#146;s success. Where the
Minister is right is in saying that the Conservative proposals would
split the scheme so that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 81</div>the cost of investigations, which do come with a cost&#151;the
Minister has gone on a great deal about cost&#151;is not flushed away
in the event that the redress scheme or any offers made by the NHS are
not acceptable to the patient. I ask Government Members to remember
that the patients have been wronged by the system, and that the
investigation and effort are thrown away because the information cannot
be used. Yes, we would split the system so that when the facts have
been objectively found&#151;not with blame apportioned as part of the
process, but purely as a fact-finding exercise&#151;the information
can be used for whatever other means of redress the patient and their
advisers seek.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000521"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000522"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I shall try to keep my remarks brief, as I am sure
that we can all join together in a consensual drive to wind up our
proceedings.</div><a name="06061416000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s planned scheme would be a small, discrete
item&#151;effectively a cul-de-sac&#151;which means that a lot of
the work done could not be used for other systems, be it resolve
schemes or other programmes to allow patients to find proper
redress.</div><a name="06061416000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000523"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06061416000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000524"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I will take no interventions, in order to keep my
promise to colleagues across the
Committee.</div><a name="06061416000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point is about how the culture of secrecy and defensiveness in the NHS
is to be changed. The hon. Member for Crawley spoke with fluency and
passion on that subject on Second Reading and has done so again
today&#151;perhaps that comes from knowing something about it.
However, I could not make the connection between the ends that she
fluently described as important and necessary and the
Government&#146;s system or see how it would help to secure
them.</div> <a name="06061416000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see a
system that will have the levers or triggers to change the NHS. As we
have said, there are already provisions under which the NHS can assess
whether it has been at fault. The NHS can come forward to patients to
apologise and offer compensation, while in no way stopping them from
going to law or finding another route to resolve the issue. That is the
nub of the matter. It would be a great shame if this opportunity to
provide a better system of redress for patients was missed because the
Government hoped that the Bill would magically change the culture of
the NHS.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 82</div><a name="06061416000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief benefit of the system
that we can hopeto achieve with the Bill will probably not be
a fundamental culture change in those organisations that are a bit
defensive and slow to apologise to patients; it will be an alternative
route to justice. That route will have to be based on the independent
verification of facts and speedy progress, with minimal involvement of
lawyers, to give people justice, restitution and an apology for the
harm that they have suffered. As I said on Second Reading, I fear that
the Government, by insisting on sticking with their initial proposal,
may end up with a damp squib that neither changes the culture nor in
reality provides for the proper investigation of facts that will allow
patients to obtain the fairness and justice that I know that every
Member wishes to
see.</div><a name="06061416000380"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000525"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Although we have had our disagreements, this has
been a good debate. In many ways, the fact that we have had a turbulent
debate might illustrate that there is a fundamental difference of
opinion about how the scheme should be constructed. But we agree that
something of the kind is necessary and that the NHS should get better
at opening up and dealing with its own complaints quickly and at
absorbing those lessons. Both those things are good.</div>
<a name="06061416000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">To some extent, we have gone
round the houses, and rightly so because these are important matters.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington rightly said,
people who take a close interest will want to see that we covered these
matters in detail. Our having put our positions on the record, other
people will be able to make their own judgments.</div>
<a name="06061416000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer all Committee members
back to the policy intention behind the Bill: to provide a coherent
redress scheme focused on speedy resolution of cases after full
investigation by scheme members at local level, which also provides
full redress for patients through a single-stage scheme and local
learning from mistakes. Those were our policy goals in introducing the
Bill. I heard the arguments made by hon. Members but remain
convinced&#151;I might even be more convinced&#151;that the scheme
we propose is the right way to achieve those aims.</div>
<a name="06061416000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not pick up on every
point made, because we have covered many points in detail. In talking
about the costs, the hon. Member for Billericay said that the
Opposition&#146;s proposal would be cheaper because people would have
no right to a lawyer; in other words, by definition it was a scheme
that had a more narrow focus. I thought that I heard him say
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000526"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> My essential point was that in large part we are
keeping the lawyers out, because of the simple fact that we are not
trying to determine liability as well as establish the facts. In the
Government&#146;s scheme, the lawyers would be far more involved,
which would account for some of the additional costs that I think it
would incur. We would not try to determine liability, so we would
largely keep lawyers out of this system.</div>
<a name="06061416000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000527"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> That makes the point that I was just discussing.
The hon. Gentleman claims that lawyers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 83</div>would largely be kept out of the system. Let us accept that he is
genuine in having said all afternoon that we need a scheme based around
patients and protecting their interests. Given that, in our view it is
right that legal advice should be available to protect the interests of
individuals at the point at which they accept redress or
not.</div><a name="06061416000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is crucial
that the Opposition understand that the scheme is meant to be part of a
coherent whole. The hon. Gentleman seems to have in mind a situation
where elements can be packaged off and separated from each other. We
clearly have a difference of view about how this thing should be
organised. I remain convinced that our proposals are the right
ones.</div><a name="06061416000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall pick up
on the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Erdington. He was right to focus on amendment No. 19, because perhaps,
in all the argy-bargy on clause 12, we did not do it justice. I
carefully examined the wording of the amendment as he was making his
appeal that we needed to look more sympathetically at it. As I
understand it&#151;the hon. Member for Romsey may want to come back
on this point&#151;it would allow independent assessment of whether a
case was eligible. It says that that judgment should be independent,
rather than being taken by the NHS Litigation Authority. I have said
that we intend that legal advice will be available on the offer and, in
other circumstances, could be provided at an earlier stage. Clause
8(1)(a) allows legal advice to be provided at any point, and we intend
to consult on when it would be appropriate, earlier in the process, to
make such advice
available.</div><a name="06061416000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8(1)(b) allows for the involvement of jointly instructed independent
medical experts. That picks up on my hon. Friend&#146;s point. Again,
we will consult on when such experts will be engaged. There is room for
discussion with my hon. Friend about how and when the provisions in the
Bill will be used by the scheme in practice. I will be ready to carry
on that discussion with him and the organisation that he represents so
well. That offer exists and is genuine. In saying that, I have to say
that we envisage that the reports that the experts produce will be
intended to help the NHS Litigation Authority to reach a view on
liability. That work will inform its deliberations on the final
outcome.</div><a name="06061416000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
amendment No. 19 envisages something different: an independent expert
or an independently appointed individual making the judgment on whether
or not liability arises. That would be a different scheme. This is the
NHS redress scheme. We seem to be struggling to get that point over. It
is a scheme of the NHS itself. It is seeking to offer a way of doing
things that is better than what it does at
present.</div><a name="06061416000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that Opposition Members have missed is that, in any redress procedure
against any organisation, public or private sector, the normal process
is that a person takes their complaint first to the organisation that
they believe mishandled their care or the other service provided to
them. That is the normal process that someone goes through before going
on to a second-stage process involving more independence. The point
about this scheme is that, in the first-stage process, when someone
goes to the national health service with a grievance or complaint, they
are asking it to do a comprehensive job of investigating the complaint,
explaining what happened, apologising for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 84</div>it and making financial reparation if need be. We are talking about a
much better job being done at that first stage of the process than is
done at present. That is the crux of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="06061416000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000528"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> Perhaps the amendment was not as clearly drafted
as it might have been. I had envisaged it as a stop-gap or safety net
so that if there were a dispute as to whether a case would be taken
forward, there would be provision for an independent opinion. That
would apply not in every case but in specified cases in which perhaps
there was a lack of
clarity.</div><a name="06061416000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000529"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> That is a reasonable point. The answer is that
this is an in-house scheme, in effect, and that decision will be made
by the Litigation Authority, but the decision can be informed by
independent advice or evidence that is jointly commissioned by the
complainant and the NHS. That scheme is slightly different from what we
have at present, but it is still an NHS scheme. It does not sign away
the ability of any patient to go on to pursue their rights through
other means, so it is wrong to use the phrase &#147;judge and
jury&#148;, because in that case those rights would have been ruled
upon and then disposed of and that is not what the scheme does. An
offer is made based on assumptions about whether a liability has
arisen. The phrase &#147;judge and jury&#148; does not apply. We
are talking simply about an ability to provide redress before the legal
system has to be
invoked.</div><a name="06061416000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal
with a couple of points quickly, because I know that the Committee
would like to make progress. On the without prejudice question, only
the offer may be without prejudice. The patient can take the
explanation or investigation report and use it in court should legal
proceedings follow an unsuccessful attempt to use the NHS redress
scheme. We intend to consult on whether investigation reports will be
disclosed, but I stress that the use of that material is not ruled out
by the scheme, and I do not think that anybody would want that to be
the case.</div> <a name="06061416000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Beverley and Holderness raised a number of times the
position of the Law Society. That is important; we should have its view
on record. In its written evidence to the Constitutional Affairs
Committee, it said clearly that it supported the proposed
scheme,</div> <a name="06061416000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;providing there
is sufficient access to free legal advice for victims&#148;</div>
<a name="06061416000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that the right to go to court was not
compromised. While the Bill is light on the detail of the scheme, it
said, those requirements appeared to have been met, subject to
clarification of some areas as the Bill passes through its later
stages.</div><a name="06061416000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000530"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I believe that, in its submission for today, the
Law Society supported clause 12. Is that the Minister&#146;s
understanding?</div>
<a name="06061416000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000531"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I have provided an accurate quote from the
evidence provided by the Law Society. It mentions two tests: free legal
advice and the right to court not being compromised. It was right to
set those tests, and I challenge any Opposition member to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 85</div>suggest that anything in the Bill does not meet either of them. It is
important to have that view on the record.</div>
<a name="06061416000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make some quick points
in closing. In response to the hon. Member for Billericay, I would
argue that the patient is not materially disadvantaged by taking a
claim forward under the scheme and then finding that the scheme has not
been able to deliver redress. Yes, there is a time delay in that
process, but all the patient&#146;s rights to take a claim beyond the
NHS redress scheme remain. Most patients would find that before they
took action under the current system they would spend time in
correspondence, negotiation and discussion with the trust. The
individual is not materially disadvantaged by the scheme as it is
envisaged.</div>
<a name="06061416000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000532"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I have asked this question once, but the Minister
moved on. Perhaps he can give us an answer now. I take on board his
point that patients still have the right to go to court if they are not
happy. However, as I said before, given that the point behind the
redress scheme is to provide an alternative to going to court, does he
not think that it would be absurd if the key to the success of the
alternative were a right to appeal to the original? That does not make
sense, yet the Minister seems to be using the right to carry on as an
alternative to going to court as somehow justifying his view that the
redress scheme will be happily in
operation.</div>
<a name="06061416000381"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
pm</div><a name="06061416000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000533"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Perhaps, again, this is where we have a
fundamental disagreement, or do not understand each other. We would
argue that it is the right to go to court that puts pressure on the NHS
redress scheme to be a success. The fact that that right is not
compromised, the process can continue and a case can go to court
ensures that there is not&#151;as Opposition Members have been
claiming all afternoon&#151;an incentive in the system not to
investigate independently or fairly and not to provide fair redress at
the end of the process. Because that end stage is still there and can
be invoked by the individual, it creates the necessary pressure earlier
on for the NHS redress scheme to be a
success.</div><a name="06061416000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000534"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> If that is the case, does the Minister accept that
the scheme being envisaged by the Government will create an atmosphere
in which there will be no down side for anybody deciding to have a go?
It will be cost-free and the costs will be covered if the decision goes
against the patient. Where is the discipline in the scheme? It will be
a risk-free attempt to have a go, at the expense of the
NHS.</div><a name="06061416000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000535"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I agreed with the hon. Gentleman earlier that
most people do not want to have a go at the NHS and that most do not
want to make an opportunistic claim to take it to the cleaners. That is
not what motivates most people. If people do make opportunistic claims,
they will be stopped at an early stage, so I do not accept that that is
a problem with the scheme. The scheme that he envisages would
make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 86</div>that more of a problem, because if a frivolousor opportunistic
claim had to be independently investigated by a patient redress
investigator, that might create more cost. Under the scheme that we
propose, if claims clearly do not have a basis in law and there is no
liability, they will be safely preventable. If the individual concerned
wishes to pursue legal action they will be able to do so. I do not
believe that that is a weakness in the scheme. Only genuine claims will
be compensated and get to the final stage when legal advice will be
provided.</div> <a name="06061416000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to my
hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington and the hon. Member
for Romsey that we may not have paid sufficient attention to the role
that the Independent Complaints Advocacy Service can play throughout
the process and currently plays in supporting patients as they navigate
the complex world of the NHS complaints system and the litigation
process. ICAS is a patient-centred service, delivering support ranging
from information on self-help to the assignment of an advocate to
assist individuals with letter-writing, form-filling and attendance at
meetings. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that the services
provided by ICAS are much valued and appreciated by patients. The
Department had some research on ICAS done by MORI, and one example
uncovered was that of an individual who
said:</div><a name="06061416000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
offered good advice. I felt I had someone on my
side.&#148;</div><a name="06061416000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">ICAS services will
work alongside the redress scheme to help people work their way through
it and to provide some of the independence that my hon. Friend the
Member for Birmingham, Erdington and the hon. Member for Romsey
want.</div><a name="06061416000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to
prolong our discussions, but I shall finish on a partisan note. My hon.
Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) put some pertinent
questions to the hon. Member for Billericay about how many patient
redress investigators there would be, who would employ them and what
they would do. We did not get answers to those questions. It is
impossible for the Government even to consider accepting such a scheme
when there is no detail to support it. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i><i class="I"> </i>I
say to the hon. Member for Eddisbury, whom I hear chuntering away, that
in the absence of such detail, the Department must make its own
calculations of the cost implications of the proposal that the
Opposition are putting
forward.</div><a name="06061416000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000536"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Publish
them.</div><a name="06061416000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000537"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I am happy to do
so.</div><a name="06061416000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be deeply
irresponsible for the Department of Health to accept a scheme without
seeking to determine and bottom out its costs. I have given the hon.
Gentleman the range within which we anticipate that the cost would
fall&#151;&#163;14 million to &#163;41 million. Unless he
provides further detail, we cannot do any more. That is why we seek to
amend the Bill. I say to the hon. Member for Romsey that I appreciate
the intent behind amendment No. 19, which is motivated by a genuine
point. But again, it is an NHS scheme and it would not be right for
ultimate adjudication to rest in independent hands; it should rest with
the NHS.</div>

<a name="06061416000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000538"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in clause 6, page
4, line 26, at end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;( )
a scheme must provide that any waiver to bring civil proceedings does
not apply if the injury or loss to which the settlement relates has
increased beyond the extent which was foreseen by the scheme at the
time of the settlement
agreement.'.</div><a name="06061416000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not detain the Committee too long. Amendment No. 20 tries to
probe situations in which a patient&#146;s condition might
deteriorate significantly after the point at which a settlement is
agreed.</div> <a name="06061416000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
factors that makes medicine so fascinating is that there really is no
such thing as a textbook case; frequently there are unusual, sometimes
unforeseen, complications. But if those arise after a settlement, the
waiver of a right to bring civil proceedings could prevent the injured
patient from seeking and receiving compensation for whatever extra loss
has been accrued. If the patient had chosen the court route, he or she
would have been able to take proceedings to compensate for that
additional loss, but under the current scheme, a patient could lose
out. The reason for the amendment was to establish what would be open
to a patient under those unfortunate, and probably rare,
circumstances.</div><a name="06061416000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000539"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Amendment No. 20 would enable civil proceedings
to be commenced when the severity of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 88</div>injury had increased in a manner not foreseen at the time of the
settlement&#151;under the redress scheme, as the hon. Lady
said&#151;even though a waiver of the right to bring such proceedings
had been signed as part of the settlement.</div>
<a name="06061416000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is undesirable
and unnecessary. It is intended that where an offer under the scheme is
accepted, a settlement agreement will set out the detail of the offer
of redress. Before a person enters into such a settlement agreement,
they will have been entitled to free and independent legal advice,
which will advise them on whether the offer is reasonable and
equivalent to what they would have received through the
courts.</div> <a name="06061416000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8(2)(b) requires the scheme to make provision for free legal advice in
relation not only to the offer but to the settlement
agreement.</div>
<a name="06061416000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000540"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point, but the
nub of the argument is that at that stage of proceedings, the patient
does not know that anything is going to happen to them. At that point,
in all honesty and probably feeling that the deal is reasonable, the
patient will be happy to sign. However, if six months or a year down
the line they develop complications, they will probably regret that
decision. It would be unusual if that were to happen, but it is
possible.</div>
<a name="06061416000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000541"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s point, but
following a discussion in another place, it was agreed that it would be
appropriate to insert in the clause paragraph (b) to provide
reassurance to people that the scheme would not require those harmed
during NHS care to waive their rights, unless they are fully aware of
the consequences and they consent to that waiver.</div>
<a name="06061416000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I develop my thoughts? I
may provide some reassurance to the hon. Lady or I may not. If people
are advised that there is uncertainty over their prognosis, and that
the offer of settlement may not take adequate account of that, it will
be open to them to reject the offer of settlement under the scheme and
seek redress through the courts, as we have said throughout proceedings
today. That is the type of case in which it might be appropriate for
the scheme to appoint a jointly agreed expert through the powers in
clause 8(1)(b). The paragraph says that provision can be made in
connection with proceedings under the scheme,</div>
<a name="06061416000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including the services of medical
experts.&#148;</div> <a name="06061416000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that respect, an applicant under the scheme will be in a similar
position to a person who is made an offer of settlement after the
commencement of court proceedings. Those are the facts. That person
will have to weigh up all the factors on the basis of appropriate
advice, and decide whether they wish to accept the offer. Claimants in
civil proceedings do not generally get a second bite at the cherry.
Settlements are usually a full and final settlement of any claim that
they bring.</div>
<a name="06061416000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000542"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> We have had a few differences this afternoon, but I
rise to support the Minister&#146;s case. Does he agree that the
whole point of a legal process is to aim to give certainty at a given
point in time? Certainty means closure and finality. If the amendment
were accepted, one might ask, for example, whether after an award was
made and the condition got better, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 89</div>one would have to repay the settlement. The amendment would create too
many uncertainties, and at the end of the day, we want certainty and we
want a robust scheme. As such, I am afraid that the amendment does not
provide that.</div>
<a name="06061416000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061416000543"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because I
agree that the amendment would not provide that certainty. Although I
sympathise in some ways with the hon. Lady&#146;s point, and we would
all sympathise with people who were left in that position, because it
would be a difficult position to be in, the hon. Gentleman is right. At
the end of the day, there must be a resolution. When that moment
arrives, individuals must take advice and make their decision. Why
should acceptance of offers under the scheme be any different from what
takes place under civil proceedings, especially since rejection of an
offer will not affect their right to take civil proceedings? That is
how it differs from the court process, as the hon. Member for Romsey
was saying. Under civil proceedings, it really would be the shutter
coming down&#151;the end of the line. In this case, if someone
decides not to accept an offer because of concerns raised by
independent medical advice, they have the option to take matters
forward to seek further redress through the legal
system.</div>
<a name="06061416000382"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.30
pm</div><a name="06061416000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the hon. Lady&#146;s point. I do not want to sound harsh or
unsympathetic to people in the position that she describes, but at the
end of the day, as the hon. Member for Billericay says, there has to be
a resolution, and people should be enabled to make that judgment with
access to the best advice that the scheme can provide. The redress
scheme will provide speedy resolutions for clinical negligence cases of
a lower monetary value. Those involved in more complicated cases
involving serious injuries, or where there is a chance that as a result
a person may develop a serious deterioration in their condition, will
obviously be outside the scope of the
scheme.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div><a name="06061416000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cases that the hon. Lady
describes are more likely to be of that sort than those the scheme is
intended to deal with, and in such circumstances, people would rightly
want to go to court in order to examine fully all the future costs that
they may face, for example for continuing care, and have those fully
quantified through the legal process. I hope that I have answered her
points in part. On this occasion, the hon. Member for Billericay and I
agree: I do not believe it would be sensible to create a situation in
