On resuming -- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I believe that it is worth continuing the debate on the amendments because we are considering important issues. I shall give the Minister a cheer and a half before reverting to criticising the provisions. The first cheer is for his response to our comments on resettlement. He said that settlement after the determination of an application would be a material factor in deciding where to place people. I appreciate such assurances, which will be helpful in determining where people will eventually be housed. 
<P>
The half a cheer is for the Minister's response to questions about overcrowding. He said that he would take overcrowding into account and that overcrowding and sharing were different. Section 325 of the Housing Act 1985 defines overcrowding. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is overcrowding whenever there are so many people in a house that any two or more of those persons, being 10 or more years old, and of opposite sexes, not being persons living together as husband and wife, have to sleep in the same room."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a clear definition, and I hope that the Minister can accept it. That would answer the points of the hon. Member for Hertsmere about people living together. 
<P>
Perhaps there should be a space standard, by which one could calculate the permitted number of people who could live in a dwelling. I hope that the space standard will be a criterion for ruling out overcrowded accommodation. If the floor area of a room is less than 50 sq ft, no one should be in it; if that area is between 50 and, 70 sq ft, half a person could fit in the room; one person could fit in a room with a floor area of between 70 and 90 sq ft; one and a half persons could be allowed to live in a room with a floor area of between 90 and 110sq ft. Two people could be allowed to stay in a room with a floor area of 110sq ft or more. I assume that an updated metric version will be produced soon. It would be helpful in determining whether housing was adequate under the Bill if the Minister decided to rule out overcrowded housing on the basis of the room sharing standards in housing legislation and of the space standard. 
<P>
The Minister's comments on adequacy and suitability were unsatisfactory. He suggested that there was no difference between adequate and suitable, yet argued that, because the accommodation was temporary, a different standard could be applied to it. Anyone who reads the proceedings with a notion of commonsense will believe that the Minister's words imply that a lower standard could be set for temporary accommodation. It is difficult to understand why the Government are keen to retain the distinction between adequate and suitable if those words mean the same. 
<P>
The provisions of the Housing Act 1996 on suitable accommodation are applicable to the Bill. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions guidelines on allocating housing state that authorities should take account of an applicant's medical and physical needs or social considerations that might affect the suitability of accommodation, as well as other factors such as the risk of racial harassment of domestic violence, access to and stability in schools and access to other facilities. Those criteria are appropriate for the Bill. I am worried by the Government's desire to maintain the distinction between adequate and suitable housing. 
<P>
The Minister was not clear about circumstances in which an individual has other means of obtaining adequate accommodation. If it appears to the Minister that someone cannot get support from his own community, he will receive accommodation under the Bill. That is an inaccurate test and the process manual does not suggest that the procedures to be used will be any more accurate. 
<P>
For example, it appears as though the Minister would say, "You're Kurdish. There are Kurdish people around, but you say that they cannot accommodate you. Fine, we shall provide you with accommodation." I am sure that the test will not work in that way, but we do not know how it will. If family members resident in this country say that they will not provide accommodation, will the Minister accept that they cannot provide it? If he does not accept that, when will he overrule them and say that they are refusing to offer accommodation and that they must do so? Such a decision will be critical. 
<P>
An argument was made about relative need and asylum seekers were compared with constituents who present themselves as homeless. That argument was nonsensical in some respects and dangerous in others. The creation of a distinction has been used in other contexts to present asylum seekers as the enemies of local people and as competitors for the same housing. Such comparisons are dangerous, because the needs of the two groups are not entirely comparable. Asylum seekers have special needs that I do not commonly find in my constituents. For example, most homeless people are not newly arrived aliens in a foreign country. In addition, the majority of those presenting themselves as homeless in Sheffield do not face the problems of oppression, torture and the deaths of close relatives. They have other problems, but they do not have the special needs of asylum seekers. 
<P>
Although I accept that asylum seekers have special needs, my amendment does not call for a special distinction to be made that would advantage them. The homelessness legislation works quite well because the homelessness of local authorities have good local knowledge and usually take into account local circumstances. 
<P>
Finding homeless people in Sheffield accommodation in Sheffield is a fairly straightforward process. My concern is that the officials of the new Asylum Support Directorate will not operate the system equitably. They will not operate in the same way as officials dealing with homeless persons presenting themselves in Sheffield. The directorate will be able to place someone anywhere in the country. Therefore, it will face a new and complex range of problems. 
<P>
Perhaps I would have more confidence if the homelessness section of my local authority had to deal with the problems of asylum seekers. The Asylum Support Directorate will have to operate nationally and its decisions may have wide-ranging consequences. We do not know the detail and shape of the directorate, but all the signs about the guidance that it will use are disturbing. 
<P>
The Minister described the changes that I seek to make to the Bill. He said that if we put all the rules in the Bill, the Secretary of State and his officials would have to get decisions right first time or they might face challenge under law. That outcome is entirely desirable. As a Liberal, I think that one of the fundamental tenets that we should bear in mind is that asylum seekers--who are not citizens of this country--should be able to consult the criteria when they need the protection of the law. The criteria should appear in legislation that has been through the House and they should be able to challenge decisions if they are bad. 
<P>
The Minister seemed to suggest that, if we leave everything to regulations and so to some extent, uncertain, we shall be able to make swifter decisions. They may not be the right decisions, but they will be less open to challenge. This clause appears to be about closing down avenues to challenge by listing all the things that cannot be regarded. Therefore, it will not be possible to challenge a decision later by judicial review. That is undesirable. We shall not be able to agree if the Government intend to keep the terms of the Bill loose, so that they can make bad decisions that will not be challenged. 
<P>
Matters should be spelt out clearly in the Bill and be examined by the appropriate parliamentary process. In that way, people would be able to exercise their due rights under law and challenge decisions if they are bad. It is incumbent on the Secretary of State to get decisions right, so that challenges do not take place. It is not our job to accept a Bill that closes down the avenues and leaves him with get-out-of-jail-free cards if his decisions prove to be faulty. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants the Bill to be so hidebound by rules that the whole process becomes bureaucratic and inflexible. That would be damaging to asylum seekers. However, I have said enough about that and made my points clear. 
<P>
Section 325 of the Housing Act 1985 is on room standards, but it relates to long-term accommodation. The Bill deals with short-term accommodation. Similarly, the Housing Act 1996 is about long-term rehousing under the homelessness legislation. Some elements of it, such as those on racial harassment may be relevant, but others certainly are not. 
<P>
As I have already said, "suitable" and "adequate" are different tests for different circumstances. It is possible that suitable accommodation may not be adequate--for example, when it is not associated with a particular level or form of support. The point is that accommodation may be part of a wider package for combating destitution. Contracts with the providers will be able to deal with those issues. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam must get into his mind the distinction between "adequate and temporary" and "suitable and long term". He wants to import into the Bill a definition that applies to something entirely different. If adequate and suitable were both thrown into the definition, that would be a recipe for confusion. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I thought that the hon. Member for Hallam was trying to help the Minister. Earlier, the Minister drew a distinction between shared and overcrowded accommodation. The hon. Gentleman has provided the statutory definition of overcrowding for homelessness purposes. However, the Minister has drawn a distinction, so will he tell us what his definition of overcrowding is?

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The definition of overcrowding in long-term accommodation is set out in legislation. I do not propose now to redefine the term "overcrowding", but I shall take on board the points raised during the debate. The suggestion that I can define "overcrowding" in a way that applies to long-term and to temporary accommodation is not practical or reasonable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have nearly reached the point at which we can say that, for the time being, things are satisfactory. Will the Minister write to me with details of the overcrowding criteria that will be applied under the Bill? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is a matter for the courts to define what is meant by overcrowding. I shall take on board the points made, but I do not think that I need to elaborate further. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I want to respond briefly to the debate. 
<P>
I understand some of the Minister's points. It would be a mistake to adopt an approach that said that the only place that asylum seekers can conceivably be accommodated is London. There is no reason why London should be the only place where they are accommodated. Some London authorities are near breaking point and face severe difficulties in performing their other housing functions because of the number of asylum seekers with which they have to deal. 
<P>
The view that London is the only place for asylum seekers implies that people from ethnic minority communities cannot settle or be reasonably accommodated in other parts of the country. That is obvious nonsense. 
<P>
I understand the parallels that the Minister drew with homelessness. I have had experience of constituents complaining that they have to wait on the transfer list or waiting list for housing when asylum seekers are being given accommodation. However, the same argument is applied to homelessness generally. People who have been on a waiting list for 10 years or a transfer list for five 1309 1310 years often ask why the homeless are being housed. We should take on such arguments and explain that there have to be priorities, and that those in greatest need take priority. 
<P>
There are few people who are in greater need than asylum seekers. We should not accept the argument that they should wait in a queue behind everyone else. I accept that the needs of the individual and the availability of accommodation must be balanced. That happens all the time in my experience of housing in London. People often do not get the properties that they would prefer. 
<P>

</P>
<P>
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister said that special needs would be considered. He referred specifically to HIV. I do not believe that HIV treatment and care is available everywhere. That may be so in theory, but for those who live outside major population centres, going to a general practitioner is a waste of time. A GP in such an area sees only an occasional case and, therefore, does not have the necessary experience or knowledge. It is common for people who are permanently resident in this country to travel long distances for treatment and care. We should bear that in mind when dealing with an asylum seeker who needs such treatment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I give my hon. Friend an assurance that I am sure that the Terrence Higgins Trust and others will also welcome. We intend to try to identify cluster areas, most of which, at least initially, will be in major population centres. As my hon. Friend said, treatment for HIV is likely to be found in most major population centres. I hope that we will take into account that an HIV-positive asylum seeker should be assured of access to appropriate medical care. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> That is a helpful respone. 
<P>
On refugee communites' willingness to help, I am sure that people want to provide support. There is a well-established Tamil community in my constituency, and I know about its concern and support for new Tamil asylum seekers. Evidence shows that asylum seekers who find such community support are more likely to settle, to rebuild their lives and not feel isolated. However, we should not base our system on expecting such support, or provide that established communities should give such help. If such support is forthcoming, that is all well and good, but we must be careful when ascertaining whether people have support in the community or from family and friends. 
<P>
I appreciate the Minister's helpful comments about considering specific circumstances. That was the point of amendment No. 739, which dealt with housing and adequate or suitable accommodation. An Opposition Member claimed that there was more adequate and suitable accommodation now than 18 years ago. That is laughable. Few of my constituents would think that. I see more difficult housing problems now than ever before. 
<P>
The Minister said that circumstances would be taken into account, but that the word "suitable" was one that he would prefer to avoid. He seemed to imply that the definition of "adequate" would be suitable for temporary accommodation if one could say that without straying into difficulties with the housing legislation. I hope that he will consider carefully what is in the regulations, because they will be the key. It has been a helpful debate and, in light of his response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Amendment made: No 756, in page 46, line 3, after "any" insert--

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 850, in page 46, leave out lines 12 to 17 and insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) In determining the extent to which a person's essential living needs are met the Secretary of State shall take account of the person's income and capital as if he were calculating entitlement to income support under section 136 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 355, in page 46, leave out lines 12 to 17. 
<P>
No. 356, in page 46, leave out lines 18 to 21. 
<P>
No. 851, in page 46, line 19, leave out ", or are not,".
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> From the fact that we have opposed the Government so vigorously, the Committee may have gained the impression that we do not want to assist them. However, these amendments are designed to help them by saving them from making unnecessary and unnecessarily complex regulations. 
<P>
Amendment No. 850 revisits the issue of eligibility by suggesting that the rules use an existing set of criteria. It may upset the Minister a little, but I hope that he will consider the rules in context and recognise that subsection (7) will mean that a whole set of secondary legislation will be nessary to define a person's essential living needs. 
<P>
The amendment would use a well-known definition that is used to calculate whether someone is entitled to income support under section 136 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. That would be an appropriate way of determining eligibility. Earlier, I mentioned my concern that the threshold might be set too low. The income support threshold is not too high; it is sensible. By assessing the age, the family structure and so on of a British citizen, it determines at what stage the income support system should kick in. It determines whether that person is destitute in the context of the social security system. 
<P>
That approach would be a sensible way of setting up support for asylum seekers of whatever background. The Minister said that many of them are single men, but some are people with children. They live in the country, and it would be in the interests of legislative efficiency to use the existing definition of destitution rather than to have to refer to a new set of regulations. That is the aim of amendment No. 850. 
<P>
Amendment No. 851 explores another areas of the regulations. Under subsection (8), the Secretary of State will consider whether items and expenses that someone may incur and that may he specified by order are to be  treated as essential living needs. The order may say whether an item is to be counted as an essential living need. The fact that the regulations might specifically exclude items is unnecessary. Will the Minister tell us in what circumstances something may be considered not to be an essential living need when the Secretary of State already has the power to specify items in the order? 
<P>
Some people have special dietary needs and incontinence may lead to someone having special laundry needs. Such matters would best be dealt with by an inclusive power in the order. The Secretary of State should be able to come to the House to say that item A should be included, perhaps with conditions. However, I cannot envisage circumstances in which he would proscribe item B when he can already define what is essential through positive powers. If we retain the existing wording, the regulations could be too complex. The amendments are intended to assist the Government to devise a simple and straightforward framework. I hope that the Minister will view them favourably. 
<P>
<B>Mr Clappison:</B> It may assist the Committee if I make it clear that I shall not speak about the amendments that I tabled and that I shall not seek a separate vote on them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
The proposal of the hon. Member for Hallam would alter provisions for matters that the Secretary of State could prescribe in connection with essential living needs. We need flexibility to develop and consult about arrangements that can cater for asylum seekers' diverse needs. In doing that, we must bear in mind asylum seekers' circumstances and the short duration of their stay in the country as asylum seekers. 
<P>
I do not want to tie the Government in primary legislation to income support provisions under section 136 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The asylum support system will be temporary and last only while applications are being considered. It is separate from the main benefits system and unsuccessful applicants will be expected to leave the country. The asylum support arrangements are not intended to be a replacement welfare service. We may need to take a different view of the assets and resources that people bring into the country. 
<P>
The clause sets out basic, short-term, safety net provisions that will cover fully the essential living needs of asylum seekers before successful cases transfer to the main benefits system and then to full integration in society. There is no link between the social security benefits assessment and that for which the clause provides. 
<P>
Social security assessment is detailed because it is intended to cover a wide range of circumstances in the long term. It assumes that people already live in the country and could have assets--for example, furniture--and future expectations. However, the arrangements in the Bill cater for destitute asylum seekers who are here for a short time until their claims are decided. 
<P>
Social security assessment includes a means test, which allows capital of £3,000 to be disregarded in calculating entitlement to income support. It would be plain ridiculous to suggest that an asylum seeker with £2,900 in his pocket was destitute. We may also wish to take account of personal valuables. I spoke to an asylum seeker at Waterloo. She had brought £4,000 in gold into the country. She had bought lots of gold that she intended to resell here. She was not destitute. In some cultures, it is normal to store wealth in jewellery. We want to take that into account. 
<P>
We want to ensure that we can deal with any circumstances that might arise. If any doubt exists, we shall examine the circumstances. However, it is unnecessary to confine ourselves to a definition that has little direct bearing on the decisions that the relevant officials will have to make.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The more I hear the Minister argue against a social security system for asylum seekers, the more convinced I become that we should adopt such a system. The income support system is not intended only for long-term applicants. If Government propaganda is to be believed, people rapidly come off income support and go to work because of all the schemes that the Government have set up. The social security system is perfectly capable of dealing with people who experience short periods of lack of other income. It does that every day. I hope that most people continue to receive income support for only a short time. 
<P>
The Minister mentioned personal valuables. If, for example, a Somali refugee came to Britain carrying his last bit of wealth in gold, I would not feel proud of a system that made him sell it to support himself while his claim was being considered, so that he had to start all over again with nothing.There is good reason for the social security system to disregard small amounts of capital. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman needs to be a little careful. He thinks that £4,000 in gold should not be taken into account. Is he suggesting that we should not continue to apply the £3,000 limit that is applied to citizens of this country? 
<P>
<H5>9 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am suggesting that there are good public policy grounds for allowing someone, who we know will settle here permanently, to start his new life in this country with a small amount of capital intact. That is a sensible way forward, and the social security regulations recognise that. They use a small capital limit of £3,000. Therefore, if someone becomes unemployed, they do not expect him to divest himself of all his assets. He is allowed to keep some until he returns to work. 
<P>
The parallel is not as straightforward as the Minister suggests. The system should not encourage people to spend every single penny that they have. There are good public policy reasons for allowing them to retain some of their assets. 
<P>
I am sure that we shall have many opportunities to return to these issues. I shall not put the amendment to a vote. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Amendments made: No. 757, in page 46, line 18, leave out "order" and insert "regulations". 
<P>
No. 758, in page 46, line 19, leave out "specified in the order" and insert "prescribed".
<P>
--[Mr. Mike O'Brien]
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 852, in page 46, leave out lines 22 to 24. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 357, in page 46, line 22, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"save that no conditions may be imposed, either generally or in any particular case, without the express authority of the Secretary of State".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It must apear that we do not like much about the clause, and that is close to the truth. Amendment No. 852 relates to subsections (9), (10) and (11) and to an earlier debate on the appropriateness of withdrawal of support. 
<P>
Subsections (9), (10) and (11) set out the conditions under which support may be provided. The draft process manual suggests that a series of conditions will have to be agreed by the asylum seeker and the Asylum Support Directorate. The amendment does not query the principle of agreements or conditions, but I query the fact that that the breaching of conditions could lead to the total withdrawal of support and to destitution. 
<P>
If the conditions are not appropriate to the support provided, and if the subsequent penalty is not a proportionate response to the offence, many other remedies could be used. For example, if someone commits criminal damage, he can be taken to court. If someone breaks immigration conditions, measures can be taken against him under the immigration rules. 
<P>
The clause worries me. if someone breaches conditions, provisions in it could cause him to be evicted and to live in destitution. I accept that he might have done something wrong and that measures should be taken against him. However, total destitution and evicting someone on to the streets could have far-reaching consequences not only for the individual, but for public order. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the conditions that will apply. I recognise that the Bill gives him scope to apply any conditions whatever, but it is important to have some guidance on his intentions. I hope that he will assure us that there will be proportionality, and that the ultimate sanction of eviction and total destitution will not be used for minor infringements, such as the breaking of an appointment with an immigration officer, which could be dealt with in other ways and for which the individual may be prepared to make remedy. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify that wide-ranging set of powers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It may assist the Committee if I say now that I shall not speak to the amendment, nor shall I seek a separate Division. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
Tenants of borough councils and private landlords have, for years, had conditions imposed upon them for the accommodation that they occupy--about good behaviour, respect for property and, in this case, for informing the Secretary of State about any change of circumstances that might affect their continued need for support. That has not been regarded as a great threat to anyone's liberties. It is a perfectly reasonable circumstance, and is the sort of concept that can be applied under clause 74. 
<P>
When deciding whether to evict someone, the Secretary of State must be reasonable and proportionate. It is certainly not our view that he should be disproportionate in applying the sanctions, nor would he seek to contribute to the problems of social exclusion. However, the conditions would be suitable for temporary accommodation. They may be different from those of a council tenant who has a long-term accommodation. However, they will, in all cases, be reasonable. Any penalties will be proportionate and proper. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is a helpful clarification. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to discuss amendment No. 831, in clause 79, page 49, leave out lines 14 and 15. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I hope that amendment No. 831 will meet the Minister's approval, because it seeks to give greater discretion to the Secretary of State. In contrast to my earlier attempts to handcuff him and bind him with shackles of rules, the amendment would free him from some of the shackles to be found in the Bill. The amendment would remove clause 79(3), which refers to clause 74. If clause 79 aims to give discretion to the Secretary of State to provide temporary support in an emergency, why do we need all the tests listed in clause 74? 
<P>
Clause 79(2) states 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Support may be provided ... only until the Secretary of State is able to determine whether support may be provided under section 74."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems that if clause 74 tests have been made, the clause 79 discretion will not be needed. It would be better to leave the Secretary of State with the wider discretionary power to provide temporary provision and, if it has to be tested fully under the clause 74 powers, subsections (2) to (11) of clause 74 will apply for that longer short-term support. The Minister continually reminds us that the support is temporary. Section 79 allows temporary, temporary support before allowing temporary support under clause 74. The tests applied in clause 74 are wholly inappropriate for the section 79 temporary, temporary support. 
<P>
In general, our debates on amendments to clause 74 have made clear the nature of our concerns. The Minister has given us some very small rays of hope, and I hope that we shall explore them further, but, in general, clause 74 remains the dark area that it was when we entered into it. It still gives the Secretary of State wide-reaching powers that cannot be tested against primary legislation. Our only hope is that the phantom menance of the regulations that we shall come to later will be slightly more helpful. All the signals from the Minister have shown continually a clear distinction between the definitions of accommodation and the essential living needs that are used for United Kingdom citizens in other contexts and those for asylum seekers. 
<P>
My understanding of the clause and that of other concerned people is that all the standards--of accommodation that is deemed to be adequate and of living needs below which one must go before deemed to be destitute--will be significantly lower than those that apply to United Kingdom citizens when they fall on hard times. That lowering of standards will cause significant hardship to asylum seekers, particularly asylum seeker families and their children. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Under clause 74, assistance can he given only to asylum seekers who seem to be destitute, for whom an assessment has been made and a conclusion reached. There may be a need, however, for more immediate assistance to be given before a formal application can be made--what the hon. Member for Hallam calls "temporary, temporary assistance". 
<P>
Clause 79 provides for that and refers to support for those who may be destitute. To operate that provision, we still need a test of destitution. It seems appropriate to use the same as that used for the main scheme, although the level of proof required is lower since, under the Bill, support may be given to asylum seekers who may be destitute. The idea of a lower test, but adopting the same criteria, has been borrowed from homelessness legislation under section 188 of the Housing Act 1996. It has worked reasonably well under that legislation and should do the same under the Bill, if required.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 828, in page 46, line 32, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(other than legal expenses or other expenses of a prescribed description)".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>  With this it may be convenient to take the following: Amendment No. 747, in page 46, line 34, at end insert "or--

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) to enable the supported person to meet the expenses of travelling to appointments with their legal representative.".
<P>

<P>
Government amendment No. 772. 
<P>
Amendment No. 402, in clause 85, page 51, line 11, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(i) for the payment of any travel expenses reasonably incurred by the appellant in bringing the appeal; 
<P>
(j) for appellants to receive advice and representation from any voluntary organisation in receipt of a grant under section 37".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendments Nos. 828 and 747 would make two changes in respect of the expenses that an individual may meet in connection with his asylum claim. Amendment No. 828 would remove the bracketed provision under subsection (1)(c) which refers to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"legal expenses or other expenses of a prescribed description".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It contains the dreaded word "prescribed", which is why it caught my attention. The Secretary of State is again taking powers to take out not only the legal expenses that we expect to be met in other ways, but a wide range of expenses of a prescribed description for the supported person in connection with the asylum claim. 
<P>
Amendment No. 747 would add in the extra element of travelling expenses to enable a supported person to meet his appointed representative. It was tabled in response to circumstances whereby individuals are likely to be moved to various parts of the country, particularly outside the capital, and who will be seeking advice. It is important that free advice and representation services are available. For example, in Sheffield we do not have an outpost of the Immigration Advisory Service or the Refugee Legal Centre. If individuals were located in Sheffield, it would be sensible to provide them with the means to travel to Leeds or Manchester, where there are outposts of the Immigration Advisory Service. 
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The current provisions in the Bill do not necessarily make explicit the fact that individuals can receive support and so take advantage of such facilities. Without travelling expenses, people might be confined to seeking only the legal advice available in the town in which they are resident and for which fees can be paid, but those services may be much less satisfactory. That could be an even greater problem in small communities less blessed--in the looser sense--with a range of lawyers than larger cities. 
<P>
Ideally, people should be resident somewhere with free legal services and lawyers available in abundance, but people may be sited in places not only distant from services such as the Immigration Advisory Service, but from lawyers appropriately qualified in immigration law. As the Bill quite properly tightens the regulation of those who are legally entitled to practise immigration law and give immigration advice, we may reduce that pool even further. Therefore, it is important to incorporate in the Bill a provision for individuals to be able to travel to services still permitted to offer quality advice, and which may be funded by the Home Office to do so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment is well-intentioned for asylum applicants, but I am not sure that its effects would be those that the hon. Gentleman wants. I say that due to the concern that ILPA expressed in its submission to the Committee, on which I look to the Minister for a response. ILPA is worried about the read across from clause 75(l)(c) to clause 76(6). Clause 76(6) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For the purposes of subsection (5)"--
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of clause 76, which is the expenditure cap-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any support of a kind falling within section 75(1)(c) is to be treated as if it were the provision of essential living needs."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My amendment No. 402 concerns someone's paying for the cost of travel when bringing an appeal. ILPA says that clause 76(6) 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Provides that expenses met in connection with a supported person's asylum appeal are to be treated as essential living needs for the purposes of the expenditure cap...This is pernicious, and would mean, for example, that the claimant called for interview who was housed far from his port of arrival, or whose appeal was heard at a distant location or was subject to adjournments, could find expenditure on his food or other daily needs reduced by the amount of his fares."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 248.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will be aware of ILPA's concern as it is part of its written evidence to us. Based on what ILPA said, will the cost of supported asylum-seekers' travel to bring appeals be deducted from their essential living expenses, which as we know are capped? If so, that could be quite a proportion of their income every week. Considering the Government's guide on the subject, a lone parent aged 18 or over would receive, based on my maths, the sum of £52 or £53. That includes a cash allowance of £7 and, depending on its age, a certain amount for the child. Travelling by bus and train from Sheffield to Leeds would probably blow all of their cash allowance. I know that both Sheffield and Leeds are blessed with lawyers, but it seems that Leeds is more blessed because, as the hon. Member for Hallam said, all sorts of hearings take place there. 
<P>
Is ILPA right that the cost of travel to make an appeal will be paid pound for pound out of essential living expenses? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The asylum support arrangements are intended to provide basic support for asylum seekers while their claims are being considered. Although they will provide for the necessary expenditure for preparing an appeal--we envisage that the cost of documentation, the cost of postage and the cost of attending a hearing will be covered--they would not extend to the cost of travel from Leeds to London to consult a legal adviser, nor from anywhere else. An ordinary client on legal aid would not expect to have all the costs of long-distance travel met if it was decided to engage a legal adviser from far away. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere makes a valid point. He asked whether the cost of the hearing would be covered, and the answer is yes. In Government amendment No. 772, we propose to provide for the travel expenses of those appealing against a refusal of support before the asylum support adjudicator. However, we see no need to make express provision for other sorts of expenses. Travelling expenses to and from one's legal adviser are already encompassed in clause 75(1)(c). I am not in the business of encouraging people to travel vast distances to consult their lawyers. We plan to encourage more lawyers in the provinces to develop an expertise in immigration law, and we shall be working with the Refugee Legal Centre and others to try to build upon their existing nucleus of knowledge. 
<P>
Clause 75(1)(c) provides support for some of the expenses of consulting a lawyer, but it is not our current policy to provide substantial amounts for that purpose. We shall be careful in developing our strategy and will consult widely. We want people to have access to good quality legal advice, but as close as is reasonably practical. We need to develop an infrastructure in the provinces; as I said, we are already working on it with the Refugee Legal Centre. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We shall consider the issues further at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or may certify that the asylum seeker is a person to whom the provisions of this Part and Sections 8 to 11 and Schedule 1 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 shall not apply".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is another attempt--we keep trying--to raise the question of access to welfare benefits. In our debates on these clauses, the Minister continually refers to the proposed system as temporary. Subsection (2) recognises that other forms of support may be required in exceptional circumstances, such as the support presently being provided for those who have been airlifted out of Kosovo. That is an example of how easily exceptional circumstances can arise. I assume that the Minister, in giving himself the power to provide additional and exceptional support, is thinking of such circumstances. 
<P>
We seek to give the Minister another way to provide exceptional support by reinstating entitlement to benefits. For example, that power could be used if the time limit had been reached, if a determination was expected to take a long time, or if a case had specific compassionate factors. The Minister need not use the power but he would benefit from being able to place someone back into the benefit system if there were compelling circumstances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The provision contained in clause 75(2) would make it possible for the Secretary of State to provide additional support to asylum seekers and their dependants beyond that provided under clause 75(1), pending the resolution of their claims for asylum and if the circumstances warrant it. For example, an asylum seeker with a disability or special health problems such as AIDS would be able to be accommodated. Further cases will emerge as we flesh out the details of the new support arrangements. 
<P>
Changing the test for additional cash support from exceptional circumstances to serious hardship would create rich new ground for argument. That may cause more difficulty than the hon. Gentleman intends. Exceptional cases are significant deviations from the norm. In this case, the norm is set by reference to the standard level of service that is to be provided. Serious hardship is much more subjective; it can be argued by reference to a range of facts or circumstances. 
<P>

<P>
The proposed definition would lead to numerous unmerited challenges and I cannot accept it. Exceptional circumstances may merit exceptional treatment. That is provided for in subsections (2) and (3), and it is what our policy is intended to achieve. However, that does not mean that we should remit exceptional cases to the main benefit system and allow the claimants to work. Such matters must be viewed in the context of a new and separate system for the support of asylum seekers.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It was worth a try, Mr. Maxton. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 856, in page 46, line 40, leave out from beginning to end of line 9 on page 47. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 901, in page 46, line 43, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) In the case of dependent children, the provision of essential living needs under subsection (1)(b) shall normally be wholly or mainly by way of payments.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendment seeks to leave out subsection (3), which states that the Secretary of State should not provide support 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"wholly or mainly by way of payments".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause will cause some specific problems because it gives no clear definition of payments. Those with expertise in the system have said that that is one of their main criticisms of the Government's proposals. 
<P>
Subsection (3) effectively requires the Secretary of State to bring in a voucher system instead of making cash payments. The exceptional circumstances under which the Secretary of State can make cash payments are not defined, but the clause sets up a framework under which the majority of support will be paid in vouchers. 
<P>
Following your instructions, Mr. Maxton, I refer only briefly to the oral evidence of Mr. Gilroy, the director of social services for Kent county council. He said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"To be honest, the voucher system has been a nightmare for us.

<P>
<B> Mr. Allan:</B> The last time I had to break off, I was in the middle of taking people off to a citizen's advice bureau; this time, I was quoting the director of social services in Kent, who, on the issue of whether we provide payments or an alternative, said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is very costly in terms of unit cost per voucher. I wish the Home Office well; it will cost a fortune.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the experience in Kent in regard to vouchers he made the important point that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is clear if you look around Thanet and Dover . . . that people know who the refugees are. They need only go to Sainsbury's or other supermarkets. For us in local government, that becomes a problem because it creates community tension and makes visible racial tensions that would otherwise not be there . . . we would ask that you reflect very carefully indeed."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 18 March 1999; c. 371-372.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The last sentence was a message to the Government. 
<P>
It is therefore, clear from those with current experience of operating the system that they find the voucher system costly and socially harmful. However, under clause 75(3), the Government extend the voucher system to a much greater number of people. My amendment seeks to renew the Secretary of State's discretion to use cash payments or vouchers as he or she sees fit. It does not rule out vouchers but removes the binding situation that the Secretary of State has imposed on himself rather than giving himself wider discretion. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): As the hon. Gentleman is quoting from the evidence that we received, should he not also remind the Committee that the Home Secretary admitted that the voucher system would be more expensive as a unit cost but said that it would be cheaper as a total cost? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It is helpful to have that reminder of the Home Secretary's words. There is general agreement that the system will be more costly; the Home Secretary's contention, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, that the overall costs would go down was made on the basis of the Home Secretary's unsupported suggestion that there is a huge pull factor for cash payments that would somehow disappear once they have been entirely replaced by vouchers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The time taken to determine applications will be much shorter than at present. The unit costs of the voucher system is higher, but the time taken to implement it will be shorter; that is how the Home Secretary arrives at his assessment of lower total costs than under the present system. Does it follow from that that the system may not come into force unless the Government can achieve their ambitious time limits? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere makes an important point on time limits, which are at the heart of the system of providing support for asylum seekers and are a critical issue. If a pull factor operates, it is based on the fact that it takes two, three, four, five years--or even longer--to determine a claim. 
<P>
 We all want--although we have different degrees of faith that the Government will manage it--to achieve the six-month time limit--If we achieve it, I contend that there will be no significant difference in the comparative attractiveness to asylum seekers of a cash payment or a voucher payment. The difference it will make is that it will place a huge additional burden on the taxpayer and on its administrators, and will create the enormous social problems that we have heard about in the Kent example, which all of us can imagine happening in our own constituencies, with asylum seekers, in shabby clothing because they will not have received any money in their support payments for new clothing, going to Sainsbury's check-outs with the vouchers, which will distinguish and separate them from everyone else, and then returning to their accommodation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> The matter that the hon. Gentleman is discussing--what the costs will be--is important. However, it is not simply a question of time. The other important issue is the take-up rate. The costs in the paper on estimates of public expenditure are based on current take-up rates of local authority payments made under the National Assistance Act 1948, which can be rather complicated to access. Those take-up rates are 38 per cent. for families and 21 per cent. for single people. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The take-up rate is another critical factor. Those who are of cynical mind would say that if people are not taking up payments, that is because they do not need to. However, those of us who have experience of the real world have often seen circumstances in which people are in desperate need but do not take up because of the complications of the system. We must worry about whether the system that we are introducing will have a lower take-up rate than the existing system, not because the need is not there--we are all aware of pensioners who do not take up their income support entitlement but clearly need income support--but because of the complexity of the system. People may be thrust yet further into poverty. 
<P>
Provision through vouchers will be costly and will distinguish people. The other critical factor is abuse. Examples have been cited of abuse of the voucher system, such as trading second-hand vouchers on the black market, some of which, although it should not be done, is done for the best possible motives. I have heard anecdotal stories of nuns involved in the care of asylum seekers handing over cash for vouchers because the asylum seekers desperately need cash for the basics of life. Out of charity, genuinely and honestly, those nuns are making a judgment about asylum seekers' circumstances and are trying to help them by giving them access to cash. People who have discussed with us the problems of local government have complained about the the worrying development of a black market in places such as Kent. If we proceed with the voucher system, an exchange rate will develop between the asylo voucher and the pound sterling, which will probably not favour the asylum seeker, and may have other unintended consequences. The edifice constructed on the principle of not paying cash will have insecure foundations if we end up with a system in which determinations genuinely take place in six months. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the problems that he outlines arise now largely because of the length of time for which people must exist under the current arrangement? Under the new arrangements proposed in the Bill, decisions will be made in six months, in which time the pressures that he outlines are less likely to arise. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman, who is as helpful as ever in his interventions, has an optimism that I do not share. Again, I am arguing from two different points of view. I believe that the system will take longer and that we shall not meet the ambitious targets--although I hope that we do. So a problem may arise later. However, I am sure that, whether the period involved is six months or 12 months, the voucher system contains inherent faults. We live in a cash-based economy in which everything works on cash. The structure of our society is founded on cash. A voucher system for any group of people in society is an over-complex and unnecessary way of supporting people during a legal process. The way in which the Secretary of State is binding himself in under subsection (3) is unhelpful. If he finds that the voucher system does not work effectively and he wants to move towards a cash payment system for reasons of efficiency, he will be unable to do so. There is no logical reason why he should want to bind himself into a system in which vouchers are the predominant method of delivery. If he were simply to delete the provision, he could still set up a voucher system; there would be no problem with his doing so in the short term. However, should he decide that that voucher system is not working in six, 12 or 18 months' time, after experiencing all the associated problems that I am describing, he can move to a cash system only by amending the primary legislation. 
<P>
It is wholly unnecessary for the Secretary of State to put himself in that straitjacket unless he wishes to send out a political message saying: "We are going to do this on a voucher system only because we are going to be tough on asylum seekers. We want life to be hard for them, so it is a good thing that they will be singled out in supermarkets." 
<P>
That is the only logic that I can see for requiring asylum seekers to go through a voucher system and not allowing any discretion for a cash payment system, even if the voucher system fails to work effectively. The Government clearly believe that it will work effectively, but I do not. I, therefore, see no reason why the Government should not accept the opening up of the system to give a mixture of vouchers and cash. That would avoid the limiting factor of insisting on what will be predominantly a voucher system. Such a system has clearly failed to deliver in those areas in which it has been tested under the National Assistance Act.

<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 901, which addresses the principle of replacing cash with vouchers, with particular reference to the effect of that on children. 
<P>
I remind the Committee that--whatever one might say about the motives of asylum seekers in general--their children are innocent of malice aforethought or intent to defraud the system. We must be careful before we let children suffer for what we believe to be the errors of their parents. 
<P>
The Government have helpfully produced a document entitled "Asylum Seekers Support", which sets out the process of the new support scheme. On page 17, referring to the voucher system, the Government say 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The arrangements set out in this paper which are based on the principle of support in kind with a minimal cash provision are expected to have a significant disincentive effect".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Every organisation pleading for asylum seekers has spelt out the ill effects of the voucher system and the problems that it may cause. All those ill effects are the Government's deliberate intent. As they say in the document, they expect the provision 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to have a significant disincentive effect".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>

<P>
That effect is not an unfortunate by-product of arrangements set up in good faith, but is the purpose of the arrangements that the Government are putting in place. 
<P>
The intended disincentive effect is the principle of the workhouse. Before the Minister or my hon. Friends accuse me of pure hyperbole, let me say that the Victorians were not being deliberately cruel when they set up the workhouses, which were not designed as places of suffering. However, like Ministers today, the Victorians believed that providing benefits to people without work was a tremendous pull factor. They believed that the way to counteract that was to make the arrangements for claiming benefit--either locally or from the state--as unpleasant and unpalatable as possible. Just as the Victorian workhouse was intended to have a significant disincentive effect, so is the voucher support system. Like the workhouse, that system will prove to be cruel and indefensible in practice. 
<P>
We do not have to look into a crystal ball when discussing the voucher support system, as we can read the records. Certain sections of the asylum-seeker community are already dependent on vouchers, so we know that ill effects that flow from such a system. 
<P>
The first point to make about the voucher system, which is worth putting on the record once again, is that it will be more expensive on a per-person basis to administer than simply giving people income support. The Minister assures us that it will save money because the take-up, will be lower and everyone's case will be resolved within that magic period of two months. But in 12 months' time, once the voucher system is in place, I am sure that the cost will exceed Government projections. That is in the nature of such systems. Even though it will be more expensive to administer than simply giving people income support, when it comes to having a significant disincentive effect, cost is no object for Ministers. 
<P>
<H5>10 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
One of the major problems that my constituents who are unfortunate enough to have to depend on vouchers have found is that they are specific to a particular supermarket. They live in Stoke Newington but their vouchers are for the Mare Street Tesco which is two bus rides away. I have to deal with asylum seekers who have to walk to Mare Street to claim their vouchers. I do not know whether, under the system that the Government propose here, vouchers will be specific in that way, but it cannot be acceptable for people to have to walk sometimes more than a mile to a supermarket to claim the food to which they are entitled. Some of those whom I have had to deal with are disabled or have to take small children with them. That is a not a humane or appropriate system. 
<P>
The other problem with vouchers is that they are inflexible. In effect, the Secretary of State is saying what may or may not be purchased. Someone who has to use his voucher in the Mare street Tesco but comes from an ethnic group whose food is not stocked there is stuck. It is no good him turning up and asking for whatever it is, because they will say that they do not have it. The freedom for people to choose what they eat--they may have all sorts of religious and dietary requirements--is taken away. They have to take their voucher to a supermarket that the Secretary of State chooses and in some cases get their on foot. 
<P>
The voucher system cannot meet incidental needs. I constantly come back to the effect that the support system has on children. I have a seven-year-old and the thing about children is that one must always expect the unexpected. What if a five-year-old wakes up in the night with a terrible earache? Every parent knows what to do in those circumstances--run to the all-night chemist for a bottle of Calpol. Under these proposal, that are being put forward by Labour Ministers, a refugee mother whose child wakes up in the middle of the night screaming with pain will not be able to get that painkiller because the supermarket will not be open and she will not have the cash to pay for it. 
<P>
The Minister may say that, in relation to the greater good of having a significant disincentive effect, what does it matter if a toddler screams for four hours until the supermarket opens and its mother can get some Calpol. But it matters to me and it matters to many people in the country who do not believe that, as we approach the millennium, we should deprive mothers of enough cash to meet the incidental and unanticipated needs of their children. Whereas an adult can wait until the morning to take an aspirin, or put off buying shoes for a month, young children's needs are insistent and cannot wait. We are putting mothers into a situation where they do not have the cash in hand to meet unexpected and incidental needs. 
<P>
In areas of east London where these vouchers are used the children are stigmatised as voucher children. The Minister may argue that vouchers have always been used for the provision of school meals and that it means nothing. I assure him that there is nothing worse for a child than being different. For people of my age and the ages of many members of the Committee, being different can be a source of pride. It can be interesting and something that people can deal with. But, for a child, it can be humiliating. These children, whose mothers have to queue in a supermarket for vouchers and who find themselves singled out in school because they do not fall under the arrangements that many borough councils make for income support claimants, will bear the stigma of being different, being voucher children. 
<P>
I accept that vouchers will buy food, and the Minister has assured me that they will also buy clothing, but, while some of the supermarkets in Hackney sell socks and underwear, none of them sells trainers, jeans and all the other things that children need so frequently. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister seemed to make it clear earlier that vouchers will not be geared to being of sufficient value to buy clothing and that, while parents might, legitimately, want to buy clothing, it will be at the expense of food and other items that are part of the formula for calculating the value of vouchers. That makes matters even worse. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I did not hear my hon. Friend say that, but if it is true that parents will have to choose between purchasing food and purchasing clothing for their children, is wholly unacceptable. 
<P>
I return to my point about young children because that is what I know about. They can go through trainers in a matter of weeks, and, if clothes tear, they tear. I prefer not to believe the hon. Gentleman because surely we cannot be telling asylum-seeker mothers that they will have to choose between food and basic clothing and shoes for their children. I hope that the Minister will respond when he returns to the Committee. 
<P>
I accept that vouchers will buy food--although goodness knows where--and that mothers will be able to buy clothing with vouchers in supermarkets, but I repeat that vouchers will not meet the incidental needs of children, who often have unanticipated urgent needs, and vouchers will certainly not pay for extra-curricular activities. The Minister may ask what asylum-seeker children want with extra-curricular activities, why cannot they just go home to their asylum-seeker hostels. But in a given week in any school there is the swimming club, the gym club, a coach trip, and a book sale. It is one thing for an adult to have to say "I must wait for that" or "I can't do that", but it is extremely hard for a mother to have to tell her seven-year-old that he or she cannot go to the swimming class, or the gym club, or to say "No, you cannot buy a book from the book sale because I simply don't have the money. All I have is 50p a day". 
<P>
I realise that that is a small matter rather than a life-and-death issue, but to a child of eight or nine, small matters are life and death matters. How can it be necessary or right that the needs of a fair but firm asylum policy lead us, through the Bill, to subject the children of asylum seekers to petty--I repeat petty--little humiliations week in, week out, so that things that other children can do because their mothers can put their hand in their pocket and find £2 will be denied to them because their mothers have to say no? If the Minister does not believe what I say about the number of incidental bits of money that mothers must find each week for a seven-year-old, he is welcome to come to my home between the time that my son gets up and the time that he goes to school and discover the small incidental cash sums that a young child will demand, which, under these arrangments, asylum--seeker mothers will not be able to provide. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Perhaps I might gently remind my hon. Friend that she is not the only person on the Committee who has young children.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I know that. But 1 ask members of the Committee, including the Minister, who have young children to think how they would feel if they had to send a child to school on 50p a day, which must cover bus fares and perhaps swimming lessons, not to mention pocket money. All I ask is that colleagues in the Committee use their imagination. I ask them to realise that asylum-seeker children are like other children and that their needs and demands will be the same, and to consider the position of the mother of one of these children who is forced to say, "Well, Mike O'Brien thinks this is a frivolous and economic asylum claim, so, sorry, I have only 50p a day." 
<P>
I have already talked about diet as another problem with the voucher system. Most supermarkets may not have the culturally appropriate foods that people need to buy. Another problem is that the 50p a day for children is supposed to cover bus fares. In London, the minimum bus fare for children is 40p. On 50p a day, a child could get to school but would have only 10p to come back. 
<P>
It is no good saying that local authorities will help out with transport. It may be possible outside London, but inner London boroughs long abandoned offering additional help with transport. If help is given by local authorities to school children, it is usually in relation to income support--a passport to extra local authority help--and it is still unclear what will happen to asylum seekers' children. As I said, 50p cash a day will take a child to, but not back from, school. 
<P>
We have already seen, in areas where vouchers are in operation, that precisely because a voucher is not a flexible instrument and because there are genuine cash needs--not for cigarettes or cinema tickets, but for a pain killer in the middle of the night, for bus fares, for photocopying--that vouchers cannot meet, we end up with a black market in vouchers. People exchange their vouchers for less than the face value in order to have a little cash for insistent cash needs. 
<P>
The motive behind the voucher system--to exercise a significant disincentive effect--is shameful. If the aim is to dissuade people from making phoney asylum claims, the Government's policy to cut down on immigration advisers is part of the answer, but the way forward is to speed up the whole process. I bow to no one in this Committee in terms of my knowledge of the day-to-day experience of dealing with asylum claims, and I know that the main incentive for bunging in bogus asylum claims is the certainty that it will prolong the stay in this country. Before cracking down on cash benefits, the Government should try to shorten the waiting time--as they claimed that they were able to do--for the resolution of asylum claims. 
<P>
The voucher system is wrong in principle. The Government could have adopted other means to choke off bogus asylum claims. It will also pose practical problems, which the Committee has not even begun to explore, and it will have a particularly detrimental effect on children. Ministers will be aware that I raised the question of the effect of the voucher system on children many times before the Committee started sitting. Let me tell Ministers again that if this Government, with a record majority, want to push through  legislation that will leave mothers with 50p a day to deal with the cash needs of their children, it is time to revisit their policy. 
<P>
There is no practical reason for the voucher system proposals. More generous proposals could easily be passed through Parliament. All sorts of practical problems will be caused by the arrangements that are being presented to the Committee. It may be a simplistic point, and the Minister will not appreciate it, but of all those who voted Labour in May 1997, not a single one would have imagined that the Labour Government would present to Parliament proposals that effectively say to asylum seeker mothers, "Yes, you'll get your hostels; you'll get your food vouchers; and then we'll give you 50p a day". 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Two amendments are before us and I shall deal first with amendment No. 901. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington set out her concerns about children. I share them. I have two young children of my own, not much different in age from my hon. Friend's. I have to say to her gently again, however, that rhetoric and hyperbole do not change the facts. 
<P>
These are the facts. An asylum seeker family of four consisting of two adults and two children under 16, will receive a support package that will provide all their accommodation needs on a temporary basis. It will provide furnished accommodation with necessary utensils, linen and other provision. Their council tax will be covered and their utilities and energy costs will be paid for, which will be about £8 or £9 a week. That will bring the total up to social security income support levels. Indeed, when we consider all the costs involved, it will probably exceed those levels. It will include £90.80 per week spending power, of which £21 will be in cash. That is the present position, but we are consulting further on the matter. 
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington knows perfectly well that we have agreed to consult further on the amount of cash that will be provided, but our view is that it is necessary to have a system involving some provision of alternative support, which may take the form of vouchers, direct provision, or a number of other options. That is the Government's view on how to deal with the matter. 
<P>
Let me set out the background to our proposals and put them in context. We have had a wide--ranging debate on amendments Nos. 901 and 856. Our objective is to restore integrity to an asylum system that is in a shambles. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Oh. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not getting into the old arguments with the hon. Gentleman. [Interruption.] It would be very easy to do so, given the record of the Government of the hon. Member for Hertsmere. 
<P>
The Bill is complex and interrelated, but I believe that its provisions are balanced. As an objective, we are seeking public support for refugees by tackling, and trying to reduce, abuse in the asylum system. Much of the White Paper and the Bill has received broad support. [Interruption.] 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must advise those in the public Gallery that they cannot make any noise whatsoever during the Committee's proceedings. If they do so, I shall be obliged to ask them to leave. If they do not leave, I will ask the security services to remove them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Bill has received widespread support from a variety of organisations, including many ethnic minority groups, as those who have sat through the Committee know full well. I include my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington in that. 
<P>
I am referring to the provisions on appeals on visas, bonds on visas requested by ethnic minorities, routine bail hearings for detainees, tackling the pre-1995 backlog ECHR appeals, so that people can bring appeals if they have human rights grounds for doing so, access to citizenship for refugees in four rather than seven years and allowing families to stay here when children were born more than seven years ago. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not want to go through all these points again. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If there has been such a crescendo of support for the Bill, what was in the Home Secretary's mind when he was giving evidence to the Special Standing Committee? When it was put to him that his proposals were tough, he said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is inevitable that witnesses who come before the Committee will criticise propositions."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee , 22 March 1999; c. 458.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why did he think that everyone was so hostile? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I can tell the hon. Gentleman precisely what was in my right hon. Friend's mind. Most of the focus of oral presentation at the Special Standing Committee was, inevitably, on controversial matters, such as the issue of direct support for asylum seekers. The written evidence and consultations show that there is broad support for many other provisions in the Bill and the White Paper. 
<P>
The key issue on which there is broad support is for speeding up the asylum process. No one disagrees with that principle. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington has just agreed that that is a key issue. I entirely agree that if cases can be dealt with quickly, and we can remove those who make false claims for asylum quickly, that is the solution to the shambles of the asylum system. 
<P>
We can talk about issues relating to Croydon, the appeals abuse and many other matters, but there is no disagreement that speed is the key way of resolving the problems in the asylum system. I suspect that there is no dispute either that the system is in a shambles, for whatever reason that situation arose. [Interruption.] 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) cannot come in. He is not a member of the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> People must face the fact that public support for asylum seekers is undermined by those who try to breach immigration control and claim benefits. We must deal with that abuse. The Bill cracks down on unscrupulous immigration advisers, who are the worst enemies of genuine refugees. They have created an industry in encouraging people to make false claims. No one disputes that there are traffickers, forgers, advisers and lawyers who are all engaged in trying to undermine the system. 
<P>
I cite the example of the many Lithuanians who have come to this country, none of whom has been recognised as an asylum seeker. Many of them are young men; they are not from any ethnic minority; nor, do they have evidence of persecution. It appears that until recently, travel agents advertised openly that it was possible to 1329 1330 come to Britain to learn English and to claim benefits for a period of time. The Lithuanian Minister came to see me to express his concern about the way in which that trade had developed. I understand that the Lithuanian Government are now trying to pass laws to deal with it. 
<P>
The Lithuanian Minister sent a clear message that we had to sort out that difficult situation because his country was applying to join the European Union. Some of the citizens of his country were coming to Britain making claims--patently abusive claims, from what we have seen so far--for asylum, with no genuine justification. They did that because they were able to access the benefits system and receive far more than they could in their own country. It is no wonder that public support for asylum seekers has all too often been low in the past. British people have warm hearts for genuine refugees; they have warm hearts for the Kosovars and the Bosnians, but those warm hearts should not be abused. 
<P>
Public support for asylum seekers has been undermined by the abuse of the asylum system. The history is well known. As the immigration doors closed in the 1970s and 1980s, the gap in the controls was in the asylum system. For 40 years, about 2,000 to 4,000 asylum seekers came to Britain. There was broad public support for the asylum system and for genuine refugees. It is right that there should be and we want to restore that position. In 1989, the figure rose to 11,000, and by 1991, it had risen to 45,000. Some of that can be accounted for by genuine refugees who were fleeing from eastern Europe, Somalia and other countries. However, many cases were unfounded applications for asylum. 
<P>
There were two consequences of that. The first was chaos in the asylum system. The IND at Croydon found it very difficult to deal with a large number of cases, each of which involved interviews, investigations, queries from lawyers and submissions being made. It began to take years for a decision to be made. By the time we came into government, there were 10,000 cases from before 1993. Years were spent in the appeals system. By the time cases reached the stage of a deportation order, many of the people had married and had children, and there were all sorts of compassionate reasons why they should not be removed from the country. During much of that period, some of them had access to benefits. The Conservatives tried to deal with those issues in two pieces of legislation, but I shall not rehearse the arguments on those. 
<P>
The second consequence of what happened was that public support for the asylum system dropped. As the right-wing press identified the level of abuse, which was patent, the public began to perceive that the system was not working, and they were right--it was not working. Some on the left took the view immediately--almost a knee-jerk reaction--that we should defend the system because of that attack on refugees. However, many Labour Members knew that the position was far more complex than that, that the system was being abused and that we had to get in touch with that reality. They knew that people were running businesses, organising the abuse of the asylum system, and that those people were undermining public support for genuine refugees. 
<P>
Every member of the Committee agrees that we need to crack down on that unscrupulous industry, but what of its clients and those who make abusive claims? I shall not go into all the arguments that they are seeking economic opportunities. People may seek economic opportunities for many reasons, but I do not think that we need go into that. However, we know that we need to reform the asylum system, so that it is firmer, faster and fairer. We must face up to the abuse. 
<P>
The Labour Government have to make clear decisions that not only protect genuine refugees but deal with the abuse. We cannot duck the issue of abuse. An academic recently wrote to me saying, "I know that there is a level of abuse, but it is not up to me to deal with it--it is up to the Government. My job is to defend genuine refugees." Our job also is to defend genuine refugees and tackle the abuse, and we must find a way to do that. 
<P>
It is the Government's view that benefits are a pull factor. The 1996 Act meant that benefits were available to port asylum seekers until a decision was made, but that no benefits were available for in-country applicants. I shall not go into all the arguments about the unfairness of that legislation. However, it was clear that the benefit changes reduced the number of people who claimed in country. The figures are clear, and the information is difficult to challenge statistically. A shift occurred very quickly from applying in country to applying at port. 
<P>
In 1995, there were 14,410 port applications and 29,555 incountry applications, so the disparity was about one third to two thirds. By 1998, the ratio had changed to about 50:50--23,349 to 22,670. Thousands of people had decided to claim at port. It is difficult to argue that the changes in the benefit system had nothing to do with that. We know that traffickers and unscrupulous advisers tell those who want to breach immigration control to claim asylum and that, if they do so at port, they can gain access to the benefits system. That is one of the key reasons why the statistics changed. 
<P>
No one seriously denies that the abuse is big business or that it is an organised racket. We know that some traffickers charge people £4,000, and sometimes as much as £14,000 in some countries. That is a big business, and we must deal with it. 
<P>
I shall not go into the reasons why, which are controversial and a matter of dispute between the Opposition and the Government, but the 1996 Act meant that people who applied at port could gain access to the benefits system for either a short period or a long period, depending on when the decision was made. However, the majority of people, who either applied in country, or were subject to the appeal system, could not gain access to the benefits system. They were reliant on a shambolic system of local authority support, which did not work well. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam referred to Mr. Gilroy from Kent county council, who rightly said that the system did not work, that it was terrible to set up and that local authorities had enormous problems with it. We want to remove that burden from local authorities; they must not carry it in future. 
<P>

<P>
<H5>10.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The changes in the system had an effect. They did not stop genuine asylum seekers coming to Britain, but they affected the way in which they claimed. Given that traffickers tend to have an arbitrage between countries and encourage their clients to go to certain places, not others, we shall see what happens when the changes come about. Housing benefit restricts access to accommodation for port asylum seekers. They may need accommodation, and we intend to deal with the inadequacies of the current benefit system for those who apply at port. Often, they cannot access adequate accommodation, especially in the London area, because of the amount of money that is now paid under the benefit system. We shall ensure that accommodation is provided by the state. 
<P>
The disadvantages of reducing the level of benefit that is paid to port asylum seekers--who make up a definite group--up to the point of decision are more in appearance than in reality, because of how the housing benefit system operates for them. Those who will be in a different position in future are the people who are currently dealt with under the local government support system. They will move into the new state national agency support system that we are creating. It will provide considerable advantages that do not exist under the current disorganised system. 
<P>
Although we shall not provide the sort of access to the benefit system that the hon. Member for Hallam wants, we shall create a better system than the current shambolic system run by various local authorities. Some of them are not really sure of the law under the National Assistance Act 1948. Asylum seekers will be in a more secure position and will receive an amount that will often be in excess of what they receive now. We do not consider it appropriate to go as far in restoring benefits as the hon. Gentleman wants, but we shall be creating a system of support that will be better than that which currently exists for the majority of people seeking asylum. It will not have the disadvantages of the pull factor for people, such as the young Lithuanians to whom I have referred. 
<P>
Our aim is to ensure that no asylum seeker is left destitute while, at the same time, containing costs. We shall also ensure that we minimise the incentives for false claims for asylum; I am not arguing that we shall eliminate them. We will encourage people to get support elsewhere if they can do so and those who do not have an established right to be here will be treated under a separate system. 
<P>
The cashless system is more costly to operate than a full cash system but, in overall costs, it has less of a pull factor and it is likely that fewer people will make false claims for asylum. It will enable us to provide adequate leave for a temporary period of about two months for those who are making claims. We want to ensure that genuine asylum seekers are recognised as quickly as possible. The Government's record in increasing the recognition rate of asylum seekers has been widely acknowledged. The system will provide assistance for those who are granted exceptional leave to remain. There will not be the pull factor that the hon. Member for Hallam thinks will be restored to the system. 
<P>
The proposal will ensure that the system operates faster, so that genuine asylum seekers wait for only a short time. Our objective is, as far as possible, to minimise that time. The hon. Gentleman may argue that we will not succeed in our aim but we will try as hard as we can to ensure that we do. People who are not genuine asylum seekers will be in the appeals system for longer and if, having explored human rights and other issues, their claim fails and they have no genuine reason to remain in the Country, they will be removed. That is the Government's commitment. 
<P>
Some valid points have been raised, which I have heard before. First, there is the issue of racist thugs who might be waiting in the supermarket queue to attack asylum seekers. The Government's record on such issues is good: we introduced new laws making racial violence and harassment specific offences and increased the punishment for those who break those laws. We are currently updating race relations legislation to cover immigration and asylum law and the police. We set up the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. I do not have to argue-- [Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am being more tolerant than perhaps I should be in allowing remarks to be made from the Public Gallery. If there are any more such remarks I shall have to ask all those in the Public Gallery to leave the Room. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government are firmly committed to cracking down hard on racism. I suspect that no member of the Committee doubts our Commitment in that respect. 
<P>
I do not doubt that racist gangs exist and that they are a threat, especially to asylum seekers. However, they would not have to wait in supermarket queues to identify them as unforturnately it is all too easy to identify victims by other means. That is regretable, and it is something that we must tackle firmly. However, I do not think that passing across the voucher is something that the asylum seeker needs to worry about significantly --[Interruption.] 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am suspending the Committee for 10 minutes during which time those in the Public Gallery will leave. 
<P>
<H5>10.37 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended. 
<P>
<H5>10.47 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is regrettable that some people do not believe in proper parliamentary debate and want to drown out democratic discussions by shouting and unpleasantness. 
<P>
Let us continue with the people's business. I was responding to points raised during the debate. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said that she was worried because vouchers were inflexible, and I know that she does not approve of them. I agree that the present system is inflexible and we intend to ensure that there is a wider choice. 
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King:</B> On the matter of vouchers, my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington mentioned Tesco's in Mare street. I was there the other night, waiting in a queue behind someone who had vouchers. The person at the checkout counter did not understand them, could not use them and refused to accept them. What will be done to ensure that someone like me, who is not a racist thug, does not become extremely irate at having to wait for 20 minutes in a supermarket queue while such difficulties are sorted out? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We should ensure that there is a national system and that everyone who works in a supermarket knows how to operate it. That means that we must reach a national agreement with the supermarket chains that vouchers will be more freely accepted. At present, they can often be used in only one supermarket in an area and are thus invalid everywhere else. It is important that there should be wider choice. There are measures to ensure that cultural and other needs are met in operating the voucher system and there may even be other ways in which such needs can be met. The details are in the regulations. 
<P>
I have much sympathy for the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington about a black market in vouchers. I do not dispute that it is a problem with the voucher system and, as far as we can, we must find ways of tackling it. There are various proposals for doing so, which we shall examine. We shall consult various groups and discuss with them how we might solve the problem. 
<P>
The aim of the system proposed in the Bill is to try to restore public support for asylum seekers by creating a more efficient system. Whatever the merits of benefits or vouchers, the current situation is unsustainable in the long term. The Government are not prepared to restore benefits for all asylum seekers and the proposed system, although not meeting all the requirements of those in favour of a benefits system, will have fewer of its disadvantages and will place asylum seekers in a better position, by and large, than they are in today. 
<P>
The operation of the Bill will fit in with the Government's overall aims of a balance between immigration control and a firm and strong human rights policy, and we are committed to delivering both aims. Much as I regret having to say it, it is necessary to remove benefits from port asylum seekers. As I said earlier, they will not be disadvantaged too much because of the current problems associated with obtaining accommodation on housing benefit. The measure may be tough, but it is necessary. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. I was shocked that people who feel strongly about the subject should have to be removed from the Public Gallery. Can you recall the last occasion on which the Public Gallery of a Standing Committee had to be cleared? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have never had to do it. I do not know when it has happened before. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I have some brief comments on the amendment. 
<P>
I have no doubt whatever that the current chaotic system needs reforming, as it is not really a system at all. It is not what the 1996 Act intended but what arose as a result of court action after that legislation came into force. 
<P>
I remind members of the Committee that the purpose of the 1996 Act was to leave anyone who applied in-country absolutely destitute, with all benefits cut off. I do not wish to see crocodile tears from the Opposition about the effects of the Bill after what they proposed in the 1996 Act. In common with everyone who has dealt with asylum claimants, I have no sympathy either for fraudulent claimants or trafficking. Much of the trafficking that goes on is not associated with asylum claimants, because many people are brought in to work illegally, not to seek asylum. 
<P>
Much of the debate on the amendments has been about the merits of cash benefits over vouchers, and whether cash benefits act as a draw to this country. I have doubts about the interpretation of the figures. It is claimed that the change in the balance after the 1996 Act came into force was simply the result of people realising that fraudulent claims--that is the implication of the interpretation--were more likely to be made at ports because that was the way of getting access to benefit. 
<P>
There is a perfectly valid, alternative explanation. One would always expect there to be a change in the pattern of applications after there had been a change in the law. Many Tamil and Somali refugees live in my constituency, and I am aware that many Tamil asylum seekers already know people in this country. Word gets back to them about how the system operates. 
<P>
Before the 1996 Act came into force, it did not matter whether an asylum seeker claimed at a port or waited a week before making a claim. The figures relating to the period before the 1996 Act show that a significant number of people made claims in the first week or two of their being in the country. It is natural that, once word gets about that the law has changed, people will realise that they cannot afford to wait two or three days or a week. They cannot wait until they have made contact with the people whom they know, but have to make a claim at the port. I am convinced that that has happened many times. 
<P>
I wish to make another point about the vouchers. I do not necessarily accept the argument that the restoration of full cash benefits would be a draw, but let us assume that I believe that asylum seekers should receive less payment. Even if I took that view, I still could not understand why we should give people vouchers that they could use in supermarkets rather than the equivalent amount in cash. If they had cash, they would have the freedom and the choice to decide where, how and when to spend the money. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington also made that point. 
<P>
If £30 or £40 in cash in hand are a draw, why is a piece of paper that is worth that amount if spent in a supermarket not considered to be a draw? I do not understand the logic of the distinction. Instead of providing people with money, we are in danger of setting up a system that is cumbersome, bureaucratic and difficult to administer. 
<P>

<P>
Today, the Home Secretary announced that this country would accept significantly more people from Kosovo. Figures of some thousands have been mentioned, and certainly I saw a report on Ceefax that suggested that we might accept as many as 1,000 a week, although I am not sure for how many weeks that would be. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said that we would be able to receive 1,000 Kosovans a week if that were necessary and if UNHCR requested us to accept them. We all take the view that there should be no cap on the numbers that we are prepared to accept, and there is not a set number of weeks. We seek to be as helpful as we can in a very difficult situation. That has been our policy from the start and we have been working with UNHCR to implement it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> It is absolutely right that we are prepared to people accept people in these circumstances. I am glad that things are moving on and that the number that we are prepared to accept has increased. However, we are left in a peculiar position. Because of the emergency in Kosovo, we shall accept people and give them exceptional leave to remain. That will give them access to benefits and permission to work. However, other people--and not just from Kosovo, but from countries such as Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan--will be stuck in the queue. 
<P>
I hope that there will not be another Kosovo, but people will inevitably come here from countries where there is turmoil and where their lives are in serious danger. We appear to be telling them that they must wait and that, while they wait, they must survive on 70 per cent. of income support, most of which is in the form of vouchers. There is a contradiction between what we are doing for people who are currently arriving from Kosovo and what we do for some of their relatives who are already in the country. In addition, those who arrive in the future will fall under the new support system. 
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened to the debate with great interest, and I was particularly interested in the Minister's latest intervention on the hon. Member for Walthamstow. In the light of the Minister's comments, will he say whether UNHCR has asked us to take any more refugees and, if so, how many? If it has not, do the Government expect it to ask us to take more refugees? It would be helpful to know. 
<P>
I do not propose to deal with some of the wider arguments about the character of the asylum system, because I do not think that that would be fruitful. However, I do not resile from anything that I have said in the past. 
<P>
I am in a curious position. I have made it clear that Conservative Members do not oppose the Government's policy in principle, but important points of detail must be dealt with much more satisfactorily than they are in the Bill. We have also asked questions about workability and cost. However, we do not want to make an issue of the policy. 
<P>
The attitude taken towards the 1996 Act and to the change in the benefit regulations that was made at that time is curious. I note the comments of the hon. Member for Walthamstow on that. However, the Government's White Paper, "Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum" prays in aid the 1996 changes to support the changes that the Government are making. The 1996 changes are attacked, but the Government rely on them in evidence. They face in both directions at the same time.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Our concern about the 1996 Act was that the previous Government intended to leave asylum seekers with no support at all. We opposed it for that good reason. The system proposed in the Bill will provide adequate asylum seeker support. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is not entirely correct. He knows that the 1996 changes distinguished between port-of-entry applicants and those that applied in- country. The arguments that he is deploying now are similar to those that were made about in-country applicants. He is using the same contentions to support his position. I do not want to be too contentious and to lay it out, but we have become rather familiar with that posture as we consider the Bill and its history. 
<P>
We still have concerns about workability and the speed of decision taking. We want to return to them, but I do not intend to delay the Committee now. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The Minister made a few general remarks, and I shall make a few general remarks that are relevant to the clause. 
<P>
A basic fallacy--not an ideological, but an administrative fallacy--underlies the Bill. Under the new scheme, it is said that officials will be able to deal with claims in two months, and that claims and appeals will be dealt with in a maximum of six months. That is a total fallacy. People's willingness to believe it directly correlates to the amount of contact that they have had with IND. If one has had hardly any relationship with IND, one will swallow the fallacy and will probably also believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden. Those of us who have spent years dealing with IND know that it is a fallacy. I am happy to put on the record the fact that it will not meet its targets for dealing with such claims, and, therefore, the logic of the punitive system of support for a short time only is blown away. 
<P>
Before I talk briefly about why I think that IND will not meet its own time limits, I want to respond to some of the general points raised by the Minister. Whenever the poor hon. Member for Hertsmere gets out of his box, the Minister slaps him down by saying that he inherited a bad system. I bow to no one in my condemnation of the terrible system that the Government inherited, which I spent 12 years attacking in Parliament and dealing with its by-products. However, the Bill, and, specifically, its proposals in relation to support, will make a bad and chaotic system worse. 
<P>
Whether anyone is inspired to ask or not, I know what I would have done. We had certain clear-cut manifesto commitments on the subject, which I would have dealt 1337 1338 with through a short Bill. I would have attended to the managerial problems at Lunar house, which are long-standing and intractable and one of the many reasons why I do not think that the time limits can be met. I would have dealt with such administrative problems, the institutional culture and, of course, the computers and taken that time to have some sort of far-reaching, comprehensive look at our immigration and asylum system. 
<P>
I have said it before and I say it again: our immigration and asylum rules, legislation and instruction system is a hotch-potch that was thrown together. The Government, supported by an unprecedented tide of good will, with an unprecedented majority and at least 10 good years ahead of them-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Steady on! 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I knew that that would get the hon. Gentleman going, but the Government are almost certain to win the next election. 
<P>
The Government have missed an important opportunity to re-fashion our immigration and asylum system and create one that is clear, transparent and humane. After putting our manifesto commitments through in a brief Bill, I would have taken the time properly to review the system and, in the meantime, dealt with Lunar house. However, this long and tortuous Bill will make a bad system worse. 
<P>
The Minister talked about "abuse", which is his favourite word, in the same way in which "prudence" is the Chancellor's. He and I spent a few years serving on the Select Committee on the Treasury before he went on to greater things and I began to languish in my humble position. Where we hand out public money, we have abuse. There is no greater arena for abuse than that of tax avoidance and offshore tax shelters. The sum of money abusively diverted by that industry far outweighs the sum that even the most assiduous bogus asylum seekers can milk from the system, but we do not threaten willy-nilly the civil liberties and human rights of fat cat City accountants and big firms that use such measures. They bring about as much abuse as bogus asylum seekers in terms of losing the taxpayer money, but have not been demonised in the same way. One of my criticisms of the Government concerns the rhetoric that they constantly use about abusive claims, even in the way in which they have justified the content of the Bill. The demonisation of asylum seekers is unnecessary. 
<P>
Amazingly, it was left to the Kent police to point out that some of the coverage of asylum seekers in Kent newspapers was an incitement to racial hatred. Where were Ministers when the papers peddled that? Why was the matter left to the Kent police? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend may not know that I complained to the Press Complaints Commission about that harsh treatment of asylum seekers. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I take that specific remark back, but my point remains that much of the rhetoric used by Ministers feeds the climate of demonising asylum seekers. 
<P>
The Minister mentioned the Labour Government's record on race relations to decry any attempt to describe any of the Bill's provisions as either intentionally or uninentionally racist. However, I continue to find one aspect of the Bill baffling. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has gained great credit, particularly in the ethnic minority community, for his brave stand on race and his principled decision to go ahead with the Lawrence inquiry and to push through the Macpherson recommendations. What I find baffling is how the Home Secretary can have a general policy on race that tends in one direction, yet a policy on immigration and asylum that tends in quite another. 
<P>
There is no doubt that many of the Bill's provisions--it fails to eliminate the old section 8 policy on employment rights--will, at the very least, facilitate discrimination based on race. It is regrettable that the Government should seek to mar their overall good record on race by a Bill that has the potential to feed acts of racial discrimination. 
<P>
I have a final general point before I go on to deal with the time limit. Apart from going on about abuse, the Minister loves to talk about the pull factor of benefit. However, Ministers overestimate the pull factor of benefits and fail to give enough emphasis to the push factor of the economic, political and military conditions from which people are escaping. Punitive and inadequate as the support arrangements are, they will not be accompanied by any palpable lessening of the flow of asylum seekers. 
<P>
My concern is partly practical. Whatever Ministers think, the proposals will not choke off the flow of asylum seekers. They will simply result in a bad system being made even more chaotic and in asylum seekers and would--be asylum seekers being placed in even more disadvantaged and socially excluded conditions. What is the point of the Government talking about fighting social exclusion, when the Bill will put in place a framework of social exclusion for a particular group of people--including, as I said earlier, children? 
<P>
I move on to the policy on time limits. I hear colleagues talking about two months, but let us remember where the Home Office stands on this. The Home Office White Paper said that by April 2001 the backlog of initial decisions will be reduced to frictional level. It said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"most initial decisions will he made within two months of receipt and. .  . most appeals will be heard within four months."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have already said that I have no confidence in that. It went on to say: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"these targets reflect average process times and the Government expects many cases will be dealt with more quickly".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Several organisations that deal with asylum seekers on a day-to-day basis including the Refugee Council and the ILPA--are deeply concerned that those targets will not be reached. 
<P>
According to the Home Office's own statistics, the backlog of outstanding initial decisions increased by 13,000 during 1998--under a Labour Government--and by a further 10,000 in the first three months of 1999 alone. The Minister does not have to persuade the Committee--he already has the votes that he needs--but how does he expect to persuade the world that he can reduce such a backlog? The total number of asylum applications waiting for initial decisions stands at 74,405. At the end of last year, an asylum seeker had to wait on average-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to stop the hon. Lady, but the amendments are about the difference between vouchers and cash, not the general issue of asylum seekers. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Maxton. However, I am arguing that the voucher system is unacceptable because it will apply not for a short period, as the Minister argues, but for a long time. You will be aware, Mr. Maxton, that I am reluctant to disbelieve one of my own Ministers, which is why I am obliged to explain why I do not believe that the Government will meet their time limit. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Briefly, as the hon. Lady has already done that. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Asylum seekers currently wait 17 months, but the Minister asks us to believe that, within a year, he will bring that waiting time down to two months. That is not credible. 
<P>
The Government accept that levels of productivity in IND are inadequate, but blame staff relocations and the fact that there are 200,000 files. However, they say that the normal level of productivity will be resumed. However, only 1,850 asylum seeker decisions were taken in March 1999, compared with 3,070 decisions made in March 1998. Therefore, there is no evidence to show that Ministers have been able to increase productivity. Even if productivity levels at the beginning of 1998 were resumed, that would only bring us back to the point at which the backlog was rising by a 1,000 a month. 
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I take seriously your strictures to be brief, Mr. Maxton. However, the Government, far from bringing down the backlog, have seen it rise. Even if the figures do not represent the actual size of the backlog, the likelihood of reducing decision times to two months seems remote. With the backlog continuing to rise, that likelihood seems remoter still. 
<P>
Interest groups, such as the Refugee Council, agree about that, as does the conservative--and possibly even Conservative organisation--the Public and Commercial Services Union. The PCSU, in its response to the White Paper, states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it remains sceptical that the (Caseworking) programme will deliver the efficiencies intended".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not believe the Minister's targets, and I do not understand how he can believe in them. Those officials who are saying "Yes, Minister,"--to use the immortal phrase--"we can do it in two months instead of 17" are also advising on other matters. 
<P>
I do not believe that the Minister can show a scrap of evidence to prove that the waiting period can be brought down from 17 to two months. In the absence of such evidence, it is hard to have confidence in the times that are talked about. It is totally unacceptable for people to languish on vouchers and be given only £l a day for an indefinite period.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased to have sparked off a lively debate with my amendment. I was particularly interested to hear the Hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. She demonstrates that she has certainly not changed her ideas, even though she has changed sides in terms of the structure of the Committee and the House. She does not seem to be corrupted by the prospect of the high office which surely awaits her. With those words, she must be done for. 
<P>
The Minister's contribution excited some interest and ranged widely over the Bill's fundamental aspects. He gave scope for a possible solution, which, I believe, lies in the processing time. 
<P>
However, I shall return to the matter of voucher versus cash. Section 4.16 of "Asylum Seekers Support" sets out the criteria that the provision of support must meet. It states that it must be simple to use by the asylum seeker and retailer, secure, as flexible in use as is possible, and have minimum administrative overheads. 
<P>
During the dinner break, I tried to make a mock-up voucher and came up with a £10 note, which would be simple and flexible for asylum seekers and retailers to use. Everyone is familiar with it and it is certainly secure, as it has a strip of metal and watermark that make it difficult to copy. Indeed, it is so secure that I will put the one that I am holding back in my pocket. We have already negotiated a system in which supermarkets will accept such tender in return for goods and which has minimal administrative overheads. I obtained my £10 note from a machine--automatically and at very little cost to the Government. I am sure that a similar system could be devised, perhaps using a Giro cheque or another tried and tested method, to distribute them to asylum seekers with the minimum possible cost. I have here-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am advised that exhibits are not allowed to be used and that they may be confiscated by the Chair. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Perhaps I should paint a word picture of a £10 note and ask why the Government intend to go to the trouble of reinventing cash in order to distribute money to asylum seekers so that they can provide themselves with the basics of life. The Minister described the current system as localised and shambolic. I suggest that what the Minister intends as a replacement is nationalised and shambolic. I do not see how the asylum seekers directorate can improve on a fundamentally flawed system. 
<P>
The Minister referred to racist thugs at supermarket checkouts, but Mr. Gilroy of Kent county council made the critical point that, if refugees have vouchers, people will believe that they--the refugees--are getting something for nothing. Although we believe that refugees may be disadvantaged by having to use vouchers, the ordinary citizen who sees those vouchers 1341 1342 will say, "Hang on a minute; that is different. You have something special." If they had cash--£5 and £10 notes--no one would notice. They would slip through the checkouts unnoticed, people being no wiser about their status. That distinction is crucial. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is hopelessly naive. I represent a Kent constituency with a high number of refugees; it is not the fact that they shop with vouchers that separates them from the rest of the community; it is the fact that they are recognisable as refugees. It is nothing to do with the vouchers; they would be recognised as refugees even if they had £10 notes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I was simply citing the views of the director of social services in Kent, who felt that vouchers contributed to the problem. I take his words at face value. However, I accept that the use of vouchers is not the only distinguishing characteristic. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I have not seen the director of Kent social services in our local supermarket. I see lots of refugees there; I assure the hon. Gentleman that what I say is true. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We do not want to go too far down that road, but the director was given the information by Ms Askew, who is intimately involved with asylum seekers. Mr. Gilroy cited Ms Askew's evidence. It is a combined Kent county council view. I am interested to hear that the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) does not agree that that is a fundamental problem. I agree with the experts who work in the Kent social services department, and I believe that the information is useful to the Committee. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister can justify the provisions of clause 75(3). The Government may wish to proceed with a barmy system of vouchers--to reinvent money, create a new currency and distribute it to asylum seekers in a costly way--but they do not need subsection (3) to achieve it. They can introduce a voucher system without mandating it in the Bill. Indeed, they have given themselves discretionary powers in many other parts of the Bill. 
<P>
Whenever I try to argue for a framework or regulations that would bind the Secretary of State, the Minister says that we should not do that, but should give him discretion. Yet in this crucial area, the Secretary of State is denying himself discretion to allow any balance of cash and vouchers that he wished. There may come a time when a different balance is required, yet subsection (3) constrains the Secretary of State so that he cannot deliver that support except with a barmy voucher system. I hope that the Minister can justify the necessity to constrain himself in that matter when he has rejected every other helpful suggestion of mine to place constraints on the Secretary of State. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The balance between cash and non-cash support will be examined during the consultation period. The provisions in subsection (3) ensure that the voucher policy is not challenged by judicial review. We include that principle in the Bill because it is important, but in the interests of achieving balance we will examine several issues, including some raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington about the amount of cash that individuals seek in particular circumstances, and will listen--as we have throughout the Bill--to the views that people have expressed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was a more conciliatory response from the the Minister, but as I continue to oppose the system at least in principle, I shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 363, in page 47, line 17, leave out "may" and insert "need".

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 862, in page 47, line 44, leave out "may disregard" and insert "must have regard to". 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to an amendment that the Opposition regard as important. I hope that it will not spoil my chances of getting concessions from the Government if I say that it is not by default that I shall not make the case on Lunar house for the previous Government and the present Conservative party, but because it is not fruitful to explore every path. I am willing to make that case and I give the Minister notice that if he continues with the line that the situation at Lunar house is a shambles and that it is all the fault of the previous Government, I will do so. However, in view of the lateness of the hour, I hope that I can avoid it. 
<P>
Having got that off my chest, I shall appeal to the Minister's better nature. I hope that he will be conciliatory towards the amendment. Although he has been in a conciliatory mood this evening, concessions have been few and far between; there has been nothing that one could call a concession on a point of substance. However, we live in hope and we put forward the amendment because it would make the Bill more workable and is in the interests of asylum seekers. Among other matters, clause 76 deals with the factors to which the Secretary of State must and must not have regard in providing asylum support. What is said about the preferences of asylum seekers is interesting. We are told that the Secretary of State 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may not have regard to-- (a) any preference that the supported person or his dependants (if any) may have as to the locality in which accommodation is to be provided".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
11.30 pm 
<P>
Let us be clear about that important provision. If it is not amended the Secretary of State will be forbidden to take into account the preferences of asylum seekers. An asylum seeker from, say, Kosovo who says, "I want, if at all possible, to be accommodated in Leeds because people from my village and members of my extended family are living there", will be told, "We are sorry, but we are forbidden by law to pay any attention to where you want to live." Accommodation might be available in Leeds, but also in Aberdeen or Southampton. He might well be sent to Aberdeen, Southampton or anywhere else where accommodation is available because that is where the system dictates he should go. He may be sent to one of the cluster areas where, in the words of the asylum support document: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is already a multi-ethnic population or infrastructure able to assist asylum seekers".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There appears to be no guarantee, however, that the population will be of his ethnic or national origins. The White Paper speaks only of placements taking account of the value of linking to existing communities "where possible". Even if asylum seekers are linked to people of their national or ethnic origins, if Kosovans are located with other Kosovans, they may well be allocated away from their families and friends. 
<P>
Amendment No. 363 would serve the purposes of the new system as well as the provision in the Bill at present. It also would be more humane in allowing preferences to be taken into account. It says that preferences need not be taken into account as opposed to may not be taken into account. That means that preferences could be expressed but at the end of the day they need not be taken into account. They would not override everything else in the system. An asylum seeker could not pick and choose where he went. 
<P>
If the Kosovan asylum seeker wanted to go to Leeds but there was no accommodation left in Leeds, he could not go there. But he could be listened to. If there was accommodation in Leeds, he might be able to go there. The amendment may enable the dispersal system to work rather better than it would under the present provisions. It would be less susceptible to an ECHR challenge. As matters stand, the ILPA says of the clause: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The breaches of ECHR Article 8 which this will cause will be all the more grave because of the vulnerability of the persons upon whom they will be inflicted."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment may reduce the risk of asylum seekers drifting away from the accommodation that they have been allocated in order to be nearer family and friends. 
<P>
From the start, I have been puzzled about why the Government have framed the legislation in this way. They are putting themselves and asylum seekers into a straitjacket. I cannot see why they want to tilt the system so much against asylum seekers in this regard when it may not be in the interests of the workability of the Bill to do so. When I put that point to Nick Hardwick of the Refugee Council, he said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I agree with that point absolutely. I think that sometimes the Home Office cannot work out whether the punitive bit of the Bill is simply the dispersal and the cashless system or whether it needs to make life unpleasant for people on top of that."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 16 March 1999; c. 113.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The memorandum of evidence contains evidence from the Chartered Institute of Housing, a well respected body in this field. It also supports the amendment and feels that the system would work better if there were more flexibility. I cannot think why the Government are taking this course. It is clearly against the interests of asylum seekers, but it is also against the Government's interests. 
<P>
I doubt whether the earth would open or the heavens come tumbling down if the Government just made this concession. It would still be consistent with what they are trying to do and would not be giving anything away, but it would introduce a little more flexibility into the system, it might avoid hardship in some circumstances, and that asylum seekers, were listened to even if ultimately their preferences and wishes could not be met. 
<P>
Amendment No. 365 is another important amendment arising from an important subject that the Committee has considered. It would qualify the prohibition on taking account of asylum seekers' preferences if they were victims of torture. With the amendment, those preferences could be taken into account if there are 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reasonable grounds for believing that the supported person or his dependants have been the victims of torture and that it is in the interests of his or their health to be in proximity to specialised services related to the treatment of victims of torture."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Its aim is to enable victims of torture to have access to the help that they need. Before we began our Committee sittings, we heard moving evidence from Alison Harvey of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, who outlined her concerns about the proposed system of dispersal. 
<P>
It would be useful to consider also the supplementary evidence that the foundation gave in the memorandum of evidence. It includes case studies that illustrate some of the problems of current dispersal which the foundation feared would be a feature of the new system. One such study involved a patient from the Central African Republic who was receiving care and treatment from the foundation, and support from friends, who was dispersed to Newcastle under the system. He was close to suicide in that city, and on the basis of the profound effects of displacement on him, the foundation was eventually able to have him rehoused in London. Another case involved a 21-year-old patient who witnessed atrocities in Afghanistan. He was sought by the authorities and his family disappeared. He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. He entered the United Kingdom in a lorry  1345 1346 and found himself in Coventry, where he ended up in a hostel with homeless people who suffered from mental problems. He came to London and was put in touch with the foundation. He began to receive help but, eventually, there was nowhere for him to live. He applied to the local authority for help and was given the choice of dispersal to Ramsgate or going back to Coventry. There were a number of such cases. I will not go into all of them, but they illustrate just some of the problems that confront people who work at the foundation caring for victims of torture when dispersal is implemented insensitively. 
<P>
I know that the Minister has taken a serious interest in this matter, and I welcome that. I know also that he believes that a support structure should be developed outside London and that the only question is how to bring that about. I urge him to listen to the foundation's views on the subject. The Government must recognise that it will not be easy for the foundation to do its work as well as it would wish. Many people on whom they draw for specialised services are in specific areas, especially London. As well as clinicians they include interpreters, who themselves need support because of the detail of some of the stories that they hear. There are also clinicians in London who are experienced in working with survivors of torture. 
<P>
The foundation said in evidence that if it were a question of rolling out services across the country, that would take a long time. It is fair to say that that was an instance of the foundation having to adapt itself to a situation that had been forced upon it. Meanwhile, the foundation is concerned about how dispersal works in practice and how it will work in future, and we should pay attention to that concern. 
<P>
I was slightly worried to discover that the issue of torture victims is barely mentioned in the first draft of the process manual for the asylum support system. The only information given is that assistants--those who will process asylum seekers' needs--might tell an asylum seeker about available specialist services such as the medical foundation. There is no indication that the Government might cater for, or take account of, the special needs of torture victims. The message is emphatic. The process manual states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the claimant will have no choice about the location in which he or she is accommodated."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is fairly modest and would be a small step towards making the system more compatible with the needs of torture victims and getting the care to them that they clearly need. 
<P>
The medical foundation's evidence was eye opening; I have not seen its like before. It was very moving and it put a new complexion on matters. We understand the constraints of the system and the problems that Governments must face, but will the Minister listen to the foundation and make concessions to enable the system to be more compatible with its work and allow asylum seekers to express a preference? The system might then work much better than, we fear, it will do.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall speak to amendment Nos. 860 and 862. I also wish to add my support for the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who raised some important points that I hope will be taken into account. 
<P>
My amendments are robust. Amendment No. 860 would remove the offending provision under clause 76(2)(a). Amendment No. 862 would change the balance and require the Secretary of State to have regard to preferences rather than allow him to disregard them as stated in the Bill. The present provisions pose the serious risk of being in breach of article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which deals with the right to private and family life. We have often said that many asylum seekers are young, single males. Article 8 refers also to links in the community, which would cover both the fact that a young, single male should be able to form such links and develop his own family and the more obvious right to be with one's immediate family in this country. 
<P>
The Government have been at huge pains throughout the Bill to make it judicial review proof, and the subsection seems to be directed entirely towards that end. They have attempted to close down every possible avenue to judicial review, but have not paid similar attention to making the Bill compliant with the spirit of human rights obligations. Subsection (2)(a), under which the Home Secretary may not have regard to any preference, tips the balance in the wrong direction. 
<P>
If the Minister is about to mention the inability to express a preference under the homeless legislation, I refer him to our earlier debate on the definition of suitability of accommodation. When someone presents himself as homeless, an interview takes place and various factors are taken into account before one choice of accommodation is offered. A body of case law under the housing legislation incorporates all sorts of factors before the offer of accommodation is made. 
<P>
Given the relatively weak definition of adequate accommodation and additional strictures such as "may not have regard to preference", the one choice of accommodation that will he offered need not include those other factors. The Minister has said that he would like to include them but, when the various measures in the clause are taken together, our fear is that he may not be able to do so. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister can respond reasonably warmly to the amendments and elaborate a little on factors such as proximity, spiritual communities, and ethnic and language communities. How does he expect them to be taken into account before the offer of accommodation is made, so that there is genuine justice and respect, especially under article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which places a duty on the Government. I hope that the Government will do that out of respect for the dignity of the individual, whether or not the claim is subsequently proved to be well founded. 
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I understand that the hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Hallam think that the clause is harsh, but it is not quite all that it appears to be. The Government do not intend that the Secretary of State should be able to take any account of the preference expressed by the asylum seeker about the location of accommodation, because that would be a recipe for constant judicial review and would cause arguments about the extent to which preferences must be taken into account. 
<P>

<P>
It would be only a short step from allowing the Secretary of State to take account of asylum seekers' preferences to a challenge that requires the Secretary of State to commission accommodation only in areas that reflect asylum seekers' preferences. That would end up with them all being located in London. 
<P>
The legal advice is very strong that we need to make it clear in the Bill that those preferences will not be taken into account. However, as I have said, circumstances could be taken into account, which is a different matter. The Government will be able to take into account the circumstances that asylum seekers find themselves in and make a decision based on them. We cannot take account of the preferences, but we can choose to take into account certain circumstances. That complies with our ECHR obligations. 
<P>
The Government's policy is based on moving asylum seekers and their dependents away from London and the south east, dispersing them to other parts of the country. There are three reasons for that. First, temporary accommodation in London and the south east is under excessive pressure because of the concentration of asylum seekers there. That, in turn, affects the ability of many councils in London and the south east to discharge their statutory duties to the homeless families in their own locality. 
<P>
Secondly, real asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution in their own countries will not mind being accommodated outside London, pending the resolution of their asylum claims, so long as they have food, shelter and protection. Economic migrants seem to want the state to provide them with accommodation in London, in particular, where--to be blunt--they can be tourists or work illegally, which is easier to do there. 
<P>
Finally, accommodation is much cheaper, more easily available and often of higher quality outside the south east. That contrasts with high cost and comparative scarcity in the capital, where the quality of accommodation is often not so good as that which can be provided for asylum seekers in the provinces at a similar price. In addition, it is eminently sensible to use the spare housing stock within the country as a whole, so that it does not fall further into decay. 
<P>
We shall not, therefore, take into account preferences, but, as I have said, we can take into account circumstances. For example, if an asylum seeker's family or members of an ethnic group live in an area in which the necessary support is available, we would want to weigh carefully the value of placing the asylum seeker in that area. I cannot give an absolute guarantee that we will be able to do that in every case, but we want to create cluster areas. 
<P>
In deciding where an asylum seeker will be located, the Home Office's policy will be to ensure that we locate people in areas where support exists, where other people from their ethnic minority live, and where they can be provided with the appropriate language, cultural and educational facilities and medical attention. Support may not always be available in the area that is most suitable. We shall certainly take into account the need to weigh carefully the circumstances of the case in devising the desk instructions for case workers in the new asylum support directory. 
<P>
Under amendment No. 365, the Secretary of State would be allowed to take into account any preference expressed by the asylum seeker about the location of accommodation provided that there is reason to believe that the asylum seeker or his dependents have been victims of torture. The amendment is unnecessary. Although the Secretary of State will not take into account preferences about the location of accommodation under the scheme, if there is a specific reason why a person should go to a particular location, for example, because of facilities that he requires or a health need--which may apply to torture victims--that will be borne in mind before a decision is taken about the location of his accommodation. 
<P>
We do not want to have to consider people's preferences about how support is given, as suggested in amendment No. 862, when the period for which they will be supported will, we hope, be relatively short. Many forms of temporary accommodation may not be suitable for long-term occupation, such as hostels with shared facilities, but would be eminently suitable for single asylum seekers whose claims may be settled in two months. We certainly intend them to be settled in six months. 
<P>
The accommodation must meet some basic needs of suitability, which we shall set. The type of accommodation offered to asylum seekers will depend on their individual needs or those of their dependents and the type of accommodation available. We must bear in mind that local people accommodated under the homelessness legislation have no choice about how that assistance is delivered, and might be surprised to find that asylum seekers, many of whose claims would be shown to be unfounded, were given such a choice. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere made some important points about the medical foundation. He shares my anxiety about the issues involved as well as my respect for the organisation. It is a London-based organisation that does an enormously good job. In making decisions about torture victims, we pay great heed to any report that it provides. Many cases have been resolved quickly as a result of reports from the medical foundation. The difficulty with the medical foundation is that, although it does good work where it can, its needs to be entended, It has insufficient capacity in London to provide medical help for victims of torture, and there is certainly insufficient capacity in the provinces. That is a serious problem that we need to tackle. We must consider how to build the capacity of the medical profession, whether through the foundation or in other ways, to help victims of torture both in the provinces and in London. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether I would undertake to listen to the foundation's views, and I shall. I cannot always agree with it, and I cannot always ensure that it will receive everything that it wants in legislation, but I have a great deal of respect for its views and its statements about individual cases and its difficulties. 1349 1350 
<P>
We cannot take into account a person's preferences, but we can take into account his circumstances, one of which may be that he is a victim of torture, which may be relevant to a decision about where he is accommodated. Some accommodation will be available in London. I give no undertakings, but I have already told the medical foundation that I shall be sympathetic to its requests. The claims of people claiming to be victims pf torture deserve a great deal of attention. However, both I and the medical foundation do not want the Government to say that any person claiming to be a victim of torture should be accomodated in London. That would probably mean that lots of people who were not victims of torture might make unfounded claims to being victims of torture. That would not be in anyone's interest. I am expressing myself carefully, but what I am saying is that the Secretary of State can consider a torture victim's circumstances without giving an undertaking that preferences will always be met. I have told the medical foundation that I shall be sympathetic to its requests about particular individuals and shall look at those cases. 
<P>
When dealing with cases of victims of torture, the priority must be to see there is evidence of such torture. If so, a medical report must be produced quickly to ascertain whether the person is a genuine refugee under the 1951 convention or ECHR provisions, so that the benefits system can be accessed in the normal way, or they can seek work, if that is appropriate. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere rightly raised some difficult and serious issues. The Government are not dogmatic about them. We are very much in listening mode about the medical foundation, and we want to respond as best we can to the circumstances that torture victims present. I hope that with those reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his courteous and careful response. I am not entirely convinced by his arguments on the issue of expressing preference. I listened carefully to what he said about the proposal being made for legal reasons and about having been given good legal advice that he cannot go against. However, that seemed somewhat at odds with what he said earlier. 
<P>
The Minister said that he wants to avoid making decisions that are capable of judicial review, yet earlier,  he chose a subjective as opposed to an objective form of test. The subjective form of the test--the Secretary of State's opinion--is far more susceptible to judicial review than our amendment--which is an objective test--would be. 
<P>
I shall consider the matter carefully, but the advice that we have from the ILPA is that there is a grave risk of the test being vulnerable to a challenge on ECHR grounds. We do not want to get into that position. That is the expert opinion of the ILPA, which I should have thought is well placed to form a view. 
<P>
I listened to what the Minister said about taking circumstances into account. That may be so, but the one thing that cannot be taken into account is any expression of preference because that is statutorily forbidden. There is no question of preferences being asked for or taken into account at any stage. I heard what the Minister said about sending people to cluster areas where they may get support from ethnic minorities. That may be so, but even if they have the good fortune to go to an area where their own nationals are or there are people from their own ethnic minority, they may not be their friends or members of their family. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Again we are having a discussion about a definition, which is exactly what the Committee should be doing, in deciding between preference and circumstance. An individual might say, "I would like to go to Bedford because my friends and family are there." The Secretary of State could take the point about his friends and family being there into account, but not the fact that the person would like to go there. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a good point. I want to consider carefully all the points that the Minister has made. These are serious matters and after careful consideration, I may want to return to them on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
