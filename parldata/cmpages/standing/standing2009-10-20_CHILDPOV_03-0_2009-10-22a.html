<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000185"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May I remind Members and witnesses that we are
bound by the Standing Orders and the deadline agreed on Tuesday? That
means that this morning&#146;s sitting must end at 10.25 am. I hope
that I do not have to interrupt Members or witnesses in the middle of a
sentence, but if I need to I will have to do so. We will now hear
evidence from Charlotte Pickles, Edna Speed and Reverend Paul Nicolson.
Welcome to our meeting at this early hour of the morning. Could you
please introduce yourselves and tell us something about your
organisation? Can we start with Reverend
Nicolson?</div><a name="09102225000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> We started the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust in
the 1990s as a direct result of working with very vulnerable people who
could not pay their poll tax. We found that not only were they not able
to pay the poll tax, but they were in trouble with rent and fines. We
needed to deal with those as well. We came to the conclusion that the
reason they could not pay their poll tax was that they did not have
enough income. Therefore, Professor Jonathan Bradshaw and I, as
directors of the Family Budget Unit, approached the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation and it turned us down. I found that Lord Sainsbury had just
moved into my parish, in Turville, and was calling himself Lord
Sainsbury of Turville. Turville is where I had the pleasure of giving
permission for the filming of &#147;The Vicar of Dibley&#148;. I
was the real vicar of Dibley for seven years, which I thoroughly
enjoyed. Sainsbury&#146;s came up with a very substantial donation,
as did Barclays, Barnardo&#146;s and some private
donors.</div>
<a name="09102225000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
commissioned the Family Budget Unit. We found that the unemployment
benefits being taxed were already &#163;40 below what was needed, so
there was really serious poverty. We went on from there. We worked as
volunteers. I spent 10 years helping people fill in their means
statements for the magistrates in Wycombe magistrates court, as a
McKenzie Friend.</div>
<a name="09102225000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">We at last
got to a point where people began to notice that we might be doing
something useful and raised substantial sums of money. We now have two
full-time lawyers. We have an administrator and an office courtesy of
the Duke of Westminster in Ebury street. I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>some embarrassment in fighting poverty with the Maserati outside the
door, not to mention the Bentley. However, there is a very nice grant
to help us pay the rent and it is a very convenient place. We work
hands-on with the most vulnerable. We only take those below the radar;
we do not take mortgage or credit card debt cases. We deal with the
most
poor.</div><a name="09102225000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I work for the Centre for Social Justice. We
were set up in 2004 by Iain Duncan Smith. Our focus is poverty and
social exclusion. We produce policy focused on addressing those things.
We also have an alliance of around 200 different grassroots charities,
community organisations and people working with those who live in
acutely deprived communities, who face the various different challenges
of living in poverty and who are excluded from the mainstream. Our
focus is on tackling the causes of poverty, and how and why families
and individuals end up in those situations.</div>
<a name="09102225000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> I am the founder and chair of an organisation
called Save the Family. I have been working at very close quarters with
the organisation for 34 years. It came out of my school; I was a head
teacher. For my sins, I have spent all my working life in desperately
deprived areas. The whole thing is rooted in the poverty of a child.
The organisation provides accommodation for homeless British families
with absolutely necessary services to turn those families around. We
are the largest provider of homeless accommodation for families in the
whole of the British isles and, as I speak, we are overwhelmed with
referrals.</div>
<a name="09102225000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would just
like to point out that not one of our children&#151;and it is a
growing group&#151;ever appear on the radar. It is not absolute
poverty; it is abject poverty. I was introduced to the Bill through
Theresa May&#146;s committee. I joined it in the summer and all I can
say is that I am very saddened to come in at such a late time, because
after 34 years of smelling, touching, seeing&#151;day in, day
out&#151;abject child poverty in this country, I believe we have a
lot to contribute. Thank you for this
opportunity.</div>
<a name="09102225000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000186"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The first question is from Steve
Webb.</div><a name="09102225000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">160
1</b><a name="09102225000187"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): What some of us would like to do,
because you have kindly provided evidence, is follow through on some of
the questions you have asked relating to the Bill. I will start with
Charlotte and the Centre for Social Justice. Your &#147;Dynamic
Benefits&#148; report is very helpful. We are very grateful and have
some interesting ideas about earnings disregards and so on. You have a
set of proposals that cost &#163;2 billion or &#163;3
billion but your argument is that over the long term you will get that
money back, as 600,000 people will find jobs because you have removed
barriers to work. That is my understanding. Can you clarify for us
whether your model says that there would be 600,000 more jobs for those
people to go into, or would those 600,000 people take jobs that other
people would otherwise have had? Have you costed in the benefits that
you would then have to pay to those 600,000 who would not be in
work?</div>
<a name="09102225000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> The report is not a report on job creation,
if that is what you mean. It is about removing the barriers for people
who are not moving into work at the moment. Obviously, we are in a
recession and there are limited jobs available, but we will come out of
that. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>The recommendations in &#147;Dynamic Benefits&#148; are focused on
us coming out of the recession, and the people who are currently
workless will be able to move from that position. Our focus is on
getting workless households into paid employment. Our
&#147;Breakthrough Britain&#148; report on economic dependency and
worklessness made recommendations around welfare to work programmes and
how you can additionally provide support and ensure that those people
moving into work are sustained in
work.</div>
<a name="09102225000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000188"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> So in terms of the Committee assessing the value of
the proposals&#151;we could all spend &#163;2 billion or
&#163;3 billion making the benefits system better&#151;can I just
be clear that the assumption that you get that money back takes no
account of the fact that the people you think would be able to get into
work would displace another set of people to whom you then pay benefit?
Have you allowed for that in your costings?</div>
<a name="09102225000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I am not aware of that being in the
costings. Although we are currently in a recession, we know that over
the past decade there have been around 5.4 million people completely
out of work and dependent on benefits in a boom time when jobs were
available. Our point is that we are going to come out of the recession
and there will be jobs available. At the moment we have a lot of people
who are not necessarily British workers taking jobs. Removing some of
the barriers and supporting people who perhaps have not been in work
for a very long time, which is often the case, will not only provide
better lives for those families, and indeed the children who live in
such families, but be much better for Britain. Our costings
are probably somewhat conservative in taking into account all the
different savings that could accrue down the line&#151;for instance,
the benefit of having someone moving into
work.</div>
<a name="09102225000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000189"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I have just one other question. One of your
arguments for your scheme is that it is much simpler than what
currently goes on, and you argue that you take the Inland Revenue out
of the assessment process. You also propose delivering the benefits
that you have invented through the pay packet, through a tax code-type
thing. A big problem with tax and benefit reform is that you have
benefits based on households and taxes based on individuals. If you
have a couple where both partners are working and one gets the
household&#146;s tax credits, how would you keep tabs on both
partners? If I were the higher earner, my spouse&#146;s tax credits
would have to be cut through their pay packet. How would the
administration of that work?</div>
<a name="09102225000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I am sorry&#151;I did not work in that
much detail on the report, so I cannot answer that
question.</div>
<a name="09102225000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><a name="09102225000190"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): Although
you did not work on this particular paper, is the reason that you did
not include the idea of a static supply of jobs, that we are part of
the European Union? There were jobs that sucked in foreign workers, for
instance, because of the benefit blocks that disincentivise people here
who would like to work and to get out of poverty but find that doing so
is not to the economic benefit of their family.</div>
<a name="09102225000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> Yes, that is very much the case. We looked
in great detail at both the participation and marginal tax rates and
the huge disincentive that that provides, particularly for those who
are completely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>workless. Once you have added on the cost of travel and losing free
school meals and other such passported benefits, in some cases you can
be worse off moving into work than being on benefits. If we do not
tackle those disincentives, we will not be able to move people into
work. As I said, we know there are social benefits for adults and
children living in a working household as opposed to a workless
one.</div><a name="09102225000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><a name="09102225000191"></a><b class="B">John
Barrett</b> (Edinburgh, West) (LD): You mentioned, Reverend
Nicolson, some very close, first-hand examples of people living in
poverty. We talk about legislation here. Do you think that that will be
effective as a way of tackling poverty? Are there not really issues
like jobs, education and other issues? Could you give us your thoughts
on how legislation might deliver? Out there, those who are actually in
poverty, do you think that they believe that legislation is the answer,
or is it something else? Could I ask you to speak from your own
experience?</div><a name="09102225000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> First of all, I shall make a comment
on what has been said. We have read that report and, broadly speaking,
welcome it. I think that there are specific things in it that will be
extremely valuable: increasing disregards, reducing the rate of
withdrawal, abolishing the couple penalty and, indeed, having one place
where claimants can get all benefits, which was being said by the local
authorities yesterday. All these steps forward would be very good
things.</div><a name="09102225000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not so sure about the suggestions about two benefits; we think that
needs a lot more examination. We are very pleased that at least an
attempt has been made to calculate the savings, because we asked the
Treasury if it could tell us what estimate had been made of savings
from reducing child or any other poverty and it said that it did not do
that. However, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has, and it is &#163;25
billion, but it does not include adults of working age or pensioners.
Savings have been calculated at &#163;25 billion, which includes
&#163;17 billion in costs. To have that sort of figure available does
help the publicity, partly answering your
question.</div><a name="09102225000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that there are two poverty thresholds. There is the 60 per cent.
of the median poverty threshold and there is the level of statutory
minimum incomes. Unless the policy increases the level of statutory
minimum incomes, be they unemployment benefits, the national minimum
wage or the state pension, the policy is not going to succeed. We know
perfectly well that all the unemployment benefits are below the
Government&#146;s poverty threshold and that when people go into work
on the national minimum wage without holiday pay or sick pay they are
still very much in poverty&#151;it will depend so much on how the
local authorities manage the housing and council tax benefit transfer
from one to the other. We know that such people are in poverty because
of our experience with the living
wage.</div><a name="09102225000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been overtaken by megalomania since I retired. I am also trustee
of the Family Budget Unit, so I have had great joy in standing outside
KPMG and yelling at the top of my voice, &#147;Low Pay&#148;, with
200 cleaners replying vehemently, &#147;No way.&#148; We go in and
see the management of KPMG, who say, &#147;Look here, we are very
embarrassed, but not by your shouting. We have been telling our
employees that we&#146;re one of the best employers in the world and
you have told us that we are not.&#148; KPMG helped us by making the
business case for the living wage, and we are very glad to see that it
has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>now been taken on by the Department for Children, Schools and Families.
We cannot begin to understand why the cleaners in every other
Department are not also receiving it. Indeed, we have an amendment
suggesting that all local authorities should support it, just as the
Mayors of London have, because it was Ken Livingstone who required the
GLA to calculate the level of the living wage by using the research
that we used and raised the money for in the 1990s&#151;updated, and
triangulated with national statistics. It comes out now as
&#163;7.60, including the use of tax credits and all other benefits.
You have to be over &#163;10 to get in the blissful area of work
where you are actually out of the benefit system, which would be the
goal of everyone who has ever been on a
benefit.</div><a name="09102225000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a huge difference between &#163;7.60 and &#163;5.80. It means
that anyone on the national minimum wage without holiday pay or sick
pay is suffering. As I said, my answer to your question is that unless
you raise the statutory minimum incomes&#151;in work, out of work and
on pensions&#151;this target is not going to be
met.</div><a name="09102225000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> First, I would like to say that the name of
the Bill is not right. No child is in poverty&#151;it is the family
who are in poverty. That starts the whole focus. It is not a child in
isolation. Whatever model of family life we have today, it is the whole
family. That should focus into the reality of poverty.</div>
<a name="09102225000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have had
problems with legislation down the years because, and I have repeated
this over and over, I believe that among the people who write our Bills
there is a large perception and not reality. May I repeat that
please&#151;perception and not reality. Hence the Bill is so
restrictive and restricted. We have only talked today about money:
benefits, salaries and levels. That is very important. There has to be
a level of money coming into a home. However, sooner or later and
hopefully through Bills such as this, we will have to face the fact
that that is not the only
problem.</div><a name="09102225000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a growing number on benefits. Many of those who are on benefits
because of the recession do not want to be on those benefits. Hence
lifting them out of that is important. I am not an academic. I am a
practitioner. I am with people. I believe we need to look more closely
at the roots of poverty. I believe that there is soil that has never
been properly analysed and then brought back to Committee and looked
at. I am concerned because as I sit here today, I know that thousands
and thousands of children are in poverty. That is my campaign. My drive
is to lift them out of it.</div>
<a name="09102225000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge you,
if you would like to liaise with us, to meet with me and I will talk
you through my concern about the constriction of the Bill. It is not
broad enough. It has gone in on one level and I would love not just to
pull it apart&#151;I know it is too late and I know there is a
deadline&#151;but to see whether other things can be inserted into it
that would give a much broader look. I would say that today we are
setting the scene for the future. It could be that someone is back in
this room in 10 years&#146; time and my words have come true. I do
not want that to happen, but I believe that the Bill itself is too
restricted and
constrictive.</div><a name="09102225000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I would echo what has been said. Obviously
we need to look at the income levels and whether they are sufficient.
In our report we chose not  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>to look at that specifically. I would certainly support that. Just to
pick up on Edna&#146;s comments, our raison d&#146;être at
the CSJ is to look at the causes of poverty and it is vital that we do
not solely look at income as the issue around child poverty. For
example, we know that 1 million children live with alcohol-addicted
parents and a further 350,000 children have drug-addicted parents.
Giving more money to either of those categories is not going to bring
that child out of poverty. In addition we know that it will take a
great deal more than simply focusing on increasing benefits to break
the cycle of inter-generational poverty.</div>
<a name="09102225000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our fear
about the Bill is that because it has these specific income or material
deprivation-related targets and very little else it will skew the
policy process towards increasing benefits. We know that increasing
benefit dependency does not break the cycle of inter-generational
poverty. Indeed a child who grows up in a benefit-dependent household
is much more likely to be benefit dependent in their adulthood and so
will their children be and so it will carry on. It is important that we
look at much wider things such as family circumstances, emotional and
psychological poverty, relational poverty and poverty of
aspirations.</div><a name="09102225000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
study done in Canada showed that even if you eliminated child poverty,
you would see only a 10 per cent. reduction in the behavioural and
academic difficulties of the children involved in the study. If you
cannot get that right, then those children will grow up and most likely
live in poverty and have dysfunctional family units when they are
older.</div><a name="09102225000041"></a>

Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab):
Can I pick you up on something? I think everyone on the Committee
agrees that there is deep, multiple deprivation that we have to tackle
through different Government Departments. You just said that increasing
wages, benefit or whatever would not lift people out of poverty. That
is not right, is
it?</div><a name="09102225000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I said that if you give it to, for example,
a family where a child is living with an addicted parent, it is very
unlikely that the money is going to the child because we know it will
probably go towards the addiction. That was my specific
point.</div><a name="09102225000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000193"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> Okay, but I think it is important for the record
that it is clear that the definition of poverty&#151; families being
on 60 per cent. or below of median income; we accept that it is only
part of the whole story&#151;is addressed by tackling income. It
would be extremely unfortunate, and I hope you would agree, if we imply
that dealing with the issue of income would not help us to tackle
poverty, because I think it
would.</div><a name="09102225000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> Of course. I started my comments by
endorsing what the Reverend said about needing to address sheer income
levels. Of course we do. Our argument at the CSJ is that you can do
that but it is not necessarily going to help that child&#146;s
outcomes in later life. If our sole purpose is to raise someone above
that 60 per cent. median income threshold, giving them more money will
do that. Do I think it will necessarily make them better at school and
more engaged? Do I think they will be more relationally able? Do I
think they will be emotionally and psychologically more stable? Do I
think they will be able to create a stronger family life themselves? Do
I think they will get into work by doing so? No. I do agree that, of
course, you need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>address income levels but that cannot be the sole thing. Unfortunately,
the Bill is framed in such a way that we feel that the point of looking
at a wider perspective may be
lost.</div><a name="09102225000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000194"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> We could agree on the concept of it being necessary
but
insufficient.</div><a name="09102225000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><a name="09102225000195"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Those statements
slot quite neatly into the area that I wanted to probe as well, which
is to get our witnesses&#146; views on the extent to which the Bill
gets the balance right or wrong between alleviating symptoms and
dealing with causes&#151;exactly the area that you have been talking
about. I wonder whether you share a concern that the Bill as currently
written may not drive policy in a sensible direction. Edna, you said
earlier that it is too late. It is not. We have next week to try to
amend the Bill, then it goes through the Commons and the Lords,
notwithstanding the electoral arithmetic. So, all these comments can be
taken into account and Members can consider them when they
vote.</div><a name="09102225000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
question is, what are your thoughts on how we should change the Bill so
that we actually have to track progress on dealing with the causes of
poverty, some of which you have already mentioned? I do not know
whether you have any specific proposals. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation
produces a report card with 56 different indicators of
poverty, some of which the Government have made good progress on,
others of which are steady, others of which have got worse. The
Department used to produce such a report card up to 2007 and then
slightly bizarrely stopped. Do you think a report card like that would
be helpful in driving policy in a more sensible
direction?</div><a name="09102225000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> I am comforted that it is not too late. I have
travelled down from the north-west and I am glad to hear that. As an
organisation, we work not just in the limited field of homelessness. We
work across the very broken and divided communities, deep in the heart.
I visit them three times a week with all kinds of aid, from bedding to
tins to children&#146;s clothes. I believe that there has to be a
deeper look at those causes. If there has been a deeper look, maybe
what has been deduced is not balanced because out of it has come only
money. I absolutely endorse what Charlotte said. There are growing
bands in this country where children will not benefit by more benefits.
I will prove that to you if you
want.</div><a name="09102225000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000196"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Can you give us some examples? Charlotte gave us
some about
addiction.</div><a name="09102225000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> It is not linked to just drug addiction and
alcoholism&#151;it is deeper than that. It is generational, and it is
a whole culture of thinking. When you have benefit handouts, there is
something about that money that isn&#146;t quite like the earned
money. This is why I am all for getting people into jobs. There is the
idea of live for today, of &#147;I&#146;ve got the benefit, I can
have what I want&#148;, and then the benefit&#146;s gone and the
rest of the fortnight is spent in severe poverty. It is almost an
educative programme that we have to do. I do not like the word
&#147;programme&#148; because programmes have failed. Take Sure
Start. Sure Start never came on the radar for our families. If you said
Sure Start to them they&#146;d say, &#147;Sure what?&#148; They
wouldn&#146;t have a clue. In those Sure Start programmes there was
budgeting and child care, but they didn&#146;t access
them&#151;they didn&#146;t even relate to them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div><a name="09102225000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to be very creative in our thinking, and that is what we have done
in Save the Family. We are off the wall, if you like, at times, but we
find ways forward and we engage with them. Hence, we are probably the
most successful: 86 per cent. of our families are turned round for
ever. They go into jobs and university, and live in community. Please
look at us. We would love somebody to come and research us. Can we be a
pilot project? We have been going for 34 years. We are there.
We&#146;ve other sites to go
to.</div><a name="09102225000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
feel this very strongly, and ask you to listen, whether
or not you agree with me. I am coming from the deep dark
pain of the poverty of children, the poverty of not having the shoes or
the uniform and not having enough to eat, but also the poverty of
experience. If you will bear with me today, my drive in the last years
of this work is to be able to relate the realities to people, and I
will go anywhere and everywhere. I am not political on any front. I
thank the Centre for Social Justice for putting us on the radar, but we
are not political. I just want to tell you that this Bill does not
address the deep roots. You can bring in money, I am all for that
level&#151;don&#146;t ever think I&#146;m not&#151;but there is
going to be a widening, and a bigger margin or group than you will ever
know. Those children will not benefit, and I am saying that from
experience. I can give you statistics and examples. I could walk my
families in today. Along with jobs and with getting them into training,
it is a much bigger, more educative programme that is needed, lifting
them up. In this third generation, there is no idea of work and their
own expectations are at such a low
level.</div><a name="09102225000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the big drives that we&#146;ve got in Save the Family, is
&#147;Every mother, every father, you&#146;re gonna make
it&#148;. In this country today there are two sides to this. There is
the extraordinary weight of families on benefits and the awful social
problems, with the support of the courts and the probation service and
all that we have, but on the other side is the loss of that potential,
which hurts me deeply. There are people in university
today&#151;</div><a name="09102225000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000197"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am sorry to interrupt you, Edna, but we have a
lot of territory to cover this morning, so I ask all our witnesses to
try to be as succinct as
possible.</div><a name="09102225000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> I agree with everything that has been
said. I do want it to be understood that I think there is a very
serious problem that cannot be dealt with only through money. But I do
not want the necessity of having enough income to go by default. When
you look at the situation of single adults, of women aged anything from
18, on &#163;50.95 a week unemployment benefit, and when you look at
the Joseph Rowntree Foundation research into what is required to buy an
adequate diet&#151;&#163;45 a week&#151;there isn&#146;t much
left to buy anything else. Food is constantly competing with heating,
lighting and debts&#151;everything but rent and council
tax&#151;and there is a desperate need for social fund
loans.</div><a name="09102225000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
10 years, I helped people to fill in their means statements at the
magistrates court. They came into court with no money to pay their
fine. The reason was that the jobcentre had stopped their benefit
because they did not go to one interview&#151;that was usually the
reason; they did not have the money because it was stopped altogether.
When they got the money back, they had the &#163;60 loan they had
been given by the social services to be paid off at &#163;10 a week,
and &#163;5 to pay off 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>the fine. So from &#163;50, they were down to &#163;35. You cannot
live on that. So what do you do? You complain about the rise in the
level of crime and see all the young people in prison. You have to take
a look at this very much from a point of view of minimum income
standards.</div><a name="09102225000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joseph Rowntree Foundation&#146;s minimum income standard for a
single adult is &#163;144 a week. That includes a lot of things that
you, as a Government, might not want to select for benefits. But my
goodness, it gives you the necessary information if you are going to
select benefits from the necessary research on the ground. I am very
glad that you will be interviewing Donald Hirsch this afternoon, who
will give you the methodology on that, which is very thorough. We had a
slightly different methodology, but we are doing exactly the
same thing&#151;the &#163;1,000 that I raised in 1998&#151;to get
the job done. We found that the benefit was &#163;40 a week below
what was needed. Now it is much more below that particular level of
minimum income standard. We are keen that minimum income standards will
come on to the
scene.</div><a name="09102225000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000198"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Can I stop you there? What you said was very
useful; thank you very much for that. In America, as far as I am aware,
there are poverty standards based along the lines that you are talking
about, on what a nutritious diet costs for a family and multiply that
for different levels of family. I think they worked out that families
spend a third of their income on food, so they multiplied it by three
to get levels of income on which they judged people in poverty. Is that
the type of idea that you are talking
about?</div><a name="09102225000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> Absolutely. Indeed, it is all there. I
spelt it out in our submission to the Committee&#151;it is all there.
What we do not do in this country, which is done in the Nordic
countries, inevitably, but also in France,
Germany, Australia, New Zealand and the United States&#151;various
states in the US have ways of doing it&#151;is to research the
adequacy of statutory minimum incomes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000199"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Are you saying that once you have found that, the
benefit system will immediately have to kick in and rise to those
challenges?</div>
<a name="09102225000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> No. As you have in the Bill, you have
to take account of economic circumstances. I am saying that you have a
target of income for healthy living for the unemployed, the employed
and pensioners. It is right across all three. We do not have it in this
country, and I think it is profoundly dangerous to leave unemployed
youngsters on a benefit of &#163;50.95 a week. When I was doing my
stint in court, they literally came in with no money, and you can guess
what they were doing to get the money. You can carry drugs from A to B
for &#163;50 a time. I actually dealt with a case of that. The person
did not have any money, so a friend of his said, &#147;Well, you can
take this parcel from A to B for &#163;50 a time.&#148; If you do
that four times a week, why will you need benefits at all? Why will you
need a job? When I told the police about this, and said to them that
that was what I met with when I was doing this work, they said,
&#147;Yes, you are right. It always escalates, because he then goes
on to actually take the
drugs.&#148;</div><a name="09102225000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
economists talk frequently about the moral hazard of having a benefit
too high because people will never take work. What is never looked at
is the moral hazard of having it too low. The consequences of that are
profoundly serious. Having full prisons is a
start.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000200"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Helen
Goodman):</b> What Reverend Paul Nicolson says about the
importance of young women eating healthily is extremely important. That
is one of the reasons why we introduced the Sure Start maternity grant
and the health in pregnancy grant this year. I would like to ask
Charlotte a question. You said that money spent on benefits for
families where there is drug and alcohol addiction probably would not
benefit children. Do you suggest that those families should have lower
benefits, or that any increases in benefits for all families should not
go to those families?</div>
<a name="09102225000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> Absolutely not. That was in no way what I
said just then. I said that by raising benefits, you are not going to
pull that child out of poverty. We have an entire report
that makes numerous recommendations about how you could get people off
an addiction to drugs or alcohol. We are saying that the priority in
that situation has to be first ensuring that that child is living in a
safe family environment, which is unlikely if a parent is addicted to
drugs or alcohol, and secondly that you need to get the parent off
drugs and alcohol. I do not think that in any way the solution is found
by saying, &#147;Let&#146;s take away money&#148;, but rather by
saying, &#147;Let&#146;s have a proper, real, meaningful
intervention, which is going to transform lives, rather than creating
dependency and relying on maintenance.&#148;</div>
<a name="09102225000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000201"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Of course it&#146;s true that people who are
addicted to drugs and alcohol need help to get off their addiction. Of
course they need care from the health services. However, we are talking
about a Bill about child poverty. There are services delivered by the
local authorities and the NHS to deal with those problems, but I do not
quite understand what relevance that has to your comments on the Child
Poverty Bill.</div>
<a name="09102225000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> If you have a child living in poverty, and
you are focusing the Child Poverty Bill solely on income targets, there
is the danger that by skewing a policy response towards increasing
benefits to pull that child&#151;or, as Edna said, that family, which
is as it should be&#151;over the poverty threshold, you
are not improving that child&#146;s life in any way, shape or form.
They are still living in a household that is likely to be chaotic. I
also refute the fact that at the moment we have sufficient, or even
nearly adequate, services for tackling addiction. Our polling of
addicts who say that they want to come off drugs and not be maintained
in their addiction shows that we need a different approach to
addiction.</div>
<a name="09102225000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I completely
take your point that this is about child poverty. It comes back to
Mr. Selous&#146; question earlier, which I did not get a
chance to respond to. I will take a moment now to do so. If your
targets are solely focused on income, and not on other issues around
poverty, you are not measuring what is necessarily going to bring that
child out of poverty. If you had a wider range of indicators&#151;I
am sure that the JRF is a great place to start&#151;you could be
tackling child poverty by supporting that family, by taking parents off
drug addiction, by strengthening family units, by giving support to
parents to improve parenting skills, and all those other things, which
are very interrelated to child poverty. It is not just about
income.</div>

that extremely long answer, that a child in an addicted family would
not benefit from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>increases in benefits. I think that you should look at the record after

to say that I don&#146;t think my answer was particularly long in
comparison with those of other members of this panel. I would like to
respond by saying that we at the Centre for Social Justice are in no
way saying that income levels or material deprivation are not
important. As you will have seen in my paragraph submission to the
Committee, we fully support the desire and the drive to tackle child
poverty, and we fully support the targets, which are being put on a
statutory footing. We do not think that tackling income alone is going
to provide the outcomes that I&#146;m sure everybody here wants to
see&#151;to improve the lives and outcomes for children. I would like
to make it very clear that we are not saying that you should not tackle

<a name="09102225000160"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> I just want to comment on the question
of poor maternal nutrition and the fact that the Government have,
rightly, introduced various payments from 25 weeks onwards. I sent a
letter to Jim Knight saying that I thought he ought to look at the
problem of benefits for 18 to 25-year-olds being &#163;50.95 and food
costing &#163;43 a week, and women conceiving on that. It is about
conceiving; 25 weeks into pregnancy is far too late, it ought to be
earlier&#151;before they conceive. Indeed, the research by Michael
Crawford says that you have to have enough income from puberty, so
&#163;43 out of &#163;50 is constantly reduced if they are going to
remain within the law. That has another serious consequence. That
letter was sent to the Department of Health. I rather fear that because
it is nutrition, it is not being coupled with income matters. It is
vital that it is coupled with income. It took four months to get a
reply, which said that it had been sent to a
Committee.</div><a name="09102225000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
your permission, Chairman, I will spell this out: I have been over,
since 1970, endless investigations into inequalities and health, all of
which mentioned the need to examine poor maternal nutrition and low
birth weight, which have consequences for ill health and particularly
mental health. We now have a mental health bill in the NHS of
&#163;76 billion a year&#151;more than cancer and heart disease put
together, and far more than obesity, which all the concentration is on.
That figure was announced by Dr. Jo Nurse, head of mental health
services in the NHS and was calculated by the King&#146;s Fund. That
is hugely
serious.</div><a name="09102225000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of our amendments is about making savings from reducing poverty. If you
feed women properly when they are conceiving and holding babies, you
will make a very big difference for the rest of those babies&#146;
lives. I do not think that it is being done and I think that is the
result of two parties failing to tackle it for many decades. I am not
blaming one party or the
other.</div><a name="09102225000073"></a>

15</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000204"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> You have all welcomed the Bill, but do any of you
fear that it could prove counter-productive, for instance due to a
misallocation of resources? If in a constrained financial situation a
Government felt the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>need to meet the income levels, they would fail to allocate resources
when they might more properly have been spent on other support
services.</div><a name="09102225000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> Could I answer that in a strange way? I shall
make it very brief, I promise. I want to flip back to the discussion
about whether benefits will lift children out of poverty. Again, I am
all for a good level of any income at all. However, this is just a
little snapshot into our action research work. A move away from
alcoholism and addiction is an absolute nightmare at times. The most
important sessions that we run are on budgeting and meal planning. The
most important are children, budgeting and meal planning. Two people
who have no addictions at all have not coped on any amount of benefit
or other ways of getting money. This is vital to the Bill. I will say
it again: the budgeting, the way of looking, the
way of feeding and of caring for children is
vital.</div>

could the Bill, as it stands, be counter-productive and in what ways?
What do we need to change to ensure that it is not like
that?</div><a name="09102225000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> I will not say that it is counter-productive
because I am not in a position to say that. I think that it misses a
very important chunk of poverty in families today. I think that it is
much bigger percentage-wise across this country than we
realise.</div><a name="09102225000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I am not sure whether it is
counter-productive or not. It depends on what the UK strategy that it
mentions actually contains to tackle child poverty. But, as I have
already said, we at CSJ would certainly say that there is a danger of
it being skewed towards simply increased benefit payments when
actually, at this stage, it would be greatly beneficial to invest in
things such as early intervention programmes, development, families,
ensuring that we have good schools and so on. Those sorts of things
would have a much better long-term sustaining impact that would break
the inter-generational cycle of child
poverty.</div>

inadequate. I start there. It is too low and it is not providing for
healthy living. Of course, I accept everything that has been said by my
colleagues. There are hundreds of other things that can be done. I note
that there are amendments in relation to housing. Overcrowded housing
is a major problem; there are a million children in overcrowded
housing. If you are going to have a Child Poverty Bill, you have really
got to tackle housing. There has not been a proper housing
policy&#151;apart from saying that as many people as possible should
own their houses&#151;that has tackled the real problem of inadequate
housing for a large number of families for about 30 or 40 years. That,
I think, is a major issue and I am glad to see that Sally Keeble has
put it in the Bill. I hope that you will let it

Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): We seem to be partly in an
argument about whether it is a lack of income that leads to other
problems. While accepting some of the very difficult families in
multiple deprivation that we have been talking about, I see a large
number of families in my constituency who have been helped solely
because they have been given more income. Could you all comment on
whether it is the case that for a substantial number of people, just
having more income would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>resolve their other problems? Secondly, to what extent do you think it
would be sensible to put more and more targets within one Bill, as is
being suggested by adding yet more areas to different
clauses?</div><a name="09102225000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> It is definitely right that there will be a
group that will be helped that does not have those multiple problems. I
feel that the Bill is incomplete, because it does not take into account
a lot of social, mitigating factors. That will almost not lift children
out of poverty. Whether we agree with it or not, those are the facts
today. I want to point out that that group is growing as we sit here. I
think that because this is a long-term Bill, it has to be right not
only for 2009, but also right down the years. If the trend is going to
continue and not be addressed, the Bill will be more incomplete than we
already know it
is.</div><a name="09102225000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> I think that income is absolutely
central. It is not just income; it is the way in which the benefits
system is so inefficient sometimes. People get housing and council tax
benefit arrears that are really the result of confusion between the
four different departments that deliver unemployment benefits. A
rationalisation of the benefits system would help an awful lot of
people. People inevitably go into debt because their incomes are far
too
low.</div><a name="09102225000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
constantly battle against Provident plc, which will charge &#163;200
for a &#163;400 loan. That is horrendous and done under pressure. I
am currently having an argument with the Financial Ombudsman Service
about that, and I only heard yesterday that I have won. In other words,
a woman who was lent a loan under extreme circumstances for a fine that
she could not pay has paid off some of it, but she will not have to pay
off the rest. The complications of being poor are huge, so income is
absolutely essential. I stick by that. We commissioned the Family
Budget Unit. It was one of the first things we did when we discovered
that there was no adequacy research by the Government. They do not do
adequacy research before they set the level of statutory minimum
incomes in work, out of work or for
pensions.</div><a name="09102225000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Family Budget Unit reported in 1998 that for a family of two children
and two adults &#163;40 a week was below what they needed, and that
the poll tax was being taken out of unemployment benefits. The
situation is very serious. We are nothing like as well off
as those European countries with minimum incomes that are better than
ours. You would never find &#163;50 a week unemployment benefits in
Europe after rent and council
tax.</div><a name="09102225000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><a name="09102225000208"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): Apologies
to you, Mr. Caton, members of the Committee and witnesses
for being late for the hearing. My comments should perhaps be
understood in the context of that apology. Although I have been very
encouraged by some of what I have heard this morning, I am disturbed by
what seems to be the false notion that the one and only method by which
this country is dealing with child poverty is the Bill. A lot of the
conversation and comments are that, in the policy fields of housing,
health, education, early intervention, free school meals, working
family tax credit, child trust funds and efforts to address market
failure in English regions are somehow irrelevant and divorced from the
Bill. Would you like all those other different strands of policy that
address child poverty and poverty in the round in this country to be
included in the Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="09102225000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> Yes, certainly. I don&#146;t think that
there is a safe and effective way forward without that. You just
mentioned school dinners. I was head teacher of a school for 15 years
and I never had one child who did not have free dinners. The take-up
was 100 per cent. the whole time that I was there. I have great
practical knowledge. We cannot isolate. The big problem&#151;we have
seen it throughout the country&#151;is that we do not work together.
However much we talk about it, there is no cohesion, hence the
disasters.</div><a name="09102225000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Save
the Family is a catalyst for cohesion. We take the holistic approach.
Instead of children going into care, and mothers and fathers being on
the streets, there is an either/or. I said to the Barnardo&#146;s
man, &#147;You haven&#146;t got to leave a child in an extreme
difficult situation or put them into care. There&#146;s got to be in
this day and age of clever thinking an either/or&#151;and we are the
either/or.&#148; We take the whole family and we put them into
care.</div><a name="09102225000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000209"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. Do other witnesses want to
comment?</div><a name="09102225000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> Judy Mallaber clearly mentioned too many
targets and of course, we do not want too many targets. Equally, we do
not want a Bill that is skewed entirely towards income, which is our
point. Yes, you are entirely right: you have to recognise that tackling
child poverty is a much broader issue than income. If our four targets
are directly linked simply to income and material deprivation, it will
prove to be a massive
problem.</div><a name="09102225000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> In 1991, the Winterton Commons Select
Committee on maternity services requested action on low birth rate and
inequalities of health. One of the proposals was the adequate income on
which to be pregnant, but it disappeared. It has not happened since
then. There is a lot to be done that would prevent some of things that
you have suggested from going wrong. As I read it, the Bill is about
income. That is important. It should be about income. I should like to
see it more closely related to the research of the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, speakers from which you will talk to this afternoon and to
which I shall listen. I am glad that it picked up from where we took
matters in the 1990s and updated them for London citizens. I hope that
London Citizens and the Greater London assembly&#151;the living wage
for London is backed by Boris Johnson&#151;will now pick up from the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000210"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> On Tuesday afternoon, we took evidence from some
other voluntary sector groups, including Gingerbread, which is the lone
parents&#146; organisation. I am going to ask you the same question
that I asked them: do you think that family breakdown is a significant
cause of child
poverty?</div><a name="09102225000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> Absolutely. Family breakdown splits a family,
so income is halved because the dad leaves or whatever. The benefit is
not halved, but as Mr. Nicolson has said, it is more limited
then.</div><a name="09102225000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000211"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> May I ask a follow-up question about that? Taking
your perspective together with Reverend Paul Nicolson&#146;s, if you
think that that is a crucial moment when families fall into poverty, do
you think that the state should provide extra support at the moment
that families separate? Should there be a divorce grant?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div><a name="09102225000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> I would just push it back a little. I think
that the support should be there before it happens. I think the
indicators that it is happening should be flagged, and very
relevant&#151;I&#146;ll say it&#151;creative intervention should
take place. It could, and I believe would, help with real support to
those young
adults.</div><a name="09102225000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> Family breakdown is both a cause and a
consequence of poverty, but I think that it is probably a significant
cause of child poverty. You asked whether we should give more money to
people at the point of separation&#151;you said divorce, but a lot of
the families never marry in the first place. I find that very
interesting because that is simply saying that we accept that all those
families are going to break down so we should just pick up the pieces.
That is one of the greatest challenges we have had with current policy,
or policy over the past couple of decades, which has not focused on
prevention.</div><a name="09102225000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that what we should be doing is investing a great deal more. I do
not mean just money, although Reverend Paul Nicolson obviously
mentioned a couple penalty, which would be a great place to start in
terms of trying to take away one of the disincentives to being in a
stable two-parent family. We need to invest much more in early
intervention, parenting programmes and in strengthening couple
relationships. If we do that, we would probably find that it has a
great impact on child
poverty.</div><a name="09102225000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000212"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I was not saying that that was my view; I was
just trying to explore the logic of the witnesses&#146; position.
Picking up on the issue of parents, do you not think that clause
8(5)(a) on the development of the skills of the parents surely covers
skills that go beyond work skills? Does it not cover life skills? Is
that not what it
addresses?</div><a name="09102225000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I welcome that clause on UK strategies. I
mentioned earlier that it obviously depends on what comes of it.
Perhaps this is me not understanding entirely how Bills work, but
subsection (5)(a)
mentions</div><a name="09102225000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
promotion and facilitation of the employment of parents or of the
development of the skills of
parents&#148;.</div><a name="09102225000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linking
employment and skills comes across to me as meaning developing skills
in terms of employment. If that means developing skills in terms of
pure parenting skills&#151;attachment theory, relational competence
and so on&#151;it is absolutely wonderful. It is not a target and
whether it will be done remains to be seen, but we certainly think that
supporting parents to be good parents is absolutely
necessary.</div><a name="09102225000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> I think that it is a good start, but I would
say that it needs to be broadened, highlighted and explained a little
deeper; otherwise, it could just be overlooked in the whole volume of
the Bill. I think that it is a start, but it needs to be
broadened.</div><a name="09102225000101"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000213"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Do you have a contribution to make, Reverend
Paul
Nicolson?</div><a name="09102225000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> I think that family breakdown has a
multitude of causes right across society. I am sure that, again, lack
of income and debt contribute to family breakdown right across society.
I would suggest that the sad part is that you are better off separated
than together if you are on benefits. That is a serious situation and
adds to the stress. It is stress that causes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>family breakdown. The poverty of being on benefit is very serious. The
stress of low pay is very serious. Low pay is very, very low in some
instances. There are multiple causes of breakdown. Income is certainly
one of them. Debt is certainly another. Drugs would be another. I would
not want to pin it down quite as hard as you have, but I think it is a
contributory
cause.</div><a name="09102225000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000214"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Just a quick follow on. The Minister directed us
to clause 8(5) which mentions some vitally important areas: health,
education, social services, housing, the built environment, the
promotion of social inclusion and the promotion and facilitation of
employment of parents in the development of skills. I recognise all of
those. Would our witnesses think it would be helpful to have something
explicit in the Bill that just talks about the importance of trying to
strengthen family stability? I absolutely accept Mr.
Nicholson&#146;s statement that it is poverty and debt that often
drives family breakdown, but it works the other way. As the impact
statement says, family breakdown can also cause
poverty.</div><a name="09102225000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> I think, if I can phrase it another way, there
should be an emphasis on the culture of poverty. That might sound awful
to people, but there is a culture of poverty. There is no aspiration to
ever get out of it. I advocate today that it is that root level. I go
on about this: the culture is in the soil. Unless we analyse what that
is, I do not think that you, ladies and gentlemen, will get your
desired ends. You will miss them. I cannot emphasise the culture
enough. That covers the multiple problems of poverty. They are complex.
Yes you can list them. Yes you can pull them out. But they are inside a
culture and I believe that definitely needs to be in the Bill in a
central
place.</div><a name="09102225000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I could answer that with one word:
absolutely. Yes, of course it needs to cover strengthening
families.</div><a name="09102225000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000215"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is excellent. One word is
fine.</div><a name="09102225000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> This is a very complex area. We need
to avoid simple solutions. I was divorced myself, so I am an example of
family
breakdown.</div><a name="09102225000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000216"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> My parents are divorced too. I come from a far
from perfect family. We are of a kind
there.</div><a name="09102225000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> There are complex reasons the whole
way up and down the scale, but I do think that money causes breakdown.
When you are on a very low income&#151;and totally inadequate income
by the way, because all unemployment benefits are below the
Government&#146;s poverty threshold and very far below if you are
single or adult with no children&#151;the pressure of finance is one
of the reasons for breakdown. Single mothers get rather a bad deal
publicly. They need all the help and support they can get. They are
astonishing. They do amazing things. I am looking after a single mother
with eight
children&#151;</div><a name="09102225000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000217"></a>The

well.</div><a name="09102225000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.

please&#151;</div><a name="09102225000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102225000218"></a>The

Paul Nicolson:</b></i> HMRC did not believe she had eight
children so they stopped her benefits and sent somebody to count them.
I wrote to HMRC to ask, &#147;Couldn&#146;t you count them
first?&#148; It caused absolute havoc and took ages to get the
benefits
back.</div><a name="09102225000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><a name="09102225000219"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): Two of our
witnesses have expressed concern about the emphasis on income in the
Bill. Which of the four targets in the Bill&#151;relative low income,
material deprivation combined with low income, absolute low income and
persistent poverty&#151;do our witnesses think the focus should be on
as part of the Government&#146;s strategy to tackle child poverty?
Which is the most
important?</div><a name="09102225000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> Persistent poverty. It&#146;s about the
culture.</div><a name="09102225000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I think they are all vitally important. As
for persistent poverty, we know that some families fall off the edge
for a temporary period of time, but if a family has been in poverty for
three or four years, you are talking about crisis point
there.</div><a name="09102225000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> I think the matter is enormously
complex, which won&#146;t be easily understood by the public. I hope
you have all received and read our submission. We commissioned the
Family Budget Unit to do work back in 1998. I am glad to see that you
are talking to Loughborough university, but the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation commissioned a more recent report, and I have quoted it in
our submission. I think we have to add&#151;in a manner that is
totally discretionary on Government, so you are not compelled to do it
and cannot be taken to judicial review if you don&#146;t&#151;a
clause in the Bill that will require you to have regard to minimum
income standards. It&#146;s done in the Nordic countries, Germany and
France, in parts of America, in Australia and New Zealand. It is a very
valuable tool and it gives a guide to what is going to keep people
healthy in the way of
income.</div><a name="09102225000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000220"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> On your argument for minimum income standards,
should that minimum income be determined on absolute or relative
grounds?</div><a name="09102225000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> It should be decided against the
evidence on what are necessities, plus what is good for well-being.
There is a wonderful amendment that would bring the issue of well-being
into the Welfare Reform Bill, which I am terribly pleased to see. I am
going to listen to those proceedings in the House of Lords. You want to
look at the market and see the quantities and prices of the minimum
income standard. That is what minimum income standards do;
that&#146;s what I hope Donald Hirsch will explain to you. If you
consider the market, and the Government take a look at the adequacy
report before they set the level of statutory minimum incomes, you will
be doing the poor a great service. At the moment there is no connection
with reality; it is all based on
statistics.</div><a name="09102225000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000221"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Reverend Paul Nicolson said, with regard to the
minimum income standards, that the matter should not be subject to
judicial review. May I ask all three of you to say briefly how you see
the role of judicial review, as far as the Bill and the targets
enshrined in it are concerned? How important is it that Government
could be taken to judicial review, and is that a helpful element of the
Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div><a name="09102225000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I can&#146;t say I have thought about that
in great detail. We know, for example, in relation to children in care,
that there are certain statutory requirements where there is no
come-back, and which are therefore pretty useless. If you are going to
enshrine something, I think there should be a way of coming back to
ensure that it is being done, but you have to enshrine the right
thing.</div><a name="09102225000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna
Speed:</b></i> Yes, I think there&#146;s no harm in it.
It&#146;s another safety net, and I would go for
that.</div><a name="09102225000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> We came in on the issue of the poll
tax. A colleague of mine, one of our associates, overturned on judicial
review more than 1,000 cases of unlawful imprisonment for not paying
the poll tax. I went to ask the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department how
many more there were, and they said that they didn&#146;t keep a
record of imprisonment for non-payment of local taxes. That is another
story. Yes, I do think the judicial review element is vital. What is
wonderful is for you all to take on this responsibility of being
accountable, not only in the sense of being voted for, but also
accountable to the courts for ending poverty. I think you should
welcome that and go to the public. Where it&#146;s going to be
difficult for you is that half the population doesn&#146;t believe
that there is any poverty in the UK, and so you are going to have to
persuade them that there is. The language of the debate on poverty will
need to change. Perfectly good words such as &#147;dependency&#148;
have become dirty words in the tabloid press. You need to be able to
talk about poverty and its reality as statesmen, if I may be very
pompous.</div><a name="09102225000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000222"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> This is my final question: why do you think the
Government are not going to meet their 2010 target?</div>
<a name="09102225000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> Because it is terribly difficult
politically to undertake the necessary revision of the distribution of
wealth to actually achieve the target. Somehow or other, politicians
have got to beat that one because, as I said, the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation has estimated that there is a &#163;25 billion cost of
child poverty. There is a huge cost to the nation of dire&#151;and it
is dire&#151;poverty. The measures that you have never show the full
depth of poverty: the debts, the bailiffs, the &#163;250
charge for a &#163;400 loan, the loan sharks, and the sheer stress
and mental illness. Some &#163;76 billion a year is spent on mental
illness, and that is partly due to the stress of being
poor.</div><a name="09102225000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I think that they haven&#146;t reached the
target for many reasons that we have discussed today, and there
hasn&#146;t been enough focus on getting workless households into
work. Instead, there has been a greater focus on getting second earners
in a home. We know that those living in severe poverty are much more
likely to be in workless households. Also, if we look at which children
are in poverty, around half of them are actually living in couple
households where there is at least one person who works, so dealing
with the couple penalty would go some way towards dealing with that
issue. Another reason is that there has been a focus on shifting people
from just under to just over 60 per cent. of median income, and if you
look at the statistics and the figures, there are more
people&#151;more families&#151;living in severe poverty today than
in
1997.</div><a name="09102225000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna

problems, I think that the target was too
high.</div>

28</b><b class="B"><a name="09102225000223"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> This has been a very worthwhile discussion about
whether targets on income alone do the job. Obviously, the Bill is more
sophisticated than that; we have got measures relating to material
deprivation and persistence, which are very welcome. I think that you
are suggesting that we have targets on underlying causes, and I am
trying to think what they might look like. Charlotte, you mentioned
that there ought to be other targets of that sort. Could you give us
some examples? For instance, if you think family breakdown&#151;not
just divorce but other sorts of breakdown&#151;is one of the causes
of child poverty, should we make cutting the divorce rate a target in
the Bill? What would you
suggest?</div><a name="09102225000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte

rather than a negative one like that; I would want to see targets
related to strengthening families and early
intervention.</div><a name="09102225000130"></a>

to legislate for these things. Do you have a specific
suggestion?</div><a name="09102225000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> No, I haven&#146;t got a specific
suggestion. I am not an expert in targets and how things are measured.
I would also say that there are other things around education and the
addiction issue, which we have raised. The JRF has the indicators, and
it would certainly be worth looking at them and pulling some of them
out.</div><a name="09102225000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Edna

the reality, and not start on any level of
perception.</div><a name="09102225000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> I absolutely agree with that, because
that is what minimum income standards are. You get the dietician unit
of a university to find out what people need to live, and then you cost
it in the market. If you go out into the market and find the minimum
that people need to live on and take a look at what they need for
well-being, you can then judge whether you are providing statutory
minimums, set by Government, that are keeping people healthy. You also
save a fortune in many ways, including in the health service, in the
education service&#151;we know very well that educational
underachievement is related to poverty at home&#151;and, I would
hope, in the Prison Service and on law enforcement. So it is hugely
important to have minimum income standards. I have a proposed
amendment, and I sincerely hope that some good, kind Committee member
will pick it up and table it, so that, at the very least, it can be
debated.</div><a name="09102225000134"></a>

Goodman:</b> On Tuesday, when evidence was taken, there was
some criticism of clause 15 on economic and fiscal circumstances. This
is a question specifically to Charlotte Pickles: do you think, as some
groups do, that clause 15 should be taken out of the
Bill?</div><a name="09102225000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> No, I don&#146;t think so. You do have to
have regard to what would be in the best interests of the economy. We
have talked about that, in terms of the potential savings to be made by
investing in other areas, or by at least not skewing the investment
just towards benefits. For example, in an early intervention programme,
if you invest &#163;1, you can save up to &#163;17. In that
context, it is about asking what works, what will have the greatest
social impact and what is the fiscally responsible thing to
do&#151;that is an important aspect.</div>

Treasury has already projected that there will be a &#163;30-billion
increase in social security spending within three years. If you are
spending that money as it is, you might as well spend it
effectively.</div><a name="09102225000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

billion is instead of the numbers in the forward forecast projections,
which means an overall cut, or are you proposing that the &#163;2.7
billion be on top of what is in the existing
projections?</div><a name="09102225000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Charlotte
Pickles:</b></i> I am saying that we already know that if we
do nothing, we are going to see massive increases. That &#163;30
billion was something like a 23 per cent. increase in expenditure. If
we look back at the history of expenditure on social security, we see
similar increases over those periods of times. An initial up-front
investment of &#163;2.7 billion, I think I said&#151;I am trying to
remember this off the top of my head, but you have access to the
report&#151;will accrue around &#163;3.6 billion in savings within
two or three years. There will be an overall marked difference between
what you are spending and what you get back, which will mean that
within a few years, you
will&#151;</div><a name="09102225000142"></a>

34</b><a name="09102225000231"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): One of the things about this
morning&#146;s discussion that has been useful is that it has looked
at matters at a macro-economic level, but the Bill hands the delivery
of what it wants to achieve over to local government. Given that the
Reverend Paul Nicolson said that the Bill is about income, is that an
appropriate thing to do to achieve what the Bill sets out to
do?</div>
<a name="09102225000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Paul Nicolson:</b></i> Clearly, if you are going to end
poverty, which is what want to do for adults, families, children and
pensioners right across the board, you have to talk about income,
because some of the incomes are so low that they are going to cause ill
health, damage and crime. I want to draw your attention to the fact
that I had votes in the General Synod of the Church of
England, in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in Unison
and in the Methodist conference. If you put the subject of minimum
income standards to the people, the people vote for it unanimously, in
my experience. You are getting letters from each of those
Churches.</div>

The Bill will transfer much of the delivery to local government. Is
that going to achieve what you think the Bill should achieve?</div>

the Bill should achieve, but as has been so rightly said&#151;I know
that Sally Keeble has amendments down regarding overcrowded housing,

think it can only be answered with reference to track record. We have
missed the deadline. Is the Bill going to be delivered in a way that
will reduce child poverty? I will read one sentence, relating to
defining the current economic circumstances that we have been talking
about. It
states:</div><a name="09102225000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

think there is significant tension there. We certainly
