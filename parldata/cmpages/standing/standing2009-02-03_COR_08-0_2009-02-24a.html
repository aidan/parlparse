<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000590"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am sure that you will be pleased to hear
that I have no correspondence to shuffle today, Mr. Gale,
just as I did not have any correspondence to shuffle in our last
sitting week, despite the fantasies of journalist Henry Porter in
<i class="I">The Observer</i> the Sunday before last.</div>
<a name="09022518000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are interrelated. About 10 years ago, Her Majesty&#146;s
coroner for the Manchester Central jurisdiction, Len Gorodkin, proposed
that post-mortems should be possible by non-intrusive examination of
bodies by magnetic resonance imaging. He had the sizeable Jewish
communities in Greater Manchester in mind when he made the proposal. In
the past few years, working mainly with the Bolton Council of Mosques,
Her Majesty&#146;s Manchester West coroner, Jennifer Leeming, has
developed the technique into an acceptable way of carrying out
post-mortems, and the so-called Bolton protocol has spread to other
Greater Manchester boroughs and towns and cities throughout the
country.</div><a name="09022518000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Manchester West jurisdiction covers Salford, where there is a sizeable
Jewish community, Bolton, where there is a sizeable Muslim community,
Wigan and Leigh, but I should stress that MRI post-mortems are
available for the whole community, not just the Jewish and Muslim
communities. Some families have asked for MRI post-mortems because they
need the procedure to be carried out in a hurry&#151;for example, if
they are visiting a loved one in this country who dies, and they need
to return quickly to their own country because of their
occupation.</div>
<a name="09022518000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Manchester West jurisdiction is one of the 10 busiest in the country,
with more than 4,000 deaths reported each year, costing the council tax
payers in the four local authority areas &#163;1,434,000 each year.
Council tax payers in the jurisdiction therefore bear a higher cost
than council tax payers in other
jurisdictions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div><a name="09022518000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022518000591"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman
agree&#151;he might have said this&#151;that there is often a quite
important religious and ethnic minority interest in swift burial or
disposal? If formalities have to be undergone, they could extend the
process and the degree of concern in those
communities.</div>
<a name="09022518000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000592"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct&#151;that is the
main reason why the procedure has been developed in the Manchester West
jurisdiction.</div><a name="09022518000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
average cost of an MRI post-mortem is &#163;885 and 50 to 60 are
carried out each year. They are usually carried out overnight, when the
MRI scanners are not required to scan living people, for obvious
reasons. Costs are usually met by the family, but the Jewish Burial
Board in Greater Manchester meets the cost of a scan for its
members.</div><a name="09022518000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consultant
radiologists play an important role in determining whether an MRI
post-mortem will reveal the cause of death, which is the reason for
amendment 188. Radiologists feel strongly about their inclusion in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09022518000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of the 50 to
60 examinations carried out in this way, perhaps one will have to be
referred to a pathologist in the end because the MRI post-mortem did
not reveal the actual cause of death. That is explained to the families
who choose to undertake the
procedure.</div><a name="09022518000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
advantage of an MRI post-mortem over a pathological examination is that
the results can be kept on a disc for future examination, if necessary.
Also, it is usually quicker than a pathological examination, especially
when histology samples must be sent away for analysis, which can take
several days or sometimes even weeks.</div>
<a name="09022518000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Manchester West coroners&#146; jurisdiction provides a full
out-of-hours service for the issue of documentation for the release of
deceased persons for burial, cremation or even removal from the UK,
which is common in Muslim communities. In Manchester West, not only Her
Majesty&#146;s coroner but the administrative assistant who issues
such documents is available out of
hours.</div><a name="09022518000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased that the Bill&#146;s explanatory notes refer to such
post-mortems, on page 26. The procedure is at least now recognised by
this Government. The power to request a post-mortem examination by MRI
scan is underpinned by clause 16, which we shall consider in a moment.
The clause gives the coroner the power to move a body between
jurisdictions.</div>
<a name="09022518000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, an
MRI scanner might not be available in the coroner&#146;s own
jurisdiction. Non-invasive MRI post-mortems are not yet available for
children in Greater Manchester, as no participating paediatric
radiologist is available. In such cases, it would be necessary to move
the body from Greater Manchester to Sheffield, where the nearest
consultant paediatric radiologist is located. Here in the south, Great
Ormond Street children&#146;s hospital also has a specialist
radiologist.</div><a name="09022518000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
summarise, radiologists feel strongly that MRI post-mortems are a
developing technique that will spread rapidly across Britain,
particularly in the communities that I have mentioned, and that will
involve a considerable number of our citizens. They feel that now is
the appropriate time, as an opportunity such as the Bill comes only
rarely, to put radiologists on the face of legislation. That is the
substance of amendment 188.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div><a name="09022518000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 189
is consequential. It defines a post-mortem as either invasive or
non-invasive. Again, the coroners to whom I have spoken, such as
Jennifer Leeming in the Manchester West jurisdiction, and radiologists
feel that there should be a definition in the clause along the lines of
my amendment.</div>
<a name="09022518000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 23
relates to providing accommodation overnight and at weekends. I remind
right hon. and hon. Members that coroners, by the nature of their
employment, must make themselves available 24/7, so that is not a
problem. Jennifer Leeming, in my jurisdiction, is always available if
needed. Furthermore, administrative assistants are provided in the
Greater Manchester West jurisdiction as well. The cost of the provision
is not excessive and would be met in most cases by the charge for the
MRI scan in the first place. I have pleasure in urging the Committee to
accept the two amendments, particularly amendment
188.</div><a name="09022518000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022518000593"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): I welcome you
to this afternoon&#146;s sitting of the Committee, Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="09022518000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
suggestion of the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East that we put the
term &#147;radiologist&#148; on the face of the Bill makes a great
deal of sense. I rise to speak to our amendment 363, which would ensure
that if a suitable practitioner is not a registered medical
practitioner, he or she is supervised by a qualified
pathologist.</div>
<a name="09022518000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may
well be cases when such scans are carried out by relatively junior
technicians. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, the use of such highly
sophisticated medical equipment will probably take place out of hours.
He also alluded to the fact that in two of the great religions in this
country, Judaism and Islam, there is an imperative that bodies be
released for burial the following day, if at all possible. I am
concerned that short cuts should not be taken and that, where fairly
junior technicians are in charge, they should always be supervised by a
qualified pathologist.</div>
<a name="09022518000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000594"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I did mention the consultant
radiologist.</div>
<a name="09022518000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000595"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
underlining that
point.</div><a name="09022518000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment speaks for itself. I hope that the Minister understands why
we are keen to put that extra safeguard in place. I agree with what the
hon. Member for Bolton, South-East said in speaking to his amendments.
That aside, it is a good clause, and it should command the support of
the entire Committee.</div>
<a name="09022518000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022518000596"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): This is clearly an
important matter for religious reasons, and it is important for those
who are suffering a bereavement in the family, for whom it is clearly a
difficult time. Having to reconcile one&#146;s religious feelings and
beliefs with the British justice system can be difficult. It is
appropriate that we be as sympathetic as possible.</div>
<a name="09022518000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East. The
proposal seems to be a sensible way forward, particularly as it works
in the jurisdiction where his constituents live. However, it has been
suggested to various members of the Committee that coroners should have
a duty to make families aware of the option for the non-invasive
post-mortem as well as the surgical post-mortem.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div><a name="09022518000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">In areas such
as Manchester, the technique is well known; it is supported and
promoted and people are aware of it. In other parts of the country,
however, religious communities may be much smaller and less well
represented. They may not have the support of the surrounding
community, and they may not be aware of the options if they feel
strongly that a post-mortem should not be carried out. Will the
Minister say whether it would be possible to require information on
what is possible and what is available to be spread more
widely?</div>
<a name="09022518000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000597"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> Welcome, Mr. Gale, to this
afternoon&#146;s discussions.</div>
<a name="09022518000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely
understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr.
Iddon) tabled the amendments, but I believe they are unnecessary for
two simple reasons. First, all practising radiologists should also be
registered medical practitioners; they would therefore fall within the
definition of a &#147;registered medical practitioner&#148; under
clause 15(3)(a). I suspect that we would all be a little uneasy if
someone who was not a registered medical practitioner were able to
carry out the post-mortem procedure&#151;invasive or
otherwise&#151;without having been designated as suitable by the
chief coroner.</div>
<a name="09022518000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we
want only those who are properly trained and qualified to carry out
such procedures. In clause 15(3)(b), we provide the necessary assurance
that only those who are registered medical practitioners or who are
otherwise recognised by the chief coroner as possessing the relevant
skills can carry out such procedures. For example, that would apply to
some toxicologists, forensic scientists and forensic archaeologists as
much as to radiologists.</div>
<a name="09022518000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
363, tabled by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, goes too far in
the opposite direction. Saying that we would need a qualified
pathologist to oversee people who, by definition, are already qualified
medical practitioners&#151;they would have to be so for the coroner
to have allowed them to carry out the post-mortem&#151;is over-egging
the pudding. If the chief coroner had any doubt about the suitability
of certain individuals, either he would not appoint them or he would
take advice from the national medical
adviser.</div><a name="09022518000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000598"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am conscious that the General Medical Council
is putting in place requirements for quinquennial recertification and
demonstration of fitness to practise for general medical practitioners.
Can we have an assurance that the chief coroner will at least look at a
system that shadows that for persons whom he approves, so that such
approval will not be lifetime approval, but will be subject to regular
review?</div>
<a name="09022518000549"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="09022518000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000599"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is a very positive and constructive
suggestion, and I will certainly take it forward. That is exactly the
way to ensure that we raise standards right across the coronial
system.</div>
<a name="09022518000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
medical adviser is able to advise the chief coroner that a person is
suitably qualified, another qualified pathologist should not be
required to be present to oversee their work and to ensure that they
carry out the post-mortem in a proper fashion.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div><a name="09022518000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the points
raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central on the availability of
MRI scans, we certainly want to encourage coroners to use non-invasive
post-mortems as well as invasive ones. In future, coroners should make
people aware of the opportunity to use that form of post-mortem,
although it is slightly more expensive. The problem at the moment is
that not every area can benefit from the work of people such as
Jennifer Leeming or from facilities such as those in Greater
Manchester. Over time, however, I would like such facilities to become
available across the country, so that non-invasive post-mortems might
become more common. I say that not only because of the religious
reasons that have been mentioned, but because families might have other
reasons for feeling that such a post-mortem is appropriate.</div>
<a name="09022518000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
189, it is not necessary to set out in the Bill that post-mortems
include invasive and non-invasive post-mortem examinations, because the
drafting of the Bill outlines that. To be clear, however, let me say
that the provisions that refer to post-mortems do indeed apply to both
invasive and non-invasive
post-mortems.</div><a name="09022518000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East talked about coronial
staff being available 24 hours a day. Clause 23 makes it clear that
staff have to be available to ensure that the coroner can carry out
their functions properly. In effect, that means that someone has to be
available 24 hours a day to ensure that a post-mortem could, for
example, be carried out urgently in the middle of the night. It is
implicit in clause 23 that staff will be available outside normal
office hours.</div>
<a name="09022518000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment. For the
reasons that I have outlined, I also ask the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk not to press his amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000600"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> Based on those reassurances, which are now on the
record, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment, but I hope that my hon.
Friend the Minister and her civil servants will try to expand the
non-invasive post-mortem service, which has been proved to work over
five years. Despite some criticisms, it does work&#151;indeed, in
only one or two cases does it not work and a full pathological
examination follows. I thank my hon. Friend for her comments and I beg

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000601"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I have a couple of points to make about the
removal of bodies. In some cases, the body might be in difficult
circumstances&#151;for example, on a railway line or protected land.
Some coroners insist on using their own preferred undertaker to remove
the bodies, whether or not the undertaker has been trained in, for
example, health and safety procedures if they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>dealing with a body on a railway line. That has been raised with me as a
concern, because it can threaten the safety of the site where the body
is located and of the people operating in that area. It can also lead
to longer closures and unnecessary disruption to, for example, a
railway line if the job is being done by someone who is untrained and
does not know how to work in those particularly dangerous
circumstances.</div><a name="09022518000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no obligation in the Bill or in any of the previous Acts for
undertakers to have any training or authorisation. We have tabled an
amendment to a provision later in the Bill that would require a code of
practice on the powers to be given to coroners in relation to entry to
and searching and seizure of land. It would also be helpful if the
Minister considered addressing, whether in a code of practice or in
guidance laid alongside the powers to remove the body, the training
that is available or necessary for undertakers in these cases. The
number of such cases is very limited, but they are specific examples.
We are talking not just about railway lines, but about electricity
substations, power stations, airports, motorways, major roads, zoo
enclosures and so on&#151;places where the circumstances raise health
and safety
issues.</div><a name="09022518000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000602"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I have two comments to make. The first adverts to
something that I talked about the other day, where a former employee
died on my farm, in a field. The difficulty was that because it was
located in the county of Northamptonshire, the body was removed to
Northampton, whereas it would have been much more convenient for all
the relatives and everyone else had it gone to Banbury, which is a much
shorter distance but would have entailed crossing a boundary. I say to
the Minister that although I understand that she has made provision in
earlier clauses for the transfer of jurisdiction, it is important that
that is tied up fairly early on, particularly when there are those
borderline issues, so that the process is as unintrusive to the family
as possible. There may well be a role for training undertakers and it
may well be that the coroner&#146;s officer has some ability at least
to make inquiries at an early stage to see what would be
appropriate.</div><a name="09022518000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point relates to the provision in subsection (3)
about removal of a
body</div><a name="09022518000526"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
a place provided by a person who has not consented to its being removed
there.&#148;</div><a name="09022518000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems entirely reasonable. No one, to put it crudely, wants a body
dumped on them without their knowledge or consent. I realise that there
is a saving for local authority premises in the second part of that
subsection, but if the practice in, say, an area of relatively low
coronial intensity, where there were only a few cases, was to use
private sector premises such as an undertaker&#146;s chapel of rest
or something similar, things would be difficult if that was not easily
available on a 24/7 basis. I hope that the Minister can address that
point administratively and ensure that if outsourcing, if I may call it
that, is to be applied, it is done in a way that does not create
further delay.</div>
<a name="09022518000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The common
interest, which is also shared by the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central,
is to produce as easy, unintrusive and unobjectionable a procedure in
difficult circumstances as possible. That is important both for the
process of justice and for the interests of the family, who are bound
to be feeling low when a death has
occurred.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div><a name="09022518000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000603"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> May I pick up on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
last sentence? He said that the procedure should be as unobjectionable,
sensitive and easy as possible, not just in public policy terms but for
the benefit of the family. Of course that is absolutely right and it is
what the Bill is about. On that basis, I hope that I can reassure him
and the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central that we will consider those
sensitivities very carefully. The whole point of clause 16 is to ensure
that, where possible, the body is removed to a place that is more
appropriate for the
family.</div><a name="09022518000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not heard of the examples that the hon. Lady outlined, so that has
sent a little bee buzzing around in my brain. I shall have
conversations with the National Association of Funeral Directors and
others as to how to take this forward, and whether it needs to be part
of a code of practice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000608"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> This very important clause introduces the new
post of medical examiner. That post is very important indeed to the
future of the coronial service. It is a crucial part of the new set of
checks and balances, especially in this post-Shipman era. Dame Janet
Smith&#146;s 600-page report on the Shipman tragedy strongly
recommended that a new post of medical examiner be
introduced.</div>
<a name="09022518000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Resources are
an issue. Touching briefly on subsection (2)(a), the
explanatory notes state that primary care trusts and local health
boards
must</div><a name="09022518000527"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appoint
enough medical examiners, and make available enough funds and other
resources (including medical examiner&#146;s officers) to enable the
medical examiners to discharge their
functions&#148;</div><a name="09022518000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">correctly,
properly and efficiently. What sanctions there will be on the
Department of Health in the event of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>failure to meet those commitments, and what discussions has the Minister
had with her counterparts in the Department of
Health?</div><a name="09022518000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an important preliminary point, but the key issue is the
independence of medical examiners. It is wrong that medical examiners
will be appointed by the PCTs and LHBs. Amendments 360 and 361 would
make a small but significant change so that the chief coroner would
appoint a medical examiner in consultation with the PCTs and LHBs. It
is an important change that should be made because it is vital that
such an important post remains independent of the local health
service.</div><a name="09022518000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me quote the Law Society briefing that was sent to members of the
Committee. The Law Society wanted to delete the whole of subsection (5)
and to put in extra safeguards, but I think that our alternative offers
a neater way forward. The Law Society
says:</div><a name="09022518000528"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
new position of medical examiner is intended as the bridge between the
health services and the coroner service. However as the employee of the
Primary Care Trust or Local Health Board, the medical examiner would be
acting as the filter for the death certificates provided by colleagues
in the health service. In that case he is likely to trust the judgement
of fellow medical professionals. There could also be pressure from his
employer, and the Law Society believes there needs to be stronger
checks.&#148;</div><a name="09022518000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not say that there is a danger that the professional integrity of
medical could be compromised if they were appointed by the PCTs, who
would also be their employers&#151;I do not accept that. However, I
do believe that the very simple extra safeguard makes a great deal of
sense.</div><a name="09022518000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may be a bit battered and bruised from her recent encounter on
the &#147;Today&#148; programme, when she was interviewed alongside
Dame Janet Smith. I thought that the Minister was her usual courageous
self.</div>
<a name="09022518000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000609"></a>Bridget

me.</div><a name="09022518000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000610"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Well, a Minister was interviewed alongside
Dame Janet Smith, the editor of the Shipman report. Dame Janet made it
clear that she was very concerned and unhappy about the post of medical
examiner not being independent enough. Although she welcomes the
appointment of medical examiners and feels that it is an important part
of moving on from the post-Shipman era and using the Bill to update the
service, her criticism of the clause was founded on her view that that
medical examiners must be independent. Our clause, and its
consequential amendment, achieve that
aim.</div>
<a name="09022518000550"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="09022518000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000611"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Amendment 116, which is in my name and that of my
hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge, is trying to achieve a similar
aim to that just highlighted by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk.
We share his concerns about the independence of the NHS medical
examiner, but we are also looking at the link between senior coroners
and medical examiners in their local area.</div>
<a name="09022518000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
most important things, which was flagged up by the Coroners Society in
its evidence to the Committee, is that by taking away the right for the
coroner to be medically trained, so that now they will be only legally 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>trained, a number of coroners feel that it is important that they have
that easy access to medical advice. We all welcome the creation of the
post of medical examiner&#151;it is clearly important. However,
because of the importance of the link between the coroners and the
medical examiner, it is important that they work closely
together&#151;preferably co-located&#151;and have a strong local
link.</div><a name="09022518000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment reinforces that local link by ensuring that, before someone
is recruited as a medical examiner for a particular area, the local
senior coroner has to be consulted so that they have some sort of say
in the recruitment. We can then ensure that that working relationship
is built into the system. My concern about the amendment tabled by the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk is that it removes the local ink
entirely by giving the recruitment of the medical examiners to the
chief
coroner.</div><a name="09022518000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000612"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> &#147;In consultation
with&#148;.</div><a name="09022518000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000613"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Yes. &#147;In consultation with&#148; the
local health board and the PCT. It does the opposite of what our
amendment does, which is getting the local senior coroner involved in
the recruitment rather than taking it to the level above. It is the
local link that will be
crucial.</div><a name="09022518000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman said, there will be an important role for the
medical examiners in improving the death certification process and
ensuring that we do not have any recurrence of the Shipman scenario.
However, the link between the coroners and the medical examiners is a
key omission from the Bill. That issue was also raised by the Justice
Committee, which was concerned that that aspect was not sufficiently
highlighted. Will the Minister ensure that the local link between the
two services is in the Bill?</div>
<a name="09022518000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also raised the independence of medical examiners, which, as
he said, has been flagged up by the Law Society. However, it is quite
telling that the Medical Protection Society, which represents the
interests of doctors, is also deeply concerned about the matter. People
from both sides are concerned about whether this ensures enough
independence for medical examiners. There have been some instances
where coroners have found that their link to the local authority has
been problematic when a local authority has been implicated in some way
in a death that the coroner is looking into. However, that is
rare&#151;much more rare than it would be with the medical examiner
and the local NHS, as the NHS is much more often involved in cases that
come before the coroner&#146;s court. This issue needs to be looked
into as concerns have been raised by a wide range of people.</div>
<a name="09022518000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
potential in the Bill&#146;s drafting for medical examiners to feel
isolated within the system. If their funding depends entirely on the
local primary care trust or health board and they are not properly tied
in with the local coroners system, they could be isolated in difficult
cases and struggle with funding. Will the Minister respond to
that?</div>
<a name="09022518000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a Welsh
Member of Parliament, like the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth, I understand that local health boards will no longer
exist&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Sorry; and the hon.
Member for Wrexham. I understand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>that local health boards will no longer exist by the time the Bill
becomes law. I am not sure whether that needs to be flagged
up.</div><a name="09022518000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000614"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Now that we know how many Welsh Members we have
in the Committee, we will proceed. This is an important debate about
the independence of medical examiners. They will be appointed by the
primary care trusts and local health boards for the very
reason&#151;I hope that this answers the hon. Lady&#146;s final
concern&#151;that they will then be closely involved with clinical
governance teams and establish whether patterns or clusters of deaths,
for example, give any cause for concern. They will therefore be able to
improve medical provision locally. However, clearly, they will also
have to work closely with coroners, not least because of the important
role they will play in providing coroners with general medical
advice.</div><a name="09022518000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department of Health has made it clear in its response to the public
consultation on improving the process of death certification that
primary care trusts and local health boards will involve the local
coroner in their arrangements for the appointment of the medical
examiner. Therefore, I do not think that we need to put that provision
into the Bill, as amendment 116 would do.</div>
<a name="09022518000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments
360 and 361, I agree absolutely that medical examiners need clear lines
of accountability, but I am not persuaded that the amendments&#146;
approach is necessarily the correct one. I do not think that it is
appropriate for the chief coroner to be directly involved in the
appointment, resourcing or monitoring of medical examiners, but I see
the role of the new national medical adviser to the chief coroner as
the important bridge between the two. He or she will agree the national
job description for medical examiners as well as the protocol setting
out the minimum level of scrutiny that medical examiners must complete.
The national medical adviser will also contribute to the development of
training for medical examiners and have a role in the resolution of any
disputes that arise between medical examiners and coroners.</div>
<a name="09022518000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
of the medical examiner service against clear standards of service
provision will be part of the process of auditing primary care trusts
and will be carried out by the Healthcare Commission. I was a little
concerned by the comments of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk
about the way that the medical adviser should be appointed. His hon.
Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)
said in a Westminster Hall
debate:</div><a name="09022518000529"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have seen that Ministers wish to embed medical examiners in primary
care trusts. I think that that is the right thing to do, as it will put
medical examiners in a position where they can link their role into
performance management of primary care providers and
commissioners.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Westminster
Hall</i>, 21 June 2007; Vol. 461, c.
534WH.]</div><a name="09022518000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is exactly the right way forward. We believe that it is vital that the
public are confident that the examiners will be able to carry out
independent scrutiny. The Bill provides for that in two ways. First, we
specify that primary care trusts in England and local health boards in
Wales can have no role in how the examiners exercise their professional
judgment as medical practitioners. Secondly, we are enabling
regulations to specify what is required to demonstrate
independence.</div><a name="09022518000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
expect that the requirements will include the definition and two
important protocols. First, a national 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>protocol will be prepared in consultation with the coroners, the royal
medical colleges, the British Medical Association and others setting
out the minimum level of scrutiny that must be completed for different
combinations of care setting, stated cause of death and circumstance.
Secondly, a local protocol agreed by the PCT in consultation with the
senior coroner for the area will determine the minimum distance between
the medical examiner and a death that he or she is allowed to
scrutinise. Distance in that context could refer to the nature of any
personal, professional or fiduciary relationship that the examiner and
the deceased person might have or the attending doctor or the
consultant for whom a hospital-based attending doctor works. The
appropriate distance has to be a local matter to reflect the different
configuration of the NHS in each
community.</div><a name="09022518000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
it does not follow that the chief coroner should be head of the medical
examiner service. It is the job of coroners&#151;and therefore the
chief coroner&#151;to focus on violent or unnatural deaths and deaths
of unknown causes that occur in custody or other state detention. That
amounts to 115,000 or so deaths each year where a post mortem is
carried out rather than the 350,000 deaths that require no further
action. I am not saying that there is not scope for further
clarification of the accountability and leadership arrangements for
medical examiners at a national level. The Department of Health is
actively looking at such matters in the context of the health service,
and I hope that by the time we discuss the Bill on
Report&#151;certainly while the Bill is undergoing its parliamentary
process&#151;I can provide further detail on what the Department of
Health envisages in that context. In the meantime, I ask Opposition
Members to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000126"></a>

Secretary who was talking about how medical examiners would operate on
a day-to-day basis, not about their appointment. My argument is that,
of course, they will be part of the PCT and will be playing an
essential role on a day-to-day basis, working alongside other doctors
within the PCT and the local health boards. However, their actual
appointment does need to be one stage removed. I am sorry that the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000632"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> The amendment and group of new clauses relate
specifically to the establishment of a national medical adviser to the
chief coroner. The Minister referred to such an appointment in her
response to the previous group of amendments, but our proposals would
establish a national medical adviser to the chief coroner so that the
system of the chief coroner and senior coroners in local areas would be
paralleled by a national medical adviser to the chief coroner and a
series of medical examiners throughout the country. The two operations
would run in parallel.</div>
<a name="09022518000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
establishment of the chief coroner is placed in statute, as are the
medical examiners, so I am unclear why the role of a national medical
adviser to the chief coroner is the only part of the jigsaw puzzle not
in the Bill. In its evidence to the Committee, the Royal Society of
Pathologists made it plain that it had been speaking to the Department
and was of the understanding that the post would be established. It is
clearly worried that it is not mentioned in the Bill, and that the
position is not made
clear.</div><a name="09022518000551"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000633"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Why the national medical adviser to the chief
coroner is the only role not in the Bill is unclear. The role is
critical to how the new system will operate. The amendments and,
particularly, the new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>clauses that we have tabled would establish the post of a national
medical adviser and enable the adviser, in consultation with the chief
coroner and the Secretary of State, to make regulations around
training, staffing levels, service provision and so on that would be
expected of the medical advisers, laying out the minimum standards
expected of medical examiners and requiring the local PCTs and health
boards to fund that minimum level of
standards.</div><a name="09022518000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed provisions would ensure that training and basic minimum
standards were common across the whole of the United Kingdom, tackling
some of the problems that the coroner system has experienced up to
now&#151;as discussed, the widely varying levels of expenditure,
support and what is expected of the system from the local authorities.
Establishing the role of national medical adviser, with the power to
make regulations regarding those minimum standards, would at least
establish medical examiners and ensure that they are not starting out
with the handicap that coroners have been experiencing. Given that, all
members of the Committee recognise that there are a number of
challenges for coroners based on the unevenness of funding and support
across the country. It seems a shame to set out a new structure that
does not get around some of the difficulties right from the start. The
chief coroner will clearly have an important role in managing and
ensuring consistency across the country for senior, area and assistant
coroners in the various regions. It is critical that the establishment
of the medical examiner system should have a similar central figurehead
and organisation that is able to ensure the consistency of funding,
standards and training across the UK, in parallel with the chief
coroner.</div><a name="09022518000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has also been highlighted that, in the same way as medical examiners
will be important as a source of advice and support for senior coroners
in their local area, the chief coroner will similarly need central
medical advice to enable them to fulfil their role in operating the
coronial system successfully across the UK as a whole. I would be
grateful if the Minister explained why that is the one role not in the
Bill, given that it is such a fundamental part of how the system will
operate. It seems a strange
omission.</div><a name="09022518000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000634"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns
about the leadership of the medical examiner service, but I do not
believe it necessary to have the medical examiner role in the Bill as
she has described. That is partly because of what I said in the
previous debate about the role of the chief coroner being solely
responsible for violent or unnatural deaths, or for deaths from an
unknown cause or during state detention and so on. The chief coroner
and the senior coroner will not have jurisdiction over natural deaths,
so the remit of the medical adviser to the chief coroner ought not to
stray into the generality of deaths, except to the extent that I
described.</div><a name="09022518000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
several occasions, the hon. Lady said that the national medical
adviser&#146;s job is the only one not included in the Bill, but
other jobs relating to the chief coroner are not covered, including the
legal adviser and some of the training specialists. I would be very
concerned by the idea that the chief medical adviser should have a role
in setting the regulations and I would not want to look at that at the
moment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div><a name="09022518000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Department
of Health will be introducing secondary legislation, as set out in the
clauses on death certification, and the role of the national medical
adviser in relation to medical examiners will be better defined in that
legislation. Our intention is that the national medical adviser will be
involved in agreeing protocols on the levels of scrutiny that medical
examiners must complete and how medical examiners will interact with
coroners, as well as agreeing job descriptions and being consulted on
the curriculum for the training that is required. The national medical
adviser will also be consulted on disputes that might arise between
coroners and medical advisers and on any conflict of views in
particular cases.</div>
<a name="09022518000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
hon. Lady not to press her amendments, but if there is a strong feeling
in the Committee that the role of the national medical adviser should
be included in the Bill, I will certainly consider the issue to see
whether it would be appropriate to return to it at a later stage.
However, the national medical adviser&#146;s position does not need
to be statutory, and many others in similar circumstances are not. That
is why the national medical adviser is not included in the Bill at the
moment, but I will not set my face against including them
later.</div>
<a name="09022518000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000635"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> The Minister&#146;s comments about the
difference between the role of coroners and the remit of the national
medical adviser in terms of deaths that are investigated could easily
be clarified in the Bill or in regulations. The remit of medical
examiners will clearly be significantly broader than that of coroners,
but both are included in the Bill, so there is no reason why the
national medical adviser could not also be in the Bill. The issue could
be clarified in regulations or in whatever way the Minister
chooses.</div>
<a name="09022518000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
regulations, I must confess that I am somewhat bewildered. The chief
coroner is to have the ability to lay out training requirements and
minimum standards in regulations, and I do not understand why there
should be a difference between the chief coroner&#146;s powers and
the national medical adviser&#146;s powers in that respect. Both have
a similar role in overseeing the two parallel parts of the system, and
it is somewhat lop-sided for the chief coroner to have powers in one
area, when the national medical adviser does not have similar
powers.</div>
<a name="09022518000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
big issues with the coroners system over the past few decades has been
the lack of consistency. One issue flagged up by a number of the
witnesses who gave evidence to the Committee was the welcome for an
overseeing body in the form of the chief coroner, who would be able to
ensure some consistency. It would be a missed opportunity, in setting
up the medical examiners system, if we did not ensure that we had a
similar central body to ensure consistency across the UK.</div>
<a name="09022518000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
given the Minister&#146;s comments about the ongoing discussions with
the Department of Health and the fact that things are still being
developed, I am happy not to press the provisions, although I hope that
the Minister will come back to us on Report with some progress. If not,
we may press the matter to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000638"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that
all medical practitioners have the right to report their concerns over
the death of a patient to the coroner, which would be an extra
safeguard in the post-Shipman era. The draft charter for the bereaved
entitles the relatives of a deceased person to report their concerns
over the circumstances of the death to the coroner. There needs to be a
similar right for medical practitioners to convey their concerns to the
coroner. As framed, the reporting mechanism to the coroner under the
Bill is confined to the attending doctor and the medical examiner.
There must be a provision to enable other practitioners, such as nurses
or other medical attendants, to make reports about their concerns
regarding the death of a patient to the coroner. That is what our
amendment is about, and I hope that the Minister will look at it
sympathetically and take on board what we have said.</div>
<a name="09022518000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I trouble the
Committee briefly with two other concerns that I have on the death
certificating process, in particular, death certificates. I raise the
case of Doreen Morris, which has been brought to my attention by two
local MPs who are concerned with her case&#151;my hon. Friend the
Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) and my hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). Doreen
Morris was discovered dead in a badly burnt-out shell of a house, and
her body had been totally incinerated. The pathologists could not give
a precise cause of death because the body was too badly burnt, but
there was a need for the body to be released for burial, which happened
about a month after the tragic fire. A suspect was arrested and charged
with her murder in the following month. In July, an inquest was opened,
but it was adjourned because criminal proceedings had started. In the
mean time, a death certificate was issued, and the cause of death on it
was recorded as &#147;not ascertained&#148;. At the trial, the
suspect was subsequently acquitted&#151;although Mr.
Justice Scott Baker concluded that Mrs. Morris had been
brutally murdered, and that she suffered an incredibly cruel and
callous
killing.</div><a name="09022518000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
there is no doubt about the arson, or whether it was an unlawful
killing&#151;the only doubt was about the identity of the culprit.
The family was very upset indeed; they wanted closure of the tragic
case, and the death certificate to be amended to read &#147;unlawful
killing&#148;, because that undoubtedly was what happened. They
wanted closure, but there was a problem, because the coroner had to
adjourn the inquest for obvious reasons.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>The certificate that was issued and sent to the registrar could only
state that the cause of death as was known as the time, which is why it
had to use the words &#147;not ascertained&#148;; it was not
possible at that stage to give a medical cause. The coroner decided not
to resume the inquest because it was impossible to ascertain exactly
how Mrs. Morris was killed&#151;I believe that it is
common practice for the coroner not to resume the inquest in such
circumstances; but having said that, there was overwhelming evidence of
an unlawful
killing.</div><a name="09022518000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two possible courses of action open. The first is for the inquest
to be resumed, which the coroner decided not to do. Even if the inquest
had been resumed, the outcome would not have been particularly
satisfactory, because the only possible way that the coroner could have
gone some distance in satisfying the family would have been to place a
correction in the margin of the entry&#151;in other words, it would
remain that the cause of death was not ascertainable, but in the margin
it would read &#147;unlawful killing&#148;. Alternatively, the
family could apply to the High Court, with the consent of the
Attorney-General, to have the original inquiry quashed, and have the
High Court direct the coroner to carry out a new inquest. Getting the
support of the Attorney-General and going through the whole process
would be incredibly time-consuming and
difficult.</div><a name="09022518000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, as the Minister knows&#151;someone wrote to her about the
case&#151;the Attorney-General examined the case carefully. A letter
from the Attorney-General dated 21 October 2008 says that it is for her
to determine, based on the material provided, whether it is desirable
in the interests of justice that an inquest should be held. She said
that in this case, there is no issue over the identity of the deceased
or where or when the bereaved person&#146;s mother died, and that the
question of how is normally interpreted narrowly to mean the cause of
death. She goes on to say that, regrettably, there was no evidence at
the time and there remains none as to the exact medical cause of death.
She said that, none the less, that does not prevent a coroner from
making a finding that the deceased had been unlawfully killed,
providing he is satisfied about the matter beyond reasonable doubt. The
Attorney-General held out a chink of hope, but decided not to give
consent for the family to go to the High
Court.</div><a name="09022518000553"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="09022518000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not talking about the odd case. I have obtained a copy of the Home
Office statistical bulletin, supplementary volume two, on crime in
England and Wales 2006-07, dated 31 January 2008. Tables 102, 103 and
109 respectively show that in the 12 years to 2006-07, 1,353 offences
initially recorded as homicide currently have no suspect; the apparent
method of killing is not known in 477 offences currently recorded as
homicide; and 2,228 suspects were indicted for homicide when the
outcome of proceedings did not result in a conviction for that offence.
Over the 12-year period, there were a total of 4,058 cases in the
categories that I extracted from table 102 of the bulletin out of a
total of 8,671 cases currently recorded as homicides over the same
period. In other words, just less than half current recorded homicides
have the potential to give rise to the situation that I am talking
about.</div><a name="09022518000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
matter is of public interest and concern. I have not tabled an
amendment yet, but I reserve the right to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>do so on Report. The Minister must look at the matter, which is of great
concern to families. It was raised in the evidence-taking sessions at
the beginning of the Committee, when I asked Andr(c) Rebello and
Professor Furness about changing the death certificate. Professor
Furness said:</div>
<a name="09022518000530"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
future, the certificate would not be issued until the relatives have
had the opportunity to discuss it with the medical examiner. One of the
key questions the medical examiner will be expected to put to the
relatives is whether anything on the proposed death certificate is a
concern.&#148;</div><a name="09022518000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is going some way to sorting out that particular problem.
Andr(c) Rebello then
said:</div><a name="09022518000531"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
I would do in those circumstances is hold an inquest after ordering the
post mortem and before getting the result. I would then use the result
to conclude the inquest, and a new death certificate would supersede
the old one.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

c. 55,
Q119.]</div><a name="09022518000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would work if criminal proceedings did not intervene, but it would not
work if the inquest were adjourned because of criminal proceedings. I
would be grateful if the Minister took a close look at the
matter.</div><a name="09022518000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have another concern based on a case that, again, I have had permission
to raise from the family involved. Sue Willis wrote to me from Pilton
in Somerset. Her husband, John, a reasonably young, incredibly fit and
active man, was admitted to hospital on 17 March last year with a
suspected inflamed gall bladder. They could not discover what was wrong
with John, and his health went downhill rapidly. On his 16th day in
hospital, he tragically lost his battle for life. What happened next?
Sue Willis
wrote:</div><a name="09022518000532"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
was informed that I was required to register my Husband&#146;s death
within a few days. To my surprise I was immediately issued with a death
certificate despite the fact that the cause of death had not been
established. I asked my Husband&#146;s consultant about this and he
informed me that, in such circumstances, it was general practice to put
their &#145;best guess&#146; on the death certificate to expedite
the funeral arrangements...In our case, their &#145;best
guess&#146; turned out to be completely inaccurate. The death
certificate stated a heart condition as the main cause of death however
the post-mortem revealed it to be a Large B cell Lymphoma. I approached
the registrars at Southmead Hospital to request an amended death
certificate and was provided with almost the same certificate stating
the incorrect cause of death with a small annotation noting the post
mortem
result&#148;</div><a name="09022518000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
a column at the bottom of the certificate.</div>
<a name="09022518000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sue Willis

stating:</div><a name="09022518000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
appreciate that the circumstances surrounding your

post-mortem without inquest the cause of death was found to be large
B-cell
lymphoma.&#148;</div><a name="09022518000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
note has been put in the margin, but the certificate puts down the
cause of death as the result of a heart attack in hospital.</div>
<a name="09022518000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
severe and serious problem that the Minister must address. I appreciate
the difficulties regarding death certificates, but I want to ask how
often medical practitioners use the best-guess formula. In the future,
medical examiners will be appointed, and presumably the chances of best
guesses being put on the certificate  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>will be greatly reduced. A medical examiner will want to look at the
matter, investigate it and talk to the family&#151;I am probably
making the Minister&#146;s case for her. However, there might still
be the odd case where the certificate gives the wrong cause of death, a
subsequent post-mortem indicates the exact cause of death and the
family are distressed.</div>
<a name="09022518000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding

be of some concern to an insurance company?</div>
<a name="09022518000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000640"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> That is a very good point. I am thinking
perhaps of John&#146;s grandchildren who will certainly want to check
their DNA framework and look for any history of medical illness. The
first thing that they will do is look at the death certificate and
although they might see the note in the margin, they will look
primarily at the principal cause of death on the certificate. I hope
that the Minister will address that case, which I have been given leave
to mention by the family.</div>
<a name="09022518000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also hope
that the Minister will look at the point about death certificates and
at the other case involving Doreen Morris, the correspondence that has
flowed from that and the cumbersome process that is currently available
to a family. Families must persuade the coroner to reopen the inquest,
and it would be rare for that to happen when there has been a criminal
trial and no new evidence has come to light. Going to the High Court
requires the consent of the Attorney-General, and perhaps we could make
that process more family-friendly. There could be something in the
charter for the bereaved to address that. Either way, the ongoing
problem illustrated by those two cases will be carried into the Bill
unless something is done.</div>
<a name="09022518000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000641"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Briefly, I am sensitive to the points made
eloquently by my hon. Friend. I suspect that there is a wide variation
in practice relating to death certificates and the certification of the
medical causes of death, not least because those will often be multiple
and the hierarchy of the symptoms will not necessarily be
clear.</div>
<a name="09022518000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I touched on
this point when I intervened on my hon. Friend about insurance. If we
are considering systemic illnesses of an occupational or other
nature&#151;I use mesothelioma as an example, although not
necessarily conclusively&#151;it is important to have full and
accurate reporting on a consistent basis, so that we can get an idea
about the incidence of such
things.</div><a name="09022518000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
respect to everyone, the Minister included, I do not think that the
Committee is able or medically qualified to systematise everything in
terms of medical reporting. However, it is important for us to try to
get a better understanding of practice, and I hope that the chief
medical examiner will lead on that.</div>
<a name="09022518000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was amazed
by the reticence of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk on
amendment 359, which I have signed, and I wonder whether it goes far
enough. In suspicious circumstances&#151;for shorthand let us call
them Shipman-like circumstances&#151;it enables any medical
practitioner to notify the coroner of any concern over the
circumstances in which a person died. I have revisited that matter, and
it occurs to me that that might not cover the full range of people.
&#147;Medical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>practitioner&#148; could include professions allied to medicine, and
perhaps the Minister will comment on
that.</div><a name="09022518000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could
somebody who cares for, or has regular dealings with, the person, and
who has reasons to enter any reservations, make them to the coroner? No
doubt it happens from time to time that somebody writes anonymously or
from cold to the coroner saying, &#147;I don&#146;t like what
I&#146;ve seen&#148;, or &#147;I think I know something about
this&#148;, and no doubt they could be called as a witness at the
inquest. Some might also have dealings with the police. However, I
wonder whether it is possible to extend the very modest terms of the
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk,
which I support, at least to include circumstances in which somebody
else who was close to the patient&#151;a carer, for
example&#151;felt that something was
wrong.</div><a name="09022518000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000642"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b><b class="B"> </b>I have no problem with the proposition
underpinning the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk. If a medical practitioner suspects, or has reason to believe,
that a person died a violent or unnatural death, or that the cause of
death is uncertain, we would, of course, want the case referred
immediately to a coroner for further investigation. However, I suggest
to him that his amendment is unnecessary, because under clause 17(1),
the</div><a name="09022518000533"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Lord
Chancellor may make regulations requiring a registered medical
practitioner, in prescribed cases or circumstances, to notify a senior
coroner of a death of which the practitioner is
aware.&#148;</div><a name="09022518000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
that covers that same ground as his amendment. Also, it covers the
variety of people who could be described as medical practitioners,
whether nurses, doctors or so
on.</div><a name="09022518000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall turn briefly to the two cases mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.
Medical practitioners can take their concerns to the coroner, as indeed
can anyone else, including the family or registrar&#151;I think that
that is what the hon. Member for Daventry was alluding to; they would
be covered, too. The reformed appeal system will obviously help in at
least one of the cases raised by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk
by allowing the family to appeal to the chief coroner to look at the
inquest again. Also, as of 1 January this year&#151;I realise that
that came after the cases that he has raised&#151;the registration
provisions have been amended to allow fresh registration after a
coroner&#146;s adjournment for criminal proceedings. Since 1 January,
such cases can return to the coroner and be
registered.</div><a name="09022518000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
19(1)(c) provides for an attending practitioner to issue a fresh
certificate if invited to do so by the medical examiner. The cases
mentioned by the hon. Gentleman are excellent examples of when that
could happen. If he wishes, I shall reconsider those
cases&#151;obviously the families concerned need closure, having
suffered great loss&#151;to see whether we can do anything to help to
rectify their situations in the meantime. I recognise his comments
about future generations looking at death certificates for their own
health reasons and so on. However, I think that the provisions
introduced this year, as well as the appeals system under the new
regulations, should ensure that those in such situations will have some
form of redress in the
future.</div><a name="09022518000554"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000643"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I want to discuss amendment 104, which would add to
subsection (1)(e) the words</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div><a name="09022518000534"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including an
investigation into the drugs the deceased had been taking prior to his
or her
death&#148;.</div><a name="09022518000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the reasons why we are here today is that Dr. Shipman
could write anything on death certificates to hide the truth about the
murders that he perpetrated with controlled drugs, which were readily
available to him. Dame Janet Smith has written extensively on that.
Since her report came out, controls have been tightened on the storage
and prescription of drugs such as heroin and morphine.</div>
<a name="09022518000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am
still concerned about doctors writing death certificates without
investigating the cause of death adequately. I therefore strongly
welcome the fact that medical examiners will undertake that duty. It is
my understanding from the Bill and the explanatory notes that the
medical examiner will not only examine the medical notes and perhaps
talk to some of the medical staff, but talk to the family, relatives
and friends to get to the bottom of what caused a person&#146;s
death.</div><a name="09022518000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment refers not only to prescription-only medicines but to
over-the-counter medicines, controlled drugs available on the street
and, indeed, alcohol and other substances, all of which can play an
important role in a person&#146;s death. Anecdotal stories have come
to me in my role as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on
drugs misuse, such as that if a heroin addict is found in the
street&#151;not all, but most people sleeping rough take drugs of one
kind or another&#151;the real cause of death will probably be
ascertained and recorded properly on the death certificate as an
overdose of heroin. However, if a person in a rather well-to-do
household has become a heroin addict, their parents may not want heroin
addiction appearing anywhere on the death certificate, and respiratory
depression or anything else might appear instead, in which case we
cannot get to the root cause of the death of all
people.</div><a name="09022518000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
all drugs, of course, come out of a pharmacy. People buy them on the
street, where they are often contaminated. Some heroin is purer than
other heroin. I also refer to internet sale, which is becoming a bigger
nuisance than ever. Some 10 per cent. of all medicines obtained on the
internet are counterfeit, so people who take them do not have a clue
what they are taking&#151;it might be Viagra, but it could be
anything else. The same applies to medicines available from certain
pharmacies on the internet. I am not saying that all internet
pharmacies are bad. Some are highly regulated, particularly in Britain,
but if a person has been abroad, it is certainly another
story.</div><a name="09022518000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
care settings, it is not unknown&#151;in fact, there have been
several cases&#151;for medical staff, including nurses, to overdose
patients&#151;generally older patients or patients who are vulnerable
in some other way&#151;with medicines. That has happened in hospitals
and residential homes, as right hon. and hon. Members know. I am
therefore pleased that the medical examiners will be able to talk to
people and perhaps ascertain the real cause of
death.</div><a name="09022518000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other reasons why I am interested in proper medical certificates
and an investigation into the drugs that a person may have been taking
immediately or perhaps some time before their death. One of them is
that the national programme on substance abuse deaths, which is based
in the centre for addiction studies at St. George&#146;s hospital
medical school here in London, has been collecting and publishing data
on drug-related 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>deaths for several years now from all the coroners&#146; jurisdictions
across Britain. I have a copy of one of those reports,
&#147;Drug-related deaths as reported by coroners in England and
Wales&#148;.</div>
<a name="09022518000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those reports
are extremely useful to the national treatment agency and to others
involved in the misuse of drugs&#151;they are interesting to
me&#151;because they show the rapidly changing scene in the illicit
drug market. Perhaps Peterborough is a hot spot today; next year it may
be Blackpool. The reports show which towns and cities across England
and Wales have the greatest drug misuse problems by recording such
information. However, it was difficult for St. George&#146;s hospital
to start collecting the material, partly because coroners did not
originally comply with requests, although that has now been overcome,
but mainly because the death certificates have not always been
accurate, as I have already
explained.</div><a name="09022518000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reason why it is important to know the real cause of death and
whether drugs, illicit or otherwise, were involved&#151;that is often
difficult to get to the bottom of, because such activities can be
covert, as I shall explain&#151;is that epidemiologists look at death
certificates as well, and they, too, are interested in trends of why
people are dying and what is causing those
deaths.</div><a name="09022518000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000644"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I want to reinforce the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comment by reporting some correspondence that I received this weekend
from a constituent who is concerned about ketamine abuse&#151;the
first time that I had ever heard of the phenomenon. Ketamine is a class
C drug, and my constituent has asked me to make representations to the
Home Office about that. My constituent makes the point that the use of
ketamine is now prevalent in, for example, my market towns and, in
terms of her daughter&#146;s health, it is extremely damaging. I
suspect that if, sadly, her daughter were to lose her life as a result,
it would be so diffuse and difficult to pin down ketamine as the
underlying cause of the medical presentation and cause of death that it
would probably never be picked up by
anyone.</div><a name="09022518000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000645"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I accept that it is often difficult to get to the
bottom of the real cause of
death.</div><a name="09022518000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, I am chairman of the all-party parliamentary drugs misuse
group, which has just published an interesting report on physical
dependence and/or addiction to over-the-counter medicines, which one
can buy by walking into a chemist&#146;s shop, and to prescription
drugs. The main body of evidence concerns benzodiazepine misuse.
However, let me stick to codeine-based products, which are the
commonest that can be bought in a shop&#151;some of them have
&#147;plus&#148; or &#147;extra&#148; at the end of their names
and are vigorously advertised on
television.</div><a name="09022518000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the evidence that we have collected, we have come across patients
taking between 30 and 70 analgesic or anti-inflammatory tablets. I do
not want to mention any brand names, but they are in our report. A lot
of the substances are co-medications, by which I mean codeine at a
fairly high dose level&#151;12.5 mg per tablet, which is higher than
the normal dose in other products&#151;is co-medicated with other
medicines such as ibuprofen. The United Nations international narcotics
board has already highlighted in its reports that the misuse of
over-the-counter and prescription medicines is now 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>exceeding the abuse of controlled drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and the
others, which is a remarkable statement. When the United Nations say
that, it is getting
serious.</div><a name="09022518000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
United Nations also says that, by taking enough codeine, the same buzz
can be obtained legally, at a much cheaper price than buying heroin
illegally on the street. However, the problem is that quite a lot of
tablets have to be taken to get that buzz. If taking ibuprofen at the
same time, the inevitability is that someone will suffer serious
gastro-intestinal bleeding leading to death. Unfortunately, such
activities are covert. The wife in a family may be doing that, unknown
to children and husband, and they may suddenly die at quite a young
age. It is important that we look into those problems in more detail
than ever
before.</div><a name="09022518000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to mention poly-drug use. Let us say that someone is taking
cocaine at the same time as drinking considerable volumes of alcohol.
They may be on other substances as well, which complicates the issue
even further. However, just cocaine and alcohol will produce a very
toxic material called cocaethylene. If no one asks whether the person
was drinking alcohol or what they were doing in the night or week
before they died, those problems may not be picked up by doctors, the
medical examiner or the
coroners.</div><a name="09022518000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
analysis of drugs is very easy. It need not even be intrusive. One can
cut off a piece of a person&#146;s hair, subject it to a chemical
process called mass spectrometry and readily find out which drugs are
in that sample of hair. One can go further, of course, and use body
fluids such as
blood.</div><a name="09022518000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Samaritans has sent a second document to the Committee picking up that
problem:</div><a name="09022518000535"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
relatively important items are often not recorded, e.g. contact with
psychiatric services, date of last contact with GP, blood levels for
drug overdoses, source of drugs taken in
overdoses&#148;</div><a name="09022518000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so on. It strongly
recommends</div><a name="09022518000536"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
development of further measures which could improve the development of
data collection for the purpose of informing research and strengthening
suicide prevention
strategies.&#148;</div><a name="09022518000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say in
response to the
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000646"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> It is with trepidation that I rise to speak
following my hon. Friend, who has given the Committee very detailed
information on some of the serious problems that people around the
country have in taking medication, whether legal or otherwise. I
commend what he and his all-party group do in highlighting those
problems and not only raising them in this debate but bringing them to
the attention of the wider
public.</div><a name="09022518000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East is right that the
information included by the attending practitioners on medical
certificates of cause of death is an important source of data for a
number of organisations, partly because it will give us more
information about mortality rates generally associated with particular
diseases, but also because it will be invaluable to people such as
clinicians, to those responsible for planning and managing health
services, to the general population&#151;not just the relatives of
those who have died, but those who could be at risk of specific
diseases&#151;and to people such as my hon. Friend and the all-party
group, who can then do further research in these areas in order to help
to persuade the Government on how best to tackle those
problems.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div><a name="09022518000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
introduction of scrutiny of the cause of death by medical examiners
will, I believe, lead to a significant improvement in the quantity,
quality and consistency of the data on the death certificate. The
inquiries undertaken by medical examiners when they are undertaking
medical scrutiny will reflect different combinations of care setting,
stated cause of death and circumstance, which my hon. Friend the Member
for Bolton, South-East has referred to. That will include discussions
about the medical history and other relevant information, such as what
the person had been doing, who they had been associating with and so
on, including any medication that they had taken before death. It would
not be appropriate, therefore, to highlight any single element of those
inquiries in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022518000555"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="09022518000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend by saying that if a death has
resulted from the misuse of drugs or illicit drug use, it would almost
certainly be reportable to a coroner, in which case the coroner could
obviously call for a post-mortem. Then the coroner, not the medical
examiner, would ensure that all the conditions and events that
contributed to the death are properly recorded. The medical examiner,
of course, could recommend to the coroner the types of examinations,
such as a full toxicology report to establish the substances in the
body. I hope that the Bill, which gives both medical examiners and
coroners the power to investigate further on a much wider spectrum,
will give my hon. Friend some
reassurance.</div><a name="09022518000219"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000649"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> This is an extremely important clause, and it
would be made a great deal more effective by the new clauses that we
have tabled. They would, in effect, bring back the proposal to set up a
coroner for treasure that was contained in the original draft
Bill.</div>
<a name="09022518000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
provide some background and history, because it might be of interest to
the Committee. The Treasure Act 1996 provided a new definition of finds
that must be reported to coroners as treasure, and which are then
offered to museums to acquire. This process has turned out to be very
successful: before 1996 there were roughly 25 finds a year, but last
year there were 804, in 2007 there were about 700, and in 2006 there
were 600. In other words, a large number of finds are being reported
that were not reported previously.</div>
<a name="09022518000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
system is working well. For example, in my constituency, a few years
ago, some Iron Age gold torcs were found in and around a village called
Snettisham. That gave rise to a great deal of local publicity as they
were worth a huge amount of money and are now in Norwich museum. That
was a major local event that obviously brought a great deal of money to
the finder and owner of the land on which the torcs were found. In
practice, most reported finds are sent on to the finds liaison officers
of the portable antiquities scheme, who liaise with the British Museum,
whose staff then write a
report.</div><a name="09022518000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
coroners hold an inquest into finds wanted by museums. In 2007, I
understand, fewer than 300 cases went to an inquest. Often, the inquest
is a small paper exercise, and a major inquest will only take place if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>there is a dispute with the museum. The remaining cases are disclaimed
and the objects returned to the owner of the land or the finder.
However, the truncated inquest process still takes up time. The find
will be valued by the Treasure Valuation Committee, and the money split
between the landowner and finder.</div>
<a name="09022518000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
need for speed. Finders&#151;the metal detectors&#151;whom we see
from time to time in fields around our constituencies, are a dedicated
bunch of enthusiasts. However, they are often impetuous; they want
their money and there is always a temptation to put their finds on eBay
and sell them quickly. Unscrupulous metal detectorists may do that, but
we hope that they are few in number. The Treasure Act 1996 code of
practice states that the reward should be paid within 12
months. For that to happen, coroners need to hold the inquest within 90
days. The problem is that the target is not being achieved. The picture
is erratic: for example, in Leicestershire and Rutland the average time
taken to hold an inquest is now 49 weeks; in Warwickshire, it is 40.6
weeks; in Northamptonshire, it is 36 weeks; in Wiltshire, it is 39
weeks; and in Norfolk, it is 24.5 weeks. Unfortunately, among the
coroners who are slowest at dealing with treasure cases is the one that
covers the constituency of the hon. Member for Bridgend. He has two
cases outstanding. One has taken three years and 20 weeks, and the
other has taken two years and three weeks&#151;both cases are way
outside the Treasure Act code.</div>
<a name="09022518000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022518000650"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Gray</b> (North Wiltshire) (Con): To be fair to the
coroner for Bridgend, my hon. Friend is probably being rather unkind.
The coroner has a significant problem on his desk. To mention him as
being an offender in this matter seems a little
unfair.</div><a name="09022518000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000651"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I was going to make the point&#151;my hon.
Friend has done it for me&#151;that it is not the coroner&#146;s
fault. He has been facing huge pressure. That is why we need action.
That is why the draft Bill introduced a procedure for setting up a
coroner for treasure.</div>
<a name="09022518000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall cite
some remarks made by the Leader of the House, the right hon. and
learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), when responding
to a debate on coroner reform in February 2006, a debate in which I had
the privilege to speak. She said
that</div><a name="09022518000537"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;treasure
trove is an ancient jurisdiction of coroners. Sometimes, such cases can
take two to three years to resolve, because treasure trove is always
put at the back of the queue and dealt with locally. That does not make
sense. We will make one coroner nationally responsible for treasure
trove and get that dealt with effectively.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 6 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 613.]</div>
<a name="09022518000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it was sensible in
2006, why is it not sensible now? What the Government proposed then
makes a great deal of sense. There is obviously a need for action, but
the draft proposals have been dropped.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000652"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend not think it relevant that to
raise money for the Crown in mediaeval days the coroner had a series of
obligations, of which inquisitio&#151;after death&#151;was one?
Others, for example matters relating to sanctuary and felons, have
fallen away and only this one anomaly is left. It would seem to be
common sense, particularly if it is a military inquest or if there are
other foci of death, to transfer that particular specialist function to
a person appointed for the task.</div>
<a name="09022518000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000653"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend entirely. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div></div><a name="09022518000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister suggests that one way to deal with the problem is through the
transfer of cases. In fact, if one examines what she says, it seems
that cases should be transferred, taken from those coroners who are
slow and given to the more efficient ones. A coroner may be under huge
pressure, which is made worse and added to by the number of treasure
cases. Is it sensible for those cases to be passed to another coroner?
Who will pay the costs of the transfer? The costs will obviously fall
on the local authority&#146;s shoulders; it will be far from
pleased.</div>
<a name="09022518000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The costs of
setting up a coroner for treasure would not be significant. I am
indebted to the British Museum for coming up with some figures. It has
worked out that the cost of setting up a dedicated coroner for treasure
would be between &#163;212,000 and &#163;258,000 a year. A middle
figure would put it at about &#163;225,000 a year. That is a
significant sum, but it is nevertheless only a small percentage of the
cost of the changes entailed in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09022518000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, there will be substantial savings if the work is moved from local
coroners&#146; areas to a national coroner for treasure. The British
Museum has come up with detailed figures. I will not go through the
method of calculation, but it considered the number of inquests, the
number of treasure inquests and the number of treasure inquests as a
percentage of the total. The British Museum has worked out that the net
savings based on a part-time coroner for treasure would be about
&#163;400,000. If the coroner were full-time, the savings would be
slightly less. In other words, if we moved those cases away from the
counties and from the jurisdiction of the senior coroners and put them
in the hands of a dedicated national coroner for treasure, we would
save a substantial amount of money. Even on those figures, the scheme
would be entirely self-funding and cost-neutral.</div>
<a name="09022518000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that there is even an argument for going further still. This may be
controversial&#151;we want to consult on it&#151;but I feel that
there is an argument for saying to the metal detecting community,
&#147;Look, you&#146;re out there making fascinating finds.
It&#146;s in your interest to get paid as quickly as
possible.&#148; In fact, only a couple of months ago, a local metal
detector found a mediaeval necklace in a field adjacent to where I live
that was valued at &#163;20,000. It is a substantial amount; I was
sad that it was not over the boundary. That find is, obviously, of
great benefit to the finder. I would have thought that a small levy of
15 per cent. of the value of a find would not be that unpopular with
the metal detecting community.</div>
<a name="09022518000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we had a
small levy in place, consider how much money it would bring in. For
example, there were 804 finds in 2008. The average value was
&#163;2,000. The total was &#163;1.6 million, so 15 per cent. of
that would be roughly &#163;250,000. If we want to make the scheme
totally self-financing&#151;indeed, to bring in extra money and
perhaps give the coroner for treasure extra resources&#151;a small
levy might be a good way to move forward. I am not saying that we will
definitely do so, or table an amendment to do so, but a consultation on
the idea might make a lot of
sense.</div><a name="09022518000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we consider the other part of the Bill that has been
removed. It is of concern to me and to certain organisations. It is
important that people are encouraged to report finds. What happens at
the moment, generally, is that people report their finds, but new
clauses 1 to 7, which I tabled, would basically reintroduce the scheme
for establishing a national coroner for
treasure.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div><a name="09022518000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other problems as well. Three other important measures are excluded
from the Bill that were in the original draft. One was the obligation
of anyone who comes into possession of treasure to report finds of
treasure. That is meant to cover the eBay point. As I understand it, a
small number of finds end up on eBay and are sold. The handlers of
those particular items are not committing any offence, nor can they be
pursued in any way, shape or form. If we put that measure back into the
Bill, as new clause 33 would do, that point would be
addressed.</div>
<a name="09022518000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the other part of new clause 33 would give the coroner powers to
require anyone who reports the discovery of a find of treasure to
deliver it to the coroner. At the moment, the duty in the Treasure
Act 1996 simply requires finders to report their findings to
the coroner; they can, in theory, refuse to deliver them. New clause 33
would also allow more time for prosecutions under the Treasure Act 1996
to be brought. At the moment, there is a limitation of six months. We
think that that is inadequate. I agree with the draft Bill that that
period needs to be
extended.</div><a name="09022518000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original proposals for setting up a coroner for treasure have the
support of a lot of organisations&#151;obviously, the British Museum,
as well as the Institute of Archaeology, University college London, the
Society of Antiquaries of London, the all-party archaeological group
and the National Council for Metal Detecting. They are keen that the
original proposals under the draft Bill should go ahead. I hope that I
have made a strong case. It has been put to us by several
organisations, and I am particularly indebted to the British Museum for
its
briefing.</div>
<a name="09022518000556"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="09022518000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not asking too much to question the Government about why they
removed from the draft Bill such excellent proposals and to suggest
that we could make matters self-financing. I entirely take on board the
Minister&#146;s point that we do not want to burden her
Ministry&#146;s budget at a time when budgets are under huge
pressure, but if we can win the argument about the scheme being
cost-neutral and top it up perhaps with a small levy&#151;something
for discussion in the future&#151;we will have a win-win
situation.</div>
<a name="09022518000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000654"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I support all the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments, and I have in fact added my name in support of the new
clauses. The Government&#146;s proposal for a coroner for treasure
under the draft Bill was extremely popular. No one opposed it, so it is
unclear why it has now been withdrawn. Calculations have shown that
such an appointment can be put into practice at low cost, if any cost
at all. It might even save significant sums in the long
run.</div><a name="09022518000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the points made by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk,
I draw attention to the statute of limitations for prosecutions under
the Treasure Act 1996. Prosecutions cannot be taken after
six months. Given the delays in many coroners&#146; areas for
understandable reasons, it means that the inquest would not have taken
place by the time the police need to decide whether to prosecute. There
have been a couple of cases when the police have not been able to
proceed because the inquest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>had not taken place in time for them to do so. We want a system that
works and is effective. We want to encourage people to produce their
finds. We want coroners to undertake inquests and to know about the
historical artefacts that are found throughout the country. To enable
that to take place, we want to make sure that the reverse of what is
happening is in practice so that, if someone does not do what they are
supposed to do and does not report such matters to the authorities,
they can be prosecuted when necessary. Otherwise, the law will not
operate effectively. I hope that the Minister can take that point into
consideration in her
response.</div>
<a name="09022518000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000655"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> It is tempting to be persuaded by the argument
of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk not least because his
proposals are the same as those under the draft Bill. I cannot
therefore fault him on their accuracy. Nevertheless, other issues that
were in the draft Bill are no longer in the one before us. That might
be a matter of regret in some quarters, but the decision to remove the
proposal for a coroner for treasure was made on the basis that the
annual number of cases is between 600 and 800, only tens of which
result in inquests, so it was felt that they could be absorbed in the
system.</div><a name="09022518000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022518000656"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): On that basis, clause
11 ought to be excised from the Bill without further argument. The
Minister started off with two, and now she is down to
one.</div><a name="09022518000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000657"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is not quite as persuasive an argument as
the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has just made. I shall leave it
there for the
moment.</div><a name="09022518000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central highlighted, there is concern
about treasure cases being delayed. Coroners are dealing with
investigations into deaths and other matters. However, the arrangements
for investigating treasure cases will benefit from other parts of the
Bill. For example, coroners will be able to transfer treasure cases
between each other and take advantage of expertise that has been built
up, particularly in certain categories of treasure find. Also, the
chief coroner will be able to direct a case transfer to avoid delays
and backlogs, and take advantage of the expertise of other
coroners.</div><a name="09022518000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000658"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> While I remain puzzled why the Government removed
the idea of a treasures coroner from the Bill, the notion that somehow
the difficulty could be answered by shifting a case from one coroner to
another ignores the fact that there is no mechanism in the Bill or
anywhere else, as far as I am aware, for moving money from one local
authority to another to follow a case. How will the Minister compensate
the receiving coroner, who could have large numbers of treasure cases
arriving at their
doorstep?</div><a name="09022518000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000659"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> It would not necessarily be the case that a
receiving coroner would get large numbers of cases arriving on their
doorstep. The chief coroner would have to direct that, which would be
unusual, because it will build up a problem. However, as I said in the
Committee&#146;s evidence-taking sessions, the jurisdiction of the
sending coroner would pay the receiving jurisdiction any costs that
arise.</div>
<a name="09022518000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000660"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That would encourage sclerosis, because the
sending coroner&#146;s area, to preserve its budget and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>save its local authorities money, would build up a backlog rather than
send a case out. It is cheaper to build up a backlog than send a case
from Norfolk to Leicestershire or vice versa. Although I have listened
with great interest to the Minister, nothing that she has said so far
seems to undermine the wisdom of the draft Bill, about which she seems
to have
forgotten.</div><a name="09022518000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000661"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I certainly have not forgotten about the draft
Bill or the wisdom therein. The local authority could, for example,
make arrangements for more assistant coroners to be appointed to deal
with a backlog. The new clauses are perfectly reasonable, but I should
like to point out that there are measures in the Bill that would be
helpful as far as treasure is concerned. Obviously, there are
difficulties with the current system. We are working with the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport to amend the Treasure Act 1996
code, and we will consult interested organisations on the
implementation of those reforms. We also want the finders of treasure
to be confident in the system, and will work towards that in the coming
months.</div>
<a name="09022518000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
duty in new clause 33 on any person who acquires a property that they
have reason to believe is treasure to notify the coroner&#151;it
would have been the case even under the draft Bill&#151;would be
difficult to monitor. Also, coroners could end up being notified of any
object belonging to third parties, meaning that they would be
unnecessarily inundated with notices of all finds if there is a fear
among collectors that they could face criminal prosecution
otherwise.</div>
<a name="09022518000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, coroners are required to determine whether further items
of which they are notified are in fact treasure or treasure troves.
Those reporting the find after acquiring the object might simply not
know, or could claim that they do not know, when or where the object
was found. In such cases, the coroner would be required to make a
determination without necessarily having appropriate evidence. By
contrast, under clause 20(2), a coroner remains able to conduct an
investigation concerning an object of which no notification has ever
been given, provided that he has reason to suspect that the object is
treasure or treasure trove and that it is located within his or her
coronial area. Therefore, irrespective whether a find has been reported
by a third party, the coroner could still conduct an investigation into
the object. It can be argued that it is not necessary to regulate the
issue by introducing a statutory
duty.</div><a name="09022518000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are aware of the work that the British Museum has been doing with
regard to eBay and monitoring potential treasure finds. We will be
working with DCMS to find ways of tackling those issues and to educate
people&#151;as the hon. Gentleman suggested&#151;making them aware
of their obligation to report, by working on the Treasure Act 1996
code.</div>
<a name="09022518000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
duty to deliver objects to a designated person, as directed by the
coroner, is unnecessary. There has never been a case under the current
system where anyone has refused to hand over an item. If such a
situation were to arise, clause 24 in schedule 4, gives the senior
coroner the power to demand the production of any items relevant to the
investigation for examination or testing that are in the custody or
control of the person. Failure to comply with such an order, without
reasonable excuse, would result in a fine not exceeding
&#163;1,000.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div><a name="09022518000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently,
the proposed new limitation period for bringing an action under the
proposed sections 8A and 8B, including section 8 of the Treasure Act is
not required in respect of the coroner&#146;s
jurisdiction.</div><a name="09022518000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am therefore interested in the British Museum&#146;s analysis of how
much this would cost&#151;it is about two thirds of what our figures
suggest that the annual cost of a coroner for treasure would be. I
agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is not a particularly significant
sum, although he is, kindly, aware of the budgetary difficulties that
we are looking at.</div>
<a name="09022518000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw these
amendments.</div>
<a name="09022518000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000662"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> The Minister has directed her remarks mainly to new
clause 33, and those aspects of the Bill. She has largely ignored new
clauses 1 to 7 and the establishment of a coroner&#146;s treasurer.
Leaving aside the question of money, which she has addressed briefly
and which is a fairly marginal matter, what does she have to say of the
allegation that these provisions which were in the draft Bill were
excised from this Bill, not because there is anything wrong with them,
but because of a massive cull which removed as much as it possibly
could in order to get in things that we do not like, such as data
protection and so forth. Is there any proof that civil servants went
through the Bill and cut out the bits they thought they could without
anyone complaining?</div>
<a name="09022518000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000663"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I say categorically that there is no truth
whatsoever that civil servants were cutting out bits of the Bill in
order to put in bits that people are complaining about, or may
otherwise have complained about.</div>
<a name="09022518000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000664"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> In the interests of open government, which I know
the Minister is fond of&#151;although following the statement from
the Secretary of State this afternoon, I rather wonder&#151;will the
Minister place in the Library the policy notes that went with the draft
Bill in 2006? We could then see the power of the Government&#146;s
thinking in that year, which recommended the new clauses that my hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk has so eloquently addressed
the Committee about. Presumably, unless there has been some fundamental

any other good reason as to why the coroner for treasure is not in the
Bill at this stage. I ask him to have a read of this document, which
sets out the policy reasons behind the decision in 2006. I ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw his amendment, so that I can check that it is not
flawed in any way and so that I may therefore be able to look at it
more sympathetically in the future.</div>

nothing to withdraw because these new clauses have not yet been moved.
If, and when, we reach them in the

new clause 33, that there may well be a number of technical issues
around that. But I am still convinced that it would not be difficult to
re-insert the principle of establishing a national coroner for treasure
into the Bill. The Minister has said that she will look at the costs. I
hope that she will come back to me as a matter of urgency, because it
is my intention to press new clause 1 to a vote at the appropriate
stage&#151;if we win that, then we will also have to vote on the
other 16 new clauses. Maybe the Minister can prevent that from
happening and come up with costs that will run in tandem with those
that the British Museum have proposed. Then we can all be happy and
re-insert the proposals, which are excellent, into the
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000672"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I shall be brief on this. The two amendments,
which are slightly on different issues, are both simple. Amendment 119
is linked to the previous discussion that we had earlier today on
ensuring the full co-operation and co-ordinated working between medical
examiners and senior coroners. It would make it clear that the medical
examiner areas would have the same boundaries as each coroner area. If
the boundaries were not the same, it would be more difficult for the
medical examiners to co-ordinate their work fully with coroners, and
for coroners to be clear as to who it is that they should apply to.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="09022518000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000673"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I should like to hear the hon.
Lady.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div><a name="09022518000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000674"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> It would make it more difficult if there were a
number of different medical examiners who a coroner would be liaising
with on a regular basis. Amendment 126, which I have also tabled,
relates to the situation when the boundaries of coroner areas are
changed. The wording of the Bill suggests that currently, the Lord
Chancellor must consult the local authorities that he deems
appropriate. I am sure that that is the intention, but since it is not
clear in the Bill, my amendment clarifies that he must consult the
local authorities that are affected by the boundary change. Usually, I
would have expected that the Lord Chancellor would do that
automatically, but it is not clear in the Bill that that is the
requirement. Given that coroner areas are often across different local
authority areas, and that any changes could affect multiple local
authorities both before and after the change, it seems sensible that it
is a requirement that all of those affected should be consulted.
Otherwise, it would all be too easy for somebody to be missed out and
not
noticed.</div><a name="09022518000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022518000675"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I have a
couple a points that fit, but not quite in the current
context&#151;they are more related to a stand part debate. I was
wondering whether you, Mr. Gale, intend to have a stand part
debate on the schedule, or whether it would be helpful if I made those
remarks and sought the Minister&#146;s response
now.</div>
<a name="09022518000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000676"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am perfectly relaxed about the position. If
the right hon. Gentleman would like to treat this as a stand part
debate, that is fine by
me.</div><a name="09022518000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000677"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am exploring the thinking behind the position
in the Bill, which is the continued situation of the location of
coroners&#146; requirements in local government. I tabled an
amendment, which is currently starred, that suggests that the Secretary
of State become the relevant authority for each coroner area. The
reason is that there is an anomaly that the coroner service is the only
judicial service that remains in local government. That leads to a
peculiarity in a number of ways because the coroner service and the
work of a coroner is judicial in its nature. We will have a situation
where local authorities or local police authorities are responsible for
the funding and delivering of the service, but have little or no
control over costs. National standards will be established and
monitored by the chief coroner, and coroners can be removed from office
only by the Lord Chancellor. There is a rather odd mixture of local and
non-local issues. That fits with the concerns expressed about new
clause 19 in an earlier debate regarding situations where there are no
unusual circumstances concerning either a particular event or some of
the pressures that have arisen from service personnel and so
on.</div>
<a name="09022518000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
always a tension between local and national matters. It has been
suggested, for example, that had there been a different deployment of
Ministers in the 1940s, we might have ended up with a national
education service and a local health service, and there is a tension in
both of those between national and local issues. There seem to be
anomalies in this matter, and concerns have been expressed by people in
local government. That reflects the views expressed by the Justice
Committee&#151;of which I am a member&#151;which stated that it is
difficult to see how a chief coroner could 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>function effectively as a force for standardisation without it being
part of a national service. With the reforms, we see councils playing
for offices, court accommodation, the training of coroners and staff
and a new appeal system. All that is sensible. Most coroners do not
have dedicated courts under the present legislation, and there will be
pressure to provide those in a reformed system. We are looking for
improvements, as is the Minister. The new chief coroner will implement
changes that will impact directly on the management of the service by
councils and the police, including the transfer of cases between
coroners. We have heard about those issues during the course of
today&#146;s debate. The purpose of that is to avoid backlogs and
delays and that is a positive outcome.</div>
<a name="09022518000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
to understand the thinking behind the retention of the local nature of
part of the coroner service, when a national focus is given to the
standards and oversight. Is this a halfway house? Have we thought about
what will happen in the future? Will the Minister set out her case and
comment on the observations made by the Justice Committee about the
Bill and about the way that we as a Committee consider that the coroner
service could be improved by moving towards a consistent service across
the country?</div>
<a name="09022518000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000678"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will start by responding to the comments made
by the hon. Lady, and then I will comment on what my right hon. Friend
has said.</div>
<a name="09022518000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
hon. Lady that the amendments are both impractical and unnecessary.
Amendment 119 is impractical because coroners areas are based on local
authority areas. Medical examining areas will be dictated by the
boundaries of primary care trusts and local health boards, and those
are not coterminous. Primary care trusts are accountable to their local
communities and to the Secretary of State through the strategic health
authorities. In 2005 the Department of Health set out proposals for
reconfiguring strategic health authorities and primary care trusts.
Although it sought to strengthen relationships between health care and
local authorities by bringing the boundaries closer together, it also
made it clear that there is no single blueprint for the future shape of
PCTs and SHAs. The most important thing is to secure high-quality safe
health care services. Therefore, the Department of Health feels that
one size cannot fit all and make every boundary exactly the
same.</div>
<a name="09022518000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000679"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I would like some clarification. The coroner
areas are not one local authority area, so local authorities already
have to coordinate to ensure that funding is made available to provide
a coroner service across those areas. For example, the area that I
represent has five constituencies and two local authorities within one
coroner area. In Wales, after the reorganisation, there will still be a
link between local authority areas and the health boards. In England,
there may not be one PCT for one local authority area but the
boundaries are pretty much the same. Given that coroner areas are
already linking, why can the same not be done for
MEs?</div><a name="09022518000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000680"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> In a sense I agree that they can
link&#151;that is the whole point&#151;but they do not have to be
coterminous. It is impractical to try to make each coroner area match a
primary care trust area. One can look at it the other way round and say
that coroners are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>appointed and funded by local authorities, whereas the coroner area
usually comprises more than one local authority
area.</div><a name="09022518000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
coroners and medical examiners will be independent of each other, they
will work closely together, as the hon. Lady pointed out. In fact,
there will often be several medical examiners serving a particular
coroner. The other thing that I should say, which has not come out in
debate already, is that while coroners will be predominantly full
time&#151;certainly in the future will be full time&#151;most
medical examiners will almost always be part time.</div>
<a name="09022518000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 126
is unnecessary because, if the hon. Lady looks at paragraph 2, schedule
2, the Lord Chancellor, when altering a coroner&#146;s area, before
making an order under that paragraph, must consult</div>
<a name="09022518000538"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) whichever
local authorities the Lord Chancellor thinks
appropriate,</div><a name="09022518000539"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
in the case of a coroner area in Wales, the Welsh Ministers,
and</div><a name="09022518000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">other
people that he thinks appropriate. Therefore, when changing coroner
area boundaries, he will be consulting the local authorities affected
by that change, and that will automatically include those affected by
the change, whether they are increasing or decreasing the boundary, so
the amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="09022518000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to my right hon. Friend&#146;s point about the relationship
between local and national. National organisations are not always
appropriate for all services, and it might not be as cost-effective a
solution as the current system&#146;s problems need. The reformed
system will have the best features of the national structure, by being
headed by a chief coroner, complementing the best features of the local
structure and local delivery. I do not think it is appropriate to
create a new and unnecessary bureaucracy.</div>
<a name="09022518000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
consultation there was considerable argument for keeping the coronial
system local, although people appreciated having the direction and
leadership of a chief coroner at a national level. That chief coroner
will set and monitor the compliance standards. The charter for the
bereaved will contain rules and regulations and there will be an
independent inspection system and an appeals system for the first
time.</div><a name="09022518000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000681"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I will be brief because I do not want to extend
the discussion, but it is possible to have a local service as provided
by the probation service, for example, without it being a local
authority service. I accept that there has to be a local service, but
that does not mean that it needs to continue being a local authority
service.</div><a name="09022518000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000682"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My right hon. Friend has made a perfectly valid
point. It does not have to be a local authority service, but we did at
least two consultations on this policy and local provision was what
people wanted. That certainly was the view among many of the bereaved
families and organisations that we
met.</div>
<a name="09022518000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that reason, I ask
him to accept that it will be a new service with national leadership
but all the benefits of a local provision, with a community aspect that
the bereaved families that we are putting at the heart of the Bill, as
we said earlier, will be able to understand, appreciate and benefit
from.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000684"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I have two simple questions for my hon. Friend the
Minister, the first of which concerns the employment rights of
coroners. For 10 years I campaigned to change the status of
registration officers. They were statutory officers, which meant that
they had no formal employer and no formal right to go through any
employment legislation, including employment tribunals, if they were
considered to be unfairly dismissed.</div>
<a name="09022518000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">During many
debates in which I tried to convert registration officers so that they
would be covered under employment laws&#151;that came about in the
Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007&#151;I learned that
coroners were almost certainly statutory officers as well. Are they
statutory officers? As such, do they have any rights under the various
employment Acts? My second question concerns indemnity for coroners
when, for example, their verdicts are challenged by a judicial review.
Are they indemnified?</div>
<a name="09022518000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000685"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> To answer my hon. Friend&#146;s first
question, coroners are office-holders and are judicially independent.
We cannot recall an example of one ever having been dismissed, which
might open another debate that we will not go into at the moment. They
may have rights to compensation under article 1 of the ECHR, but that
has never been tested. That is as much as I can advise him on that
issue. On the issue of indemnity against judicial review, yes, they
will have indemnity. That will be covered in the regulations made under
clause
6.</div><a name="09022518000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000686"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we embark on schedule 3, which has a lot
of amendments, we had better do a little housekeeping. I understand
that there is likely to be a Division in the House at about 7.20.
Unless somebody leaps to their feet and moves the adjournment, I
propose to sit until then and suspend the sitting until 8.30. That will
give hon. Members time to vote and eat, quickly; it will not allow for
a luxurious dinner. If anybody changes their mind, I would like to
know, as I need to let the Officers of the House

heard what Andr(c) Rebello had to say could only be impressed by
his hard work and his total commitment to the job. He made it clear
that he was on duty 24/7. He could be rung up at any hour of the day.
He said that he was under constant pressure, and pointed out that he
was persistently underfunded. He also made it clear that coroners live
in constant anticipation of some ghastly local disaster. The office
carries pretty poor pay and allowances and is not likely to appeal to
everyone. On the other hand, it carries power&#151;the coroner has
the power to summon witnesses to an inquest to give a
statement&#151;and a great deal of prestige in the local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>community and among local professions. Many coroners have a civic role,
as well, attending the mayor and corporation at civic occasions. What
the office of coroner represents is the very best of localism. Many
coroners are third or fourth-generation coroners from a particular
family, and they take a huge pride in their work. I have spoken to many
county coroners and have been incredibly impressed with their total
dedication and professionalism. They really pride themselves on the
professional service that they can give to the
community.</div><a name="09022518000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why Conservative Members have always been very much in favour of
maintaining the best of localism. That is why we support the
Minister&#146;s decision to put in place a national overarch, the
national coroner and the deputy national coroner, but with strong local
autonomy under it. However, it is important that the office of senior
coroner be truly independent, and the offices under it, the area and
assistant area coroners, must be totally independent. That is why our
amendments 44 and 46 strike out the provisions in the Bill to give the
power of appointment of the area and assistant area coroners to the
local authority. That would be a bad move. At the moment the county
coroner appoints his deputy and assistant deputy. I put it to the
Minister that, if we give the power of appointment of the more junior
ranks to the local authority, there may well be possible conflicts of
interest.</div><a name="09022518000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">What,
for example, would happen in the scenario&#151;unlikely, I accept,
but possible&#151;of a local authority falling out with the senior
coroner? It could be over resources, the senior coroner demanding
facilities or how he has handled a particular inquest. In any event, I
suggest that there could be a serious falling out between the local
authority&#151;or perhaps the police authority&#151;and the senior
coroner. Under the arrangements as envisaged in the Bill, the local
authority could say, &#147;Right, we are going to appoint an area and
assistant area coroner under you whom we know full well you will not be
able to work with&#148;, thus causing strife and probably leading to
the resignation of the
coroner.</div><a name="09022518000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments are taking an extreme case, but what the Bill as it stands
does is to take away an important task from the senior
coroner&#151;the power to appoint his two key deputies. If we are to
have a coronial system that works smoothly and well, it is crucial that
the senior coroner and his deputies get on well together and work
together as a team. That is the essence of amendments 44 and
46.</div><a name="09022518000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a need for the office to be properly independent. The Minister
mentioned a moment ago that the office, as it stands, contains proper
judicial independence. She mentioned that in future, the coroners will
be independent. On the other hand, the Bill states clearly that the
office of coroner will no longer be a freehold office. Freehold, which
I remember from my early days of law, implies a degree of independence.
It implies a degree of self-sufficiency and control over one&#146;s
own destiny. It implies, in this context, judicial independence. To
remove the office&#146;s status&#151;the freehold status&#151;and
move it over to being an office of the local authority would take away
that judicial independence. It would make the coroner a servant of
another agency, another authority. It would also imply that, rather
than being totally independent, he or she could be controlled by that
third party. That would be a very negative move.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div><a name="09022518000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it not also
important to have a proper career structure for coroners? Is it not
important that we try to attract the most able, capable people to the
post of senior coroner? The Minister has said on a number of occasions
that it is important to have the highest calibre men and women applying
for the posts. Surely it makes no sense at all for there to be a glass
ceiling on the career structure of senior coroners. Why should they not
be able to apply for the post of chief coroner or deputy chief coroner?
There is no reason why they should not apply for those posts. If they
have the necessary qualifications and experience, there is no reason
why they should not apply; hence we have tabled amendment 36. It is
important that senior coroners do not have a glass ceiling on their
career structure and that they are given the opportunity to apply for
the top jobs. That is the essence of amendment 36. It is also very
important that they retain their current retirement
age.</div><a name="09022518000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000692"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I cannot accept amendments 44 and 46&#151;I
will manage to find the others in a moment. They run entirely contrary
to what we are aiming to achieve in the Bill, which is to create an
open, transparent and consistent system for appointing coroners. The
system at the moment is largely opaque. It is not uncommon&#151;the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk obliquely referred to
this&#151;for a coroner to appoint as a deputy or an assistant deputy
someone from their own legal practice or someone who is otherwise known
to them. That, in turn, clearly causes disadvantage to anyone else who
might be interested in applying for the post when the senior coroner
position becomes vacant if they have not been in that law firm. It also
means that vacancies might never be made known to potential candidates
who might be better people to fill those vacancies. As well as creating
a lack of transparency, it has led in the past to a lack of diversity
among those in coroner
posts.</div><a name="09022518000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we do all that we can to enable diversity of coroners
to reflect the diversity of our society. Having the local authority
advertise vacancies, with an agreed and published set of criteria that
candidates must meet, is one of the fundamental measures that we take
in this part of the Bill. It will allow all potential qualified
candidates with an interest to apply and will allow the local authority
to select the best person for the
job.</div><a name="09022518000332"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022518000693"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Howarth</b> (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab):
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk made the point that some coroner
families are into the fourth generation. Does that not rather make my
hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s point&#151;or are some people just
genetically predisposed to being
coroners?</div><a name="09022518000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000694"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am not sure that anyone is genetically
predisposed to being a coroner, but my right hon. Friend is right to
say that the hon. Gentleman did rather make my case for me. Under the
new, transparent system, there will be an additional check, in that the
chief coroner, who is responsible for ensuring consistent standards
throughout the system, and the Lord Chancellor will have to consent to
the appointment of all coroners. With that new scrutiny in place,
consistency and transparency will become much more apparent. In
addition, it will increase public confidence in the system and people
will see that the best candidates have been
recruited.</div>

turn to amendments 47 and 33, which deal with increasing the retirement
age of coroners from 70 to 72 for which I see no justification.
Schedules 3 and 7 set out a new retirement age of 70 for coroners and
chief and deputy chief coroners. There is no retirement age at present:
the office of coroner is freehold. The introduction of a retirement age
will bring consistency with the rest of the judiciary and allow for
better succession planning.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000695"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000698"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is now out of order.
The question was out of order. I allowed the Minister, perhaps
unwisely, to half-answer it, and I would now like to get back to the
amendments before
us.</div><a name="09022518000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000699"></a>Bridget

<a name="09022518000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000700"></a>Mr.
Gray:</b> I asked my question to introduce the matter of age
limits. The point that I was making in perhaps a frivolous way was that
the hon. Lady&#146;s argument was that, because of the quasi-judicial
position of a coroner, it was therefore reasonable for them to retire
at the age of 70. I accept that my point was marginally out of order
and that I did not express it well, Mr. Gale, but I wanted
to draw attention to the fact that lots of other highly responsible
work is undertaken in this country that can be done until the ages of
80, 90 or older. If the hon. Lady is of the view that the work of a
coroner requires that the person should retire at the age of 70, why
should that not apply to
politicians?</div><a name="09022518000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000701"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> To ensure that I stay within order,
Mr. Gale, I repeat that we are making the retirement age of
coroners consistent with that of the rest of the judiciary. In
practice, that will make very little difference at the moment because
we shall allow those coroners who are in post to continue for the time
being.</div><a name="09022518000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000702"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the Minister at least consider the
possibility of providing some flexibility or headroom for the future,
so that there is a presumed retirement age&#151;she has selected the
age of 70 for consistency&#151;but in particular circumstances and if
there was a reason for doing so, it would be possible to continue the
appointment for, say, up to a couple or three years? I can imagine
there being a local difficulty or a shortage of suitably qualified
legal persons for the post. It is exactly the sort of the problem that
the High Court had to deal with by drafting back, for example, retired
judges to carry out some
inquiries.</div><a name="09022518000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000703"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I do not object to retired judges being brought
back into the system for particular reasons on some occasions. There is
no reason why that could not continue in the coronial system, too.
Nevertheless,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>most coroners retire voluntarily between the ages of 65 and 70, so it is
unnecessary and undesirable to increase the retirement age to
72.</div><a name="09022518000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the Bill, anyone under 70 who has been legally qualified for five years
would be eligible for appointment as a senior coroner, area coroner or
assistant coroner. Amendment 45 would remove the requirement for
coroners to be legally qualified. In other words, it would allow anyone
to be a coroner if they were under the age of 70, even if they had no
qualifications. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk intended by the amendment, so I hope that he feels
able to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="09022518000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">In future, it
will be increasingly important for coroners to be legally qualified.
Given the duty of investigations that satisfy article 2, legal
qualifications will become even more essential. They will also give the
coroners the skill to examine evidence and conduct investigations in
the most effective way.</div>
<a name="09022518000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, a small number of coroners are both medically and legally
qualified, and about the same number are medically qualified only. The
Coroners&#146; Society tells me that there are about four of each.
Under the reformed system, it will not be necessary for the coroner to
be medically qualified, as the medical examiners will be on hand to
provide independent medical expertise. However, those who are currently
medically rather than legally qualified will retain their posts under
the reformed system and will simply be exempted from the legal
qualification requirement. They will already have picked up forensic
skills through experience and training, and that is not something that
we want  to
lose.</div><a name="09022518000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
36 deals specifically with eligibility for the appointment of chief
coroner and deputy chief coroner. Schedule 7 provides that to be
eligible for appointment as chief coroner or deputy chief coroner, the
person must be a judge of the High Court or a circuit judge. Amendment
36 would allow a senior coroner to be eligible for appointment as chief
coroner or deputy chief coroner. I understand the point made by the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk about the glass ceiling, and I have
some sympathy with it. However, in my view, the scope of the job of
chief coroner probably requires someone with senior judicial status,
such as a High Court judge or a senior circuit judge. To be led by a
figure of that stature heightens the profile of the coroner service.
When determining complex appeals or negotiating for resources
nationally or locally, status can be quite important. I cannot agree
that a senior coroner should necessarily be eligible for appointment as
chief coroner.</div>
<a name="09022518000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am more
open to the suggestion that a senior coroner should be allowed to
become a deputy chief coroner. It is important that we recognise that
there will be more than one deputy chief coroner. Amendments 127 and
128 would allow a senior coroner to apply for that role provided that
they are under the age of 70. As I said, given the experience of senior
coroners who have been working in the system for some time, it is
understandable that they might wish to apply for such an appointment
and I recognise that their skills should continue to be used in that
way. Although I cannot give a firm commitment at this stage to table an
amendment  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>on Report, I will certainly reflect carefully on that aspect of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposals. On that basis, I ask him to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000349"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000704"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> In response to the Minister&#146;s comments
about deputy chief coroners, this is an important point for senior
coroners, who are clearly upset by the suggestion that it is not
appropriate for them to progress in their career to become deputy chief
coroners.</div><a name="09022518000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to flag up a couple of points made to me by a coroner of
significant years&#146; experience who raised a number of concerns
from his personal perspective, particularly regarding the suggestion
that coroners who operate in the courts do not have the appropriate
judicial experience to become a deputy chief coroner. He pointed out to
me that he is the part-time president of the Mental Health Tribunal and
a part-time chairman of the Appeals Service. He gained considerable
experience as an advocate and a solicitor in private practice before
becoming a coroner. He has dealt with more than 100 jury inquests and
used remote video link and voice distortion equipment. He has dealt
with witness intimidation, anonymity and special measures. Those are
all matters that coroners deal with daily, just like other members of
the judiciary, although coroners are not recognised in the same way as
having judicial experience. That is reflected in the Bill&#146;s
current
measures.</div><a name="09022518000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the Minister will come back on Report with proposals to
make the arrangements fairer, so that senior coroners can progress in
their careers, but I would like to flag up one other issue. I
understand her point about the chief coroner being a High Court judge,
and I know that the Coroners Society believes that, especially at the
beginning, the post needs to be held by someone in a significantly high
office, so that it is well respected and has the clout to make the
necessary changes. However, if the reforms are successful, resulting in
improved standardisation and funding across the UK and so on, and if
the coroner service is held in higher regard and given more
recognition, at some point a very experienced senior coroner with a lot
of experience as a deputy chief coroner might be the most appropriate
person to become the chief coroner. It seems unwise to rule out that
possibility completely, even though I understand that perhaps nobody
would wish to take up that option for a while. However, I am glad that
she will reconsider the point about the deputy chief coroner, and I
look forward to hearing her proposals on
Report.</div><a name="09022518000352"></a>

<a name="09022518000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
a point that the Minister made about doctors also serving as coroners,
I appreciate that there will be a five-year phasing out period, but it
would make sense to have doctors serving as coroners as long as they
were told to get at least some basic legal qualification as well. It
would be a great pity to exclude doctors completely from the career
structure, because they could have a great deal to offer. Perhaps she
could reconsider that point, but on the basis of the commitments that
she has given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

that very few know what it means. It is an historical throwback and the

by so doing we will undermine coroners&#146; independence, which is
referred to throughout the Bill. I therefore resist the

much that she will reflect on what I have said. We do not want to be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000714"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> The amendments and new clauses go together quite
well as a group. They are designed to introduce standards for coroners
in various ways. Amendment 259 relates to the terms and conditions on
coroners; amendment 258 would mean that the coroner must publish
regulations on training for senior coroners; new clause 28 would enable
the chief coroner to publish minimum standards that should apply to all
senior coroners in the UK; and new clause 29 would enable the chief
coroner to publish guidance on salaries and fees.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div><a name="09022518000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">This matter
has been raised a number of times already, so I shall be brief. There
are concerns about the inconsistencies in the United Kingdom, both on
standards of service delivery and on the terms and conditions,
salaries, equipment, staffing and support that is provided to coroners
by local authorities. The proposals would improve the uniformity of the
service that is delivered to bereaved families. New clause 28 would
mean that the chief coroner would be able to publish minimum standards
by which local authorities would have to be guided when funding
offices&#151;accommodation and staff&#151;to ensure that coroners
have the basic minimum of support that they need to fulfil their jobs.
Because those standards would be laid out by the chief coroner, it
would not be so much in the hands of local authorities to decide what
they believe is appropriate. Instead, a basic minimum standard would be
applied, which would help coroners in their dealings with local
authorities.</div><a name="09022518000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already highlighted the issue of training. The Government accept
that there is a need for improved consistency in training in the UK to
ensure that there is better uniformity in different coroners&#146;
areas. The Bill states that the chief coroner may publish regulations
about training, but amendment 258 would ensure that such guidance is
published. Given that we all accept the need for it, it seems somewhat
surprising that the Bill enables rather than ensures. That is clearly
important for coroners and for all of us.</div>
<a name="09022518000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
the proposal on terms and conditions and on salary guidance is slightly
contentious. However, a key issue in some areas is that coroners are
not in a strong position when negotiating with local authorities. For
example, the area that the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth and I represent is covered by the coroner for Cardiff and Vale
of Glamorgan, who is employed only on a part-time basis, despite the
fact that she works full-time hours. The local authority has decided
that it only wants a part-time coroner despite the fact that her work
load is far too large. Laying down central standards and guidance for
local authorities on salaries and fees would rule out such anomalies.
The guidance could take into account such things as the number of
inquests, investigations and deaths reported, and the size of an area.
It could also consider transfers between areas, and generally take into
account a coroner&#146;s overall work
load.</div><a name="09022518000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
the chief coroner is in a much better position to consider such things,
because they gather information and can see the bigger picture
throughout the UK, whereas local authorities see a very small part of
the picture and are not in the best position to make decisions on how
much coroners should be paid for how many hours, and what support staff
they need to do their jobs. Currently, as we all accept, there is
significant
inconsistency.</div><a name="09022518000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the four proposals provide a solid basis to enable coroners
to do their job with the resources that they
need.</div>
<a name="09022518000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000715"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I understand that at present, the mechanism for
determining coroners&#146; salaries nationally is an annual
negotiation between the Coroners Society and local government employers
on behalf of local authorities. If that arrangement is discontinued, it
would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>be up to the Local Government Association and the Coroners Society to
decide what alternative machinery should be put in place. Frankly, they
are probably better placed to make the decision, and the Coroners
Society should represent coroners&#146; interests rather than the
chief coroner. I therefore resist the
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
training, subject to the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, the chief
coroner will be responsible for setting national standards and ensuring
that coroners and those who work with them have the training that they
need to meet those standards. There will also be requirements for
specialist training in coronial law and, as the hon. Members for
Cambridge and for Daventry pointed out in earlier debates, there will
be a need for training on the application of the Human Rights
Act.</div>
<a name="09022518000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can assure
the hon. Lady that improved training arrangements will be high on the
chief coroner&#146;s list of priorities. I do not think that they
would be any higher on the agenda if they were there purely through
compulsion. In any event, as an independent judicial appointee, it
would not be appropriate for the Government to compel the chief coroner
to do any particular thing, however essential we may see it as
being.</div>
<a name="09022518000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, new
clause 28 would allow the chief coroner to publish minimum standards
that coroners must meet after consultation with the Lord Chancellor.
That replicates clauses 32 to 34, which already provide for the Lord
Chancellor to issue guidance on the services to be delivered to
bereaved families. Those of us who have looked at the draft charter
know that it includes at paragraph 44 an example of the types of deaths
where specific standards might be set. We would therefore expect
coroners&#146; rules and regulations to deal with such
matters&#151;for example in relation to post-mortems, suspension and
resumption of investigations, disclosure of information, the release of
bodies for funerals and the operation of the appeals system. Such
secondary regulation would have added
force.</div><a name="09022518000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that on that basis, while much of what the hon. Lady has said
about the way the system works is sensible, she will see that it is
already covered in the Bill. Those other areas, relating to employment
and salary negotiation, are best left to those who will be doing the
negotiation.</div><a name="09022518000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000716"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> To clarify, the amendment about salary guidance
is not so much about the amount that an individual should be paid, as
forums are already in place to deal with that. The issue is more to
look at the guidance for what work there is in a particular area and
what needs to be funded there. At the moment, although the guidance is
provided centrally, it clearly does not work as some areas are
significantly underfunded, and the volume of work is far greater than
the hours for which the coroners are paid. The system is not operating
efficiently at the moment, so the suggestion is that there is a better
way to ensure that areas get the resources that they
need.</div>
<a name="09022518000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000717"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Other parts of the Bill give the chief coroner
the powers to look at how local authorities resource the system.
Therefore the reports that the chief coroner will be able to make will
give them the leverage to deal with the overall resource issue as far
as local authorities are concerned.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div><a name="09022518000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000718"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I tabled the amendments because I am not
convinced that the existing powers are strong enough to enable the
chief coroner to do that. We clearly agree in this Committee on what
the outcome needs to be in terms of adequate funding and the resources
to enable coroners to do their job, but we do not necessarily agree on
how to achieve
that.</div><a name="09022518000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point concerns minimum standards. I accept that the issue of
coroners&#146; rules and regulations relates to a lot of their work,
but my concern about the publishing of minimum standards is that they
relate to work load and so forth&#151;the practicalities of running
the office and the service that will be delivered to all families that
come into contact with that service, rather than the way in which an
inquest will operate and so on. There are certain areas that are
already covered by the measures in the Bill, but there are areas where
it is not clear enough. We shall return to the issue on Report, and I
look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s comments
then.</div><a name="09022518000381"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000721"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> This is on similar lines to the previous group,
but from the opposite perspective, requiring the local authority to
take into account the minimum standards when providing
funding.</div><a name="09022518000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that the wording of the clause, as it stands, is
vague&#151;it refers to the local authority having to &#147;take
into account&#148; the staff that are needed and adequate
accommodation. Clearly that is currently being interpreted extremely
widely, as very varied staffing levels and accommodation are provided.
I want to clarify that and to get the Minister&#146;s response to the
duties that will be held by local authorities to ensure that the
provision is adequate, as it does not seem to be at the moment. She has
already commented on many of the issues when we discussed the previous
group of amendments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div><a name="09022518000388"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022518000722"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): The clause imposes a
statutory duty on a local authority to provide adequate resources for
the local coroner service, but what if a local authority does not
provide adequate resources and is in breach of its duty? The Bill is
silent. I asked the Minister that question when she gave evidence on
the first day, and she thought that the ability of the chief coroner to
make an investigation and recommendations, perhaps allied to the
coroner service and the Government of the day putting that authority in
a bad light to the public, might be sufficient pressure. However, the
Government of the day might regret not having the ability to intervene
and sort out such a problem, should the time arise. My amendment 92
proposes one way in which a Government might want to intervene to make
a direction to solve the problem. I am open to the Minister saying that
that is not the right solution, but there should be a
solution.</div><a name="09022518000389"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000723"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I wonder whether I can make an allied point,
which is more of a clause stand part point, but might be helpful for
the Minister to reply to at the same time. I am looking for clarity
about who is responsible for providing the coroner service in future.
Something like 90 per cent. of coroners officers are currently employed
by police authorities rather than local authorities. It is intended
that coroners officers will continue to be employed by either police or
local authorities, with the transfer of the two subject to local
agreement, as is now the
case.</div><a name="09022518000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that, reading the Bill as it stands, the wording appears to
make it clear that local authorities are compelled to provide the
service, if the police do not, but I am not absolutely clear that
police authorities are obligated to carry on providing the service, if
they do so at the moment. My question is, if the Bill goes through in
its present form, police authorities that currently employ coroner
officers must continue to do so unless a transfer to local authorities
is agreed mutually. If that is not absolutely clear, will the Minister
look at it again and seek to make it explicit and clear on Report, so
that there is no
doubt?</div><a name="09022518000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
police can be wonderful, but they can also change their arrangements
quite quickly without looking at the impact on other authorities, which
we have seen on a number of occasions. The hon. Member for Cardiff,
Central will be aware of discussions about changes to some arrangements
in south Wales at the moment, which the police have announced without,
as far as one can see, discussing the matter with anyone. That example
does not involve coroners, but the point is the same. If there are to
be changes in the current arrangements, they ought to involve adequate
notice and agreement between the police authority and the local
authority.</div>
<a name="09022518000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Minister to consider removing any ambiguity on Report to clarify the
Government&#146;s intentions now. The police service already has
heavy involvement in the matter of death investigation, which is going
to continue, whereas it is not really a part of the daily business of
the local authority. I would be happy to accept a short speech from her
saying, &#147;My right hon. Friend is right. The police authority
will not be able to opt out unilaterally from providing the coroner
service.&#148;</div><a name="09022518000561"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
pm</div><a name="09022518000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000724"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am afraid that I cannot commend the amendments
to the Committee, because I do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>think that it would be appropriate to give the Lord Chancellor and the
chief coroner direct powers over local and police authority funding
decisions. However, the Bill will confer on the chief coroner
significant influence over such matters. We believe that his or her
powers of persuasion and negotiation, together with the opportunity to
name and shame recalcitrant local authorities, are probably a more
appropriate and proportionate response to the issue addressed by the
amendments. I am repeating what I said on the matter to my hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford.</div>
<a name="09022518000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know, as
Andr(c) Rebello made clear in his evidence, that some coroners are
very well resourced. It is also important to acknowledge that the
reforms of the death certification system are expected to lead to a
significant reduction in the number of deaths referred to the coroner.
That in itself should lead to significant savings, which can be
reinvested to deliver an improved service for bereaved
families.</div><a name="09022518000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
chief coroner&#146;s powers as a result of the Bill go beyond any
that coroners currently have when negotiating with their local
authorities. In addition, the new inspection regime will examine and
comment on the use of resources. A new complaints system will give a
good indicator of the views of bereaved families and highlight trends
pointing to resource deficiencies. The package satisfies me that the
new arrangements will be sufficient to deliver proper resources to
coroners. If I am wrong, we can return to the matter, but for now, I
contend that the case for the amendment has not been made, and I ask
that it is withdrawn.</div>
<a name="09022518000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth asked about police
authorities. He is right that there must be an agreement between the
local authority and the police authority before officers are withdrawn.
If we need to strengthen that requirement and make it clearer in the
Bill, I will certainly consider it.</div>
<a name="09022518000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 261
would compel a local authority to take into account the
coroner&#146;s view when providing not only accommodation but staff.
Again, I do not believe that that is necessary. The Bill requires a
proper provision of resources and provides a role for the chief coroner
in that. Clause 23 already places a statutory duty on local
authorities, in partnership with police authorities where relevant, to
secure the provision of whatever officers and other staff the coroner
for that area needs to carry out their function. It is therefore
implicit that the coroner will be consulted on their need for
coroner&#146;s officers and other support staff. I therefore ask the
hon. Lady to withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000725"></a>Jenny

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000728"></a>Mr.

states:</div><a name="09022518000540"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

authorisation.&#148;</div><a name="09022518000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is simple. We believe that too many agencies have too much
power to enter and search land or property. That is why we want to
delete paragraph (b) and retain the powers in the hands of the chief
coroner only, not other senior coroners or those nominated by the chief
coroner. The measure is simple and straightforward. It will simply add
safeguards for householders, landowners and other such people who might
come up against a totally unscrupulous situation in which those powers
are abused. I commend the amendment to the
Committee.</div><a name="09022518000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000729"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Amendment 120 relates specifically to the
introduction of a code of practice relating to the entry to land. We
have tabled it because it seems somewhat odd that police officers must
abide by a code of practice but coroners will not need to do
so.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000730"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I was speaking briefly to amendment 120, which
would introduce a code of practice for the entry and search of land. I
would be grateful if the Minister addressed two issues. First, the
police must abide by a code of practice when entering and searching. It
would be helpful for coroners to have a similar code. In some areas
such as health and safety, they must have detailed parameters and
guidance to work
within.</div><a name="09022518000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am afraid that the second issue relates to railway lines and utilities,
which we discussed earlier. The schedule gives the senior coroner the
power to require &#147;any other thing&#148; to be produced or
to</div><a name="09022518000545"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;seize
anything that is on the
land&#148;.</div><a name="09022518000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure it is not intended that that should include things such as
railway sleepers and electrical equipment. Such things are technically
on the land and could be produced or seized, so they fall within the
provision. Will the Minister confirm that that is not the intention and
undertake to consider the wording? There are a number of things that
could be involved that were not intended to
be.</div><a name="09022518000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000731"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Amendment 34 would prevent the chief coroner
from nominating a senior coroner to authorise search and entry. That
would fetter the coroner&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>ability to search and enter premises and to seize items. The clause was
drafted as it is because time is of the essence in such circumstances.
I hope that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important for somebody who can grant the power to be available 24
hours a day. There will be times when the chief coroner or one of his
deputies is not available. The intention is to allow the group of
senior coroners to inform the chief coroner of any permission to search
and enter that they grant. The amendment would mean that if the chief
coroner was unavailable, the quality of evidence could be impaired
severely or lost entirely. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not
wish to impede a coroner&#146;s investigation in that
way.</div><a name="09022518000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 120, I assure the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central that
paragraph 2 of schedule 4 makes it clear that the coroner does not have
the power to require anything to be provided that a person could not be
required to provide to a civil court. I suspect that power lines would
fall into that category. On that basis, I hope she will not press her
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000415"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000733"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I wish to ask the Minister about the powers of the
chief coroner in trying to prevent future avoidable deaths under
paragraph 6 of the schedule. We had a short debate under clause 5 on
what is now called the rule 43 procedure, whereby coroners raise issues
with people who can do something about avoidable
deaths.</div><a name="09022518000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the evidence-taking sessions, we had a debate about what happens in
Australia. The Samaritans stated in a memorandum that it greatly
approves of the procedure there. It mentioned developments in Australia
such as the national database of coronial information, a quarterly
publication called <i class="I">F</i><i class="I">atal Facts,</i> and examples of coronial
recommendations that are published widely. My coroner in Staffordshire,
Mr. Andrew Haigh, sent me a copy of a publication by the
Victorian Government called <i class="I">R</i><i class="I">esidential Age</i><i class="I">d</i><i class="I">
Care Coronial Communique</i>, which is a subscription service for
people connected to residential aged care. I was given volume 3 of
issue 5, from December 2008, which is mostly about the effect of
warfarin. There are three coroners&#146; cases about warfarin, and an
expert commentary about its use as a drug for treating a number of
conditions.</div>
<a name="09022518000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are all
commendable practices from Australia. Under the current drafting of the
Bill, can the chief coroner in this country decide to do that kind of
public information work at a wider level, including subscription
services to people who are interested? I cannot see a power in the Bill
that would allow the chief coroner to do that at all, or to be paid or
claim expenses for doing that. Does the Minister agree that that would
be a valuable service by the chief coroner? If so, is there sufficient
flexibility in the Bill for the chief coroner to have the power to do
that and to have their services  paid
for?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000737"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> The amendments relate to the issue of
coroners&#146; expenses. The Bill replicates the current
circumstances, but there are significant problems with the present
situation regarding expenses. At the moment, a coroner is personally
responsible for paying expenses out of their own pocket and claiming
back for juries, witness costs and general costs of the inquest. That
can be a huge amount of money, particularly in the case of jury
inquests. Coroners pay all that out themselves and claim it back
afterwards. It is a bizarre situation; there are very few&#151;if
any&#151;other jobs where a person would be expected to fund
something like that out of their own pocket and salary.</div>
<a name="09022518000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">A coroner
wrote to me to express his deep concern at having to take on personal
liability for &#163;50,000 because it was considered that LiveNote
stenography recording was important to a particular trial, which
involved the Home Office. Originally, the local authority refused to
guarantee payment, so he had to take on personal liability himself.
That seems a very strange situation.</div>
<a name="09022518000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said earlier that coroners are, or would be, indemnified against the
costs incurred in a judicial review. I have had letters from coroners
that say the exact reverse, so perhaps the Minister could clarify that
point. There seems to be concern among coroners about a lack of such
protection following a couple of cases. I understand that the law has
already been amended a couple of times, but there are still concerns
about the matter and I would be grateful if the Minister clarified that
point today.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div><a name="09022518000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
completely inappropriate that senior coroners have to pay for the costs
of running an inquest out of their own pocket. There is no way that a
judge or magistrate would be expected to pay the running costs of a
court case that they were hearing. It seems extraordinary that coroners
are expected to do that, particularly given that the costs can be quite
substantial. Has that issue been considered, and have any other
suggestions been made to bring coroners in line with the standard
practice of almost every other
employee?</div><a name="09022518000435"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000738"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b><b class="B"> </b>Schedule 6 provides a clear structure for
paying allowances to jurors, witnesses, pathologists, coroners and
anyone else who is eligible to receive them. The structure should be
appropriate and transparent as well as flexible, which will make it
simpler both to claim for and to pay allowances. I am not prepared to
accept the amendments as they stand. None the less, I understand what
the hon. Lady is trying to achieve. There is a discrepancy in coroners
paying out that money directly. We made the change in the 2006 draft
Bill as a direct result of the representations made by the Coroners
Society, which wanted such flexibility to be available. I will have to
think seriously about whether to change that during the Bill&#146;s
progress through
Parliament.</div><a name="09022518000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
judicial review, I can only repeat what I said earlier. Coroners may
have misunderstood something in the past, but I can assure them that
they would be indemnified if they were judicially reviewed. At the
moment, I would be reluctant to remove the local flexibility that the
Bill makes available to both coroners and local authorities in the way
in which reimbursements are
made.</div><a name="09022518000437"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000742"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Amendments 124 and 123 are common sense. I should
be grateful if the Minister confirmed whether my understanding is
correct. The clause states that the Lord Chancellor can ask the chief
inspector to inspect and put together a report, but it does not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>mention whether the chief coroner will receive a copy of that report. I
am sure that it is common sense that the person who is in overall
charge should be able to see such a report and comment on it, but I
should be grateful if the Minister confirmed
that.</div>
<a name="09022518000446"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000743"></a>Bridget

course the chief coroner would receive the report. There may be others

clause 30, page 16, leave out line
26.</div><a name="09022518000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment whose purpose is to clarify what is intended by
subsection (5). The subsection gives the Lord Chancellor the power to
amend the list of reasons for an appeal. Will the Minister explain in
what circumstances such a power would be used? The list is pretty
comprehensive, which would mean that the Lord Chancellor would have a
fairly blank cheque. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister
clarified the intention behind the subsection and what she foresees its
being used
for.</div><a name="09022518000564"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
pm</div><a name="09022518000452"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000746"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> If I were to accept the hon. Lady&#146;s
amendment, it would prevent the Lord Chancellor from amending the list
of coroner decisions that can be appealed under subsection (2), which
would not be desirable. As this is an entirely new system, tailored
especially for the coroner system in England and Wales, it is important
to retain flexibility as the system beds down. It is likely, for
example, that some of the processes contained in the Bill will be
piloted before full implementation. We will be able to see from that
how best to take things forward.</div>
<a name="09022518000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I were to
accept this amendment, it would be impossible to introduce new
decisions that could be subject to appeals or to amend the list of
appeals that are subject to appeal at the moment, even slightly,
without recourse in both cases to primary legislation. If the Lord
Chancellor were to make an order to change decisions that can be
appealed, it would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure
and so would receive full parliamentary scrutiny. It would be both
unnecessary and undesirable at this stage to remove that power from the
Bill. We have already published a delegated powers memorandum alongside
the Bill and will give careful consideration to any recommendations
that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee puts forward
in the other place. Until we have the benefit of that
Committee&#146;s report, I would prefer that the hon. Lady withdrew
her
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000454"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000748"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I beg to move amendment 362, in
clause 30, page 16, line 46, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;, subject to all
coroners enjoying indemnity for
costs.&#146;.</div><a name="09022518000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to subsection (7) which deals with what the chief
coroner may do if the appeal is successful and allowed. The chief
coroner can take a number of different actions including amending the
determination, and they can substitute any other decision. Under
paragraph (d), they can</div>
<a name="09022518000546"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make any order
(including an order as to
costs)&#148;</div><a name="09022518000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
they think
appropriate.</div><a name="09022518000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that the senior coroner should enjoy indemnity from costs
being awarded against them. We talked earlier about the independence of
that office. We were talking about the need to ensure that morale in
the service remains high. We are also, to some extent, moving into
uncharted territory with the new appeals system. I am sure that the
Minister will agree that while there is a great deal to recommend the
new appeals system, there is a whole new area of opportunity for people
who may feel disgruntled and upset, which is a good thing in many
ways.</div>
<a name="09022518000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
two cases earlier where the families were extremely distressed about
what happened&#151;in one case a death certificate was not amendable,
and in the other the inquest had been adjourned and was not going to be
restarted. Under the clause, they would be able to appeal. The Minister
in her reply to that earlier discussion said that the clause would play
a pivotal part in giving those families the sort of remedies that they
are quite entitled to expect. I am concerned that there might be an
order for costs against the coroner personally. Perhaps the Minister
will comment on that and tell us whether she is prepared to accept
amendment
362.</div><a name="09022518000461"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000749"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am not persuaded that there is a case for the
amendment. It would be for the chief coroner to make any order that
they think fit, based on the circumstances of the particular case. That
would mean that coroners and the local authority, which funds them, may
well have to pay the costs that the chief coroner orders. However,
coroners would not have to pay any expenses from their own pockets,
because such funds would come from the funding of the coroner
service.</div><a name="09022518000462"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the reasons why I cannot accept the amendment is that the appeals
process must not only be totally transparent and fair, but be seen to
be such. The amendment runs counter to that, because it could mean that
if coroners were indemnified against costs, they would be seen to be
treated more favourably than other parties against whom the chief
coroner could make an order. Paragraph 9(2)(c) of schedule 6 allows for
regulations to be made about coroners&#146; expenses arising from
appeal decisions. To the extent that additional provisions are needed
in respect of appeal costs, it is best that they are made there rather
than in the Bill. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel
able to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09022518000463"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000750"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> My only concern is that judges and magistrates
are indemnified from any award or costs against them, whereas coroners
do not appear to be. On 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div>the basis of what the Minister has told me this evening, I will reflect
on what she has said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000753"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The Bill currently provides that the chief
coroner may carry out an investigation, instead of the relevant local
coroner, or may make a request to the Lord Chief Justice for a serving
judge to carry out an investigation. I envisage that that power would
be used sparingly, but it allows the chief coroner, or a senior judge,
to take responsibility for specific investigations, for example when
there are legal complexities. This group of amendments extends the pool
of persons eligible to conduct investigations in accordance with the
provisions in schedule 8, and that includes retired High Court judges,
retired Court of Appeal judges and retired senior coroners, much in
line with what the hon. Member for Daventry was asking for in an
earlier
debate.</div><a name="09022518000469"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000754"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I would be grateful if my hon. Friend were to
clarify the implications of these amendments. As I understand it, they
provide the power to undertake judicial functions, not the power to run
an organisation or anything of that sort. Is that the
case?</div><a name="09022518000470"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000755"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Yes, it is. The provision is about carrying out
an investigation. An example is the de Menezes case, where a High Court
judge was appointed to deal with that case rather than the local
coroner.</div>
<a name="09022518000471"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000756"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> A judicial

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000757"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Yes, it would be a judicial function. That is
why we have tabled these amendments. The amendments include the
opportunity for the chief coroner to make the request of a retired
coroner, for example, without the need to consult the Lord Chief
Justice. Amendment 27 clarifies the reference, elsewhere in the
legislation, to include not only a judge nominated under paragraph 2 of
schedule 8, but also a retired judge or a retired coroner who is acting
as the coroner.</div>
<a name="09022518000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 26
inserts the requirement for a</div>
<a name="09022518000547"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;person
nominated or requested...to conduct the
investigation&#148;</div>
<a name="09022518000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">to formally agree to do
so. There was less need for that when the people who could be nominated
were all serving judges. However, there is a need for a formal
acceptance of a case where a judge or coroner is requested to come out
of retirement.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div><a name="09022518000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 28
closes a potential loophole. It is possible, under the employment
procedure, for someone to be a senior coroner and subsequently to
become a High Court judge. Paragraph 3(1)(a) simply refers to a person
who is not a senior coroner or a former senior coroner. Paragraph 3
would not cover a case where the investigation is conducted by a High
Court judge who used to be a senior coroner, and the amendment covers
that
possibility.</div><a name="09022518000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
29 makes provision for hearing appeals. Normally, appeals against a
coroner&#146;s decision would be heard by the chief coroner. However,
where the investigation is carried out by a High Court judge, a retired
High Court judge or a retired Court of Appeal judge, the appeal will be
heard by someone nominated by the Lord Chief Justice who is a
practising Court of Appeal judge. Where an investigation is carried out
by a circuit judge, any appeal will be heard by someone who is a
practising High Court judge, allowing for the judicial levels to be
kept
intact.</div><a name="09022518000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
30 allows a coroner who was appointed under the 1988 Coroner&#146;s
Act, and retires before the reformed system comes into effect, to
conduct an investigation when asked to do so by the chief coroner.
Allowing only retired senior coroners&#151;those who were appointed
under the reformed system&#151;will have little impact in the first
few years. We have allowed that flexibility to make that pool of
experience available. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will
accept these
amendments.</div><a name="09022518000478"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000762"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> The new clause is closely related to the point
raised a few minutes ago by the hon. Member for Stafford as it concerns
the transparency, openness and accountability of the system on which
the Committee took a lot of evidence as it was raised by a number of
witnesses. We looked particularly at how to ensure that the system
identifies patterns, not just in situations such as Hillsborough, where
there are many people in a similar area, but in cases across the UK in
which similar verdicts are recorded by different coroners. That will
help us to tackle broader medical or health and safety issues as they
arise. The new clause would place a duty on the chief coroner to
produce an annual report that would be provided to the Lord Chancellor,
who would be obliged to publish it and lay it before the House of
Commons, so that it would be openly available and there would be
opportunities for much broader oversight of any issues
arising.</div>
<a name="09022518000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Stafford said, there are many examples around the world of
coroners&#146; systems that operate effectively and openly, in which
lessons are learned in a much more transparent fashion than has been
the case up to now in the UK. He gave as examples the systems in New
South Wales and Ontario, Canada, where verdicts and recommendations are
made publicly available and are widely disseminated so that lessons can
be learned and patterns identified. The new clause attempts to do
something similar here.</div>
<a name="09022518000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am prepared
to accept that the Minister might not like the wording of the new
clause, but I would be grateful if she gave her views on what could be
done to ensure that we identify broader patterns as they occur across
the UK, pick up on recommendations that coroners have made in different
coronial areas, and ensure that greater transparency and accountability
is built into the
system.</div><a name="09022518000494"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000763"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I hope that I can give the hon. Lady some
assurances. I think that there are sufficient powers elsewhere in the
Bill dealing with making annual reports. For example, clause 33(3)(d)
and (e) allows for regulations to be made on the provision and
disclosure of information, and for the Lord Chancellor or the chief
coroner to require information from senior coroners. That measure will
enable that information to be collated and published. I can also
confirm that the regulations are likely to include the matters that the
hon. Lady proposes in new clause 17. For example, each year the chief
coroner will have to provide a report to the Lord Chancellor with an
assessment of different coroners&#146; performance and on a range of
other issues, which will then be published. That covers some of the
hon. Lady&#146;s examples. Having said that, there is no great
principle at stake here, and although I will not undertake now to table
a Government amendment at a later stage, I will reflect before Report
on what the hon. Lady has
said.</div><a name="09022518000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will touch on clause 32 stand part. While we have argued and discussed
all other elements of the Bill, this clause is important in that it
gives the Lord Chancellor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>the ability, for the first time, to issue statutory guidance on how the
coroner system is expected to operate in relation to interested
parties. For the purpose of clause 32 interested parties
include a spouse, a civil partner, a partner, a parent, a child, a
brother, a sister, a grandparent, a grandchild, the child of a brother
or sister, a stepfather, a stepmother, a half-brother and a
half-sister. A full list is in clause
36.</div><a name="09022518000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
anticipate that the first guidance that the Lord Chancellor issues will
be the charter for the bereaved, and that is why I wish to speak a
little on this now. We published a revised draft charter along with the
Bill, and I am grateful for the many positive comments that hon.
Members have made about it. That charter will set out the services that
bereaved families can expect to receive under a reformed system and the
means of redress if those services are not met, and it highlights other
opportunities that families will have for involvement. Equally, it sets
out families&#146; responsibilities, including information to be
provided to the coroner. Given that our immediate aim for reform is to
improve the service that bereaved people receive, the charter is
specifically for the bereaved. However, it is likely that guidance will
be issued on other aspects of, and participants in, coroners&#146;
investigations, such as non-professional witnesses who have been
involved blamelessly, in transport crashes for example. This clause is
central to our aim to standardise and improve the service that bereaved
people receive from the reformed coroner system and on that basis I
commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="09022518000497"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000765"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Clause 35 abolishes the office of coroner of
the Queen&#146;s household. The current holder of that office is
Michael Burgess, who is also HM coroner for Surrey. We discussed
earlier the great historic nature of the traditional post of coroner.
The post of coroner to the King or Queen&#146;s household is also an
ancient one and I have worked out that it dates back to William I. It
would be a great pity if it were abolished without good reason. Was
this measure recommended in the June 2003 Luce report? What sort of
discussions have take place between the Ministry of Justice and the
Palace, at the time of that report and subsequently? I am well aware
that there have been issues more recently, particularly relating to the
summoning of a suitable jury in the inquest of the late Diana Princess
of Wales. That obviously posed challenges. I suppose it could be argued
that the exclusive nature of the office is difficult 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>to integrate with the new national framework that is being put in place,
and I understand why the Government may be keen to look at how the
office has been held by different coroners throughout the country in
the past. At the moment, it is held by the Surrey coroner, who will
become the senior coroner for that
area.</div><a name="09022518000503"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am suggesting that, instead of getting rid of the post completely, it
might be more sensible to retain it, because from time to time
important and sensitive matters will have to be dealt with concerning
the Queen&#146;s or King&#146;s household. It is important not to
abolish the office, but to transfer it to the chief coroner. Under our
amendment, the chief coroner would also be the Coroner of the
Queen&#146;s Household, which makes a great deal of
sense.</div><a name="09022518000504"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000766"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
suggestion, which seems to run counter to the developments in the Bill.
He referred to the fact that the Bill establishes a national framework,
but it does not establish a national organisation. The purpose of my
earlier questions to the Minister was to clarify that the amendments
that she moved a short time ago were to extend the judicial competence
of the chief coroner, not to give the chief coroner an organisational
responsibility. The chief coroner is a judge, so he is not necessarily
competent to run anything. I say that with some feeling, because I was
the first Minister to be a member of a jury when the legislation
changed to allow MPs and Ministers to be members of juries. The
experience did not increase my confidence in the capability of judges
to run
anything.</div><a name="09022518000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we pass responsibility to the chief
coroner, who would then have to run something and to be the coroner,
instead of merely being the overseer or regulator of the coronial
service. Surely the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion is inconsistent
with the rest of the
Bill.</div><a name="09022518000506"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000767"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> With respect, the right hon. Gentleman
overestimates how onerous the duties of the Coroner of the
Queen&#146;s Household are. Mr. Burgess, who is currently
the Coroner of the Queen&#146;s Household and the Surrey coroner,
probably spends 1 per cent. of his time dealing with the former office.
It is much more a ceremonial post, and if the Government are keen to
move it away from the senior coroners, I am suggesting that they keep
the great ceremonial office in place. I know that the right hon.
Gentleman is keen on getting rid of a lot of things, but I am more of a
traditionalist.</div><a name="09022518000507"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000768"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> With respect, the hon. Gentleman is suggesting
that the new post, which is innovative, should take on that activity,
but surely he is describing a local coroner having responsibility as
Coroner of the Queen&#146;s Household. He is being far more dramatic
and innovative than I
am.</div><a name="09022518000508"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000769"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I am suggesting a compromise. I understand why
the Government want to take the post away from what will be senior
coroners. They want to tidy up the system. I do not know whether Luce
suggested this in his report&#151;the Minister may be able to touch
on that&#151;but one way of keeping alive a great historic, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>albeit a mainly ceremonial office would be to transfer it to the chief
coroner, which would be neat. The Minister may say that my new clause
is unnecessary, and that she will think again and keep the post of
Coroner of the Queen&#146;s Household with the senior
coroners.</div>
<a name="09022518000509"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000770"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b><b class="B"> As </b>well as the ceremonial functions, an
operational function can be invoked. If the Government abolish the
post, is the hon. Gentleman clear about where the operational side
would go and who would be responsible for
that?</div><a name="09022518000510"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000771"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I am pleased to say that members of the royal
family do not die very often, thank goodness; but, when one of them
does die, presumably, the death will now be dealt with by the local
coroner, along with many others. At the moment, if a member of the
royal family dies, the death is dealt with by the coroner of the
Queen&#146;s household. It is an ancient, ceremonial office, and I
believe in keeping such offices in place. There is a good reason for
doing so, and I hope that the Minister will listen to our
argument.</div><a name="09022518000511"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000772"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The hon. Gentleman has tabled a piece of
nonsense.</div>
<a name="09022518000512"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000773"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> My right hon. Friend said to me a moment
ago that he could not resist it. May I suggest to him that he
might?</div>
<a name="09022518000513"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000774"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The Opposition, having tabled a serious
provision, should be taken seriously and challenged. The chief coroner
is a regulator, and he or she will have oversight of training,
standards and so on. He will not undertake coronial duties as such,
apart from the responsibility that the Opposition seek to move on to
him. Could we imagine Ofcom running a radio station, even if it was
known as the royal radio station? Could we imagine Ofwat running a
small, royal water company, or something like that? The new clause may
be exploratory, but the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk did not say
that; he suggested that it was serious. If he had suggested that the
post be retained and attached to a local coroner, as it currently is,
some degree of tradition would have been retained, but what he suggests
does not seem logical.</div>
<a name="09022518000514"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022518000775"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> When we reach the end of a subject, the debate
always becomes lively again.</div>
<a name="09022518000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most
recent example of an inquest requiring the post of the Queen&#146;s
coroner was the inquest into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales,
which, as was mentioned, was opened by the current coroner of the
Queen&#146;s household, Michael Burgess. Dr. Burgess is also the
coroner for Surrey. Owing to the complexity of that case, which
required almost full-time attention in the run-up to, and throughout,
the inquest, the proceedings were eventually conducted by Lord Justice
Scott Baker. Before that inquest, the last time that a case required
the involvement of the coroner of the Queen&#146;s household was in
the 1980s, and I really cannot see the merit in retaining a post when
there is work only every 15 to 20 years.</div>
<a name="09022518000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Bill, a death that currently falls within the jurisdiction of the
Queen&#146;s coroner will simply be dealt 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>with by the coroner for the area where the body lies. As with any case,
excepting certified inquests, the chief coroner will have the power to
transfer the case to another senior coroner, to investigate it himself
or herself, or to require the Lord Chief Justice to nominate a judge to
conduct the investigation. That seems perfectly satisfactory and,
indeed, the many people whom we have consulted about the Bill since it
was published in draft have not objected to the proposal in any way. I
do not know what Tom Luce said in his report, but I suspect that it was
very little, as he will have considered it a relatively minor matter.
He is unlikely to have commented on it at all. I must say to the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk that, until now, no single person has
raised any concern with us about these plans.</div>
<a name="09022518000517"></a><div class="hs_Para">The abolition
of the office of coroner of the Queen&#146;s household is one of two
provisions in the Bill which require Her Majesty&#146;s consent, and
that will be signified  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>in the normal way on Third Reading. It would not therefore be
appropriate for me to say any more on the matter, given Her
Majesty&#146;s constitutional position.</div>
