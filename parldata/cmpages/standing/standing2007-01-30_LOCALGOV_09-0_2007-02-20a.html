					<a name="07022085000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall fulfil my undertaking to
provide some of the evidence that the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire asked for in relation to findings on the changes made
under the Local Government Act 2000. A number of pieces of research
independent of Government have found improvements in the decision
making, performance and leadership of councils as a result of the
changes. Perhaps most prominent is the &#147;State of the English
Cities&#148; report published in 2006, which laid particular emphasis
on the economic success of local authority areas as a result of
enhanced leadership. Research on best value in 2006 also showed that
leadership was</div>
					<a name="07022085000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
single most significant driver of change and improvement in local
authorities&#148;.</div>

predecessor, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister; the Department
changes its name every now and again&#151;carried out research in
2003. The local government workplace front-line staff survey&#151;we
have always gone for snappy titles&#151;showed that front-line staff
in the authorities that were performing less well, that is, those that
the Audit Commission identified as weak or poor, were significantly
more likely than those in good or excellent authorities to say that
they needed better leadership by senior
officers.</div>

								Alistair
Burt:
						</b> Ten out of 10 for artistic impression&#151;that is
an heroic effort to justify the Government&#146;s proposals, but I
remind the Minister of what we are talking about. We are trying not to
get some measure of the importance of strong leadership in delivering
effective local government&#151;that is taken as read&#151;but to
justify the Minister&#146;s and the Government&#146;s contention
that the desire for directly elected executives has been a ripple
running through local government, stimulated by local government and
councils themselves. It is not about research bodies talking about
strong leadership or others commenting on it, but about finding the
spark in the local government system that said, &#147;We want this,
and we want it now.&#148; Despite the Minister&#146;s best efforts,
I am still uncertain that we are talking about a mass movement beyond
two or three councillors thinking that it might be a good
idea.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000468"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> As ever, the hon. Gentleman advances an heroic
argument to justify inaction. As my evidence shows, the
Government&#146;s strategy for improving local government has proved
to be working. One element of that strategy&#151;I concede that it is
only one&#151;is our emphasis on better leadership of local
authorities.</div>

						<a name="07022085000469"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): The evidence
that the Minister is bravely offering to try to justify his argument
refers to &#147;officers&#148;. Much though councillors want to say
that the leadership issue is about them, officers&#146; leadership is
important as well. In my borough of Enfield, the change of leadership
of the elected councillors, a change of officers at senior level and a
much more streamlined leadership approach led to improvements, as the
Audit Commission results this week will
show.</div>

								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me the
opportunity to pay tribute to the chief executives and senior officers.
The Local Government Association and the Government&#151;if it is not
immodest of me to say so&#151;should be congratulated on the emphasis
that they placed on the importance of chief executives and senior
officers. The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior
Managers should be congratulated on performing the tasks that we ask
the chief executives to carry out, especially when we bear in mind
councils&#146; partnership arrangements, whereby chief executives at
management leadership level take on a raft of responsibilities. They
serve their areas and the country well. We should all be proud of that
on a non-partisan
basis.</div>
					<a name="07022085000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Our
research included senior officers and frontline staff. The work on best
value that was commissioned in 2006 showed the importance of
leadership. The front-line staff survey backed that finding by
considering authorities in the different categories. An evaluation
survey in 2004 also backed the findings, showing, for example, that
leadership by executive members was positively associated with the
joining up of services and the better delivery of services to local
people. In that survey, 71 per cent. of the respondents believed that
leadership by executive councillors had had a positive impact on
performance improvements in their authority.</div>
					<a name="07022085000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A survey of
councillors, officers and other interested parties in 2005 followed
consideration of the impact of the Local Government Act 2000.
Opposition Members, reasonably and rightly, often call for
post-legislative scrutiny, and evidence on the 2000 Act shows that the
role of leader was perceived to have become stronger by 79 per cent. of
respondents in the case of authorities with an elected mayor, and by 69
per cent. of respondents in the case of other authorities. More than
half the councillors and nearly three-quarters of the officers believed
that the executive had become more effective in articulating the vision
for their area under the new arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07022085000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The latest research from the
ongoing evaluation of the new councils&#146; constitution is being
undertaken by the university of Manchester, which has played a very
positive role in research on local government, as it has in every
discipline of learning. It is probably the finest university in the
United Kingdom. It found that 69 per cent. of councillors and 76 per
cent. officers perceived the role of the leader to be stronger under
the new executive arrangements. Moreover, some 52 per cent. of
councillors and 72 per cent. of officers believed that the executive is
more effective in articulating its vision for its area under the new
arrangements, and 53 per cent. of councillors and 62 per cent. of
officers believe that the executive has led the drive to service
performance.</div>
					<a name="07022085000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
substantial evidence. Of course, it is reasonable for hon. Members on
both sides of the Committee, to want evidence that accountability and
scrutiny have gone hand in hand in that
process.</div>

								Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I understand the
Minister&#146;s point, but where is the specific evidence that a
directly elected leader and executive contribute? We all accept the
general point, but how many local authorities in the research
specifically said, &#147;We want to have a directly elected leader
and executive,&#148; as opposed to the model of a leader and
executive cabinet appointed by the local
authority?</div>

								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Once again, I invite the hon. Gentleman to come
out of his centralist mindset and join me in the devolutionary world,
where the matter is one for local authorities or, in the case of
referendums for the position of elected mayor, for the local people to
decide.</div>
					<a name="07022085000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
referred to the strong support for the idea that the mayoral model has
created an improvement in leadership, albeit not hugely greater than
other executive arrangements&#151;10 per cent. or thereabouts. An
interesting piece of evidence for elected Members of Parliament and
elected councillors who read this debate is that 68 per cent.
of people surveyed in areas where there is an elected mayor knew the
name of the mayor and who was responsible for their area, as opposed to
37 per cent. of people in a non-mayoral area recognising their council
leader. That figure compares reasonably with Members of Parliament and
shows that, in areas that have chosen to go for a mayor, the
mayor&#146;s high visibility has helped accountability.
But&#151;there is a big but, of course&#151;the Government are not
saying and have never said, &#147;Thou shalt have a mayor.&#148; We
have said simply, &#147;If you want one, you can have one,&#148; in
order to improve leadership arrangements.</div>

						<a name="07022085000473"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I would like to take the
Minister back to his remarks a few moments ago, when he stressed the
importance of local authorities determining for themselves the
structure of executive arrangements that they wish to take forward. Why
has he excluded a hybrid committee structure in conjunction with an
elected leader or mayor? That system has worked well in many local
authorities&#151;I am sure that we will come on to that point later
in the debate. Why cannot local authorities determine the structure for
themselves?</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000474"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point, which
many authorities across the spectrum have made, asking, &#147;Why
can&#146;t we have committees?&#148; You would probably pull me up
if I were to go into detail on that, Mr. Benton, because we
are discussing the amendment on directly elected mayors tabled by the
hon. Member for Hazel Grove. I shall just say &#147;horse&#148; and
&#147;camel&#148;, and perhaps you will get a hint of the argument
that I shall use when we consider the evidence of the success or
otherwise of the committee structure. I refer, of course, to the idea
that God so loved the earth that he sent his only son, not a committee,
and if you try to design a horse by committee you end up with a
camel.</div>
					<a name="07022085000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we
seriously want to devolve strategic power over billions of pounds of
public expenditure, the public will want accountable leadership and
clear decision-making structures. That is my argument on the executive
models. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove has put strongly an argument
against the model of directly elected executives, arguing that it is
unworkable and that support for it among local authorities is not huge.
I argue that it is a reasonable model that has been proposed by some in
local government and that satisfies the criteria that the Government
have set in their policy. I invite the hon. Gentleman to put aside his
centralising tendencies and join me in the idea that councils that want
to take forward that model should be allowed to do so. I therefore
invite him to withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<a name="07022085000475"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> Some of the Minister&#146;s words have been
carefully noted down for subsequent debates. When I moved the amendment
I prefaced my remarks by making it absolutely clear that, like
everybody else in the room, I am in favour of strong leadership models.
Obviously, what is in dispute is whether a particular style of
governance is more or less likely to produce that strong leadership and
positive outcomes for local authorities. There is clearly a difference
of opinion between the Minister and myself on his other proposed
models, but they are not the subject of the amendments before
us.</div>
					<a name="07022085000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am appearing
almost passionate about this group of amendments&#151;that is how the
Minister was kind enough to describe it&#151;because the
Government&#146;s proposal is completely dysfunctional. It will not
work. I cannot see how it could be made to work in a way that would
allow a local authority to have strong leadership. The proposal is
based on a series of premises that appears to be completely
disconnected from any experience of how local government is run or
indeed how any Government is run. At no point did the Minister make the
case for a directly elected Cabinet in Whitehall. If we contemplate
what that would produce, and the side effects, we will see that it
would be as wrong for the governing party as for opposition parties and
the country as a whole. As soon as we look at that model in a more
familiar setting, it becomes transparent that it is completely
dysfunctional.</div>
					<a name="07022085000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of other points have been raised in the debate. Several Members
commented on the problems that might arise from changes to control,
capacity or aptitude, and on the necessity of bringing in new people
during a four-year term or to rotate portfolios. All those things are
ruled out by the proposed model. Such failings would mean less strong
leadership than under the current executive model, whatever its
strengths and weaknesses.</div>
					<a name="07022085000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister&#146;s
justification is that the system he proposes will improve
accountability. It is extremely difficult to follow his argument when
presented in that form. It will improve accountability in the sense
that the people involved will be directly elected once every four
years, but if it all goes wrong and after two years the
directly-elected leader says, &#147;It has all gone wrong in social
services and I would really like to get rid of this person, but I
cannot and you cannot blame me because I am trapped by the
system,&#148; where is the accountability? Who is loses an election
on that basis? There is no
accountability.</div>
					<a name="07022085000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
wonders also about scrutiny. Let us suppose that a major gaffe is
disclosed when scrutinising a particular department and the performance
of the executive member directly elected to handle it. Scrutiny can be
as condemnatory as it likes, but it cannot actually remove or hold to
account that person, who can simply wave two fingers at the scrutiny
committee and say, &#147;I have got another two and a half years to
serve and there is no way that you can touch me.&#148; If that is
accountability, the Minister has got a different view of it from the
one that I hold and that I think that the Committee should also
hold.</div>
					<a name="07022085000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
hard as I read the Bill, I cannot get to the bottom of another aspect
of the system. We have raised already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 265</div>the question of what happens if a subsequent by-election produces a
change of party in the representatives elected to the council. The
Minister did not specifically address that point&#151;perhaps because
he has no idea. However, it seems possible that what we really have
here is an aldermanic system. If the directly elected executive can
vote in the council, one could take the view that any change in control
or, at least, the balance of the council, could be overwhelmed by the
10 or 12 additional votes of the directly elected executive. If that is
true, it raises one question: what is the point or substance of any
by-election of change that take
place?</div>
					<a name="07022085000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The system
completely defeats the notion of increasing accountability, and puts
pitfall after pitfall in the way of exercising strong, accountable
leadership.</div>

							<b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): I am trying to follow the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s logic. His argument is stronger if he envisages that
the executive would be independent, but the chances are that it would
consist of party representatives, like the rest of the council.
Although the executive&#146;s members would be elected for the
district rather than the ward, they would probably be party people, so
they would always be counted as part of the
council.</div>

							<a name="07022085000477"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises the lid on the
Pandora&#146;s box of who is entitled to propose a slate, on what
basis, and of what size. Let me accept the premise that he has offered,
however. If one takes Stockport as an example, there could be a slate
from the Liberal Democrats, one from the Labour party and one from the
Conservative party, and perhaps one from some other group. On the basis
of the Government&#146;s present proposals as I understand them,
there would be a fixed number on the slate, so there would be no scope
for a party to compete by saying that it could run a borough more
efficiently and effectively with five, seven, or 11 people, because the
number would be a predetermined one. That is clearly a mistake, and I
assume that when we reach the relevant amendment the Government will
confess as much.</div>
					<a name="07022085000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be by-elections in a variety of wards across Stockport, depending
on which slate gets in, and there could then be a change in the
council&#146;s composition if the electorate decided&#151;perhaps
on a very low turnout&#151;that it did not like what had happened. At
that point, the executive would no longer have the political support of
the council in delivering its policies. Indeed, it might be said that
the executive would no longer be legitimate, and that the electorate
had decided that it did not want the executive members to be the
decision makers. Where is the accountability and the legitimacy in
that? So every door and window that one opens in examining the proposal
produces a more and more bizarre view and a less and less workable
system.</div>
					<a name="07022085000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is fine
for the Minister to say that the Government are just giving an option.
That is what they did in Stoke, but after three years they have had to
concede that the option did not work in local government. What I am
saying is that the Government have taken away one option that they have
decided is not workable and that, although they are offering three
others, one of those is already predictably and visibly not workable.
In effect, therefore, they are reducing the options to two, while 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 266</div>claiming to be widening the choice open to local authorities. I cannot
make any sense of the Government&#146;s arguments and I believe that

							<a name="07022085000498"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Perhaps if I explain the purpose of the
clause, that will answer the question.</div>
					<a name="07022085000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sections 14 to 16 of the 2000
Act deal with how functions are discharged by the executive of a local
authority. Specifically, they provide that functions that are the
responsibility of an executive may be discharged by members of the
executive, committees of the executive, or officers of the council.
Currently, where there is a mayor and cabinet executive, the mayor can
either discharge a particular function or arrange for that function to
be discharged by the executive, an individual member of the executive,
a committee of the executive, or an officer of the authority. By
contrast, where there is a leader and cabinet executive, it is the
authority as a whole that makes those decisions unless, of course, it
leaves those decisions to the leader.</div>
					<a name="07022085000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause 39,
which we have just debated, makes changes to the form of executive
arrangements in England. As a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 267</div>consequence, clause 40 provides that, in future, all decisions about how
executive functions will be discharged should remain in the hands of
the mayor in the case of a mayoral executive; similarly, they should
rest with the leader in the case of either a leader and cabinet
executive or an elected executive, as in the model that we have just
debated.</div>
					<a name="07022085000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
that, in future, all council leaders in England will have the same
powers as mayors currently have to decide how executive functions are
discharged. The arrangements in Wales, subject to the caveats that I
referred to earlier, will remain unaltered. Therefore clause 40
strengthens the role of the leader and will help to deliver the
conditions for the strong and accountable leadership that we have been
discussing.</div>
					<a name="07022085000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions in the clause apply to all three models, so it is helpful to
have a single term that refers to all three models, because the Bill,
if Parliament allows it, will place the executive power in the
leader&#146;s office, whether that be a mayor, a directly elected
leader of a directly elected executive, or an indirectly elected
leader. It is simply common sense to have a single term.

						</b> I remind the Minister that he has now admonished
the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, the hon. Member for Ludlow
and me, asking us to come out of our centralist mindset. I am not sure
whether he has suggested that other Members should do the same. I am

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 268</div>
					<a name="07022085000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						I
shall start my remarks by saying that clause 41 is six and a half pages
long. Whatever else, there should be a law against that. Consequently,
the Committee should carefully consider the amendments to see precisely
what I intend to achieve. I shall simplify matters by explaining that
amendments Nos. 33 and 34 would give local authorities freedom to
determine their own system of governance; amendments Nos. 99 and 101
would give authorities the option of having the committee system in
certain circumstances; and amendment No. 100 would extend the
eligibility of special arrangements to district and metropolitan
boroughs without regard to their
size.</div>
					<a name="07022085000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
propose that small authorities should be able to retain what is
commonly called the committee system, although most people understand
that the system of 25 years ago is not what we are talking about. We
are debating an enhanced committee system. My amendments would open up
the options for local government of all sizes and classes, first, to
decide their own system of governance entirely; secondly, to decide
their system of governance and to have the committee system, if they
are district councils or metropolitan boroughs regardless of size; and,
thirdly, to be able to adopt the committee system if their population
exceeds, not 85,000, but 850,000. Both numbers are arbitrary, but my
intention is to show the direction in which I believe the Minister
should be encouraged to
go.</div>
					<a name="07022085000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deploy the
arguments in favour of self-government. As I said on Second Reading, we
conceded it long ago to Australia, Canada and colonies throughout the
world, and it seems to work. They get on with it, so the Minister
should have a little more trust in local government and its capacity to
deliver and show leadership. It became clear on Second Reading that
many of his colleagues share that view and feel that he is being too
prescriptive, in particular by not allowing the possibility of the
enhanced committee system to be an option for consideration by
authorities unless they are in the smallest category. He is denying
local democracy an
opportunity.</div>
					<a name="07022085000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
plenty of anecdotal evidence of the dissatisfaction in local government
about the executive arrangements. I tried to follow the 69 per cent.,
the 74 per cent. and the 89 per cent. figures that the
Minister rattled off when referring to various studies. I do not know
what the sample groups were when those were undertaken, but I have yet
to find outside the membership of the executives themselves councillors
who would agree with that analysis. Most of them consider that they
have been excluded to some degree by the new arrangements. Many
councils believe that they should have the option of the committee
structure, one that is much more inclusive and inclined to consensus
building than the executive model and much less remote from the
communities that they
serve.</div>
					<a name="07022085000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
am not an unadulterated supporter of the committee system. I am far
from saying to the Minister that every local authority should have it.
I am certainly not arguing that we should go back 20 years and start
all over again. However, if what he says about opening up local
government and giving it more choices and options really means
anything, he has a simple, practical way of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 269</div>doing that, which is by extending a system of governance that is tried
and tested&#151;and certainly not failing&#151;into other council
areas.</div>
					<a name="07022085000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						I
want to make the pure gospel point that governance should be entirely a
matter for local councils, but I listened carefully to what the
Minister said on Second Reading and to what has been said in Committee
and I know that his Department has struck a deal with other Government
Departments about devolving functions and decision making to local
government. To some extent, that deal is dependent on the Department
for Communities and Local Government being able to show other
Departments that the bodies to which it will be transferring powers and
decision making have the substance and the effectiveness to carry out
those functions. Therefore, a deal has been struck, and perhaps the
governance issue is one of the prices that local government is expected
to pay to achieve that.</div>
					<a name="07022085000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the whole
Committee would benefit from a clear exposition by the Minister of
exactly why neither he nor his Department is prepared to give any
flexibility for the enhanced committee system. The amendments explore
different options and different ways of achieving essentially the same
thing, which is to widen the choices available to local government.
They are not looking to bring in a system that is untried, untested and
clearly dysfunctional, but to bring in something that is tried, tested
and that demonstrably produces leadership results now in small
authorities and which historically has done the same for more than 100
years in the largest authorities in the land. I am very happy to speak
to the amendments and to listen to what the Minister has to
say.</div>

						</b> I am pleased to support the tenor of the amendments

be covering some old ground, I hope that they will encourage Committee
members to reaffirm their commitment to the importance of choice in
local government and to express again their concerns that a key

					<a name="07022085000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will return
to a familiar theme that the Minister must now hear echoing in his
dreams. I do not know whether he caught that wonderful programme
&#147;Sleep Clinic&#148; on the television last night that looked
at the extraordinary contortions that people go through when their
sleep is disturbed, what they hear and what they do not hear. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman is hearing in his dreams, &#147;choice,
choice,&#148; and at some stage tonight that he will share again that
champagne moment that he gave to the Committee earlier when, as members
of the Committee will recall, he spread open his arms and said,
&#147;I am a devolutionist, let them have the choice.&#148; He said
that in relation to a different part of the Bill, but, as the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove said, all we are asking is that the Minister
finds again in his soul that moment. He made that comment in relation
to offering the choice of a committee system. He was not talking about
forcing it upon anyone, not demanding that anyone has to have it, but
simply giving people at local level their opportunity to choose a
committee system for
themselves.</div>
					<a name="07022085000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
voice from one of our witnesses was that of Gordon Keymer. The very
name strikes a chord in all our hearts. Asked about the committee
system and the problem of involvement, he said:</div>
					<a name="07022085000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What is happening too
much at the moment in the executive system is that council meetings are
dominated by two or three people and the rest are spectators. The
figures speak for themselves&#151;note the turnover of people who
stay for only one term and leave because they are frustrated. The
trouble is that we are trying to produce a whole lot of mechanisms to
keep them happy by extending scrutiny and so on. If you look at it
quite cold-bloodedly, all those things could be covered by active
membership in the committee system. It is a great shame. People are not
easily fooled.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022085000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">He said
that when he goes down to watch his local council committees at work of
an evening he thinks,</div>
					<a name="07022085000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Here are people who,

								Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I get the impression that the
hon. Gentleman is talking about the difference made by a well run
council that engages councillors, be they there principally to make
decisions or to scrutinise. That is the real difference that he is
describing. Is there not a great danger of assuming that scrutiny is a
lesser role and therefore less satisfying when, in fact, scrutiny is an
important role when it is done and managed
well?</div>

Burt:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but a
slightly distracting one. I am not seeking to prioritise the business
pursued by committees over the functions of scrutiny and overview. The
point is that local authorities should be allowed to make a choice
about the structure that they believe is right for them, so that well
run councils can make a judgment about the allocation of functions and
their efficacy. The question asked by the amendments, following the
points raised by hon. Members on both sides of
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 271</div>the House on Second Reading and by the witnesses who came before us
prior to the formal Committee stage of the Bill, is: why not give
people the choice? That is all. A committee system may not be right for
all councils. For example, it may not suit councils that have moved on
to a different system and do not want to go back.</div>
					<a name="07022085000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
overwhelming impression I had was that while it suits the leadership of
a council to have a tightly controlled system, and a leadership will
naturally support and understand an executive system that concentrates
power, those who see the other purpose of a council as involving
councillors so that they have more of a role than that of back-bench
councillor&#151;a role that people warmly welcome, but which keeps
them out of the loop in the system&#151;want the chance to do
something more. I am sure that grass-roots resentment does not
necessarily surface in those councils in which the executive and
cabinet system works well, and which have mechanisms to get people
involved, but to deny that there is resentment would be to shut
one&#146;s eyes to what is going on in local authorities.</div>
					<a name="07022085000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I come back
to the point made so well by Gordon Keymer about the frustration of
people who come on to councils and feel trammelled in what they can do.
We have enough evidence from over the years of people who have gone on
to councils and then complained that they get told what to do by
central Government too much and that they are frustrated by it. They
then go into a system in which they cannot even express themselves
through committees, and they feel constrained. No wonder people are
walking out the door.</div>
					<a name="07022085000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a simple mechanism
that we can use. It is not to force councils to go down a particular
route, nor to demand that there is a particular structure of local
governance that they should all follow; it is to add another element to
the mix for effective government. If the Minister is going to argue
that he cannot in any circumstances foresee that a committee structure
could provide effective leadership in the manner of the models already
presented, I have to say that I doubt that such an argument will be
supported by the broad mass of people who have been involved with local
government over the past few
decades.</div>

					<a name="07022085000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier, the
Minister made the point that the issue is about quality of leadership
and individual powers of persuasion in many cases, but the right
people, the right structure and the right officers can make a local
authority work. I do not see any reason why the Bill should not contain
the option for authorities to have the opportunity to run the committee
system if that is what they want to do.</div>
					<a name="07022085000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter that we are debating
is one of the strongest arguments against the Minister&#146;s belief
that he is a devolutionary Minister of a non-centralising Government
who are prepared to take a risk in local government. If the Minister is
true to the moment that he gave us with such splendour before
lunchtime, this is the opportunity for him to relive that moment, to
confess himself to be a true devolutionist and to say in a heartfelt
manner, &#147;Let them choose.&#148; I am therefore delighted to
support the amendments, and I hope that we can hear something from the
Minister and indeed from his Back-Bench colleagues that will echo the
sentiment of setting our local councils
free.</div>

							<a name="07022085000505"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I rise to support my hon. Friend and the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove. I have the benefit of 12 years&#146;
experience as a local councillor, first as an opposition councillor
under the old committee system in Enfield, then in control as a cabinet
member. Having been on two sides of the fence, I can give my view, both
as a new councillor who was one of the youngest councillors elected in
a committee structure and as a cabinet member.</div>
					<a name="07022085000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The benefit of the committee
format was that, at the very least, one knew where to go for
information. The Minister has put forward in favour of an executive
type arrangement the benefit of strong leadership. As a cabinet member,
I certainly saw that, but there was a concern about those who were left
behind. There was a feeling among other councillors who were newly
elected under the cabinet model, which Enfield council adopted at an
early stage, that they were left behind. Many well qualified
councillors felt that they were not able to access information and were
not party to decision making. They had to play catch-up to find out
where the decision had been made and then subject it to scrutiny. New
councillors do not feel sufficiently part of the scrutiny arrangements
that form part of cabinet-style government. Councillors in Enfield
often felt disfranchised and inadequately served by the scrutiny
process. For all its imperfections, I say that the committee system
suits every model of governance. It was certainly of value in Enfield,
because people knew where to receive information.</div>
					<a name="07022085000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Minister talked about
sample groups that support the new executive arrangements, he did not
mention the public. One should not forget that turnouts for local
government elections have not dramatically increased across the board,
despite some steps having been taken to improve leadership. There is
still a major issue concerning community engagement, both of the public
and of individual councillors on their behalf. When one talks about
leadership, it is not only about executive leadership; it is about
community leadership.</div>
					<a name="07022085000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that part of the
intention of the 2000 changes was that community leadership should be
upheld also by local councillors, as community advocates, who are not
necessarily part of the executive. Without the option of a community
system, they have felt increasingly disengaged. Without such a system,
when the public are looking for information and seeking to find out
about debates before decisions have been made, they are left to
encourage councillors to call in a decision or to be part of a scrutiny
process, which often feels inadequate. An option for a local authority
to have a local community system should be
provided.</div>
					<a name="07022085000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">One looks in
desperation for consistency in the Bill. If the Minister is consistent,
when he says there needs to be a stronger local voice for councils
serving a population of more than 85,000 I presume he also thinks there
should be a stronger local voice for populations of fewer than 85,000.
What is the logic of not allowing a committee system for populations of
fewer than 85,000? Why does it come down to the size of the population?
Surely that stronger local voice should be there for them. If the logic
of the Minister&#146;s argument is that the option of a committee
system 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 273</div>should be taken away from those smaller population communities, it does
not make sense.</div>
					<a name="07022085000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						Certainly
the committee option available to populations of under 85,000 should
also be there for those over 85,000. The option should be there for the
sake of not just executive leadership but community leadership. It is
important for individual councils to feel properly empowered and
engaged in the process. If that means an option of a committee, so be
it. Let the Minister take off the shackles of the centralising
tendencies he sees in us and ensure that there is true choice for local
communities. I support the
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Sir
Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): It was clear from
the way that my hon. Friend the Minister spoke about the
Government&#146;s intentions in bringing forward this range of
governance options that they are rightly concerned that local
authorities should be capable of strong leadership. That strong
leadership should be stable and visible. Those were the words that the
Minister used to describe the sort of leadership we would want to see.
He also spoke convincingly about the need for local authorities to
provide, as many already do, strong leadership not just within their
organisations but in the wider communities that they
represent.</div>
					<a name="07022085000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
convinced that all hon. Members share the desire that local authorities
should provide that leadership both internally and externally. I am
also sure that no hon. Member would wish to see a return to the
committee structure that many of us used to know, with all its
frustrations and its inability to provide the sort of leadership that
we would all wish for in local government, or, in many cases, to
provide the accountability which we would also wish to see
strengthened. It was often difficult to tell who was responsible for
taking decisions within the committee structure, with each committee
often able to blame another for the byways and alleyways that decision
making was going
down.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): The hon. Gentleman might be
exaggerating a little. I can recall things called policy and resources
committees that used to make all the hard decisions that other
councillors feared to make. It was very similar to the modern
cabinet.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000508"></a>Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> I do indeed recall the strengths of that
system as well as its weaknesses. I am convinced that those strengths
can be used to produce a reformed committee structure and a system that
would enable the leadership and accountability that we have all said we
would wish local government to deliver. The two great advantages of the
committee system were that it enabled a wide range of members to become
engaged in the decision-making process in a useful way and, equally
importantly, that it enabled opposition members to sit around the table
to debate and to vote on matters on which decisions were being
taken.</div>
					<a name="07022085000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One of the
great frustrations of the present structure for councillors, whether in
opposition or part of a controlling group, is that they cannot directly
participate in the decision-making process. They cannot speak and vote
at cabinet meetings in many situations. Obviously the political make-up
of many councils occasionally enables them to take part, but in many it
does not.</div>

							<a name="07022085000509"></a>Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> I stress again that I am not arguing for a
return to the committee structure as it was 20 or 30 years ago, but for
the committee structure, much modified and modernised, to be included
in the range of options open to local government. We do not need to
think very hard to come up with some excellent examples of powerful
leadership in councils with a committee structure and we do not need to
think too hard about examples of effective community leadership being
provided by councils with a committee structure. That leadership can be
provided externally as well as
internally.</div>
					<a name="07022085000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
committee structure, much modified and much modernised, is not a
panacea, but it ought at least to be an option. I also argue that the
governance options that have been put forward by the Minister and the
Government in the Bill are not a panacea either. They, too, are capable
of being expanded to increase the range of opportunities open to local
councils.</div>
					<a name="07022085000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
doubt at all that it is vital for councils to be able to provide
leadership to their local communities and for there to be strong and
effective leadership within local authorities. There is no doubt at all
that it is vital that whatever governance structure is adopted, it is
accountable both internally and externally to the wider community and
that the major issue of how the majority of members are engaged in the
council&#146;s process needs to be
addressed.</div>

							<a name="07022085000510"></a>
								Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is making me quite nostalgic for
the committee system. One of its advantages for scrutiny and
accountability was that officers&#146; recommendations, which often
turn out to be what the council actually does, were subject to
extensive examination from back-bench and opposition councillors, which
simply does not happen today. I find that there are few pleas from
officers to go back to the committee system, and there could be a good
reason for
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000511"></a>Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> I certainly believe that when opposition
members, if there is overall control, or coalition members if there is
not, sit round a table in public discussing recommendations put in
front of them by officers and are required to debate them and answer
questions about their attitude towards them and the reasoning behind
their position, that provides a degree of clarity and accountability
that is not always provided in the current system. In at least some
authorities, cabinet meetings are little more than a staged ritual in
front of the present public, with decisions in fact being taken
elsewhere.</div>

								Patrick
Hall:
						</b> When I was on Bedfordshire county council there were
many advantages to the committee system. However, one of the
disadvantages was the amount of time that it sometimes took for a
decision to be taken because of the interminable sub-committees and
perhaps sub-sub-committees&#151;I cannot remember how many there
were. I invite my hon. Friend to elaborate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 275</div>a little on what some call an enhanced committee system or, as I believe
he called it, a modernised committee system. We need to know more about
that because I do not believe that any suggestion of returning to the
old system is
credible.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000513"></a>
								Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that
intervention, which gives me an opportunity to re-emphasise that I am
not seeking a return to the system as we used to know it. I envisage a
system with a much reduced number of committees and an enhanced central
committee, be it called a policy and resources committee or a policy
committee, that is clearly in control of the overall direction of the
authority, with perhaps a limited number of sub-committees reporting to
it. Such an arrangement would enable a local authority to have both the
leadership role whose importance we have stressed and the
accountability that is made possible by members debating across a table
the direction of the authority&#146;s
policy.</div>
					<a name="07022085000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude, I
am arguing that there should be a wider range of choices than is
included in the Bill. I do not support the amendments, because there
are a number of arbitrary elements to them, as the hon. Member for
Hazel Grove acknowledged, which make them unsatisfactory. I hope that
the Government will recognise that it would benefit good local
government if there were a wider range of choices of governance than is
currently offered. I hope that the Minister will agree to reconsider
the proposals and recognise that the range to be offered is too limited
and prescriptiveto local government. We have an opportunity to
allow local government greater freedom in how it responds to local
circumstances, to the local political environment and to local
communities.</div>

							<a name="07022085000514"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I want to pick up where the hon. Member for
Leicester, South left off. I agree with him and I commend much of what
he said to Ministers. His experience as a former leader of a large
local authority should weigh heavily with them, especially given the
Minister&#146;s comment when he intervened on an observation by my
hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire who said in the
context of the Gordon Keymer scenario that the key test is contrasting
a well run authority, whatever its structure, with a badly run
authority. As my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate said, we
should not work on the assumption that the committee system can work
only in small authorities. There is no reason why it should not be
applied in large local authorities in its enhanced form.</div>
					<a name="07022085000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point was made about clear
political leadership and we all sign up to that. There was never a
larger local authority in English history than, first, the London
county council and then the Greater London council, nor were there
local authorities with a stronger tradition of clear political
leadership and direction. Herbert Morrison was as strong a local
government leader as one could find operating under the old committee
system, so were Ike Hayward, Desmond Plummer, Horace Cutler
and&#151;dare I say it&#151; Ken Livingstone.</div>
					<a name="07022085000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">All those people gave very
clear political leadership and direction to their authorities under the
old 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 276</div>committee system, never mind the modernised and enhanced one which, I
agree with the hon. Member for Leicester, South, should be an option.
If it could work then, why cannot it work now? Does it not come back to
the quality and calibre of the politicians and the senior
officers?</div>
					<a name="07022085000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
experience chimes with that of my hon. Friends and others. If we want
to keep good quality people in local government, they have to think
that there is a worthwhile role for them. I do not denigrate scrutiny
and I take the point, but if people believe that the only time that
they will be able to take a decision and make a difference in a
substantial and meaningful way is by waiting to become a member of the
executive, it will put a lot of very good people off&#151;hence the
turnover, which is a real
concern.</div>
					<a name="07022085000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some local
authorities try to get around the problem because they want to be
involved in scrutiny but a good council wants to be involved in policy
development too. In Bromley, we call our scrutiny committees policy
development scrutiny committees, which is an attempt to get members
involved at an earlier stage. We could do that in the context of the
leader and cabinet system and of the enhanced committee system
too.</div>
					<a name="07022085000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I
spent 16 years as a member of a London borough council and for eight of
those years I was chairman of one of the large service
committees&#151;first the environment committee and then the social
services committee. It was under the old structure, but we gave a
pretty clear political steer. We had a leader, who chaired the policy
and resources committee; the chairmen of the five or six service
committees were on the policy and resources committee and the
opposition were also represented on it.</div>
					<a name="07022085000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had a system of delegation
that enabled urgent decisions to be taken and we should look again at
the legal problems that sometimes get in the way in that respect. We
made sure that members&#151;usually the chairman or the vice-chairman
of the committee&#151;were involved if urgent action had to be
taken,. We also had a system whereby the leader and the service
committee chairmen could meet senior officers and give them a steer, or
direction.</div>
					<a name="07022085000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
is well made that, in the policy resources committee, not only could
the opposition debate the issue and question the officers on their
recommendations, but the officers had to account for them. That worked
in a very large local authority&#151;London boroughs were almost the
same size as the city of Leicester, for example&#151;and it worked on
a bigger scale for the London county council and the Greater London
council, so I do not understand why we are closing that option
off.</div>
					<a name="07022085000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
Minister that there is a contrast between the Government&#146;s
approach to this clause and to the previous one. If we accept that the
option can work for small local authorities, why close it off
arbitrarily for larger local authorities? Would not the decentralising,
localist option be to leave it open for all classes of local authority
and, as the Minister said earlier, let them
decide?</div>

comments on this part of the Bill, on which we have had an interesting
debate.</div>
					<a name="07022085000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only the
first two of my 11 years as a local councillor&#151;between 1996 and
1998&#151;were spent under the old committee system. So my experience
of the old system is very limited. I grew up politically with the new
cabinet system and its birth pains when first introduced. However, I
must say from my two years&#146; experience that I think that we tend
to hark back to a golden age that never existed. That was not my
recollection of how the committee system worked. Members certainly felt
more involved; that is correct. They had all the reports and tended to
discuss issues with other members on different committees in the
members&#146; room or at other meetings. Therefore, they had a
general overview of what was happening in the council that perhaps they
do not have now.</div>
					<a name="07022085000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In my
experience on the committee, however, decisions were made at the
chairs&#146; briefing, which were bounced through the group meeting,
sometimes with a row behind closed doors. Nevertheless they were
bounced through and were rubber-stamped at the committee meeting open
to the public and opposition often under the hard stare of the whips if
there had been a row in the group meeting. I am all too familiar with
hard stares from Whips, because I have been told to be brief. However,
that was my experience of the old committee
system.</div>
					<a name="07022085000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new system
was undoubtedly a culture shock for those who had lived with the old
one for a number of years. They had become familiar with it. It was
very comfortable. The new one has taken time to bed down and in some
authorities it is still not there. But where it is working, scrutiny
and support for members not in the cabinet is certainly in place and
working well. I take the point of the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst about pre-decision scrutiny. When I was a scrutiny chair in
Tameside, we took the decision to lead the way on scrutiny in our
borough. Afterwards, it was perceived to be a success and the executive
asked us to do more of it. So where it works, it works well. However, I
accept that it has taken time to bed down.</div>
					<a name="07022085000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I shall turn
to the information, which is there. Any councillor can ask for the
background information to a cabinet decision in advance of it being
taken. Information on the officers, who to contact and so on is all
there in the forward plan. Certainly in Tameside&#151;although it
might be different in other authorities&#151;the forward plan is
debated at full council so there is the opportunity for all members,
including back-bench members in the controlling group and all
opposition members, to debate issues before the cabinet makes a
decision.</div>
					<a name="07022085000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
shall turn to amendment No. 99 tabled by the Liberal Democrats. I
accept that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said that the upper limit
of 850,000 was arbitrary, but if it is right that some metropolitan
district councils, which are currently prevented from having a
streamlined committee system, should adopt one, it should be available
to all of them. It should not be discriminatory. Of course, setting the
target at 850,000 would mean that 35 out of the 36 metropolitan
district councils in England could opt for the committee
system&#151;poor Birmingham would be left out. So if someone is going
to argue that it is right for metropolitan councils to have that
facility, it should be for all of them, and not all except
Birmingham.</div>

							<a name="07022085000516"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I, too, do not wish to detain the Committee, but to
make one point. I rise in support of the amendment in the name of the
hon. Member for Hazel Grove. The point that has just been made is a
telling one, however, and I hope that he will comment on it before he
presses the amendment, if he chooses to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07022085000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are looking at
rearranging certain local government structures on a unitary basis,
which means that a very many councillors will be participating in a new
structure for the first time. In my view, it is likely that a number of
councillors will not have participated nor had previous experience of
either structure. I am delighted to have the opportunity to mention the
possible restructuring in Shropshire where, as I told the Minister last
night, we are possibly looking at a council of 96 councillors. One has
to ask oneself what all those people are going to do in a council of
that size that does not have any committee structure other than for
overview and scrutiny. How are they going to get engaged and
participate in decision
making?</div>
					<a name="07022085000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The points
that have been made by other hon. Members are valid, so I shall not
rehearse them&#151;councillors will have a lack of opportunity to
develop and grow and to participate in debate. So it is entirely
appropriate to have a committee structure option on a hybrid
basis.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000517"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The debate is important, and it is being echoed in
council chambers, in members&#146; rooms and in the wider local
government family, so it is important that the Government present the
arguments clearly. I hope to persuade the Committee that the ideas on
which the amendment is based are ill-founded and would not achieve what
the mover of the amendment intended.</div>
					<a name="07022085000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have already
explained in our debates on previous clauses the Government&#146;s
intention and thinking in relation to the executive arrangements that
we have proposed. However, let me repeat one point for emphasis. If one
is truly ambitious for local government, one believes that local
government can take up a strategic leadership role and a delivery role
across the range of services, across the portfolio of economic
regeneration of an area, across crime and disorder partnerships, across
the children and young people&#146;s agenda and the health and
elderly people&#146;s agenda. However, even medium-sized local
authorities are being asked to give strategic direction over hundreds
and hundreds of millions of pounds of public money, so the limit on the
Government&#146;s willingness to devolve power is that we can do so
only when we are convinced that decision-making arrangements are in
place by which responsibility for such matters can be taken. If people
wish to portray that as an anti-devolutionary or centralist policy, I
will have to live with that, but we are debating the subject of the
barriers to devolution. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove takes an
entirely consistent position&#151;that councils should decide, but I
want to persuade him that that is not in their interests.</div>
					<a name="07022085000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several hon. Members have said
that strong leaders existed under the old system. That is true&#151;I
said it of the mayoral model in New York. My argument is not that
strong leadership follows necessarily from an executive arrangement, or
that an alternative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 279</div>arrangement cannot produce a strong leader. I think that strong leaders
come out of strong political parties and a healthy body politic, which
I think all of us have an interest in fostering. My argument is rather
that the Government&#146;s proposals are more likely to lead to
strong and accountable leadership and are more likely to be fit for
purpose for the new responsibilities and the extra powers that we
intend to give to local authorities.
</div>
					<a name="07022085000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading,
the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said
that if one is serious about devolution, one has to talk about money,
because power flows from it. It is precisely because we are serious
about devolving power over public money that one has to have confidence
in the executive
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07022085000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
have referred often to the 2000 Act, which we are building on by way of
the Bill. That Act provided the types of executive arrangements, and
separated the role of back-bench councillor from the executive
councillors. As we are doing now, the Government took a devolutionary
and pragmatic approach in 2000. That is the answer to the points made
by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, who asked why there should
be smaller councils. Ultimately, the figure of 85,000 for
population&#151;it is population that counts, not the
electorate&#151;is an arbitrary one. The cut-off date was 30 June
1999. If an area had a population of fewer than 85,000, it could adopt
what were referred to as alternative arrangements, also known as the
committee structure. In the event, of the 86 eligible
authorities, 59 adopted the alternative approach. Since then,
three authorities&#151;Cotswold, Fylde and Rossendale&#151;have
moved from alternative arrangements to executive arrangements, and have
adopted a leader and a cabinet. I have looked in vain for a common
thread between them but I could not find
one.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000428"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="07022085000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2000 Act
also provided for alternative arrangements as a fall-back position in
case of a no vote in a mayoral referendum. That is the situation in
Brighton and Hove, and I know that it will listen closely to this
debate. But&#151;and this is where we come to the core of the
argument&#151;the amendments would not allow the enhanced committee
function to which my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South
referred. Indeed, under the existing arrangements, it is possible for
an executive to devolve executive powers to sub-areas. That is an
important part of the devolutionary approach and of involving people
and bringing them closer to their local authorities. An executive can
already devolve executive powers by
area.</div>
					<a name="07022085000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
authorities&#151;the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst
mentioned his own&#151;the role of overview and scrutiny involves
policy development and what are commonly called task and finish groups,
through which recommendations can be made not just about traditional
areas of council activity but about the wider activity of the area, the
local authority and its partners. That is the nub of it.</div>
					<a name="07022085000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall comment on the
rose-tinted glasses that my younger colleague the hon. Member for
Denton and Reddish mentioned, but the old internal decision-making
committee structure, whatever its strengths and weaknesses, was a
decision-making structure for the council as an institution and not for
the area as a whole. It would not be able to take responsibility for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 280</div>the strategic direction of health, crime and disorder and children and
young people, never mind social care or other responsibilities. One
should see decision-making executive structures in the context of the
wider, enhanced role that we are increasingly inviting local
authorities to take. I think that that answers the point, because
smaller areas do not take on the
responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="07022085000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of other points were made, which I shall try to answer. The hon.
Member for Ludlow asked what the other councillors should do, as those
who are not on the executive can feel excluded from decision making. It
is precisely because councillors across the political spectrum too
often spend more time in committees in the town, city or county
hall&#151;or, to be fair, in districts&#151;and not as champions of
their wards that we are in a situation in which too many councils have
become distant.</div>
					<a name="07022085000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new functions that I have mentioned of overview and scrutiny and of
policy development and reports across the whole range of services
provide a fantastic opportunity for local authority back-benchers to be
involved in decision making. Indeed, if one attends the overview and
scrutiny committee, which is now a major annual event in the calendar
of local government, there is excitement and a buzz about the potential
role of overview and scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07022085000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I endorse strongly the point
that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish made.
Inadvertently, the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst backed up
his point when he mentioned a policy and resource committee made up of
the deputy leader and chairs of the committees. What is that if not an
executive by another
name?</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000518"></a>Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> It is precisely right to liken that to a
camel. The difference, however, is that opposition members were able to
question directly both the executive and the officers on the thinking
behind their recommendations to the committee. Surely, that was its
great strength&#151;and that is lacking in the cabinet
system.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000519"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I disagree with my hon. Friend on two counts.
First, a functioning overview and scrutiny committee allows such
questioning to be carried out in a way that is similar to the process
in the House, although I would not take the analogy too far. Secondly,
and more importantly, the public did not know what the policy and
resources committee was. Because of the local government
decision-making process that existed, the chairs of the committee took
decisions, often in private, often involving two or three people and
often not in the council building. The hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst looks perplexed, but he cannot, with his experience of
local government, believe that Herbert Morrison took his decisions
openly in committees in every instance and debated them and did not
have a preconceived idea of what he
wanted.</div>

is a conservative with a small &#145;c&#146;. I commend him for
wanting to go
backwards.</div>
					<a name="07022085000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South, there is a
serious point to be made about accountability and visibility. The
amendment does not take us back, as he says, to the old committee
system. Nobody has spoken in favour of the old committee system, which
leaves we Committee members with the difficulty of not having a
definition of what an enhanced committee is. I believe strongly that
those councils that have grasped the executive arrangements and the
overview and scrutiny opportunities are already finding ways to involve
newer, and often younger, members in the decision-making
process&#151;Tameside is a good example&#151;and are getting the
benefits of that strong, speedier decision
making.</div>
					<a name="07022085000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I
have answered the points that have been made, if not to the
satisfaction of hon.
Members.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000524"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> The Minister made some pertinent, relevant
assertions, including that cabinet members are far more visible than
committee chairs ever were and that there is enthusiasm throughout the
land for scrutiny and overview. Those are contestable assertions. It
would be sensible to do some polling or evidence-based research to
justify those claims and find out whether cabinet members were any
better known to their local communities than committee chairs were and
whether there is enthusiasm among back-bench councillors. The evidence
is probably to the contrary, but has his Department commissioned any
research to find out whether the Minister is
right?</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000525"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman asks a legitimate question. I
have mentioned some of the surveys relating to this matter. Of course,
the Department has taken up such research, as has the Improvement and
Development Agency, the Leadership Centre for Local Government and, I
think, the Local Government Association. One has to test the whole
circumstance, including the overview and scrutiny and the executive
arrangements. My real evidence is in the improvement of performance of
local authorities. There is a correlation, which the research tends to
show, between better executive decision-making structures and the
enhanced performance of local government. I could throw in the 39 per
cent. real-terms increase in grant as well, but Mr. Benton
might accuse me of point scoring. I am not saying that there is always,
necessarily cause-and-effect between the two things. I concede the
point that the hon. Gentleman made reasonably. Strong leaders can
emerge under any structure, but I am concerned with what is most likely
to achieve that objective.</div>

							<a name="07022085000526"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am struggling to understand the
Minister&#146;s logic when distinguishing between those smaller
councils that have alternative arrangements and the larger councils. He
suggests that councils with a population under 85,000 do not
necessarily involve themselves in strategic issues. I question that,
and I am sure that those authorities would question whether he is right
that they are not involved in strategic issues about children and young
people, crime and disorder and social care. They fundamentally are, and
they would question and challenge the idea that they do not have a role
to play in the strategic leadership of their local authority just
because they are smaller.</div>
					<a name="07022085000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it not true that the
Minister is more worried about the budget and how much central money
councils have to deal with? One answer would be to make them fully
accountable and autonomous and to make them raise their own revenue.
The other option would be to have a cut-off link of 85,000 based not on
numerical population, but on the budget that it
receives.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000527"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman tempts me down the road of the
other clauses on finances and on money-raising powers. If he will
forgive me, I shall resist.</div>
					<a name="07022085000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that, to some extent,
the 85,000 figure was arbitrary. The hon. Gentleman rightly says that
it is based on population not on electorate. All such councils, with
the exception of one, are lower tier authorities. They are not involved
in the big strategic issues to which I referred, although they are
involved increasingly through enhanced two-tier working and under the
auspices of the local area agreement. It boils down to a pragmatic
approach. The one exception is the county of Rutland, re-created by a
former Prime Minister out of&#151;probably worthy&#151;nostalgia.
Rutland certainly has not asked for executive arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07022085000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concede to the Committee that
the question is where one draws the boundary and how far one involves
executive arrangements. I recognise that point, but it is right that
the Government, and indeed, Parliament should draw the line at some
point. Otherwise chaos would ensue.</div>
					<a name="07022085000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment that the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove has tabled would not achieve what he wants, and
that is because of the way in which it is written. Crucially, it would
not achieve what my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South would
like. What it describes as the enhanced committee structure can be
achieved under existing executive arrangements in the 2000 Act. If I
have the opportunity, I shall put into context those arrangements,
particularly the points about Brighton and Hove, which is I imagine
waiting with bated breath to find out how it fits into the clause. On
that point, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07022085000528"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I said at the beginning that the clause is
six-and-a-half pages long. Perhaps I made it more difficult for hon.
Members by offering three different options, but some criticism of the
amendments did not, perhaps understandably, appreciate that.</div>
					<a name="07022085000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, amendment No. 34
would effectively provide all councils with the self-rule option; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 283</div>amendment No. 100 would provide self-rule to all district and
metropolitan councils; and amendment No. 99 would provide self-rule to
all councils of any shape with a population of up to 850,000. They were
options, and perhaps if I had focused on just one, we might have had a
slightly different debate, although then no doubt the criticism would
have been that I had not taken account of other
options.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000429"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15 pm</div>
					<a name="07022085000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I started by saying that I
should like the Minister to come out of his centralist mindset, seeing
as he has talked to the rest of us about doing so, and I am
disappointed that he has not. The debate has brought out some accurate
points. It is certainly true that my amendment does not define an
enhanced committee system, but if close definition of the outcome had
been intended in the Bill, we might have expected from the Government a
little more precision on the directly elected executive. Given the
response to the last debate, a lack of precision should not be a reason
for ruling such a system out.</div>
					<a name="07022085000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister set aside 100
years of local government performance&#151;until at least 1948,
although we could take it further forward&#151;when local authorities
in places such as Birmingham, which has been mentioned, and Manchester
were controlling utilities, transport and health as well as all the
services that they now control. They did that using the committee
system and, on the whole, they did it well.</div>
					<a name="07022085000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am disappointed by the
Minister&#146;s response. He recognised that the debate is important
and crucial, but unfortunately he has come down on the wrong side of
it. Once again, he has raised the red herring that there is some
connection between performance or outcomes and the governance system.
In a previous debate, I think I heard him accept that there was no
connection; that is certainly the view of the Audit Commission, which
believes that there is no connection between the governance system and
outputs and outcomes.</div>

it cannot detect any difference in the performances of authorities
based on their existing leadership model. That includes those with the
alternative arrangements. They are neither noticeably worse nor
noticeably better, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 284</div>and the same can be said for each of the categories. If the Minister

Benton.</div>
					<a name="07022085000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
gives the Minister his second opportunity to come out of his centralist
mindset in relation to the requirement for a referendum before a
mayoral system can be introduced. The clause removes that requirement,
but the intention of the amendment is to restore it. Again, the debate
was rehearsed to some extent on Second Reading. There have been 32
mayoral referendums, but only 12 of those have been successful, in the
sense that they have approved a mayor, while 20 have been
unsuccessful. In the cases of four of the 12 successful referendums,
there are vigorous campaigns to get rid of the mayor. The Minister said
on Second Reading that it is of course possible to get rid of a mayor,
which led me to have a careful look at the wording. It is indeed
possible to do that, but only provided that the mayor agrees, because
the council has to sign off any such
change.</div>
					<a name="07022085000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
current situation. Whatever the merits of the mayoral system, at least
this completely novel form of local government required endorsement by
the public before it was put in place. As the Library note states, Lord
Hattersley has
said:</div>
					<a name="07022085000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Originally
the idea of switching from a proper council to an elected mayor had to
be endorsed by the local people...But the rules have been revised.
If a local authority wants to hand over its responsibilities to one
individual supported by anonymous councillors with emasculated powers,
it is now free to do so. The obligation to organise a referendum has
been scrapped. Too many referendums produce the wrong result. That
decision was, we must hope, the death throes of New Labour&#146;s
novel definition of local democracy&#151;the right of the people to
choose as long as they make the choice that the government
wants.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022085000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could hardly
have put it better
myself.</div>
					<a name="07022085000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
extremely difficult to see any decentralising or empowering tendency at
work. Local people, who have so far said by two to one that they do not
want mayoral systems, will not be given the chance to choose, as it
will be for councils to decide. I want to hear the Government&#146;s
answer to the criticism that they are proceeding simply in order to
force through more mayors in the face of popular dissent. The facts are
very clear. There is no need for me to go on any longer, but if the
Minister would like to comment in passing on the way in which proposed
new section 33N would be used to get rid of a mayor under the present
system, I would be interested to hear his
explanation.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000557"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I am grateful to
the hon. Member for Hazel Grove for tabling the amendment and giving us
the opportunity to debate this issue. The first premise of his speech,
and of the amendment, is that the Government want more local
authorities to take up the mayoral model, but that is not our policy.
Our policy is that local authorities should have strong executive
arrangements and that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 286</div>should be up to them to decide whether they are within the boundaries
that we have debated
today.</div>
					<a name="07022085000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Neither
the Government nor I see what the hon. Gentleman described as the loss
of a referendum as a defeat. It is good that some local authorities
have taken up referendums. When the result has been against the mayoral
model, it has helped to enhance the democratic process and to reconnect
the local authority with the people. To think that that is the
Government&#146;s objective is to misunderstand what we are trying to
achieve in prompting the debate about executive arrangements. We do not
prompt the debate about mayors in order to impose&#151;via the front
door, back door or a side door&#151;a mayoral model. It is evident
from our policy decisions and debates that that is not the case. We are
saying to local authorities, &#147;We want you to have more power,
but we want you to have in place the arrangements that would best suit
that
purpose.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022085000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the heart of the debate is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second premise,
on which we differ, although it is an honourable difference. When he
moved the amendment, he said that there should be a requirement to hold
a referendum. In other words, were the amendment to be passed, we in
central Government and Parliament would tell a council what it had to
do in such circumstances. There is a similar debate on the unitary
proposals. We are not saying to councils what the public test has to
be. If one is a devolutionist, one has to trust the council. I imagine
that if a council were to resolve to move to a mayoral model and that
model was unpopular in the area, the public would have their say at the
ballot box&#151;indeed, I am certain that that would be the case.
Therefore, the premise on which the hon. Gentleman has based his case
is not where the Government are coming from. There may be, or may have
been, people in the Government who thought that it would be a good idea
to have mayors everywhere and to impose their introduction, but that is
not Government policy.</div>

							<a name="07022085000558"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> The Minister has, to some extent, pre-empted me,
but the Prime Minister is not yet a former post holder. The Prime
Minister seemed extremely keen on this form of government. Indeed, it
has been suggested that that might be why the measure was first
introduced.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000559"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. There
is a danger in politics that the Opposition believe their own
propaganda too much. Our manifesto makes our intention very clear. The
prompting of the debate about mayors is not so that the Government can
impose their favourite model, but to ensure that there is debate about
executive
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07022085000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has taken a perfectly consistent position, and I commend him
on it. He has said that the decision should be by referendum, and it
will still be possible under the Bill for the public to petition for a
referendum. Also, executive arrangements that have been determined by
referendum may be changed only by another referendum. The clause adds
to our manifesto commitment that local authorities should be able to
make that choice, which is why we reject the notion put forward in the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment.</div>

					<a name="07022085000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked me specifically about proposed new section 33N to the
Local Government Act 2000, which is set out in clause 41 of this Bill.
It ensures that changes to the governance arrangements of mayor and
cabinet executive or elected executive&#151;he would not like to see
those, but in such circumstances, this would apply&#151;cannot be
made without the specific consent of the elected mayor or the elected
executive leader, both of whom have a direct mandate from the
electorate of the whole council area.
</div>
					<a name="07022085000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would be to enable an authority to
make changes to its constitution, such as changes to the allocation of
responsibility for functions between the full council and the
executive, without needing to ensure beforehand that the executive was
content with that. That would undermine the accountability of the
executive. Those are the reasons why I reject the point of view that
the hon. Gentleman has put forward.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000560"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> Will the Minister clarify whether proposed new
section 33N(2) would mean that if an elected mayor or leader lost a
motion of confidence in his own performance, he could thereby prevent
the change in structure and keep himself in
post?</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000561"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> A directly elected leader, be they a mayor or an
executive under the arrangements that we were discussing, can be
removed only by the electorate, unless criminal or other such activity
is involved&#151;similarly, a Member of Parliament is elected for a
period of office. We are saying that an indirectly elected leader would
be elected by the full council for a period of four years, unless they
lose the confidence of the council, which would be expressed, as
happens now, through a resolution. Our intention is minor, but it is
symbolically
important.</div>
					<a name="07022085000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						At
the moment, a council leader faces re-election by the full council
every year. That normally happens at the annual general meeting on the
Saturday following local elections, although it sometimes occurs in the
following week. In practice, where there is majority control the
decision is made by the majority group. Where there is no overall
control, which is the case in a significant number of councils, that is
subject to the arrangements. The council leader needs re-endorsement
each year.</div>
					<a name="07022085000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under this
proposal, the constitution of the council would assume that the leader
would stay in office for four years, unless there is a motion of no
confidence in them at any council meeting, so the presumption is the
other way round.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000562"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> That would move towards the old Scottish system
of a four-year convenorship, as opposed to having one-year leadership.
Does the Minister intend or recognise that that will simply be bypassed
in real life by the way in which we do things in England? Will he be a
little more explicit about why he thinks that we need this provision
rather than just leaving things as they
are?</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000563"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. Because
of the process of dividing the role of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 288</div>executive from the role of back-bench overview and scrutiny, the council
as a corporate body requires its executive power to be accountable, and
the presumption of leadership for four years enhances that. I admit
that that is more symbolic than practical in the real world, and some
local authority leaders have said that they would prefer an annual
endorsement as part of their strong leadership, which is a reasonable
point of view. To answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question directly,
placing that executive power in the office of the leader will enhance
accountability and the council&#146;s ability&#151;let alone its
leader&#146;s ability&#151;to implement its strategic objectives
with its
partners.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000564"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I very much appreciate the Minister&#146;s
generosity in giving way. I want to take him on to a different issue:
will he confirm the point in the Library briefing that the only way to
change an existing electoral mayoral system is if the existing elected
mayor agrees to it under proposed new section 33N(2)(a)? That seems to
be the
model.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000565"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Let me explain again the principle behind the
policy that we are pursuing, as laid out in the Bill. The route by
which an executive arrangement has been made is the route by which it
can be undone. Of course, some stability for that must be built in and
an elected mayor can resign or face other circumstances that would
render him or her incapable of holding the office. In the absence of
that&#151;this is the case in Stoke-on-Trent&#151;the elected
mayor, who was elected directly by the population and whose office was
created by the referendum, must stay in office until the end of the
period.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000566"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> May I press the Minister on that point? Proposed
new section 33N is apparently a clear statement that a proposal to
change governance arrangements cannot be implemented unless the elected
mayor has given written consent to the proposed change. In the event of
a campaign against a mayor or popular consent against a mayor, he or
she is entrenched unless they sign something according to that
provision. Will the Minister tell me whether that is
correct?</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000567"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman slightly misunderstands what
proposed new section 33N does. It does not apply to changing the model
of governance, which is not what it refers to. The hon. Gentleman has
quoted proposed new section 33N(1), which is not about changing the
model of
governance.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000568"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> Perhaps this is a matter to take up outside the
Committee. However, the fact is that according to the Library note and
my reading of proposed new section 33N(2)(a), the mayor cannot be
dislodged and a new system cannot be proposed by the council unless the
mayor gives assent to
that.</div>

knows that the Government&#146;s view is that directly elected forms
of executive arrangements provide the strongest and most visible
leadership and are therefore the most accountable. As with a mayor, a
directly elected executive allows people to understand who is
responsible for taking difficult decisions&#151;in other words, they
know where the buck stops. People would elect a directly elected
executive on the basis of the manifesto that has been produced and, of
course, they can hold that executive to account. However, under that
system they expressly elect a leader and members of the executive. When
they cast their vote they are choosing the person&#151;the executive
leader&#151;whom they want to be in charge of delivering a manifesto
and policies with the help of the executive members on his or her
slate, if I can use that word.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 290</div>
					<a name="07022085000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The executive powers of the
council rest in the office of the leader in those circumstances as in
the other two options, and it is therefore essential that if that
person ceases to hold office, the electorate are able to choose whom
they wish to replace that leader. Of course, that would result in a
by-election, and I suspect that it is part of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concerns about this model. However, I think that
that is right. If the electorate have chosen an executive with a
leader, and that leader resigns or leaves office for some reason, they
should be able to choose a successor. That is a good thing and it will
help to achieve the improvement of local democracy that we all say we
want.</div>
					<a name="07022085000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions
relating to the filling of casual vacancies occurring in the office of
the elected mayor are contained in regulations; they were not included
in the 2000 Act. Broadly, those regulations state that an election to
fill the vacancy shall be held within 35 working days of the
date that the office was declared vacant. Until such an election has
taken place and the vacancy has been filled, the office is filled by
the deputy mayor. Therefore, it would be inconsistent to include in the
Bill the arrangements for such by-elections; to remain consistent, such
provisions should be contained in regulations in order.</div>
					<a name="07022085000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to reassure the
Committee, and take the opportunity to place on record, that we intend
to provide for the filling of vacancies in the office of the leader of
the directly elected executive in exactly the same way that is used for
the office of mayor. Where there is a vacancy for the office of leader
of an elected executive, an election for a new executive would have to
take place within 35 days of the date that the office was declared
vacant. That would be an election for a new leader and a slate of
candidates. Until such an election had taken place and the new
executive had taken office, we would intend to provide for the old
executive, led by the deputy leader, to continue. Requiring the
election of a new leader and executive within 35 days provides the
stability required in an authority and, crucially, the transparency and
accountability that I hope we all want to achieve. That is my
explanation of how to make a workable proposal even more
workable.</div>

					<a name="07022085000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
alluded to this amendment before. It deals with the question whether
the Minister has a fixed determination that a set size of slate should
be put before the electorate when the directly elected model is used,
or whether he would prefer the approach that the Liberal Democrats see
as right, which is that that, too, could be a matter for competition
between the competing teams who seek to run the authority, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 291</div>that the legislation should therefore allow for the executive being of
the size of the winning slate, provided that it is not above a fixed
number. We have said 12, but the Minister might prefer 10 as the
cut-off number. It is a straightforward matter. Would it not be right
to give the council and the electorate the right to choose the size of
the executive team that they have, as well as their political and other
composition?</div>

							<a name="07022085000574"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I again congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his
amendment, because councils that may be looking to adopt different
models would wish to know about these important matters. My own point
of view was influenced significantly by discussions with county council
leaders of different political groupings who pointed out the geography
of county councils and the distances that members had to travel. In one
case, the chair of the county council has to do a 120-mile round trip
to chair a meeting of the council or, indeed, a sub-committee of it. It
was felt that it would be better to have directly elected members who
could carry out functions in the administration, as well as the ward or
division councillors who could concentrate on their patch and travel
less frequently. There are other arguments in favour, and I do not
dismiss those arguments. It is important that we have that
flexibility.</div>
					<a name="07022085000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings us to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interesting suggestion, which,
if I understood him correctly, would allow competing slates to be of
different sizes and give councils greater flexibility. Of course, one
would have some flexibility. If a group wanted to have an executive
slate of 10 including the leader, and in fact to give a portfolio only
to four or five of those, that would be possible under the arrangement.
We have already debated the wider issues behind directly elected
executives and I have not convinced the hon. Gentleman that the
proposal is desirable and workable. I will keep trying, but not for too
long.</div>
					<a name="07022085000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause 39
sets out our intention to extend to elected executives the current
provisions that determine the maximum and minimum number of executives
for mayoral or leader and cabinet models. That means that elected
executives will, including the leader, contain a minimum of three
members and a maximum of 10 members. The number of executive members
that a council has is set out in its constitution and is determined by
the full council. In determining the number of executive members,
councils should have regard to certain factors, including the need to
exercise their functions and the size of the council. The number of
candidates on a slate will therefore be identical to the number of
executives set out in the council&#146;s constitution, which will
have been subject to the consideration of the full council. We have put
the cart before the horse, in other
words.</div>

							<a name="07022085000575"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I am sure that the Minister can easily envisage
circumstances in which an opposition group might say that it had a
different way of running the council, with a different number of
executives, with different departmental allocations, and that that
might be part of a legitimate&#151;indeed, perhaps
essential&#151;theme of value for money or some other argument that
they would wish to deploy. However, they would be trapped by a prior
decision to have an executive of a certain size. I wonder whether the
Minister would consider that situation.</div>

								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I confess to the Committee&#151;I hope that my
Whip will not make a note of this&#151;that I debated this issue with
the Liberal Democrat leader of a county council late one night in a
restaurant somewhere in south-west England. The argument that I made
then was as follows. The full council takes the decision on what model
it will use. The full council takes that decision before the electorate
have chosen which political colour of slate they want to run the
council. In doing so, the council cannot pre-empt the decision of the
electorate. Therefore, the number of people on the elected executive
and what resolution the council forms in setting up that executive
will, of course, come before the people have had their say. The
executive&#146;s obligation, therefore, is to include in the number
of the directly elected executive members the equivalent number to that
which would be in the cabinet of the leader, or indeed hypothetically
the mayor, paying regard to the functions, the geography of the place
and so on.</div>
					<a name="07022085000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, if a slate did not want to adopt that full role and wanted to
change those functions, it would have to justify that to the council in
the first instance. However, it would be wrong to allow a council to
pre-empt the decision of the electorate by changing the constitution in
such a way that a fair comparison could not be made. That was the
conclusion of the late-night debate in a hotel in south-west
England.</div>

								Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> Again I am disappointed by the Minister&#146;s
answer, because under the amendment the council would not be
pre-empting the electorate&#146;s decision; on the contrary, under
his system, the council will be pre-empting that decision. It will
decide whether to have eight, 10, or whatever the number might be of
members, and it will have a constitution that is approved. Under the
system proposed in the Liberal Democrat amendment, the council would
not be pre-empting the electorate&#146;s decision and it would be for
those who contested the executive election to put forward a slate that
they thought was appropriate to the circumstances of that council.
Under the system that I am proposing, far from the council pre-empting
the electorate&#146;s decision, the situation would be exactly the
opposite. However, it is clear that the haze has not yet cleared from
that late-night hotel session and therefore I will not press the
amendment today. I hope that wiser counsel will prevail in the
ministerial office in due course. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07022085000578"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I would like to ask the Minister a question about
the clause. My concern arises from the fact that the Minister envisages
a slate of people being elected under the proposed system. One has to
assume that many of those people will have been councillors, because
they are the people who are most likely to wish to take executive roles
with the authority, and that within a month or thereabouts there would
have to be a by-election for all those members of the slate who have
been elected as leaders of the council. Does the Minister envisage that
that will lead to greater public participation in local elections, or
to less? The only example that I am aware of in recent years of an
election taking place shortly after a another election in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 293</div>which turnout rose was the case of my good friend and neighbour, my hon.
Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack). In
that election, the turnout soared shortly after the general election in
very peculiar circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07022085000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">When there are by-elections
shortly after an all-out election, surely the turnout will be greatly
reduced, which will lead to increasing apathy among the local
electorate for local elections. In any event, it is a challenge for all
those involved in local elections to encourage turnout. Does the
Minister have any examples of any authority anywhere in the world where
a similar system applies? It would be useful for the Committee to know
that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000579"></a>Mr.

						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising a serious
point about the by-election process that could result from this
directly elected model. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to
repeat my comments to <i class="I">The</i>
						<i class="I">Daily Telegraph</i> last week when
I learned with great regret that despite the increased turnout at the
election, the Conservative party have ignored the advice of the

							<a name="07022085000581"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Thank you Mr. Benton. I think you put
it more politely than my Whip was about to do. I have now completely
forgotten the question that I was asked. It was about by-elections. In
our model, if an individual stood both as a ward councillor and as a
member of the slate, he or she would risk winning and losing. In the
event of winning the executive election, they would have to resign the
ward election and in the event of losing they would, if elected at ward
level, carry on in that position. Those individuals would have to face
that decision and make that judgment. It is right that under this model
people cannot hold both offices, just as an elected mayor cannot also
hold a ward councillor position. It is part of the separation of
executive and policy.</div>
					<a name="07022085000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally&#151;this comes back
to the point that I have been trying to get across to the
Committee&#151;it would be the council&#146;s decision whether to
go for this model. If it was aware of the possibility of forcing
by-elections and took the view that it might be damaging to its
democracy because of turnout or other factors&#151;it is not right
for me to pre-empt its considerations&#151;I assume that it would not
go for that model. But it would be a consequence of the model that is
being put forward. I hope that factually answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000582"></a>Mr.

system.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 294</div>
					<a name="07022085000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this country the traditional
way of filling a vacancy is through a by-election and that is what we
are providing for, but there are other approaches in other European
countries. For example, in France some elected representatives have a
deputy elected alongside them. One could point to the example of the
list system in the European Parliament. Those two systems avoid the
need for by-elections, but I do not believe that that is a better
alternative. It is better to give the public the say at the end of the
day. While this model is not based on examples of by-election processes
in other parts of the world there are directly elected executive models
in parts of Europe, particularly in France. I hope again that that is a
factual answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

						</b> The clause deals with the time limit within which
a further referendum can be held to change governance arrangements. The
Bill specifies a period of 10 years in England and five in Wales. Why
there is a difference is an interesting question, and I am sure that
the Minister has a suitable explanation. The period seems to us to
restrict the choices open to a community for changing its governance
arrangements if it discovers that it has made a mistake.</div>
					<a name="07022085000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments propose that no
referendum could be held within four years, rather than the 10 or five
specified. I am interested to hear the Minister&#146;s reasoning
because, given all the emphasis he has placed on getting the model
right and providing local choice and diversity, I would have thought
that he would want to facilitate rather than obstruct an opportunity to
correct an error&#151;learning from the Stoke-on-Trent example, let

						</b> I repeat my earlier point about the Stoke-on-Trent
experience: Stoke-on-Trent that chose that model and now wants to move
away from it. It was not imposed upon Stoke by the Government, nor is
it being taken away against the will of the people of Stoke-on-Trent.
That is the consequence of devolution, and one must live with
it.</div>
					<a name="07022085000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
the hon. Gentleman said, the clause extends the period within which no
more than one referendum can be held from five to 10 years for
authorities in England. That change will provide increased stability
for executive arrangements and prevent see-sawing between different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 295</div>leadership models. He referred to situations in some councils around the
country.</div>
					<a name="07022085000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
difference between the provisions for England and Wales is because of
powers that are given to Wales in clauses that we shall debate later. I
expect that, as a consequence of those powers being given, the Welsh
limit will change to 10 years, but it would be premature on the one
hand to devolve powers to Wales and on the other to dictate what the
period should be. This is another champagne moment, although the hon.
Gentleman looks as though he is more interested in a red wine
moment.</div>
					<a name="07022085000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
that people should have the opportunity to express their views on and
influence their council&#146;s leadership. As I said earlier,
communities will still be able to petition for a referendum for an
elected mayor, and we are extending that provision to directly elected
executives. Local people will also have an opportunity to make their
views known whenever a council proposes to change its executive
arrangements.</div>

in the meantime, before the 10 years are up, a petition could be
launched by local residents. Is he saying that, in that case, the
provision would not have effect or would be superseded, or is he saying
that the petition would lie on the Table until the 10 years
were
up?</div>

							<a name="07022085000589"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Let me finish my point, because the situation will
become clear and it will save the Committee
time.</div>
					<a name="07022085000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						After
earlier debates, Opposition Members should be in no doubt that in order
to plan for and deliver the strategies that we all want, the Government
believe that leadership needs to be strong and accountable. It is the
latter of those criteria that the amendment would affect. It would mean
that a council&#146;s executive arrangements could be changed by
referendum every four years, which would mean that every four-year term
of office could be subject to a referendum on executive arrangements.
If a referendum supported change, the executive would of course be
undermined. The amendment would make that a possibility in every
consecutive term of office. The turbulence caused by that situation
would not be conducive to enabling councillors to improve their
communities. In fact, it would be highly disruptive. That is why we
propose to revise the provision under the Local Government Act 2000 to
extend the minimum period between referendums from five to 10 years in
England to give new executive arrangements the time they need to bed
down and then to provide the stronger leadership that will benefit
their area. To repeat my point on Wales, we propose no change to the
five-year moratorium, as the Welsh Assembly has expressed no desire as
yet to change it. Of course, the decisions of the Assembly anticipate
our deliberations on the enabling powers contained in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022085000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the intention behind the amendments. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove
wants further to increase people&#146;s abilities to change their
council&#146;s executive arrangements. However, there is a balance to
be struck between providing opportunities for communities to express
their views and the stability that provides the foundations for that
better and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 296</div>stronger leadership. I believe that we have struck the right balance.
The petitions that are held now would, of course, lead to a referendum.
Until the Bill is enacted, the five-year moratorium applies. After the
enactment, the 10-year moratorium will apply to provide the stability
that I have talked about.</div>
					<a name="07022085000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat the policy that I
expressed before: the route by which an executive arrangement is
created is the route that must be used to unpick it. In other words,
the decision of a council can never overturn a decision of the people
in a referendum. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points.</div>

length of time that it would take for a local community to unpick
arrangements that it believed were flawed and needed to be changed. The
Minister&#151;or his successor&#151;will come to regret that,
because he will find that there will be occasions where it would be
expedient for the Government to allow local communities to exercise
that choice and not to be inhibited by primary legislation that puts
that barrier in place. Nevertheless, I have made my point, I have heard

Stunell:
						</b> The purpose of the first three amendments, all
tabled by me and my hon. Friends, is to get rid of the proposed
appointed parish councillors. There are many proposals in the Bill
relating to parish councils that we strongly agree with and welcome.
Bearing in mind some of the harsher things that I have had to say
earlier today, let me say straight away that I believe the Government
are approaching the parishes issue appropriately and we shall support
them, on the whole. However, we believe that in respect of the
provision of appointed councillors they have stepped off the
path.</div>
					<a name="07022085000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should be
remembered that parish councils already have the capacity to co-opt.
They may co-opt to fill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 297</div>vacancies, and they frequently do. Indeed, the people they co-opt to
vacancies would, in many cases, conform to the intentions here.
However, they are co-opted if there are not enough candidates to
contest an election, never mind to have one, and if vacancies remain
afterwards. We think that parish councils ought to retain that
democratic element and that those who serve on them should do so as a
result of an electoral process, and not following an entirely separate
appointment. Amendment No. 121 simply reads: &#147;leave out
subsection (4)&#148;, which relates to appointed councillors, because
we believe that the intention is mistaken. Amendment No. 122 would
provide that any such appointed person could not vote on any matter
before the council. In other words, they would be non-voting members of
the parish
council.</div>

								Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> Co-option is a power that parish councillors have
already, provided that there is an unfilled vacancy on the council. It
is a second-best situation, so to speak, in order to make up the
numbers to the total of the council&#146;s representation. The
Government&#146;s proposal is perhaps for the Minister to explain,
but I understand from the clause and explanatory notes that they
believe a wider range of people might serve on parish councils as a
result. But, that might be said of Parliament and of principal
councils. I wonder whether the Government think that in order to get a
wider range of people into Parliament it would be a good idea just to
appoint them. Actually, I suspect they do think that that is rather a
good idea. If parish councils are to be, say, residents associations or
some sort of sounding boards, that is fine as we need all sorts of
representatives. However, if they are to be democratic institutions,
they should comprise those who have stood for election and been voted
in, regardless of whether or not they are community leaders.</div>
					<a name="07022085000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a separate and rather
important practical point, the selection of appointees will be in the
hands of parish councillors whose views on whom should be selected
might vary quite a lot from those of the Minister. We therefore believe
we should retain parish councils as democratic institutions and
not&#151;as was suggested in a sedentary comment&#151;turn them
into a version of the House of Lords where the great and the good are
added to those who can be bothered to get elected. In very many parish
communities, if people know that they have two means of getting on to
the parish council&#151;going through the hassle of standing and
getting elected or sitting back, waiting and getting
appointed&#151;the number of people offering themselves for election
will not increase. The process proposed by the Government will
undermine the democratic nature of parish councils and I hope very much
that the Minister will accept the
amendments.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): Amendment
No. 115 is essentially a probing amendment to tease out the
circumstances in which councillors can be appointed. I would like some
reassurance from the Minister that the clause will not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 298</div>simply provide a mechanism for those with the largest and most organised
voices in a community to get undue representation on parish councils,
which in the future might have considerably greater powers than they do
now. The Minister will be aware that some people who work with the most
vulnerable, excluded and disadvantaged groups can easily be overlooked
because they do not seek credit for themselves. They are exactly the
sort of people who would make excellent
appointees.</div>
					<a name="07022085000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
hour, I shall not labour the point, but I simply ask the Minister
whether regulations would ensure that a balance of community
representation is maintained and encouraged when appointments are
made.</div>

							<a name="07022085000598"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Angela E. Smith):
						</b> That may be a champagne
moment.</div>
					<a name="07022085000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
that hon. Members seek to amend will allow parish councils to appoint
councillors in addition to the normal quota of elected councillors as
supplemental councillors co-opted to fill vacancies in the office of
elected parish councillor. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford asked
what the difference is. I shall come to that in a moment, but there
will be no difference in the council&#146;s
role.</div>
					<a name="07022085000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want first to
draw a sharp distinction between the official process of co-option and
appointment as in the clause. All of us want parish councils to be the
focal point of the communities that they serve, and to be as vital and
effective in their role as they possibly can be. Some councils embrace
that philosophy. If they could appoint people by virtue of their role
in the community&#151;for example, local teachers&#151;they would
be able to add to their
effectiveness.</div>
					<a name="07022085000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hazel Grove was quite cynical about the great and the
good. I believe that parish councils want to embrace a wider group of
people than just the great and the
good.</div>

						There
may be doctors, business people, faith and community leaders, local
youth workers; someone suggested the local carnival organiser. They are
people who contribute to the life of the community, but perhaps by
virtue of the work that they do are not eligible to stand for the
council. The appointment of such people could greatly enhance the work
of councils, and we want to give power to the councils to appoint them
if they wish to. We do not want to require councils to do it, and we
will not put any pressure on them to do so. The intention of the clause
is simply to enable them to appoint if they believe that people in
their area&#151;in their community&#151;can contribute to making
the council more
effective.</div>
					<a name="07022085000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
long as there are tight limits on the scale of such appointments, we
are somewhat less concerned about the notional dilution of the
council&#146;s democratic credentials. As we heard, co-option is
already commonplace in councils. In some areas, contested elections are
relatively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 299</div>rare, particularly in smaller parishes. Co-option may be used to fill a
vacancy; if there is no vacancy but somebody has a contribution to make
to the life of the parish and to making the parish council more
effective, the option is open to the
council.</div>
					<a name="07022085000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for City of Durham asked about limits being imposed
and the guidance that would be available. Although I cannot go as far
as she would like, I can say that I recognise that limits are
important. That is why we are seeking a regulation-making power. We
want to ensure that the great majority of councillors are elected and
that the council as a whole is democratically
accountable.</div>

							<a name="07022085000601"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I am not unsympathetic to the general point that the
Minister is making about having the right people on parish councils,
but I am a little concerned that the clause is somewhat bureaucratic.
If parish councillors want to consult the right people in the parish to
help them achieve something, they can easily ask. The clause creates a
new procedure.</div>
					<a name="07022085000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
appointed councillors with no vote and no say also be subject to the
Standards Board&#146;s provisions and so on? Will we encourage people
to get involved in this way? Surely an informal procedure to ensure
that the right people are involved in the council would be better than
what is
proposed.</div>
					
					<a name="07022085000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000602"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman pre-empts some comments that
I was about to make. I shall deal with his points now. First, appointed
councillors will be covered by the same standards and requirements in
respect of behaviour of councillors as any other councillors, because
they will be full councillors. That is the difference. He says that the
clause is too bureaucratic because councillors can just ask people for
advice. We do not need legislation to ask anybody in the community for
advice. If the council wishes to get advice, it can do so. What we are
proposing is something different. People will be full councillors and
able to vote on all issues other than the co-option or appointment of
new members to the council. One of the differences is that the decision
on the appointment of new additional councillors will be taken only by
elected councillors, not co-optee councillors. I assure the Committee
that the regulations proposed will deal with that imperative.</div>
					<a name="07022085000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will also work closely with
the National Association of Local Councils and other key stakeholders
as we develop the details of the regulations and guidance. As part of
that work we need to consider the maximum ratio of appointed
councillors to elected councillors that will be permitted. At this
stage, a maximum ratio of 1:4 or 1:3 would be a sensible rule.
We also need to consider how long councillors&#146; appointments
should last.</div>
					<a name="07022085000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman implicitly asked why people would not stand for election in
the normal way. As I said at the beginning, there may be good reasons
why people cannot stand for election. For example, it may be in
someone&#146;s conditions of employment that they cannot stand for
election when, nevertheless, they may have a contribution to make. It
may not be appropriate to someone&#146;s profession that they stand
for election: for example, a local doctor may feel that it is
inappropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 300</div>for him or her do so. Whatever the reason, such people may have the
expertise, experience or commitment to their area and feel that they
would be an asset to the council and be willing to serve.</div>
					<a name="07022085000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 48 and 121
proposed by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove would wreck the measure. I
understand that is where he is coming from, but we oppose those
amendments. Amendment No. 122 would allow councils to appoint members
but would then prevent those appointees from taking part in decisions
that require a vote. I am worried about the hon. Gentleman because
several times during proceedings he has described himself as being
disappointed and I feel that I may be disappointing him again. As I
said to the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, we do not want
appointed councillors simply to be advisers to the council: they are
not observers to councils; they are there for councillors. Someone who
cannot vote on any matter coming before the parish council cannot be
said to be a councillor. As I have already pointed out, councils do not
need legislation to allow them to take advice from people in the
communities; they can do that already. We want the councillors who are
brought in to have the same voting rights as elected councillors, with
the exceptions that I have
mentioned.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000603"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I draw the Under-Secretary&#146;s attention to
paragraph (3)(d) which says that the regulations will deal, among other
things, with</div>
					<a name="07022085000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the right
of persons appointed to participate in decision-making by the council
(including voting)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07022085000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the Minister&#146;s own Bill envisages circumstances in
which that right to vote might be circumscribed by the regulations.
What is her objection to putting that in the
Bill?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000604"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> The regulations that we are talking about apply
to very minor cases. The example I gave was that it would be completely
wrong for an appointed member of a council to take part in a vote to
appoint another member. That is very limited and the hon. Gentleman is
looking at a far wider picture than that envisaged in the regulations.
Why would people want to come forward&#151;for example, a youth
worker or somebody working in the community&#151;and spend time
engaging with and being part of a council if, as the hon. Gentleman
suggests, they were not allowed to vote and take part in proceedings? I
should confirm that people appointed would be subject to the Standards
Board code of conduct for councillors and would be expected to behave
in accordance with
that.</div>
					<a name="07022085000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
123 would prevent the Secretary of State from regulating the right of
persons appointed to councils to participate in decision making. That
was the effect the hon. Gentleman was looking for, but I have given
reasons why that should be the case. We want to take the opportunity to
look at the proper limits that there should be on those
councillors.</div>
					<a name="07022085000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 115 seeks to
empower the Secretary of State to regulate the appointment of
councillors and their subsequent holding of office by making provision
about the degree of representation in the wider community. This
amendment is rather different and I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 301</div>have some sympathy with the objectives that have been set out. My hon.
Friend the Member for City of Durham said it was a probing amendment,
and unfortunately if it is put to the vote, I must ask the Committee to
vote against it. However, it makes a constructive suggestion and one
that I hope parishes will take on board. My hon. Friend gave clear
reasons why she has concerns, but one of the reasons I must ask the
Committee to reject the amendment is because it offers no definition of
the wider community. We take it to be a reference to the democratic
make-up of the parish in which the appointment was made, but it is
quite vague and could be a recipe for trouble later on. For that
reason, we have to resist the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07022085000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There are,
however, more fundamental reasons why we have to resist, and I am sure
that my hon. Friend will understand. She wants to allow the Secretary
of State somehow to put the onus on parish councils to correct failures
of the democratic process by delivering a set of councillors that
better reflects the make-up of the community from which they are drawn.
For example, there might not be enough women councillors, or an older
council might need youth representation. The council&#146;s make-up
might have a different balance from that of the community as a
whole.</div>
					<a name="07022085000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the measures is to be fairly permissive to councils and to give parish
councils the flexibility that might be helpful to them, but we are
reluctant to set any expectation that the Secretary of State will
interfere by regulation to correct some perceived failure of the
democratic process. That is not our purpose, and we do not think that
it is achievable in practice. I accept my hon. Friend&#146;s comments
about the loudest voice being heard. We want parish councils to be able
to look around their communities for expertise that could be of use.
Often, those voices are not heard or are not the loudest, but such
people have a role to play in the
community.</div>
					<a name="07022085000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
modest measures intended to assist councils. We want to allow parish
councils to appoint additional members, but not on a scale that would
be seen by right-minded people seriously to undermine the democratic
process. We must ask whether allowing appointments of one or just a few
extra councillors is a suitable basis on which to adjust the make-up of
parish councils to reflect the communities they serve. We think that it
is very difficult and probably wrong to try to achieve that in such a
way. In our view, it would be better to trust the good judgment of
parish councils to ascertain which people will be an asset and serve
the community best. The measures will give them some room to manoeuvre,
and the intention is
clear.</div>
					<a name="07022085000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measures
will be a useful step forward. We think that they will not damage local
democracy but indeed enhance it, and I hope that hon. Members will
therefore not press their amendments. Otherwise, I shall ask the
Committee to join with me in rejecting
them.</div>

							<a name="07022085000605"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> The Under-Secretary made a flying start this
morning, but as she predicted, it has ended in disappointment. She said
some interesting things. She seems to have a model of how parish
councils operate. I am pleased to see that the Department has such a
positive picture of them, but there are 26,000 parish councils, which
have highly variable performance, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 302</div>something like 90 per cent. of the Standards Board&#146;s work
concerns disputes with or between parish councils. I was not reassured
by her comment that the appointed members would be exactly the same as
other councillors and subject, as they are, to the Standards Board.
That does not fill me with a positive feeling about the
proposal.</div>
					<a name="07022085000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Under-Secretary says that she does not want to see any restriction on
appointments, except in the most minor way to prevent councillors from
appointing their friends, which is sensible. However, to rule out the
possibility that such appointees might have an agenda of their own that
goes beyond their role as, say, youth worker or doctor or vicar, and
might see their primary route to the parish council as being through
the electoral system seems to be a disappointing discounting of the
value of democracy in parishes. I shall not ask the Committee to vote
on the amendment, but I do make it clear that I believe the clause to
be completely misconceived. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07022085000618"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I am happy to move these amendments briefly in the
name of my hon. Friends. We will have an opportunity to talk more about
parishes in our next 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 303</div>sitting, so I shall not rehearse now a number of the issues that I want
to raise in relation to them, but shall confine myself to the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07022085000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to widen the scope for the use of the power
to promote well-being. Instead of confining the power to eligible
councils, which are effectively those that will be designated under the
quality parish councils criteria, the amendment would extend the power
and give that opportunity to all councils. That is in line with our
general approach of being as permissive as possible in relation to the
devolved powers.</div>
					<a name="07022085000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I support that
extension, I offer one caveat that bears on what I said about the
previous amendment. At the weekend, I had a meeting with all my parish
councils. I split them into two groups and I saw about two-thirds of
the 54 parish councils in my constituency. We had a good discussion
about the Bill and the various powers that it contains, and one of the
clearest messages that came out of the meeting was that although people
thoroughly enjoyed being part of the parish council, they were
concerned that over time, more and more responsibilities were coming
their way and they did not know whether they could find the people to
do the job.</div>
					<a name="07022085000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
read two short quotes, the first of which is from Cardington parish
council, which said to me in a letter dated 8
January:</div>
					<a name="07022085000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Concern
was also expressed that at this time it is already difficult to get
people willing to volunteer to become Parish Councillors, the volume of
consultation documents that are received for comment, and with the
Local Authorities being penalised if they do not meet the Target Dates
for
responses.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022085000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stevington
parish council
said:</div>
					<a name="07022085000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The role
of the Council appears to be changing and both the Council and the
Clerk will inevitably have to take on more duties; we forsee difficulty
in encouraging residents to stand for the Parish Council in the future
if the role becomes more
onerous.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022085000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I received a
number of other similar remarks. Those two comments can be taken to
represent them all.</div>
					<a name="07022085000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power to promote well-being
is incredibly widely drawn. The Local Government Act 2000 enables the
local authority to promote well-being where it considers it
will</div>
					<a name="07022085000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;achieve any one or
more of the following
objects&#151;</div>
					<a name="07022085000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
the promotion or improvement of the economic well-being of their
area,</div>
					<a name="07022085000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) the
promotion or improvement of the social well-being of their area,
and</div>
					<a name="07022085000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) the promotion
or improvement of the environmental well-being of their
area.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022085000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">The various powers
that are available to a council that is granted such a power include
the power
to</div>
					<a name="07022085000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) incur
expenditure,</div>
					<a name="07022085000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) give
financial assistance to any person,</div>
					<a name="07022085000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) enter into arrangements or
agreements with any
person&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022085000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so
on.</div>
					<a name="07022085000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Under-Secretary can briefly give a sense of how she expects the powers
to be used by parish councils and why she feels they should be limited
by qualifying criteria. Will she also bear in mind that because the
powers will exist, and people will seek them, there is a danger that
parish councils are being given rather too much to do? Their original
purpose is changing and it is difficult to get the right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 304</div>sense because we are caught in a trap. Many parish councils want greater
responsibility, but will the extension of powers and more
responsibility encourage anyone new to come on board and share the
burden with the small group of people who at present give a huge amount
of time to local affairs? We had an interesting discussion on the
matter with the parish councils and, by and large, the consensus was
that they did not think they would encourage new people.</div>
					<a name="07022085000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was disappointed, because
members of the Committee are involved in the process of government and
it matters a lot to us. I am interested in the Under-Secretary&#146;s
thinking on the promotion of well-being. How many councils does she
think will take up such a provision? Is she keen for it to be
permissive so that if a council wants to take a chance, will it be able
to do so rather than fulfilling the criteria of being an eligible
council and going down the quality parish council route?</div>
					<a name="07022085000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Will the
Under-Secretary give us her view, to which we can return when we
discuss other provisions relating to parish councils? The growing
bureaucratisation of parish councils is not helping the process of
getting more people informally involved. They fear that their
involvement is no longer informal but getting more serious. That might
not encourage people to engage with local matters in the way that we
would like them to.</div>

							<a name="07022085000619"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. He
shared with us some of the dilemmas of this issue, which we will
continue to address in the Committee. I will say something about the
reason for this clause being in the Bill and answer his questions in
that context.</div>
					<a name="07022085000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Bill
takes forward many of the White Paper&#146;s commitments to empower
local government. We want to extend that philosophy to parish councils
by giving local people much more freedom in respect of well-being in
their own area. Parish councils already have a long list of specific
activities and powers and an additional power under section 137 of the
Local GovernmentAct 1972 to undertake actions that will bring
direct benefit. That power is limited at present, not least because
there is a ceiling on the amount of money per head that can be spent by
a parish on specific objectives. It is currently &#163;5.54 per annum
per person.</div>
					<a name="07022085000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 56
will release some parish councils from those constraints and give them
additional powers to enable them to promote social, economic and
environmental well- being in their areas. Hon. Members will be aware
that district councils have that power under the Local Government Act
2000 and they must have regard to their own community strategies in
exercising that power. We did not want to place an additional burden on
parish councils and require them to develop their own community
strategies too. To avoid duplication of bureaucratisation, the Bill
says that they must have regard to those strategies prepared by a
higher-tier authority. We will not require the parish councils to get
into additional bureaucracy themselves. Many parishes anyway produce
their own local plans and local authorities are increasingly having
regard to local parish plans.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 305</div>
					<a name="07022085000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman said, the
power of well-being is potentially a very broad power and we do not
seek to constrain it by placing statutory limits on eligible
parishes&#146; expenditure, but it would be prudent to have some
safeguards in place; the problem is how many there should be. Clearly,
not every parish council would have the right to the power of
well-being because the size of parish councils varies enormously and so
does the work they do, their ambitions and, indeed, their
competence.</div>
					<a name="07022085000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want
to ensure that those who want to use the new power have the capacity
and the competencies to do so and that is where the eligibility
criteria come in. The White Paper said that the criteria would be based
on the non-statutory quality parish scheme, which provides a good
starting point for thinking about the issues. However, I cannot give an
assurance that those criteria are automatically sufficient for what we
are seeking to do. As hon. Members may be aware, in the quality parish
councils scheme, a parish council must be able to demonstrate that it
is representative of, and actively engages with, all parts of the
community, providing vision, identity and a sense of belonging. It must
also demonstrate that it is effectively and properly managed, and has
the ability and capacity to take on the enhanced role and
responsibility that quality status is likely to
bring.</div>
					<a name="07022085000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
is a good starting point for development of the criteria that a parish
with power of well-being should have. A number of tests have already
been devised. They cover such matters as electoral mandate,
qualifications of the clerk of the council, the frequency and
administration of council meetings, communication, community and so
on.</div>
					<a name="07022085000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made some probing comments about whether the Government are
seeking to put a duty or obligation on every parish council to have to
meet the criteria for power of well-being. We are not&#151;that would
be too onerous for certain parish councils, and many would not want it.
We are not trying artificially to limit the number of parish councils
that could have a power of well-being, but we want to ensure that the
power is exercised sensibly and that the parish itself has the
competence and ability to exercise the power. The number of parishes
with quality parish status is fairly small&#151;approximately 300.
That might increase, but not because of a drive to get higher numbers.
It will increase if councils want the power, and are sufficiently
competent to be given
it.</div>
					<a name="07022085000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have discussed
matters with the National Association of Local Councils, and the
association is broadly content with the Government&#146;s position.
When we consider the precise criteria, we shall talk to the association
and to other stakeholders, including the LGA. In considering whether
the power of well-being should go further than the quality parish
scheme, we shall also explore whether, for example, the criteria should
address potential financial
implications.</div>
					<a name="07022085000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want
to devolve power so that local people can have greater influence on
services in their own local communities. We want councils to be able to
respond better to local circumstances. However, appropriate safeguards
have to be attached to devolution, both for the sake of the public and
of councillors. By providing suitable appropriate criteria, we can find
a way forward that is appropriate for all.</div>

Burt:
						</b> The Under-Secretary may not be able to answer now,
but let me put an idea in her mind. Parish councils might come forward
with a wish to take more powers, or powers that are outside the scope
of the power of well-being&#151;especially in relation to planning.
They might say to the Government, &#147;If you really want to devolve
powers to us that will involve our local community, can we have more
control over such and such an issue?&#148;. Will the Government be
open to that
approach?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022085000621"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> Parish councils are statutory consultees of the
higher-tier authority. If that authority wanted the parish council to
take on such a role, it would have to ask it to do so, but the
Government have no plans to take planning responsibilities away from
the councils that currently have those responsibilities. The proposal
we are making is different. It is about a power to engage the local
community so that that community is at the heart of things. The power
of well-being can do that. It is not about putting more onerous duties
on parish councillors.</div>

be encouraging if we spend a bit more time on them at our next sitting.
