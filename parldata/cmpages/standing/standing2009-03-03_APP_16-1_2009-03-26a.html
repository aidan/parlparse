David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I welcome you back to the
Committee, Mrs. Humble, as I do members of the
Committee&#151;well, certainly Opposition members of the Committee;
unfortunately, there are still only two hon. Members on the Labour
Benches.</div>
<a name="09032735000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes it
feels as though we are slaving away without any attention from the
outside world being paid to our deliberations. I was therefore
particularly pleased that our discussions this morning attracted
widespread media attention under the headline &#147;Labour Loses Key
Committee Votes&#148;, with a lovely photograph of the hon. Member
for Brent, South at the top of the
article.</div><a name="09032735000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
said this morning that there is every reason for the Government to
accept amendment 222, to invite Ofqual to ensure that recognised
awarding bodies are consulted as part of the processes laid down in the
clause. However, if the Minister is not willing to accept the
amendment, perhaps she will confirm and clarify that Ofqual will be
expected to consult in such a way with the recognised awarding
bodies.</div><a name="09032735000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032735001278"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Clause
137 is about the criteria for the accreditation of qualifications. With
last week&#146;s news that Cambridge university will now be looking
to distinguish bright pupils by accepting the new A* A-level grade, it
shows just how far school qualifications have gone awry. It seems that
they are no longer used for businesses or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column634" />Column number: 634</div>universities. Only last year, Sir Richard Sykes, the rector of Imperial
college, mooted the idea of an entrance exam,
stating:</div><a name="09032735001129"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are doing this not because we don&#146;t believe in A levels, but we
can&#146;t use the A level any more as a discriminator
factor.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to say that he believes in many aspects of the current
qualifications system but cannot ignore the weight of evidence that
points to one fundamental truth&#151;that A-levels are no longer
created with the needs of business and higher education in
mind.</div><a name="09032735000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim of the amendment is to halt the trend and reverse the situation in
which a 2008 CBI survey found that 40 per cent. of companies had
serious concerns about the literacy and numeracy of their employees.
Through open and honest consultation with employers and those in higher
education, we can begin to ensure that the criteria for accreditation
prioritises literacy and numeracy as well as knowledge, concept and
ideas in our qualifications. Currently, the qualifications system seems
to be falling far short of that.</div>
<a name="09032735000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already heard about the worrying statistics from the Royal Society of
Chemistry, which said that teenagers who get 35 per cent. of the
answers correct when faced with today&#146;s examination papers would
only have got 15 per cent. correct if they were dealing with papers
from the 1960s.</div>
<a name="09032735000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Universities
and employers have a proper and very vital interest in driving up
standards. A 2008 Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development
survey found that 90 per cent. of companies expected their skill needs
to grow, with 36 per cent. requiring high-level skills. At a time when
our economy is in deep peril, the development of higher skills is at an
all-time premium. We cannot afford to fail our students, our employers
or our universities. We must ensure that the qualifications that are
the route out of our problems are a collaborative venture built with
the best interests of all those parties at heart. It is the purpose of
amendment 199 to ensure that there is consultation with the users of
qualifications, higher education and
employers.</div><a name="09032735000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001279"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b> Clauses 130, 137 and 140
give Ofqual the duties to publish criteria for the recognition of
awarding bodies, the accreditation of qualifications and the assignment
of guided learning hours to the relevant qualification. In each case,
Ofqual must consult such persons as it considers appropriate before
setting or revising the criteria. The amendments would change that by
specifying certain persons whom Ofqual must consult. There is no need
to specify that in the Bill because Ofqual will already have to do
it.</div><a name="09032735000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
222, 224 and 225 would require Ofqual to consult recognised awarding
bodies before changing their criteria for recognition, for
accreditation and for guided learning hours. Of course Ofqual will do
that. No regulator is going to ignore the community it regulates in a
consultation exercise. If it helps the hon. Member for Yeovil, I will
put it on the record that I expect Ofqual to consult those bodies.
There is nothing to be gained by specifying that in
legislation.</div><a name="09032735000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
199 is a variant on the same theme. It would require Ofqual to consult
representatives of the higher education sector and business. Clause 126
sets 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column635" />Column number: 635</div>out various general duties for Ofqual. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of
subsection (2) require Ofqual to have regard to the reasonable
requirements of those sectors when performing its functions. Paragraph
(f) requires Ofqual to have regard to information from sector skills
councils. Amendment 199 would not have a significant practical effect
because Ofqual will have to focus on the needs of higher education and
business in all it does. On that basis, I hope that the amendment will
be
withdrawn.</div><a name="09032735000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001280"></a>Mr.

McCarthy-Fry:</b> These drafting amendments clarify that an
independent review of Ofqual&#146;s decision to cap fees or withdraw
recognition may be carried out by an individual or a body. The wording
in the Bill states that it must be</div>
<a name="09032735001130"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person other
than a member of Ofqual or Ofqual&#146;s

suggests that only an individual can carry out the review. On the basis

appears that the essence of the amendment is to give bodies outside

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001285"></a>Sarah

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001286"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001288"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> This provision applies conditions to Ofqual for the
entry into and inspection of premises of, what I presume, are the
awarding bodies. That seems to be a very heavy power. We are not
talking about tax revenue or potential financial fraud; we are merely
dealing with the quality of exams. Will the Minister explain to the
Committee, before we nod the clause through, the reasons behind
requiring this power? I know that it will refer to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 637</div>powers that already exist in the Education Act 2005. None the less, if
we are going to extend that power&#151;even if this provision applies
conditions to the use of it&#151;it is important that the Committee
is aware that that power exists for Ofqual and is being given to the
new Ofqual. As such, we need to know why the Government feel that the
power is necessary.</div>
<a name="09032735000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001289"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The Bill does not give Ofqual the right to
entry in the sense of the right to kick down doors; that would be
disproportionate and unwarranted. However, there may be circumstances
where it will be necessary. The test will be that of necessity, not
whether it is the most convenient way for Ofqual to gather information.
For Ofqual to enter an awarding body&#146;s premises to check on
standards or to gather information about the potential capping of
fees&#151;if, for example, it needs to look through an awarding
body&#146;s financial files to consider whether to cap fees&#151;we
would normally expect Ofqual to agree the arrangements for such a visit
with the awarding body. However, in the case of a challenge, the
provisions leave no doubt at all that it is Parliament&#146;s
intention, in setting up Ofqual, that it should be able to enter
premises for specified purposes. We have discussed the safeguards on
the use of the power&#151;for example, the need for reasonable notice
of a visit and the need to include, in its qualifications regulatory
framework, how it will perform its functions under an entry and
inspection
condition.</div><a name="09032735000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032735001290"></a><b class="B">Mr.

possible for Ofqual to request that the information is provided via the
post, or is faxed or e-mailed? Why does it need to go into premises to
look through files? It suggests that the qualifying bodies are trying
to cover something up.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001291"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I made the point that the test is one of
necessity, not whether it is the most convenient thing to do. Of course
we would expect Ofqual to begin by requesting information by post.
There may be lots of documents to look at and it may not be appropriate
to deliver all the documents to Ofqual. It may therefore be appropriate
for Ofqual to have such a power, and we therefore wish it to have the
power as a
backstop.</div><a name="09032735001212"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001292"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I share the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for
Broxbourne. I still do not understand why the power to enter premises
is necessary, given that the Bill gives Ofqual a fee-capping power,
meaning that if Ofqual is unhappy about the quality of information on
costs provided by the awarding bodies, it has the ultimate weapon of
capping the fees charged to schools and colleges for the
qualifications. So I do not see the need for Ofqual to enter premises
and go through the accounts detailing the costs of providing the
qualifications. If Ofqual is unhappy with the quality of information
provided, it has that backstop power, which is far more reasonable than
the draconian power proposed. We should be very careful about awarding
powers of entry to governmental bodies, as that goes against one of the
fundamental freedoms that the House was established to protect. I am
still not convinced that the power is necessary, given the task with
which Ofqual is charged.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001293"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I merely point out that the interim Ofqual
already has that power&#151;we are not adding anything. We all hope
that the power never need be used, but it is important that it is in
Ofqual&#146;s toolkit. We have improved safeguards and are putting
safeguards around the existing use of powers. We spoke earlier about
how the qualifications regulatory framework, which will be consulted
on, will regulate how Ofqual functions under this entry and inspection
condition, to ensure that those safeguards are
there.</div><a name="09032735000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001294"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I hope that it never comes to a total breakdown in
communication between Ofqual and the bodies that it regulates. However,
what would happen if the company or awarding body said, &#147;No, we
are not going to give you permission to enter our premises because we
think that that is excessive. We have provided the information we feel
you need, so we are going to say no to your request on this
occasion&#148;?</div><a name="09032735000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001295"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Presumably that would be tested in the
courts, against the framework in the Bill regarding how the power can
be used. Ofqual&#146;s overarching power to direct is enforceable in
the
courts.</div><a name="09032735000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032735001296"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): Will the
Minister give an example of when that could happen? I cannot see how it
could. We are not talking about a privatised monopoly. With some of the
utility companies, great powers are needed to prevent them from taking
advantage of their monopoly position, but we have a competitive market
among qualifications bodies and we hope that a greater diversity of
qualifications will become available. This seems more like something
that the Stasi would require, not a regulator of standards which has
all sorts of other powers of registration, fee setting and so
on.</div><a name="09032735000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001297"></a>Sarah

my previous remarks. We want Ofqual to be a regulator with the powers
that it needs. The interim Ofqual has those powers. We are restricting
the powers by introducing more safeguards, but we need them as a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001298"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 383, in clause 137,
page 78, line 9, at end
add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6) In establishing
accreditation criteria for qualifications, Ofqual must have regard to
the desirability of raising standards whenever
possible.&#146;.</div><a name="09032735000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
137 requires Ofqual to set out the criteria it will use for accrediting
qualifications. It is very clearly set out and understandable. The
confusion lies with the explanatory note which
states:</div><a name="09032735001133"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
criteria for accreditation are a threshold requirement - a recognised
body must meet these criteria before it may award or authenticate a
qualification&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09032735000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is clear enough so far. But then it says:</div>
<a name="09032735001134"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Once
that threshold requirement is met, satisfying the criteria is not as
such an ongoing requirement of the recognised body. However, Ofqual
will be able to mirror all relevant criteria in general or specific
conditions in order to ensure continued compliance by the recognised
body with the
criteria.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have no idea what that means. Perhaps the Minister could
explain.</div><a name="09032735000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
383 inserts an additional requirement for Ofqual when setting the
criteria. That is a requirement to raise standards. This reflects
concerns already referred to when Ofqual required AQA to lower its
grade boundary to be consistent with the awarding bodies. The amendment
would prevent such an approach and require Ofqual to require the other
awarding bodies to raise their grade boundaries to the position of the
board with the highest
level.</div><a name="09032735000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind the amendment is to introduce a virtuous circle of
ever-rising exam standards instead of the current vicious circle of
declining standards. As Dr. Mike Cresswell, the director-general of
AQA, said in an interview with <i class="I">The Times </i>in October
2008:</div><a name="09032735001135"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
awarding bodies compete for entries. They don&#146;t compete on
standards.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is that element of market failure that I believe Ofqual must compensate
for. To overcome the exam boards&#146; incentive to lower standards
in order to raise the quantity of entries, and thus their income,
Ofqual needs an explicit duty in the Bill to raise
standards.</div><a name="09032735000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001299"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I shall first try to explain to the hon.
Gentleman the details in the explanatory notes. At the beginning, the
criteria are set for a qualification. They could be criteria a, b and
c. The application would come from an awarding body and Ofqual would
look at those criteria. In the ongoing life of a qualification, the
power exists to set conditions and those conditions can refer back to
the criteria in the original accreditation. I suppose an analogy is
that criteria involve getting on the bus; the conditions involve
staying on it. That is the difference between the criteria and the
conditions.</div><a name="09032735000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
383 would require Ofqual to have regard to the desirability of raising
standards. But we must be careful to distinguish between two meanings
of the word &#147;standards&#148; here. If we mean standards of
assessment, or the difficulty of a qualification, then Ofqual&#146;s
duty is to make sure that the standard is consistent over time, and not
to raise it, because that would disadvantage previous years&#146;
learners. But if we means standards of performance, or the achievements
of students, that is not a matter for Ofqual. It is a policy ambition
of Government to raise standards of performance, and part of
Ofqual&#146;s role is to ensure that, where qualifications 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column641" />Column number: 641</div>and assessments are used to measure that, this is being done
consistently. On that basis, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
his
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001300"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful for that very clear explanation. I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09032735000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09032735000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001301"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Although I do not want to detain the Committee, we
have some concerns about clause 137, as amended by Government amendment
451, which we agreed on Tuesday. One of the awarding bodies, Cambridge
Assessment, has drawn to our attention a concern about that. According
to the amendment&#146;s explanatory
statement:</div><a name="09032735001136"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
amendment provides that if Ofqual revises accreditation criteria
applicable to a form of a qualification which has been accredited, that
accreditation ceases on a date specified by Ofqual, unless Ofqual
determines otherwise. Ofqual may make saving or transitional provision
about a form of qualification ceasing to be
accredited.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment that we originally put forward, which was too late to be
taken into account and set against Government amendment 451, would have
built into the Bill a safety mechanism in relation to the danger that
we will effectively have a new retrospective element for accredited
qualifications. Clearly, the Government have recognised that risk and
the fact that this is controversial, which is why they have made the
saving or transitional provision in subsection (10), as set out in
amendment 451.</div>
<a name="09032735000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that
amendment&#151;and therefore the Bill as it stands&#151;puts no
obligation on Ofqual to have that delay. It states that Ofqual
&#147;may&#148; use the delay mechanism, for which no specific time
period has been fixed. That could be damaging to the awarding
authorities, with regard to having some kind of stability, and to
candidates on the courses in question who could suddenly be left high
and dry if the qualifications for which they are studying are no longer
regarded as having proper academic status.</div>
<a name="09032735000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cambridge
Assessment told us in a briefing note:</div>
<a name="09032735001137"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
addition, even having this clause will probably encourage awarding
bodies to add in a risk premium to the price of qualifications that
they suspect Ofqual, or indeed the Minister, given his power to tell
Ofqual to take note of policy, wants to axe, thus adding to the costs
to the public purse.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032735000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the existing
circumstances, Ofqual could either not renew accreditation after the
term of years, or issue the new accreditation criteria and the new
specifications in the Bill, so that the previous versions would wither
on the vine. That seems to be a more sensible way of dealing with
circumstances in which an existing accredited qualification is no
longer suitable.</div>
<a name="09032735000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">On what
occasion does the Minister envisage an emergency retrospective date
being necessary to stop a qualification, and does she have any
objection in principle to changing the wording in subsection (10) so as
to place a duty on Ofqual to allow for that transitional period, rather
than making that
discretionary?</div><a name="09032735000157"></a>

orderly way, and that is how the

Gentleman&#146;s concerns, one safeguard is that Ofqual will have a
general duty to have regard to the needs of learners, and the other is
its general public law duty to act reasonably. Given the way that we
have set up Ofqual, how it manages that will be up to it, and it is
accountable to

speech was rather shorter than I expected. She did not reassure me; I
am unclear under what circumstances Ofqual would decide not to make the

to know under what circumstances Ofqual would decide not to grant the
provision, given the concerns clearly expressed by Cambridge Assessment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001322"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It is good to have such active participation from
Ministers in the debate and to see so many Labour Members present now.
Clearly, they are at their best after the lunch break. We now move on
to an extremely important clause. If you will allow me, Mrs.
Humble, I will start with a quiz for those Committee members who are
here. I should like them to tell me&#151;they should feel free to
intervene if they wish&#151;the significance of the following
volumes. I would particularly expect the Minister for Schools and
Learners to know the answer. The volumes are Enid Blyton&#146;s
Famous Five adventures, Malcolm Saville&#146;s Lone Pine detective
stories, &#147;The Wind in the Willows&#148;, &#147;Swallows and
Amazons&#148; by Arthur Ransome and, finally, a book called
&#147;Keeping Pet Chickens&#148;.</div>
<a name="09032735000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001323"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Could it be that those books have been banned from
the reading list? Am I
warm?</div><a name="09032735000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001324"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Not only have those books not been banned from the
reading list, but they are the favourite books of the Secretary of
State for Children, Schools and Families; he picked them out in a
recent selection. He has apparently been reading one of those titles to
children in schools, so I hope that it is not banned.</div>
<a name="09032735000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer to
those books because, under clause 138, they could find their way into
every English examination in the land. They could be a compulsory part
of the GCSE English examinations that every child in the country must
sit. Under the clause, the Secretary of State is taking extraordinary
powers&#151;new powers, as has been confirmed in a letter to my hon.
Friend the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 644</div>Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole&#151;that will allow the
Government to dictate to examination boards what precise books they
will examine youngsters on and what parts of history must be included
in history examinations.</div>
<a name="09032735000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
has drawn a lot of attention from the educational media and the wider
media. The books that I mentioned at the beginning of my comments were
drawn to my attention by a leader article in no less than <i class="I">The
Times</i>, which published an editorial on the subject on 20 March. The
feature was titled &#147;Set texts&#148;, with the subtitle:
&#147;It is not the Government&#146;s job to hand out reading
lists&#148;. It was not only <i class="I">The Times</i> that covered the
matter. As well as the <i class="I">The Daily Telegraph</i>, there was a leader
article in no less a paper than the <i class="I">Daily Express</i> under the
headline &#147;Brainwashing won&#146;t work&#148;, which
concluded that only the slowest of learners will fail to appreciate
that the Secretary of State&#146;s control freakery and belief in
centralised planning are the mark of a crackpot and not a statesman.
Those are not my words but those of the <i class="I">Daily Express</i>.</div>
<a name="09032735000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
significance of the clause is set out not only in the exchanges that we
had in the evidence sessions a couple of weeks ago, but in the
explanatory notes. It is worth reminding ourselves what those
explanatory notes say about the clause. I assume, Mrs.
Humble, that because my general criticisms of the clause are embedded
in the amendments, you will not allow a separate stand part debate on
the clause. The explanatory notes
say:</div><a name="09032735001138"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
clause allows the Secretary of State to determine the minimum
requirements in respect of skills, knowledge, or understanding that
someone must be able to demonstrate to gain a particular qualification
or type of
qualification.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on, very helpfully, to give an
example:</div><a name="09032735001139"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
example, it could be used to ensure that the content of GCSEs properly
reflects the... Key State 4 Programmes of Study, such as
specifying which authors&#146; works needed to be studied for someone
to gain a GCSE in
English.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to
say:</div><a name="09032735001140"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government intends that this power would be used only in exceptional
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
none of the guarantees in relation to that, or to intervention on
grading or assessment, are embedded in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09032735000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001325"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that more and
more legislation is couched in the terms that powers given to various
Secretaries of State will be used &#147;only in exceptional
circumstances&#148;. Those who find themselves on the receiving end
of the use of such powers&#151;whether those who are spied on by
local authorities, or Members of Parliament in their
offices&#151;know only too well that exceptional powers tend to be
used by those who are granted
them.</div><a name="09032735000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001326"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. When those exceptional
circumstances are not even contained in the Bill, we have to ask
whether such assurances are really worth anything. Such concerns have
clearly not only been expressed in the media and Parliament; they are
also concerns that Ofqual has shared at some point in time. A section
of the notes that Kathleen Tattersall, the chair of Ofqual, sent to
members of the Committee before our evidence session touched on the
clause. It said that her officials have had detailed discussions with
DCSF&#151;one always knows when one hears the phrase &#147;detailed
discussion&#148; that a concern lies at the root of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 645</div>the issue&#151;about the Secretary of State&#146;s power to
determine minimum requirements in relation to certain qualifications,
as set out in clause 138, and that Ofqual must be sure therefore that
the Secretary of State&#146;s powers do not undermine its ability to
act independently, either in reality or in the perception of the public
and other
stakeholders.</div><a name="09032735000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual
has been concerned about the issue, and it has discussed it not only
with members of the Committee, but with the Secretary of State himself.
There was an exchange of letters between Kathleen Tattersall and the
Secretary of State on 10 February. When such concerns require a public
exchange of correspondence, there clearly are serious concerns. Our
concern is that they have not yet been
resolved.</div><a name="09032735000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also had some exchanges on the issue in our evidence session on 10
March. The Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families,
the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North was cross-questioned on the
matter. She cited Shakespeare as an example of the type of direction
that the Secretary of State might give on what should be contained in
an English examination. Although she said that in relation to history,
I assume that she meant that Shakespeare was important in our history,
but that he should be embedded in the English examination.</div>
<a name="09032735000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether the Minister would care to let us know in her comments later
whether she can think of any other examples in the English and, perhaps
as interestingly, in the history examinations where the Government
think that particular authors or events in history are so important
that they should be an obligation for qualifications that cover those
subjects.</div>
<a name="09032735000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also had
some uncertainty from Ministers over the significance of the powers in
the clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
asked the Minister whether the powers in the Bill were new. With great
frankness, she
admitted:</div><a name="09032735001141"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do not know and we are going to find
out.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee</i>, 10 March 2009;
c. 171,
Q405.]</div><a name="09032735000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">It did
not take long before she was true to her word, and she did find out.
She wrote a letter to my hon. Friend, dated 14 March 2009, confirming
that there is currently no explicit statutory power to determine such
matters and that such powers may exist in some way through the back
door. The letter cheekily suggests in paragraph 4 that the
effect of clause 138 is to limit, in practice, the powers of
intervention that Ministers have. How it can do that while giving the
Secretary of State an extensive power that he does not possess at the
moment is an interesting question, to which we shall no doubt hear a
response from the Minister in a
minute.</div><a name="09032735000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suppose that I could save until later my response to what I expect the
Minister to say, but it may be better to add to my comments at this
stage by anticipating some of the arguments that she is likely to
deploy. She will undoubtedly talk about getting the balance right
between public policy and interfering with examinations and give us
many assurances about the circumstances in which the powers will be
used. We need to remind her that the Government already have a great
deal of power to influence what is taught in
schools.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 646</div><a name="09032735000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The national
curriculum is an inordinately long document with a great deal of
specificity, particularly by comparison with the expectations in the
past 100 years about the degree to which Governments would try to
meddle in what is taught in our schools. There will also be the
Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency, which we will debate
under part 8, the funding regime and the Joint Advisory Committee for
Qualifications Approval, which we will also talk about later and which
advises the Secretary of State and allows him to withhold the funding
of particular
qualifications.</div><a name="09032735001214"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="09032735000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
view, therefore, is that the power would be needed only if the
Secretary of State was determined to promote his own pet subjects in
the history curriculum or his own pet reading list in the English
curriculum, for example. We question whether it is right to give
politicians the power to prescribe in such detail what should be taught
in our schools and what should be part of the qualifications that every
young person may need to
have.</div><a name="09032735000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a risk that we will give excessive powers to &#147;Here today,
gone tomorrow&#148; politicians to put all sorts of nonsense on
reading lists and decide that bits of history are in fashion and then
out of fashion. There is also a risk that Secretaries of State and
other Education Ministers will feel obliged to react to the latest
newspaper headlines, or, perhaps more likely, to garner newspaper
headlines by introducing new obligations through the examinations
system, many of which might be counter-productive in terms of allowing
schools and colleges to do their job and respond to the needs of their
pupils. It also opens up the potential for much lobbying from all sorts
of groups familiar to many hon. Members to have their own pet subjects
put into the national curriculum or the qualifications that many or all
youngsters have to have. The split between subject and design criteria
is not nearly as simple as many Ministers and the Secretary of State
may think. For example, by promoting particular subject criteria, we
directly affect the design criteria and vice versa.</div>
<a name="09032735000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We therefore
may want to divide the Committee on whether the clause should be in the
Bill at all. We have tabled a number of amendments&#151;532, 533 and
5&#151;which I am going to speak to now. Amendment 532 came from our
discussions with Cambridge Assessment, one of the accrediting bodies.
It does not change the Government&#146;s intentions but clarifies the
restrictions on the role of the Secretary of State by including in the
Bill the undertaking about the power being used &#147;only in
exceptional circumstances&#148; that is in the explanatory
notes.</div><a name="09032735000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
533 does not change what the Government appear to want to have in the
Bill. It clarifies the restrictions on the role of the Secretary of
State in relation to having
to</div><a name="09032735001142"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;agree
with Ofqual the circumstances in which he can use the power conferred
by subsection
(1)&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 5 does not seek to clarify what the Government claim are
their intentions in the Bill through the explanatory notes. It
clarifies the restrictions on the role of the Secretary of State by
making it clear
that</div><a name="09032735001143"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State must not make a determination under subsection (1)
relating to the grading or assessment of
qualifications.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column647" />Column number: 647</div><a name="09032735000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">An awful lot
has been put in the Bill that is of low importance and that probably
should not be there. I gave an example the other day of the obligations
that were being placed on Ofqual to review the structure of its
committees every few years&#151;a degree of prescription that seems
completely unnecessary. If such obligations and details are in the
Bill, the safeguards contained in the explanatory notes must at least
be included to make clear the safeguards that the Government recognise.
That would deal with some of our concerns, although whether the powers
given in clause 138 have any place in the Bill or in a country where we
would not expect elected politicians to dictate to such an extent to
our schools and pupils is quite another
matter.</div><a name="09032735000213"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001327"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> If we look at any opinion poll over the past 20
years that lists the public issues of most concern, education is rarely
out of the top three. There are genuine reasons for that concern:
Ofsted reports, for example, that 43 per cent. of secondary schools are
not good enough or that one in five 11-year-olds leave primary school
still struggling with
literacy.</div><a name="09032735000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the same time, the curriculum has been watered down and the rigour and
content of exams diminished. Much of that is driven by ideology, though
not always that of the Minister and her colleagues. Often, it is driven
by a child-centred John Dewey-type ideology, the dominant orthodoxy of
those who have reached prominent positions in the educational
establishment. The public are hugely anxious about such trends. I know
of many left-of-centre journalists who, against their own principles,
have taken their children out of the state sector because of such
concerns. That is fine for those who can afford it, but for most people
the state sector is the only option, hence people&#146;s concerns in
the opinion
polls.</div><a name="09032735000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elected
politicians need to respond to those concerns, and need to be able to
respond. We all received the letter from the Minister which, with the
usual rigour and attention to detail that we have come to expect from
those involved in the Committee, was dated 23 March 2009&#151;I know
it has been a long Committee, but not quite that
long.</div><a name="09032735000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032735001328"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): Is that how long the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001329"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b>
Perhaps.</div><a name="09032735000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course we want Ofqual to be an independent regulator. I have already
set out my concerns about whether it will be independent of those who
are responsible for the problems with today&#146;s educational system
and who seem determined to create more problems&#151;those in the
educational establishment who put ideology ahead of evidence of what
works. We want Ofqual to be independent from ministerial interference
on issues such as grade boundaries, which has always been the position
of the QCA regulatory division, which would never countenance such
interference. I do not believe that there ever has been such
interference, either from this Government or previous Governments, but
Ministers must have reserve powers to set minimum standards. In a
democracy, when education is of such concern to the public, we cannot
remove from Ministers every lever to effect change that would raise
standards.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column648" />Column number: 648</div><a name="09032735000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001330"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> My understanding of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
policy, which we were discussing earlier, is that the Conservative
party is happy for good-quality state-funded schools to opt out of the
national curriculum. How is that consistent with saying that there
should be this degree of central
direction?</div><a name="09032735000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001331"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> When schools opt out of a system, in a system that
has plenty of surplus places and makes it easier for new schools to
enter into the state sector&#151;as set out in our policy Green
Paper, &#147;Raising the bar, closing the gap&#148;&#151;there
would be genuine choice to allow parents to choose a school. The
independent schools and independent sector are not subject to the
national curriculum and, notwithstanding that, the reason that they
still provide high-quality education&#151;world class in the majority
of independent schools&#151;is because the market forces them to
provide the high-quality education that parents
want.</div><a name="09032735000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
state education system has to date been a state-provided system that is
not responsive to the needs of parents. It has no need to be. There are
few surplus places and one has to go to one&#146;s local school, or a
school to which one is allocated&#151;in theory one has a
choice, but in practice most parents do not have a genuine choice of
school. It is therefore important, under the current system, that
schools provide a curriculum and exam system that respond to the needs
of parents.</div>
<a name="09032735000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the
role of the state to replicate the market through things such as the
national curriculum. That does not mean that we want to regulate and
provide detail down to the last dot and comma, but national politicians
have a responsibility to ensure that public services that are directly
provided by the state respond as closely as possible to the needs of
parents. The only methodology through which parents can exercise such a
power at present is our elected democratic
process.</div><a name="09032735000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001332"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> May I explore the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument
further? Is he saying that he is happy for good quality state-funded
schools not to have to teach Shakespeare, for example, which is an
obligation under the national curriculum at present, and that such
schools should not be obliged to offer qualifications that would
include Shakespeare? Does he believe that such things should be left to
the market and to
preference?</div><a name="09032735000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001333"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> No, I do not take that view. The state has a very
important role to play in providing examinations, and that is why we
agree with the power under clause 138 for the Secretary of
State to set minimum standards for assessments. If schools do not want
to take up the examinations or assessments provided by the state, they
will be able to turn to the marketplace. That is why the independent
sector is not required to set GCSEs for
schools.</div><a name="09032735000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not currently have a genuine marketplace within the state sector for
school provision. If we get to a position where parents have a genuine
choice&#151;I mean a genuine choice, not a theoretical one&#151;of
schools, it would be possible to relax the system, because, given what
we know from opinion polls about what parents want from schools, they
would not choose a school that does not teach Shakespeare or does not
provide exams.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column649" />Column number: 649</div><a name="09032735000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001334"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument
about having a proper market and choice. He is saying that, even though
he wants the Secretary of State to have the power outlined in clause
138 to set minimum standards&#151;in underperforming schools perhaps,
or at least until there is a market&#151;he is willing for
state-funded schools not to be obliged to teach particular authors,
including Shakespeare, or to insist that students be examined on such
authors through GCSEs and other
qualifications.</div><a name="09032735000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001335"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman talks about a theoretical
position that I hope will be reached where parents have a genuine
choice of schools for their children. In such circumstances, they
should be able to choose. If they want a very progressive education for
their children that does not require academic rigour and study, there
is a case for allowing that under a system in which they can genuinely
choose. We are not currently in such a position, so we need to ensure
that our exam system is rigorous and has minimum standards. That is why
we agree with the power that the clause gives to the Secretary of State
to determine minimum requirements. The Bill does not determine maximum
requirements, only minimum
ones.</div><a name="09032735000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the explanatory notes, the Secretary of State&#146;s power will be
used only in exceptional circumstances and
it</div><a name="09032735001144"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does
not allow the Secretary of State to make determinations relating to
parts of the qualification such as grading or assessment. Such matters
remain solely for Ofqual to
determine.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
notes go on to
state:</div><a name="09032735001145"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State intends to put in place a Memorandum of
Understanding with Ofqual about the use of this
power&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
issues were reiterated in the Under-Secretary&#146;s letter of 14
March 2009 to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, to which
the hon. Member for Yeovil also referred. The fourth paragraph of that
letter states that the effect of clause 138 is in practice to limit the
role of Ministers by setting out what Ministers can
determine&#151;the skills, knowledge or understanding which someone
must demonstrate in order to obtain a specified qualification. It says
that Ministers will not be able to decide, for example, on grading,
structures, assessment methods or how standards will be maintained, and
that they may express a view on these things from their policy
perspective, but the final decisions will be for
Ofqual.</div><a name="09032735000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree with that, but I understand the reasons behind the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments, particularly amendment 5, and his
general concerns, especially given that the Government are more
concerned about the message than genuine reform and higher
standards&#151;&#151;nothing delivers a better message than exam
results rising year on year. Although we do not support
amendment 5, because I do not believe that Ministers have
ever sought to interfere with grade boundaries, absolute transparency
will be necessary when Ministers use the power in clause
138.</div><a name="09032735001215"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="09032735000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
233 would require Ofqual to publish in its annual report each of the
determinations published under clause 138(4), together with a note
setting out how it had responded. There should be no problem with a
Secretary of State, acting in good faith and trying to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column650" />Column number: 650</div>ensure rising standards, being open in the use of this power. Giving
that determination maximum transparency and accountability would
strengthen Ofqual&#146;s independence. Amendment 141, which deals
with clause 138 as well, would require Ofqual to set a minimum
requirement of knowledge that must be learned before the qualification
can be awarded. That returns to our earlier debate about knowledge
versus skills. However, it also relates to public concern about the
reduced quality of knowledge required to pass GCSEs. Last November, in
an article in <i class="I">The Sunday Telegraph</i>, Terence Kealey
wrote:</div><a name="09032735001146"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Would
you like a GCSE in science? Don't worry, you may not need to know much
science actually to get one. Last Monday, Graham Stuart, the Tory MP
for Beverley and Holderness, read out to the Commons Select Committee
for Children, Schools and Families a question from a recent GCSE
science paper: &#147;A nuclear power station is to be built. (1) It
will provide more employment in the area. But (2) any release of
radioactive material would be very dangerous. Which of these two
statements argues in favour of siting the nuclear power station in the
area?&#148;</div><a name="09032735001147"></a><div class="hs_brev">Mr
Stuart then asked if &#147;the department is really sure that we are
providing pupils with a rigorous scientific understanding?&#148; But
he was answered by Jim Knight MP, the schools minister, with
&#147;Yes. I am absolutely happy that we are, and we have set up
Ofqual to provide more public
reassurance.&#148;&#148;</div><a name="09032735000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we have set up Ofqual to provide that assurance, let it do so, by
setting out clearly the actual knowledge required when setting pass
marks and grade
boundaries.</div><a name="09032735000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same point applies to equivalencies. A merit in an International
Therapy Examination Council diploma in tanning treatments is worth 45
points&#151;the same as a grade A in one A-level module. Speaking at
a recent seminar in London, Isabel Nisbet said that she has begun to
wonder whether it really stands up against A level maths and that it
seems to raise doubts about accrediting self-tanning courses as level 3
qualifications. She also said that her aide said that she chose it as
an example of the tough judgments that the watchdog should make.
Amendment 141 would help Ofqual to make those tough judgments and
choices.</div><a name="09032735000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001336"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I have listened to both hon. Gentlemen with
interest. Clause 138 has become something of a clause
c(c)lbre, if hon. Members will excuse the pun, and I want
to set out the Government&#146;s position in light of that media
interest.</div>
<a name="09032735000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can state
categorically and unashamedly that ministerial interest in the school
curriculum is not only legitimate, but necessary. That position has
been established since the launch of the national curriculum two
decades ago. This is not a sinister new development, as some have
suggested. Ministers need to be democratically accountable for the
curriculum. They need to be able to stand at the Dispatch Box and
explain, for example, how the curriculum is ensuring that the next
generation of young adults entering the work force will have the skills
that employers are looking for; how they are preparing young people to
play a full part in society when they grow up; how they are developing
the maths, science and foreign language skills required for future
economic prosperity, and how they are passing on to the next generation
the knowledge and understanding that we consider to be the rightful
inheritance and entitlement of every child&#151;our history, culture
and knowledge of the world. That is a significant responsibility, and
Ministers must approach it wisely. They must listen to a range of
advice from the QCDA and elsewhere. They must allow teachers the space
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column651" />Column number: 651</div>exercise professional judgment within the requirements of the
curriculum, and they must not change it too rapidly. For a Government
to abandon their responsibility for the curriculum would be
extraordinary.</div>
<a name="09032735000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Qualifications
are closely related to the curriculum. They are an assessment of a
learner&#146;s attainments, reflecting what the learner has been
taught. Qualifications can help drive and focus teaching, which is why
they are so important when making educational policy. As with the
curriculum, it would be extraordinary for a Government to give up any
say in what qualifications should be
available.</div><a name="09032735000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001337"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister says that if, for example, she were to
accept the deletion of clause 138, the Government would have to give up
their powers in that respect. Under what legislation can Ministers
determine the content and structure of
exams?</div><a name="09032735000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001338"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The Secretary of State has wide-ranging
powers of control under existing legislation. He has the power to give
directions to the QCA on how it should exercise its functions,
including its function of setting criteria for the accreditation of
qualifications.</div>
<a name="09032735000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001339"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister did not say that the Secretary of State
has the power at the moment to determine the content or structure of
exams. I presume that that is why the letter to my hon. Friend the
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said that it is a new
power.</div>
<a name="09032735000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001340"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> There is a power to direct the QCA under the
Education Act 1997, and the QCA is currently accountable to Ministers.
That is why we say that it is not a new
power.</div>
<a name="09032735000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001341"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The power to direct is in relation to
what?</div><a name="09032735000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001342"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As I explained, the power to direct the QCA
on how it exercises its functions includes its function for setting
criteria for the accreditation of
qualifications.</div><a name="09032735000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001343"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I am listening with interest, but does the
Minister share my concerns about amendment 141? It considers
qualifications solely in respect of the knowledge that a person has.
When I was redesigning the master of business administration course at
Cranfield school of management with my colleagues, we considered
knowledge, skills and ability, but is not the true test of knowledge
how it is translated into action and how it is used in the workplace as
well, of course, as its value in and of
itself?</div><a name="09032735000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001344"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I thank the my hon. Friend for her
intervention. I shall come to that point
later.</div><a name="09032735000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001345"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I grateful to the Minister for giving way; she has
been most patient. I am not convinced by her earlier answer. Surely she
is not going back on the statement that she made in her letter to my
hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. She clearly said
that there is currently no explicit statutory power to determine
&#147;such
matters.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001346"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman to section 26(1)
of the Education Act 1997, which states:</div>

Authority shall&#151;(a) comply with any directions given by the
Secretary of State; and (b) act in accordance with any plans approved
by
him&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001347"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> They may be wide-ranging, but unless the Minister is
suggesting that her letter of 14 March 2009 was wrong, she has already
confirmed that there is currently no explicit statutory power to
determine such matters.</div>
<a name="09032735000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001348"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We are dancing&#151;&#151;excessively
so&#151;&#151;on the head of a pin. There is no explicit statutory
power that mentions qualifications. The wide-ranging power that I cite
states:</div>
<a name="09032735001149"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any directions
given by the Secretary of State; and...any plans approved by
him&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are becoming bogged down, so I shall move on.</div>
<a name="09032735000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 138
allows the Secretary of State to set minimum requirements for
qualifications relating to knowledge, skills and understanding. In it,
we seek to balance two interests. On one hand is the legitimate
interest of Ministers in the content of qualifications; on the other is
the need for the regulator to be able to ensure that standards are
maintained in order to provide public assurance. The interim Ofqual has
gone on record to say that it is happy with the letter. On 10 February
2009, Kathleen Tattersall said:</div>
<a name="09032735001150"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
fully support the principle that Government should set the broad policy
objectives...I am pleased that the Bill clarifies this balance of
responsibilities, making it clear that the Secretary of State can
specify publicly minimum requirements in respect of a limited range of
aspects of a public qualification; and that Ofqual would need to meet
those requirements when setting criteria for recognition or
accreditation, in a way that will not encroach upon territory which is
clearly the responsibility of the independent
regulator.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers
will not be able to decide how qualifications are graded or assessed,
or how standards are set. It is a real reduction in power, which is
being given up to the independent regulator. Ministers may have views,
but the final decision will be Ofqual&#146;s alone. Of course, the
content of qualifications can affect standards and assessment, so under
clause 138, the Secretary of State will only be able to set minimum
requirements for a qualification. He will not be able to reduce the
requirements of a qualification, which might make it impossible for
Ofqual to maintain standards, and Ofqual will continue to control the
criteria that specify the requirements of a qualification. It will not
be for Ministers to tell Ofqual how to deliver the minimum
requirements.</div><a name="09032735000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001349"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> When the Minister was questioned on this issue in
the evidence session a couple of weeks ago, she cited Shakespeare as an
example of a requirement that she might embed in English examinations,
so people would be obliged to read and be examined on Shakespeare. Can
she explain why she decided that Shakespeare should be given priority
over other great authors, such as Chaucer, Dickens or Jane
Austen?</div>
<a name="09032735000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001350"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I was merely citing an example. I will come
back to that point, with the examples that the hon. Member for Yeovil
asked for, if he will be patient.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column653" />Column number: 653</div><a name="09032735000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with the
curriculum, Ministers will need to use  the powers wisely. We
have publicly committed to safeguards&#151;we will agree a memorandum
of understanding with Ofqual over the use of the clause. Qualifications
development is complex and takes time to get right, and we will not be
making determinations every five minutes. It is more likely that the
power will be used to require GCSEs to relate to the key stage 4
national curriculum, which they assess, than to require the use of
specific text
books.</div><a name="09032735000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
clause 138, Ministers would lose any decision-making power over
qualifications. Let me illustrate that point. Some years ago, a working
group led by Sir Mike Tomlinson published a report on 14-to-19
qualifications. That high-profile report generated a lot of debate,
with commentators and politicians on all sides taking a view. Four
years ago, my ministerial predecessors published our response in a
White Paper that set the direction of travel that we are still
following today, in particular, with respect to 14-to-19 diplomas for
which young people are now studying.</div>
<a name="09032735000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Bill
had been in force without clause 138, none of that debate would have
been possible. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Yeovil has had
a chance to read the indicative regulations. An indicative
determination would be the minimum requirements of the 14-to-19
diploma.</div><a name="09032735000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001351"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Given the powers that the Joint Advisory Committee
for Qualifications Approval and the QCDA have already and the way
qualifications are funded, why is this power necessary in relation to
the item that the Minister picked out?</div>
<a name="09032735000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001352"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I will move to another point. The hon.
Gentleman has said that he wants to introduce a general diploma.
Without the power in clause 138, he could not do that. If the power was
not there, the regulator might refuse to implement it and there would
be nothing that the hon. Gentleman could do about it, in the highly
unlikely event that he was in a position to introduce a general
diploma.</div><a name="09032735000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001353"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am not quite sure why that conclusion follows from
her observations. There already are accrediting bodies, a national
curriculum and the QCDA, which will develop the curriculum, and the
Government power not to fund qualifications that do not meet the
requirements of the Secretary of State, so what does this measure add
to that array of powers?</div>
<a name="09032735000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001354"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It gives Ofqual powers to set the criteria,
which are owned by Ofqual, so it needs to have the powers. Without
clause 138, only a regulator can decide what is in a qualification.
Ofqual may agree voluntarily to set criteria to meet a
Minister&#146;s requirements. In practice, I hope that clause 138
determinations are unlikely to be necessary very often, because
Ministers and Ofqual should aim to have a good working relationship,
whereby Ofqual will agree to regulate for qualifications that deliver
policy proposals, provided that those proposals are made to maintain
standards.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column654" />Column number: 654</div><a name="09032735001216"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09032735000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
138 is important for three reasons. First, as I have said, it is
important because ministerial interest in qualifications is legitimate,
and the clause is explicit about what matters Ministers have a say in
and clear about what matters are not for them to decide. Secondly, it
provides for the unlikely event that Ofqual starts behaving
unreasonably and refuses to deliver the qualifications that Ministers
want, without giving any good reasons. Thirdly, it ensures
transparency. If Ministers want to influence what is in a
qualification, there is no need for behind-the-scenes negotiation. They
can make a determination, they have to publish it and they are
accountable for it.</div>
<a name="09032735000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
move on to the five amendments to this clause that are not Government
amendments. First, amendment 532 would mean that the Secretary of State
could make a determination specifying minimum requirements only in
respect of the qualification &#147;in exceptional
circumstances&#148;. Often, it will not be clear whether a particular
set of circumstances is &#147;exceptional&#148;. That is a
fundamental difficulty with the amendment. Lawyers could spend a lot of
time arguing about whether a particular set of circumstances is
&#147;exceptional&#148;. That lack of clarity and the uncertainty
that it would give rise to means, in our view, that the wording of the
amendment does not work.</div>
<a name="09032735000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
amendment 532 seeks to address two concerns and I have some sympathy
with both. The first concern might be that Ministers should not make
frequent changes to qualifications and therefore that determinations
should be made only occasionally. I agree with that view. Qualification
reform is complex, takes time to get right and the stakes are high,
particularly, of course, for the learners who would be affected.
Ministers should not issue new determinations unless it is appropriate
and necessary to do so. However, I do not think that we can write that
into the legislation. There is no clear or easy way of describing that,
and amendment 532 does not achieve that description. Instead, we should
rely on the memorandum of understanding that we have put in place, and
on Ministers taking seriously their responsibility to learners, along
with the transparency that is created by having an independent
regulator to prevent problems.</div>
<a name="09032735000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001355"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I appreciate the fact that the Minister said that
she is quite sympathetic to the concerns that underlie amendment 532.
However, is it really that difficult or impossible to put the wording
in the amendment in the Bill? After all, we were discussing
earlier&#151;I think that it was only this morning, although it seems
like some time ago now&#151;clause 126(7), in which the Government
specify:</div>
<a name="09032735001151"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
must perform its functions efficiently and
effectively.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
that time, I questioned the fact that those words are very
general.</div>
<a name="09032735000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the Government are willing to have wording that is so general in a Bill
of this type, surely there is no reason at all why they cannot make it
clear in the Bill that this power in clause 138 is one for
&#147;exceptional circumstances&#148;? Alternatively, the Minister,
with all the support that she has to hand, might be able to introduce a
different form of words that could express her intentions in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09032735000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001356"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I think that I made it clear to the hon.
Gentleman that I do not think that the Bill is the right place for that
and that we should rely on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column655" />Column number: 655</div>memorandum of understanding. However, another concern lies behind
amendment 532. I think that it says that Ministers should make a
determination only occasionally because normally it would be
unnecessary. We would hope that ministerial policy decisions relating
to qualifications, as put forward through draft criteria developed by
QCDA, should be easy for Ofqual to accept. We do not want
Ministers&#146; relationship with Ofqual to be characterised by the
need to issue formal determinations. However, I do not see how that
could be required in law. I think that we should use the memorandum of
understanding.</div>
<a name="09032735000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 533
would require the Secretary of State
to</div><a name="09032735001152"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;agree
with Ofqual the circumstances in
which&#148;</div><a name="09032735000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">he
could make a determination specifying minimum requirements in respect
of a
qualification</div><a name="09032735001153"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
publish the terms of the
agreement.&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Secretary of State said in his letter to Kathleen Tattersall last
month, it is certainly our intention to make and publish such an
agreement with Ofqual. We could, therefore, put it in the legislation.
However, the problem with doing that is that there cannot be a legal
duty on the Secretary of State to agree something with Ofqual, because
ultimately, by refusing to come to an agreement, Ofqual could veto the
use of the power, which would undermine the intention of the provision.
Again, I must ask the Committee to trust the public commitments that
the Secretary of State has made to develop an
agreement.</div><a name="09032735000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would also delete the requirement to publish a determination.
I am not clear why that has been proposed. The requirement to publish
is key to ensuring that the system is fully transparent and therefore
that confidence can be maintained.</div>
<a name="09032735000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 233
would require Ofqual to include in its annual report a copy of any
published determination that the Secretary of State makes and how
Ofqual responded to such a determination. We do not need that provision
in the Bill. A determination will be in the public domain, and I
suspect that Ofqual would want to refer to it in its annual report. The
Secretary of State is required to publish any determination and there
will need to be public consultation on the criteria and conditions that
are set to give effect to that determination. The Select Committees
will doubtless want to discuss any section 138 determinations with
Ofqual as part of the oversight of its work.</div>
<a name="09032735000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
141, Ofqual will have discretion to decide when a qualification
requires individual scrutiny. In such a case, it would require that the
qualification was accredited. Ofqual would then publish criteria, which
might be drafted by the QCDA, for the accreditation of qualifications
that are subject to the requirement. When appropriate, the criteria
would have to include, for example, the academic content that must be
covered in the qualifications for them to be accredited. What would be
required by the amendment will happen anyway, so I do not see that it
would add
anything.</div><a name="09032735000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
5 would make it explicit that the Secretary of State does not have the
power to make a determination to specify requirements in relation to
the setting of grades or the assessment of the qualifications. I
strongly agree with the sentiment of the amendment. Grading and
assessment are very clearly the domain of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column656" />Column number: 656</div>regulator. A Minister who sought to make a minimum requirement relating
to such areas would risk undermining the independence of the regulator
and, therefore, the credibility of the qualification system. That is
why the Bill will prevent the minimum requirement on grading or
assessment. Clause 138(3) clearly defines a minimum requirement
as</div><a name="09032735001154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
requirement that relates to the knowledge, skills or understanding
which a person must demonstrate in order to obtain the qualification or
a qualification of the description in
question.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
a requirement is about what someone must demonstrate, not how it is
demonstrated or how the achievement is recorded. The definition does
not, therefore, allow requirements relating to the setting of grades or
assessment.</div>
<a name="09032735000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would not affect the nature of the minimum requirements that the
Secretary of State can determine. The Government have made clear what
the respective roles of Ofqual and Ministers should be on
qualifications, and interim Ofqual has indicated that it is content
with that position. If a decision relates to grading or standards, it
is rightly a matter for the regulator. That is exactly what is written
in the Bill. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09032735000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001357"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am sorry if I missed the substantive point of
those last comments, but the Minister clearly indicated that she is
very sympathetic to the sentiments that are behind, or embedded in,
amendment 5. Why can she not simply accept it, or make a similar
amendment of her own?</div>
<a name="09032735000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001358"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Such an amendment is unnecessary because the
Bill will already prevent Ministers from doing what the amendment says
they must not do.</div>
<a name="09032735000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 453 to 456 and 458 fall into two groups. First, amendments
453, 454, 456 and 458 relate to ensuring that the Secretary of State
can vary a determination as long as he publishes and gives notice of it
to Ofqual. We do not intend to use the measure very often. As I said,
changing the broad content of qualifications such as GCSEs is not
something to be undertaken frequently, but nor must we be in a position
in which qualifications fail to evolve over time. The amendments allow
the Government to change the high-level requirements over time as the
curriculum evolves.</div>
<a name="09032735000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
amendment 455 adds Ofqual&#146;s functions under clause
131&#151;the power to set general conditions&#151;to the list of
functions that Ofqual must exercise for the purposes of implementing a
determination made under clause 138. That reflects the fact that the
Bill has two concepts of the requirements of awarding bodies: criteria
and conditions. Criteria are only directly relevant at the time an
awarding body applies to be recognised or to have a qualification
accredited. As I explained to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, once the criteria have been met and recognition or
accreditation has been granted, Ofqual will regulate the activities of
awarding bodies through its general and specific conditions. It may
therefore need to use the conditions as well as the criteria to
implement the determination. For example, if a determination required
GCSE English to reflect the national curriculum key stage 4 programme
of study, the accreditation criteria for GCSE English would require
that awarding bodies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column657" />Column number: 657</div>submit GCSE English specifications reflecting the programme of study.
The clause 131 conditions would require that they continue to offer the
qualifications on that basis.</div>
<a name="09032735000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
explanation, I hope that the Committee will agree to add the Government
amendments to the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001359"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that very full
response to the amendments. The hon. Member for Wakefield made a point
about knowledge versus skills. Amendment 141 would not rule out
criteria to assess skills, but the concern is that, over the past 10
years, the knowledge content of some of our qualifications&#151;not
all, but some&#151;has been depleted or removed from the GCSE
qualification. Ofqual agrees with us on that point, and that is why our
concern is about the level of knowledge: we are not concerned about the
level of skills being assessed but we are genuinely concerned, as are
the public, about how much knowledge we ask our children to acquire. On
many occasions, such knowledge is reduced, and that is very
damaging.</div>
<a name="09032735000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001360"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I was curious about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
use of the tanning salon as an example of something that was not
equivalent to an A-level. I am sure that he is far too sensible to use
a tanning salon, as are most Committee members, because of the known
risks associated with skin cancer, but, given that there are such risks
in a tanning salon, does he not think it appropriate that people who
operate such salons have a high&#151;a level
2 &#151;qualification to advise their clients on the
appropriate length of exposure to tanning rays and on the sunscreen
factor that they should
wear?</div>
<a name="09032735000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001361"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I agree. If one goes into that industry, a
qualification in self-tanning or in how to use a tanning booth is very
important. The problem comes when we try to pretend that it is
equivalent to a module in A-level maths. It diminishes and undermines
the credibility of the vocational qualification, because everybody
knows that they are not equivalent, hence the point made by Isabel
Nisbet from Ofqual, who is also concerned about that. I cited
Ofqual&#146;s concern about such equivalence, and we must get away
from trying to pretend that all things are the same in the pursuit of
parity of esteem. Vocational qualifications, if they are high quality,
of course have parity of esteem with academic qualifications, but if we
pretend that they are the same as academic qualifications, we destroy
the credibility of both.</div>
<a name="09032735000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern
is about knowledge, and I take on board the Minister&#146;s points
about amendment 233. It is already a requirement to publish any
determination that the Secretary of State makes under the clause. The
amendment&#146;s purpose was to make it crystal clear that there
would be transparency. However, given her assurances that there will be
transparency, I am happy not to pursue either amendment to a
vote.</div>
<a name="09032735000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001362"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am also grateful to the Minister for a very
detailed response, and for her usual patience in taking a large number
of interventions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column658" />Column number: 658</div><a name="09032735000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall touch
on our amendments&#151;532, 533 and 5 &#151;and then
reflect on the wider issues raised by clause 138. The
Minister said that she believes that, embedded in the Bill, is the
content of amendment 5, preventing the Secretary of State from making a
determination under subsection (1) on the grading or assessment of the
qualifications. Perhaps it is just the time of day, but I need to
reflect on that, to look carefully at her comments and see whether she
is right that there is enough protection. If I feel that she has been
slightly generous in her interpretation of how much protection the Bill
affords, I may return to the issue.</div>
<a name="09032735000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 532
would include a provision on the power being used in exceptional
circumstances. I was not convinced by the Minister&#146;s arguments
on that. We can point to many other parts of the Bill in which general
directions or powers are granted that are far vaguer and more difficult
to pin down than the words &#147;exceptional circumstances&#148;,
which are, after all, used very carefully in the explanatory notes.
However, I will press that amendment and divide the Committee later,
because it is crucial to how these powers will be
used.</div><a name="09032735001217"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="09032735000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to reflect a bit on some of the wider issues to do with the
extent to which politicians should be able to interfere in the contents
of examinations. In spite of the Minister&#146;s suggestion that, in
some way, there are already powers that allow interference by the back
door through the QCA, she confirmed in her letter to the Committee that
there is currently no explicit statutory power to determine such
matters, which appears to bolster the back-door powers that there may
already be. Regardless of whether those powers exist or not, there is
an issue of principle about whether politicians should be able to
interfere in the ways that the Minister anticipated in her evidence
session, when she mentioned that Shakespeare should, in her view, be
part of an English language GCSE as an obligation imposed by the
Secretary of State. We heard a contrasting view from the hon. Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, although I accept that he was
explaining what would happen in a world with more choice in the
education
market.</div><a name="09032735000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001363"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Is it the view of the hon. Gentleman and his
party that our school children should not study
Shakespeare?</div><a name="09032735000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001364"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> No. I will explain in one second how my view differs
from the
Minister&#146;s&#151;</div><a name="09032735000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001365"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> In one second? We will hold you to
that.</div><a name="09032735000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001366"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> In a few moments. I hope that the right hon.
Gentleman will take the opportunity to stay in the Committee Room to
hear
me.</div><a name="09032735000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was about to explain the three different positions on this matter.
Clearly, I need to do so in more detail than I had initially
anticipated. One extreme view, which is interesting, coming from the
Conservative party&#151;although I accept the proviso of the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that this would happen when
there was more of a market in education&#151;is that in an ideal
world there should be, even for maintained schools, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column659" />Column number: 659</div>no national curriculum that is as prescriptive as the one that the
Government want, which would determine that Shakespeare must be in the
English curriculum, for example. I think that he was also saying that
in this world of greater choice and freedom in state-funded education,
an obligation on the Secretary of State to insist that the examinations
embedded Shakespeare, for example, would also not be needed. In his
ideal world, he would no longer prescribe what the Minister seeks to
prescribe, either in the national curriculum or in the qualifications
that youngsters have to
take.</div><a name="09032735000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001367"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> But we are living in a world, today, in which Ofsted
says that 43 per cent. of secondary schools are not good enough. While
that situation persists&#151;I expect that it will persist for some
time&#151;there needs to be a considerable degree of prescription to
ensure that, through the national curriculum and our exam system,
schools are providing the kind of education that parents
require.</div><a name="09032735000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001368"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Yes, I register that point, but even in the
discussions in the Select Committee there is a wide range of views
about how the national curriculum should develop. Conservative party
policy nationally is that academy schools should be able to opt out of
the national curriculum. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
perfect world would take a period of time to evolve, but he is saying,
helpfully and in a principled way, that his vision is that the
maintained sector&#151;in future, when standards have risen and the
choice is there&#151;would be able to operate in the same way as the
independent sector, so there would be no need for a prescriptive
national curriculum and no need for such prescriptiveness in the
examinations.</div><a name="09032735000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001369"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Of course, in that world schools would be teaching
Shakespeare and a rigorous academic curriculum, including the three
separate sciences and good maths and literacy. That is the ultimate aim
of all Committee members, is it
not?</div><a name="09032735000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001370"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I suspect that that is probably so and I would be
surprised if the schools were not doing that, but the hon. Gentleman is
saying that he wants schools to be free to do so or not to do so. They
might decide that Chaucer is very important and select examinations in
which other key authors who are named in the national curriculum are
specified, such as Dickens, Hardy, Austen, Bronte, H. G. Wells or
Wordsworth. There is no obligation to cover any of those authors in
qualifications at the moment. The hon. Gentleman thinks that schools
would do that, but acknowledges that parental choice would also be
influential. Parents might want a school that does not teach some of
those subjects. It is a logical consequence of his policy that some
schools might not cover Shakespeare in their curriculum and might chose
qualifications that do not cover
him.</div><a name="09032735000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, the Minister wants not only to prescribe through the
national curriculum, but has made it clear that she wants the Secretary
of State to have the power to direct that particular authors should be
covered in qualifications. That is an extraordinary degree of
direction. The Minister has cited Shakespeare as if it is obvious that
he should always be covered in English examinations. By picking out
Shakespeare, she has left 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column660" />Column number: 660</div>out a long list of authors who presumably she does not believe need to
be covered in English examinations. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> She is
pooh-poohing that from a sedentary position, but her implicit position
is that Shakespeare should have special status, whereas Chaucer,
Dickens, Austen, Bronte, Hardy, Keats, Wordsworth, Wells&#151;I could
read out lots of other names if you want me to, Mrs.
Humble&#151;do not have the same status. The Minister is quite happy
to jettison them all and leave them to the devices of the national
curriculum and
schools.</div><a name="09032735000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001371"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Far be it from me to come to the Minister&#146;s
defence, but is it not the case that the former Secretary of State
intervened because there was a danger that Shakespeare would be removed
and would not be taught in schools? There was no evidence that those
other authors were not being taught. He intervened to tackle the
specific problem that Shakespeare would not be taught in some schools
because it was difficult, whereas those other authors probably would
have been
taught.</div><a name="09032735000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001372"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Really? Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting
that all those schools that were not teaching Shakespeare were teaching
Chaucer, Blake and Dickens? I very much doubt
it.</div><a name="09032735000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
any case, the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that the Secretary of
State would determine such things if his reforms were accepted. Under
his model, the market would decide through parental preference. He will
have to accept that some parents might prefer not to have some authors
on the
list.</div><a name="09032735000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue of authors and English examinations seems relatively simple in
comparison to history. So far, we have not tempted the Minister to
indicate which parts of British or foreign history she thinks should be
obligatory for the GCSE. I will give way happily if she wishes to pick
any out. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The Minister says from a
sedentary position that she will not pick out the bits of history that
should be covered in the GCSE examination. The Secretary of State will
have that power under the clause. He could decide tomorrow morning that
particular parts of British history should be included in the history
examination. He could specify that the history of the labour movement
should be covered in the examination. We could have that degree of
political
control.</div><a name="09032735000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister asked for it earlier, my view is that it is reasonable to
have a minimum curriculum that sets out the key expectations, but that
it is unreasonable and unnecessary to embed that curriculum in the
examinations system. It is not necessary for Ministers to micro-manage
the curriculum to that extraordinary degree. Anyone who is interested
in this matter can look at the long list of authors in the national
curriculum who are regarded as an acceptable part of the English
literary heritage. Goodness knows whether Ministers have approved that
list or been involved in who is included or who is taken out. There is
also a list of contemporary writers. Goodness knows which Ministers
were involved in selecting Jennifer Donnelly, John Fowles and Susan
Hill to be part of that approved
list.</div><a name="09032735000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
question not only whether we need to be so detailed and prescriptive in
the national curriculum, but whether Ministers need to take these
extraordinary powers to specify such things for qualifications. Like
<i class="I">The Times</i>, <i class="I">The Daily Telegraph</i>, the<i class="I"> Daily Express</i>,
many other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column661" />Column number: 661</div>newspapers and many colleagues in Parliament, I do not trust here-today,
gone-tomorrow politicians to take the right decisions about what should
be embedded in our exams. The Minister is on slightly different ground
when she talks about the structure of qualifications and the interest
that the Government might have in that. They already have a great
degree of influence over that through the QCDA and through the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers not to fund particular
qualifications. We have this body that we will discuss
later&#151;JACQA&#151;which gives advice to the Secretary of State
about whether any of these qualifications should be funded in the
first place.</div>
<a name="09032735000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her
comments on the structure of examinations, she mentioned that she might
want these powers where Ofqual or the exam boards were refusing to
deliver what Ministers wanted. That is rather telling about an attitude
to the examinations system, and perhaps the curriculum as well, and it
is extremely top down. This is about what Ministers think is right for
children throughout the country. They are qualifications that Ministers
pick and it reflects back on our earlier debate about whether there
should be a market in qualifications where the wishes of schools,
parents and youngsters themselves should be influential in determining
what qualifications are taken up, or whether this is a really top-down
process where Ministers pick and choose qualifications and try to shunt
the qualifications framework in a particular direction. When Ministers
do that they are often extremely unsuccessful. Indeed, in the past
30 years, successive Governments have promoted vocational
qualifications that have no traction, credibility or a value in the
market.</div>
<a name="09032735000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001373"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I have some sympathy for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument, but I also have some sympathy for the
Government&#146;s position, which is hard to have. What would happen
if some school, some governing body or some qualification agency took
it upon itself to have a one-year module in Barbara Cartland? Surely we
would expect some form of intervention to stop that and to ensure that
Barbara Cartland did not squeeze out William
Shakespeare.</div><a name="09032735000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001374"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Under the system I am suggesting there would still
be a national curriculum. It is under the system that his party is
suggesting, albeit at some stage in the future, that that complete
free-for-all would evolve. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton told us that he believes that the best schools should be
able to opt out not only from qualifications prescribed by the
Secretary of State, but from the national curriculum. Indeed, I think
the Conservative party says that already in relation to academies. So
that really is a question that is best addressed to his own Front
Bench.</div>
<a name="09032735000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear that I
have not yet persuaded the Minister, and I may have exhausted both the
Committee and the argument. I will want to return to the wider issues
at a later date, but I would like to press the amendment to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001387"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I rise to quiz the Minister about
guided hours. The clause, as amended, now includes amendment
459 and the explanatory note to that amendment says:</div>
<a name="09032735001155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
amendment and amendment 462 ensure that where a body is recognised in
respect of a qualification which is relevant for 2008 Act purposes, it

English.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we debated that amendment, and similar matters earlier on in the
debate, I asked the Minister: to which qualifications would those
learning hours be applied? She indicated:</div>
<a name="09032735001156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
regards to the guided learning hours, that relates to raising the
participation age, as agreed in the Education and Skills Act 2008. That
creates a duty on young people above compulsory school age, but
under-18, to participate in education or
training.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>24 March 2009; c.
579.]</div><a name="09032735000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thought that I had obtained from the Minister confirmation that that
would not apply to qualifications applicable to those under the age of
18. Yet, now we seem to have passed an amendment to part of
clause 139, where the explanatory note seems to say that it
would apply to a particular version of GCSE English.</div>
<a name="09032735000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain clause 139 and what qualifications it will apply to?
Can she say how the guided hours are calculated and why? I would have
thought that the number of hours required to teach a particular
qualification was a matter for the professional judgment of teachers
and not something that should be set down by legislation. I would be
grateful if the Minister could clarify those points of
confusion.</div>
<a name="09032735000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001388"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am happy to clarify that clause 139
relates to the 2008 Act of raising the person&#146;s participation
age. It only applies to 16 and 17-year-olds. It applies to people
studying in full-time employment and is the 280 guided learning hours
that the 2008 Act duty applied
to.</div><a name="09032735000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001389"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am still not clear whether that means all the
GCSEs must have applied to them guided learning hours for each part of
those GCSEs. That is the concern, that all such qualifications being
taken by people under the age of 16 will have to have guided learning
hours applied to them. Can the Minister confirm that that will not
apply? She seemed to indicate earlier, in our deliberations of 24
March, that it would not be applicable to
GCSEs</div><a name="09032735000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001390"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The legislation states that where a body
offers a qualification that that body decides is relevant for the
purpose of the 2008 Act&#151;it may be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column665" />Column number: 665</div>used by young people in full-time employment to fulfil the duty to
participate&#151;that body must assign to the qualification a number
of hours of guided learning. It is probably not applicable to
GCSEs.</div><a name="09032735000360"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001391"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful for that explanation. Does it apply to
A-levels?</div><a name="09032735000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001392"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> If someone has attained a level 3
qualification, which is the level of attainment demonstrated by
obtaining A-levels in two subjects, the duty to participate does not
apply.</div><a name="09032735000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001393"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I would like to take issue with what the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said about it being down to
individual teachers to decide. The issue of establishing guided
learning hours and having it in legislation&#151;being absolutely
transparent across qualifications&#151;is the guarantee of quality
and comparability for the quality of the education that we are trying
to give young
people.</div><a name="09032735000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, when I sat down and redesigned a master of business
administration from a full-time structure into a modular structure that
was to be delivered in two-week blocks over a two-year period, we had
to look at the guided learning involved. We had to work out how our
qualification was going to be safeguarded but at the same time give
students some excellent experience and make sure that they were all
coming out at the end with an equivalent qualification. The guarantee
that that is happening is in the notional or guided learning hours that
are attached to a
qualification.</div><a name="09032735000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001394"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I do not agree. What is needed in a qualification is
specified knowledge that children need to have by the end of the
period. For some children, that will be learned in quite a few learning
hours, but for many it requires more. For a small minority, it may
require a number of learning hours way beyond the average. The number
of learning hours becomes a meaningless number for most students.
Teachers will feel that such hours are an infringement of their
professional
autonomy.</div><a name="09032735000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
other reason for disliking the notion of guided learning hours is that
they are used as equivalencies between things that do not have an
equivalence. That is where we get into the self-tanning problem. A
self-tanning module might require 40 learning hours to achieve the
qualification. A module in physics A-level might require 40 learning
hours. Therefore, for some reason, they are then deemed to have
equivalence on the basis of those guided learning hours. We do not want
to go down that route, because it is pretence, it is false and it will
undermine the credibility of vocational qualifications. That is my
concern about guided learning
hours.</div><a name="09032735000366"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause</i><i class="I">

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001401"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I would like to start by talking to
amendment 8 which is in my name and that of my colleagues. I
hope that the Minister will offer assurances which make it unnecessary
to press the amendment to a vote. There was a degree of discussion on
this topic in the evidence session we had a couple of weeks ago and
there was disagreement between those present as to whether the powers
that amendment 8 seeks to give to Ofqual are already contained in the
Bill. The Minister will probably be aware of the origin of this
amendment. It was suggested by the AQA&#151;Mike Cresswell talked
about this issue at the evidence session. In some ways it came out of
concerns raised by the experiences of last summer when there was a
disagreement between three of the awarding bodies over the grade
boundaries for the GCSE science examination. Two of the awarding bodies
wished to set the grade boundary at a lower level than the AQA and the
AQA felt bounced into agreeing at the last minute to set a lower
boundary than it thought right, as a consequence of feeling pressured
by Ofqual to accept the will of the majority. Clearly none of us wants
such disputes and in a well operating, well functioning system issues
of this type would be resolved at a much earlier stage. The AQA
feels&#151;and I think it perfectly proper for Ofqual to have this
power&#151;that where there are disputes of that kind Ofqual should
have unambiguous powers to direct a recognised body to set standards in
a specified qualification on a particular occasion at a specified
level. Kathleen Tattersall said on the record in our evidence session
that she believes that Ofqual already has that power. I believe Greg
Watson or one of the other awarding body chief executives present on
that occasion also said that he believed that the power
was  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column668" />Column number: 668</div>embedded in the Bill but that is not the view of the AQA. It believes
that the particular power to give directions under the clause is
ambiguous.</div>
<a name="09032735001219"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="09032735000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems ironic for an awarding body to suggest it, but the commitment of
the AQA and others to proper standards and scrutiny means that they
want Ofqual to have this power. If the Minister can assure me that the
powers are most certainly to be granted under the clause, I will be
satisfied. But it is the uncertainty with the clause that caused me to
table the amendment.</div>
<a name="09032735000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to comment on amendment 559, if the hon. Member for Wakefield
allows me to do so. I hope that she will not feel that I am pre-empting
any of what she will say, but because I am speaking on both amendments,
it is only suitable that I make my comments now. In her amendment, the
hon. Lady has raised an extremely important issue about whether Ofqual
should have a power to fine. That issue was touched on in the evidence
session a few weeks ago, when Ofqual asked about that. It indicated
clearly&#151;as it did in its note to the Committee&#151;that it
would like to have that power. There were a number of exchanges
involving, I think, the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough,
the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, the
hon. Member for Portsmouth, North and the Minister for Schools and
Learners. The issue was whether the power to fine was
necessary.</div><a name="09032735000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not so far supported such a power, which is partly because, as
liberals, we have a natural reticence to giving all sorts of
unnecessary powers to the Government and its agencies&#151;we
generally think that lighter-touch regulations are desirable. However,
we have considered the issues carefully. As you may be aware,
Mrs. Humble, there was a letter written to a couple of
members of the Committee yesterday&#151;I am not sure whether it was
addressed to all members of the Committee&#151;by Kathleen Tattersall
of Ofqual, setting out some of its views on the matter in greater
detail, which I welcome. That is an indication of Ofqual&#146;s
interest in the issues and its independence. I am also grateful to
Fiona Pethick of Ofqual for giving me further information about its
views.</div>
<a name="09032735000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
reasons to be reticent about granting the power to fine were set out
clearly by Greg Watson of Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations in the
evidence sessions a couple a weeks ago, who was responding to the hon.
Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough. He said that in an ideal
system, fining should not be
necessary:</div><a name="09032735001157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
regulator that finds itself counting crashed planes and fining people
for crashing them is an unsuccessful regulator. The important thing is
that effort, power, authority and resource within Ofqual must be
devoted to getting qualifications that are fit for use into the system
in the first place.&#148;<i class="I"> </i><i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee, </i>3 March 2009; c. 75,
Q198.]</div><a name="09032735000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">I very
much agree with that, and I am sure that Ofqual would as well. Any
fining powers should not be used frequently, and if they were, it would
be an indication that the regulator and the bodies concerned were not
doing their job. As far as I am aware, other public bodies that have
such fining powers do not use them on a frequent basis&#151;although
it will be useful to know whether the Minister has any information and
evidence about the frequency that such powers are used.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column669" />Column number: 669</div><a name="09032735000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Greg Watson
also pointed out that since OCR is a charity, a not-for-profit
organisation, he has concerns not only about being fined, but about the
implications of that on the reputation of his particular organisation.
He said that because of those issues with
reputation,</div><a name="09032735001158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
threat of being shamed is much stronger than the threat of being fined
for an organisation like mine.&#148;<i class="I">
</i><i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee, </i>3 March 2009;
c. 76,
Q198.]</div><a name="09032735000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister for Schools and Learners rightly pointed out that we have many
other awarding bodies, including McDonald&#146;s and Flybe, which the
Minister cited. It may be the case that not all of those awarding
bodies&#151;I am not criticising those two organisations, before
their chief executives write to me, or possibly, the Minister; I mean
unspecified organisations&#151;have quite the reputation that OCR
has, and they will not face such a penalty from naming and shaming.
Ofqual has therefore come back and said that it continues to believe
that powers of the type contained in amendment 559 should be in the
armoury of the regulator, and Kathleen Tattersall stated in her letter
of 25 March that that would help to act as a deterrent and as an
immediate sanctioning step before the ultimate step of withdrawing
recognition from an awarding body. The Ofqual committee therefore
confirmed that it supports a final power as a valuable addition to its
powers, and it has pointed out that many other regulators possess such
powers, including Ofwat, Ofgem, Ofcom and the Office of the Rail
Regulator.</div>
<a name="09032735000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, Ofqual&#146;s case is that there needs to be something
between naming and shaming, which might not be a considerable sanction
for some organisations, and the ultimate sanction of removing the
recognition of an organisation and stopping it from awarding recognised
qualifications, which could of course be devastating to those
organisations and do great damage to learners. I find those
representations quite convincing, and it seems to me unlikely that a
body such as Ofqual, if it had the right staff and leadership, would be
likely to use those powers irresponsibly.</div>
<a name="09032735000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although Greg
Watson made some excellent points in his evidence to the Committee, I
am neither sure that all of them address Ofqual&#146;s concerns, nor
convinced that all bodies would suffer the damage to their reputations,
which is so important to OCR, which has obviously been around for many
years.</div>
<a name="09032735000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
Ministers will consider giving Ofqual some powers on that matter, but
several questions must be asked before they are given. Indeed, Ofqual
sent me a note yesterday evening commenting on some of the issues I
have touched on, such as whether those powers should be available,
whether amendment 559 is right for delivering that and what the scale
of fines should be. I am sorry to take time on that, but it is
obviously an important issue and I would like to touch on some of those
points.</div>
<a name="09032735000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
you will not mind, Mrs. Humble, if I read some of
Ofqual&#146;s observations on those points. I asked Ofqual whether it
believes that amendment 559 is the right response, and although it
supports having a fining power, it believes that the current amendment
is insufficient, as the hon. Member for Wakefield, who tabled the
amendment, may know. Fiona Pethick stated in that note that
she</div><a name="09032735001159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
anticipate any fining power given to Ofqual should be couched in legal
safeguards that provide a framework in which we could use the power. We
would anticipate that framework would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column670" />Column number: 670</div>be similar to that given to other regulators that have fining
powers...We would also expect to be required to set out, and
consult on, a sanctions policy. In setting out such a policy we would
make it clear that we would act in line with the Macrory principles of
restorative justice set out in the Better Regulation
Executive.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that means more to the Minister than it does to me. Ofqual
clearly believes that the amendment is a good one, but that there need
to be additional safeguards, specifications and consultation on that,
and I agree.</div>
<a name="09032735000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also asked
Ofqual what the scale of any fine should be if such a power were given,
and it answered that it</div>
<a name="09032735001160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
anticipate that the legislation would limit the scale of any fine to
say 10 per cent of the turnover of the relevant part of the awarding
organisation&#146;s revenue in the preceding year. So where an
awarding body had business that was not related to qualifications this
would not be taken into
account&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
stated that</div>
<a name="09032735001161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;examples of
other income could include income from publishing or from overseas
examining. Experience from other regulators suggests that any actual
fines would be very much smaller than 10 per
cent.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032735000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">For us to agree to the
additional fining power, we would need not only those earlier
guarantees about legal safeguards and consultation about how the
sanctions policy was going to work, but to know the scale of fines
envisaged. Given that there is already the serious power to withdraw
the ability to accredit, we would not want to set the fining power at a
level that was likely to disable any of the bodies and make it
impossible for them to continue to
operate.</div><a name="09032735000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
email from Ofqual dated 25 March also addresses whether fines would
simply result in higher fees for future qualifications, and states that
Ofqual would put safeguards in place using its fee-capping powers if
necessary to prevent fines from being passed on. The email clarifies
where Ofqual would see the moneys from fines
going:</div><a name="09032735001162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would first expect any awarding body to recompense any learner or
centre for monies they may have lost as a result of whatever
misdemeanour the fine applies to. We would then expect any financial
penalty to go to the consolidated fund, this is in line with other
regulators and reflects the fact that when it is not feasible,
appropriate or economic to recompense all the individuals who lose out
as a result of the failure the taxpayers as a whole are the best
substitute for the
public.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are also comments in that email, which was sent to me and, I believe,
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, about the
circumstances in which Ofqual would wish to use the powers. I think
that I have touched on those. The final point the email addresses is
why the financial penalties would be necessary, over and above the
existing powers to name and shame and remove an awarding body&#146;s
recognition.</div><a name="09032735000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
I am sympathetic to Ofqual having such a power. We want Ofqual to be an
independent regulator, as we have already made clear, but also one that
has the teeth to act when it needs to, and powers and sanctions that
are proportionate to the offences or problems that have arisen. We
therefore hope&#151;I do not wish to anticipate the speech of the
hon. Member for Wakefield&#151;that the Government will respond
positively, but consider coming back with amendments that allow for
some of the powers but with the proper safeguards, and a proper
indication of how the powers will be used and what the scale of fines
will be.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001402"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Yeovil for setting out
so eloquently the reasons behind my amendment. He has given many of the
arguments that I was to
use.</div><a name="09032735000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is not perfect, but I believe that perfection is the enemy of
the good. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is a good amendment. Most
other regulators have the power to fine, and regulation should create
an environment in which innovation can flourish and people can take
risks, while still safeguarding the public interest. The ultimate
deterrent, to keep the public interest at the forefront of
regulators&#146; minds, is the ability to impose a fine. I am not
sure whether I can imagine the circumstances in which such a fine would
be imposed. There would have to be catastrophic failure on behalf of
the examining organisations, with consistently poor service and
behaviour&#151;egregious examples, which cannot be imagined because
they have not happened. In some ways, that shows that we already have a
reasonably good system of regulation, but the deterrent is
important.</div><a name="09032735000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue of whether Ofqual should have the power to fine is not new. It
was raised by the Government in the 2007 consultation paper,
&#147;Confidence in Standards&#148;, and 62 per cent. of
respondents felt that Ofqual should have such a power. Unsurprisingly,
none of the awarding organisations felt it necessary. It was important
that we listened to the chair of Ofqual, as we did on 3 March, when she
gave evidence to the Committee asking for the power to be included in
the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09032735001220"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="09032735000410"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001403"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does the hon. Lady envisage the power to fine being
applicable to the QCA as well? If it failed to deliver proper
assessments of SATS, as it did last summer, could Ofqual fine it, under
this amendment? Is that how she envisages the amendment
working?</div>
<a name="09032735000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001404"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> In an ideal world, yes, but in the real world it
would be bizarre for the public purse, which pays for the QCA, to be
fined by a regulator and for that money to re-enter the public purse.
That circularity would militate against it, although I acknowledge that
the case that the hon. Gentleman raised caused enormous distress and
stress to many learners. I am glad that my right hon. and hon. Friends
took appropriate action.</div>
<a name="09032735000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would put in place a failure-free system. Interestingly, we were
talking about other potential awarding organisations, such as Flybe,
which, like all airline companies, is a failure-free organisation.
Every day, they cannot take the risk of something going slightly wrong
with a plane that could have catastrophic consequences for the pilot,
crew and passengers, as well as, obviously, their business.
Failure-free organisations are now entering the learning environment
and, perhaps, passing on some of their quality and assurance systems to
the development of qualifications for learners in their
companies.</div><a name="09032735000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
mere existence of the power to fine will influence the behaviour of
those that Ofqual regulates, which can only be to the benefit of
learners. As the hon. Member for Yeovil said, it would be an
intermediate step&#151;a sanction falling short of the more serious
one of removing recognition of the awarding body. The ultimate step
would be to prevent it from awarding recognised qualifications, which,
of course, could be damaging to learners past and present. We never
want somebody to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column672" />Column number: 672</div>receive a qualification from an awarding body that then is no longer
allowed to give them out. By implication, that would devalue past
awards.</div><a name="09032735000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ability to fine is a sign of a robust regulator. It would force
organisations to think twice before taking measures that could impact
on the learner. Most measures tend to relate to doing things cheaper,
faster and&#151;supposedly&#151;better. However, we know that
cheaper and faster is not always better, either for the learner or the
exams and tests being marked. We hope that Ofqual will co-operate with
organisations, but as the hon. Gentleman said&#151;I am sorry that he
is not here to hear my response to his eloquent outlining of his
amendment&#151;there would be risks. We would need to be confident
that a fine would not result in fee increases. Most exam fees are paid
for out of the public purse by public bodies, such as schools, colleges
and so on, and we do not want fee increases to be passed on to the
learner, so I understand the Government&#146;s
reluctance.</div><a name="09032735000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual
would need to set out its own sanctions policy and ensure that any
fines levied are proportionate. It would also need to reflect the
changes to the qualifications made by this Bill, because, as we have
heard, a wider range of organisations could be recognised in the future
to award qualifications. For example, I would not want a fine to
jeopardise the existence of a charity. I must declare a past interest
as a board member of Rathbone Training for seven years. I hope that the
time would come when it could, as a large national charity providing
life skills training, develop its own qualifications. However, if
something went wrong and a fine was imposed, we could not jeopardise
the charity&#146;s existence. In any fine-imposition regime we would
therefore need to separate off the amount of money generated by the
qualifications and protecting the rest of the organisation which, in
Rathbone&#146;s case, is delivering skills and learning.</div>
<a name="09032735000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have spoken
about the 14-to-19 work that my local West Yorkshire fire service is
doing with young people in local schools such as Wakefield City high
school and across the region. To go back to equivalence, which is the
bugbear of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, that is
the equivalent of GCSEs or level 1 qualifications. We cannot have a
fire service being fined for a failure in its qualification awards. We
cannot jeopardise the future of the fire cover service in Wakefield
because there may have been catastrophic errors on behalf of the
awarding body. I am also keen to ensure that this new power does not
stifle innovation or lead to conservative&#151;with a small
&#147;c&#148;&#151;organisations or encourage bodies to be
risk-averse. On that note, I would like the Minister to respond and I
stress that it is a probing
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001405"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I shall first address amendment
8, which seems a long time ago, as we have moved on. I hope be able to
reassure the hon. Gentleman. His amendment is intended to allow Ofqual
to direct an awarding body in relation to the setting of standards if
that body is failing, or likely to fail, to comply with a condition and
that failure would be prejudicial. However, clause 144(2) already gives
Ofqual the power to direct a recognised body in the way that the
amendment intends because it states:</div>
<a name="09032735001163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
may direct the recognised body to take or refrain from taking specified
steps with a view to securing compliance with the
condition.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column673" />Column number: 673</div><a name="09032735000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">That includes the power
to direct a recognised body to set the standards in a specified
qualification on a specified occasion at a specified level in order to
secure compliance with a condition. The amendment seeks to address
concerns that we have considered. We agree with them and have dealt
with them in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09032735000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some concern
has been expressed, in particular by Dr. Mike Cresswell, director
general of the AQA, whose comments were mentioned by the hon. Member
for Yeovil, that the powers of Ofqual will not allow it to maintain
standards. I shall put on record once again the Government&#146;s
absolute intention that Ofqual will have the powers it needs and our
confidence that the Bill will give it those powers. For example, Ofqual
could set a condition requiring those awarding bodies offering GCSEs
and A-levels to work together to ensure consistency of standards, to
notify Ofqual by a specified date where there are problems with
agreeing the standard and to accept Ofqual&#146;s judgment about that
standard in that event.</div>
<a name="09032735000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">There can be
no doubt that Ofqual has the powers to set such a condition, not least
because its first objective is the qualification standards objective.
It has the power to direct if those conditions are not met. Parliament
will hold Ofqual to account in relation to its effectiveness in
securing that recognised bodies comply with conditions of recognition
and directions given to it under this section. As the Bill stands,
Ofqual will have robust powers to direct recognised bodies where
necessary, including on standards. I hope that I have satisfied the
hon. Gentleman on that account.</div>
<a name="09032735000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment 559, I am well aware of the request made to us by Ofqual.
It has made it clear on numerous occasions that it wants the power to
fine&#151;we had this in evidence from earlier sittings and in
conversations with, and correspondence from, the chair of Ofqual. I
understand why it needs to have this. I have listened carefully to both
the hon. Member for Yeovil and my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield
and I undertake to the Committee to reflect on that. I ask my hon.
Friend to withdraw the amendment on that basis because, as she
acknowledged herself, it is not perfect and there is more work to do,
not least the talks that we will have to have with the awarding bodies
and with Ofqual, with whom we will discuss how it thinks it might, and
how we think that it should, use that power.</div>
<a name="09032735000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Yeovil asked about the fining powers of other regulators. I
do not have examples to hand but I think all of them have used their
fining powers at some point. We will certainly take that into account
when we consider it
further.</div><a name="09032735000423"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001406"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her undertaking to
reflect on the matter and to include a discussion on the awarding
bodies. It is right that if such a measure is to be introduced, they
should have a chance to respond. The Minister is clearly minded to look
at this seriously, but obviously she still has some reservations.
However, will she put on the record today the concerns and reservations
that the Government have about granting the power? They are still
considering it and did not put it in the original
Bill.</div><a name="09032735000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001407"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It was the fact that the awarding bodies did
not feel that the power was necessary, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column674" />Column number: 674</div>the effect that it might have on exam fee increases and issues such as
that. That is why we wish to reflect on it further. It would be better
if we could get a consensus from the awarding bodies and Ofqual that
the power would be used only if absolutely necessary. That is the issue
that we will reflect on. On that basis, I ask the hon. Members to
withdraw their
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000425"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001408"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. She gave a very clear
exposition of the position on amendment 8 and a clear reassurance that
the Bill already has those powers. She also gave a helpful response to
amendment 559. I hope that the Government will now go and talk to the
awarding bodies and bring back some sensible proposals. We should all
accept that it is very difficult to expect enthusiasm from any body or
organisation that is being invited to discuss whether it should be
fined. If any rational organisation were asked whether it wished to be
fined or have a body given powers to fine it, it would be likely to say
no. It is important that the awarding bodies are consulted, but
ultimately the Government must decide and pay due heed to
Ofqual&#146;s concerns that it needs to be an effective
regulator.</div><a name="09032735000426"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001409"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response. It
is no surprise to me that the awarding bodies were not in favour of the
measure, but I think that there is a case to be made for the new power.
We have discussed separating the qualification awarding activity, which
gives protection to charitable and commercial organisations. But I am
reassured and I look forward to debating this further on
Report.</div><a name="09032735000427"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001411"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take the
following: Government new clause 24&#151;<i class="I">Duty not to impose or

<a name="09032735000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause

shall set and publish the criteria and indicators, including those for
the allocation of credit ratings, which shall be used for the
allocation of qualifications contained within achievement and
attainment tables published by the Secretary of
State.&#146;.</div><a name="09032735000439"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001412"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> New clause 24 will impose a duty on Ofqual
not to impose or maintain unnecessary regulatory burdens. The clause is
similar in effect to section 72 of the Regulatory Enforcement and
Sanctions Act 2008, which imposes almost identical duties on a range of
regulators such as the Office of Rail Regulation and the Postal
Services
Commission.</div><a name="09032735000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sits alongside the other provisions in the Bill that require Ofqual to
perform its functions efficiently and effectively and to review its
committee structures at least every five years. Ofqual will also need
to observe the Government&#146;s five key principles of good
regulation: that any regulatory activity should be transparent,
accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at cases when
action is
needed.</div><a name="09032735001221"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="09032735000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the different subject matter of new clause 22, I am
sympathetic to the thinking behind it. It will be entirely appropriate
for Ofqual to have a role in looking at how qualifications are scored
for the purposes of the Government&#146;s achievement and attainment
tables. That will help to develop confidence in the objectivity of the
scoring judgments. It will be related to its duties under clauses 139
and 140 in relation to the assignment of guided learning hours to
qualifications for the purposes of determining whether qualifications
are sufficient to meet the duty to participate in education and
training under the Education and Skills Act 2008. However, we should
not put the provisions in legislation and there is no need to do so
because achievement and attainment tables are not statutory, and it
would be inappropriate to make them so. I am sure that the Committee
will be aware that we are reviewing them in the light of our proposals
to develop a school report card. Our consultation on that proposal
finished recently and we are reviewing the responses. In the light of
those responses, we will discuss with interim Ofqual what the role of
Ofqual and, if appropriate, that of QCDA, should be in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column676" />Column number: 676</div>new arrangements that we are making for providing information about
school performance. We do not need to put such provisions in the Bill
because, as it stands, it will allow Ofqual to undertake the activity
if requested to do so by the Secretary of State. On that basis, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
it.</div><a name="09032735000442"></a>

when we discussed an earlier clause, but I was distracted by this
morning&#146;s excitement. I do not really know what early years
foundation stage assessment arrangements are, but it would be alarming

concerned. Will the Minister offer reassurance that there is not going

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001417"></a>Sarah

play-based early learning framework designed to help teachers and
professionals in all schools, nurseries, out-of-school clubs and
child-minding provision, working with children from birth to five to
give them the best possible start. There are no formal courses or
lessons or any prescription in terms of what providers do in their
day-to-day practice. The Secretary of State sets arrangements for
assessment of the early learning goals, and Ofqual will have a
statutory duty to monitor and report on whatever arrangements are made
by the Government for assessing the early years foundation
stage.</div><a name="09032735000460"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001418"></a>Annette

<a name="09032735000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Sutherland inquiry made several important recommendations that the
Government have accepted. One key recommendation
states:</div><a name="09032735001171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
forthcoming legislation to establish Ofqual should ensure that it is
given statutory powers to regulate the quality and delivery of National
Curriculum tests, and clearly sets out reporting
lines&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is on page 9 of the report. That is the purpose behind a number of the
clauses in this part of the Bill. My concern relates to the issue of
quality as well as delivery. Amendment 380 requires Ofqual not just to
review all aspects of national curriculum assessment arrangements, but
to ensure that the academic standards of national curriculum
assessments are maintained. Amendment 382 seeks to implement the
recommendation in the Sutherland report
that</div><a name="09032735001172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
test delivery process and timetable should be designed to allow for
maximum marking time and
capacity&#148;</div><a name="09032735000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
382 requires Ofqual to monitor the assessment arrangements to ensure
that tests are delivered in a timely and orderly fashion. Amendment 384
requires Ofqual to make a public statement as soon as practicable if
there is likely to be a significant failing in the delivery of national
curriculum tests. It amends clause 155, which requires notification to
be given only to the Secretary of State. That should be more widely
publicised. Amendment 381 amends clause 156 and it is intended to
ensure that the document that Ofqual is required to publish also sets
out how it intends to maintain the academic standards of the national
curriculum tests. These are sensible amendments designed to ensure
efficiency, timeliness and rigour. I am sure therefore that the
Minister will find it easy to accept all four of
them.</div><a name="09032735000480"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001425"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I shall be brief, because the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton has already made a good case for his
amendments. They are clearly topical in the light of the key stage
testing and marking shambles last year which he described in his
opening comments. I simply add two questions that I hope the Minister
can address. Has Ofqual carried out any further assessment of the
quality of key stage test marking last year? Has any evaluation that it
has carried out supported the assertion that it made fairly soon after
the key stage test shambles first emerged that the quality of marking
last year was as good as in previous
years?</div><a name="09032735000481"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001426"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I think I shall begin by confirming what
clause 153 requires. Ofqual must keep all aspects of national
curriculum and early years foundation stage assessments under review.
The reasons why Ofqual is required to do this are, by definition, to
fulfil its objectives. There are two objectives that are relevant here.
One is the assessments standards objective, which requires Ofqual to
promote consistent and reliable assessments. The other is the objective
to promote public confidence in assessments. Clearly a key part of
public confidence is that assessments are delivered in a timely and
orderly fashion: if there are problems or delays, as I am afraid we saw
last summer, public confidence will inevitably  be
dented.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column680" />Column number: 680</div><a name="09032735000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 380
and 382 seek to guide Ofqual, in undertaking its reviews, to look
particularly at standards and delivery of assessments. We agree that it
should be looking at these things, but we do not need these amendments
to achieve that, because the Bill already requires it to do that. It
would not be fulfilling its statutory objectives if it did not.
Amendment 384 seeks to amend clause 155. Clause 155 was inserted
following a recommendation from Lord Sutherland report in December on
last summer&#146;s national curriculum test delivery
problems.</div><a name="09032735001222"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
<a name="09032735000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">If Ofqual
considers that there is or is likely to be a significant failing in the
assessment arrangements, the clause requires it to notify the Secretary
of State and any other body that appears to have contributed to the
failing. That duty ensures that, if Ofqual comes across problems with
the arrangements, there is no ambiguity about the responsibility to
report them to the Secretary of State, which will improve the chances
of any  future problems being identified early to
maximise  the prospect of them being dealt with. In similar
circumstances, amendment 384 would require Ofqual to produce a public
statement as soon as is practicable, which should specify the nature of
the failing, why it occurred and the actions that Ofqual intends to
take to rectify it.</div>
<a name="09032735000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
will, of course, allow Ofqual to choose to make a public statement
about its concerns, but it will equally give it the discretion not to
do so. It may be entirely appropriate for it to decide not to say
anything publicly; it may want to give QCDA, or the Secretary of State,
an opportunity to rectify problems before talking about them publicly,
to avoid damaging public confidence in the arrangements. If Ofqual
thinks it spots smoke, that does not always mean that there is fire. It
should have the discretion to check whether something really is burning
before deciding whether it would be in the public interest to alarm
people. I am concerned that the amendment would inhibit Ofqual&#146;s
ability to be an effective
regulator.</div><a name="09032735000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would require Ofqual to report what actions it was taking to
rectify failings, but if it finds a problem, it will not be
Ofqual&#146;s job to tackle it. Ofqual is the regulator, its role is
to monitor and report, not to do. If Ofqual was asked to take
responsibility for some aspect of delivery, it could not be an
objective observer reporting on that process, and it would blur the
lines of accountability for delivery, which, as Lord Sutherland found
in his report, are important to have clear. Therefore, if Ofqual chose
to report a problem, it might report, for example, what QCDA was doing
about it and give its judgement about whether that was sufficient, but
it should not be asked to report on what it was doing itself, which the
amendment
suggests.</div><a name="09032735000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
381 would amend clause 156, which requires Ofqual to publish and keep
under regular review a national curriculum assessments regulatory
framework. That framework must describe how Ofqual intends to keep all
aspects of the national curriculum assessment arrangements under review
and to give guidance to bodies with responsibilities for the
development, implementation and monitoring of national curriculum
assessment arrangements on how to perform their
functions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column681" />Column number: 681</div><a name="09032735000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 381
proposes that that document should also include a description of how
Ofqual intends to maintain the academic standards of national
curriculum assessments. A similar point to the one I have just made
applies here. Ofqual is the regulator. It is Ofqual&#146;s
responsibility to set out, through the regulatory framework, how the
QCDA, and other bodies responsible for delivering assessments, should
maintain standards. It is also Ofqual&#146;s responsibility to
monitor and report on whether standards are being maintained. As
regulator, Ofqual cannot be responsible for maintaining standards; only
those who are delivering the assessments can do
that.</div><a name="09032735000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
entirely agree with the thinking behind the amendment, which is that
maintaining standards should be at the core of Ofqual&#146;s
regulation of assessments. That is why promoting assessment standards
is one of Ofqual&#146;s objectives. Due to that objective, Ofqual
will have to make maintaining standards one of the key aspects of the
framework, but it does not need the amendment to do that.</div>
<a name="09032735000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked some specific questions, which I shall answer. The
Government responded to the Sutherland report in February. We hope to
be able to announce the QCA inquiry soon, but we need to allow the QCA
board to go through the due process. Ofqual published its conclusions
on key stage 2 last week.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001449"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Thank you, Mr. Chope, and welcome back to
the chair. I hope that you are suitably impressed with the rapid rate
of progress since you were last in it&#151;perhaps not quite as rapid
as some might have wished, but in any case, we are further on than we
were last
time</div><a name="09032735000531"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with the annual reports that will have to be produced by
Ofqual, and we have tabled amendments 7, 70 and 556. Amendment 7 would
change subsection (2) to ensure that Ofqual would be required to define
specific and measurable success criteria for its objectives. As it
stands, the subsection does not make it clear that there should be a
specific comparison and assessment of its performance in that period of
time against the objectives set for the organisation. With many
governmental bodies in the past decade or so, there has been has been
an expectation that annual reports will make a rigorous attempt to
evaluate whether the performance targets that the body has been given
have been met. We have discussed in relation to other clauses what
Ofqual&#146;s objectives will be and the need for some measurable
process to assess whether it is meeting them. It is therefore entirely
sensible to invite the Government to consider whether that assessment
should be part of the annual report.</div>
<a name="09032735001225"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="09032735000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
70 seeks further to flesh out what the annual report must contain. It
would indicate that the report must not only state how Ofqual has
performed its functions in the reporting period and how it performed in
relation to its objectives, but give an assessment of changes in
educational standards and performance since the last report. The report
would therefore have to give a sense of how standards are changing over
time.</div>
<a name="09032735000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">Importantly,
the amendment would require Ofqual to make an assessment
of</div><a name="09032735001173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;how
English educational standards and performance compare with those in
other developed countries&#148;.</div>
<a name="09032735000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the considerable
scepticism about the changes in standards that we have seen in the past
10 or 20 years as measured by qualifications, there has been an
increasing focus on how the English education system is performing in
relation to those of other countries. Indeed, international surveys
that seek to give some insight into the English 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column684" />Column number: 684</div>system and to compare it with other education systems are released
periodically. Given the debates within the UK and England on how our
educational standards are changing, and that Governments want to know
whether their investments in education are paying off, making
comparisons with other countries is potentially extremely valuable,
both as a benchmark for understanding whether the results of public
examinations actually reflect changes in standards, and so that we can
say whether we are getting value for money from our education
system.</div><a name="09032735000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
556 would introduce new subsections (9) and (10) to the clause. It
would ensure a more rigorous process for Ofqual&#146;s reporting
structure and performance measurement. It
states:</div><a name="09032735001174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
shall, before each financial year, publish a
document&#148;</div><a name="09032735000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
represents the</div>
<a name="09032735001175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;forward work
programme&#148;</div><a name="09032735000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
contains</div>
<a name="09032735001176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a description
of the main activities which it plans to undertake during the year and
how these activities are intended to meet its
objectives&#148;.</div>
<a name="09032735000538"></a><div class="hs_Para">The forward work
programme would ensure that schools, colleges, qualification providers,
the media and parliamentarians clearly understand what Ofqual&#146;s
priorities are each year, and that it can plan its qualifications
accordingly. One issue that we discussed earlier and in previous
sittings is the need for some coherence on the timeliness of what
Ofqual does, to ensure that other organisations are informed in good
time of Ofqual&#146;s plans and priorities and that they are not
wrong-footed by initiatives that take place at very short notice,
without an ability to have an input.</div>
<a name="09032735000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, a
forward work programme would also provide checks and balances for
Ofqual&#146;s activities and allow for greater scrutiny of, and
accountability for,  its performance. We think that all the
measures in amendments 556, 7 and 70 ought to be welcomed by
the Government, and that they are consistent with their strategy in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09032735000540"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001450"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It is good to see you back in the Chair,
Mr. Chope, after a short
absence.</div><a name="09032735000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
162 will require Ofqual to publish an annual report as soon as is
practicable after the end of each reporting period. The explanatory
note says that that report must be laid before Parliament. Our
amendment 33 says that no recommendation contained in that
report shall be implemented unless the report has been approved by
resolution of each House of Parliament. It is trying to echo the
affirmative resolution statutory instrument procedure that we have in
the House to ensure that the annual report is debated. It is all very
well laying a report before Parliament, but we need to be sure that it
is debated in the House.</div>
<a name="09032735000542"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
we are not permitted in legislation to require the House of Commons to
do anything. To get around that convention we have tabled an amendment
requiring any recommendations to be debated in both Houses, the reason
being that Ofqual&#146;s maintenance of standards is important to the
public, higher education and employers. Unless the annual report of
Ofqual is scrutinised in this place, I believe that we would be failing
in our duty to ensure that those standards are being maintained. That
would be an important annual parliamentary event, to ensure that our
standards are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column685" />Column number: 685</div>maintained, and certainly a key priority for Conservative Members. That
is why we are sympathetic to amendment 70, which states that
changes in standards should be compared with those in other developed
countries.</div>
<a name="09032735000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">We tabled a
similar amendment requiring a benchmark comparison with similar
qualifications abroad. That is our party&#146;s policy. If we were to
win the next election, we would have an official link requiring our
examinations to be compared with those in other countries. There is a
concern that our qualifications have drifted downwards compared with
many international qualifications that have not gone down the modular
route or reduced the knowledge content. It is interesting to note the
popularity of qualifications such as the international GCSE, which is
very popular abroad but the Government will not allow in state schools
in this country for fear of creating a two-tier examination system. The
truth is that we have a two-tier system in this country. We have a
system whereby the independent sector is allowed to teach and examine
using the IGCSE, but state schools are not permitted&#151;or are
certainly not funded&#151;to teach it. That has an effect of not
providing a competitor exam to the GCSE, which over the past 10 years
has been chipped away by the QCA and the Government so that its
standards are very different from those of the IGCSE, even though they
started out in a similar position when they were split.</div>
<a name="09032735000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
taking up any more of the Committee&#146;s time, I think that we
should debate this annual report in Parliament and the amendment
provides a method by which the report&#146;s recommendations will be
debated in this House and another
place.</div><a name="09032735000545"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001451"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I, too, would like to welcome you back to
the Chair, Mr. Chope.</div>
<a name="09032735000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 7
and 70 would require Ofqual to include in its annual report material on
the extent to which it has met its objectives. Amendment 70&#151;I
think we have said this before&#151;says that one feature of the
standards objective on which Ofqual must report is educational
standards and performance, including comparison with other countries. I
readily agree that Ofqual will need to report achievement of its
statutory objectives, a key feature of its accountability. I know that
Ofqual in its interim form agrees with this and is planning to identify
measurable success criteria and report on them, including in its annual
report.</div>
<a name="09032735000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked
Ofqual on Tuesday to write to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton and I can confirm that Kathleen Tattersall will be
writing, as committed, on setting measurable objectives. I do not think
it is necessary to include the detailed requirement in legislation.
Ofqual will be accountable to Parliament and the Select Committees will
no doubt put in place arrangements for scrutinising Ofqual&#146;s
work and assessing what it has achieved. Ofqual will have to put in
place some exacting success measures by which its performance can be
assessed.</div><a name="09032735000548"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032735001452"></a><b class="B">Jeff
Ennis</b> (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab): Welcome back
to the Chair, Mr. Chope. The Minister will recall that I
pursued the issue of reporting mechanisms to Parliament during the
evidence sessions because the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column686" />Column number: 686</div>reporting process is crucial for the work carried out by Ofqual. The
presentation of the annual report to Parliament is going to be
important in how we deal with that. As I said at the evidence session,
I favour a repeat system for Ofqual, such as the one that the Select
Committees adopt for Ofsted. They scrutinise the annual report when it
is first presented publicly. Later in the year&#151;maybe five or six
months later&#151;there is another presentation from Ofsted, not just
to look at the outcomes from the annual report, but to go over any
other issues that may have cropped up in the intervening
period.</div>

that it is, of course, a matter for Parliament, not Government, to
decide how Ofqual will report. We would expect the relevant Select
Committees to play a key role, as they do with Ofsted, and I would
imagine that they would want to use the same
mechanisms.</div><a name="09032735000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned, the Government are also planning to ask Ofqual to consider
commissioning an independent review of the reforms to qualifications
regulation after three years, in order to assess what they have
achieved. If Ofqual agrees to that, it will need to decide what
performance measures to set to enable that review to report
meaningfully. It is not good practice to specify such detailed
requirements on the face of the Bill. The danger of prescription is
twofold. First, when Ofqual reports, it would focus only on the
requirements in the Bill, rather than considering carefully and
discussing with the Select Committees what would be most appropriate
for it to report on each year. Secondly, the Bill is not future-proof.
In five or 10 years, the expectations of Ofqual may have moved on and
our successors may want it to report on different things. Comparing the
current Bill with the Education Act 1997, which established the
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, shows how far expectations
change. Rather than buttoning things down in legislation, we want to
ensure that we have robust processes in place to hold Ofqual to account
and to ensure that its work is transparent. We believe that that is
what is in the
Bill.</div><a name="09032735000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
70 reflects the view of last year&#146;s report by the Children,
Schools and Families Committee that measuring standards is the primary
function of the regulator. I need to emphasise that we have discussed
similar amendments and that the Government disagree with that view. A
key role&#151;arguably the single most important role for
Ofqual&#151;will be to keep the height of the hurdle constant from
year to year. That is not easy as curricula and qualifications change,
as they must, but that is the reassurance that we need. Ofqual must be
able to focus on that task and not be distracted by wider questions
about standards. It should be unconcerned with how many people can jump
the hurdle; that is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column687" />Column number: 687</div>job of the Government as they pursue policies that improve the quality
of teaching and learning, safe in the knowledge that those improvements
will be reflected properly and credibly in the form of better results
and qualifications in
assessments.</div><a name="09032735000555"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001457"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s views and the
views of the Government, but she will be aware that information is
already regularly made available, on a comparative basis, on
educational performance in different countries. Ministers are often
inclined to comment on that. Would it be more sensible if we allowed
the independent regulator, Ofqual, to make those judgments and comments
and to take that responsibility away from Ministers, who will naturally
be concerned about
independence?</div><a name="09032735000556"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001458"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> There is nothing in the Bill that prevents
Ofqual from reporting on qualifications in other countries. The primary
function of Ofqual&#151;the clue is in the name: Office of
Qualifications and Examinations Regulation&#151;is to regulate
qualifications and assessments, not to measure standards. Giving Ofqual
the role of measuring standards across the education system and forcing
it to engage in endless debates about standards, would distract it from
its core role and make its job unmanageable. Both Dr. Mike Cresswell,
from AQA, and Kathleen Tattersall, the chair of interim Ofqual, made
those points in the evidence session.</div>
<a name="09032735000557"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 33
would require Ofqual to have any recommendation in its annual report
approved by each House of Parliament before it could implement them. As
I have said, we expect that the relevant Select Committees will play a
key role in holding Ofqual to account, as the Children, Schools and
Families Committee does with
Ofsted.</div><a name="09032735001226"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09032735000558"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
we would expect the Select Committees to scrutinise Ofqual&#146;s
annual report and to discuss the implementation of any recommendations
with the chief regulator. However, as far as I know&#151;the hon.
Member for Yeovil can correct me if he has any more evidence&#151;it
would be unprecedented for a Department to have its detailed business
plan approved by Parliament. That would risk undermining the proper
governance and accountability relationship between Ofqual and
Parliament. Parliament, principally through the relevant Select
Committees, should be responsible for holding Ofqual to account for the
delivery of its objectives, but Ofqual must have the discretion to
decide how best to achieve those
objectives.</div><a name="09032735000559"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001459"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does the Minister recall the statement about Ofqual
by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, the right
hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)? He
said:</div><a name="09032735001177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is an independent regulator of standards, it is independent of
Ministers and it reports directly to
Parliament.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 February 2009;
Vol. 488, c.
27.]</div><a name="09032735000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the essence of the amendment: to enable Ofqual to report directly to
Parliament. It is not about the Minister&#146;s programme of
work.</div><a name="09032735000561"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001460"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It is for Parliament to decide how that
reporting happens. My point is that government is government, and we
would hope that Parliament would use the Select Committee mechanism.
Presumably, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column688" />Column number: 688</div>Ofqual&#146;s business plan would include the recommendations from its
annual report. Parliament should not second-guess Ofqual&#146;s
judgments, because Ofqual would then be at risk of failing to achieve
an objective because it did not attain approval from Parliament for
something in its business
plan.</div><a name="09032735000562"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 556 would require Ofqual to publish for public consultation
an annual work programme for the coming year. I sympathise with the
general sentiment that Ofqual should be a regulator that works
transparently and makes the effort to listen to the voices of a wide
range of people with an interest in qualifications and assessment,
including learners, business, higher education, schools and colleges,
and the general public. Ofqual may want to publish an annual business
plan or lay such a plan before Parliament and the Northern Ireland
Assembly, but I have concerns about the amendment similar to those
about other amendments we have
discussed.</div><a name="09032735000563"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a matter of principle, we should avoid detailed prescription of how
Ofqual does its business. Both the legislation and the ongoing
accountability mechanisms should focus on what Ofqual
achieves&#151;how far it meets its objectives&#151;and leave the
detailed judgments about how to deliver to Ofqual itself. Ofqual needs
to have powers to deliver, which the Bill provides, but it risks being
a less effective organisation&#151;less able to be robust and to
respond to events&#151;if it has to jump through hoops before it can
act. So, let us trust Ofqual to regulate as effectively and
transparently as possible, to consult as and how it needs to, and to
answer to the Select Committees. As with all these
amendments&#151;accountability, yes; scrutiny, yes; measuring
Ofqual&#146;s impact, absolutely; but not through statutory
requirements regarding how Ofqual goes about its business, which might
constrain its ability to meet learners&#146; needs. I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000564"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001461"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful for that detailed response to this
group of amendments. I think that we can agree on amendment 7, because
the Minister made it very clear that she will expect Ofqual to define
specific and measurable criteria for its objectives and report on them
in its annual report. I am very satisfied with her response on that
amendment, which she has put on the
record.</div><a name="09032735000565"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I am afraid that I remain unconvinced by her response on amendments 70
and 556. Amendment 556 states that Ofqual should publish a forward work
programme, which would allow for consultation from outside groups,
allowing people to know what Ofqual was looking at and input their
views. The Minister&#146;s response was that we do not want to give
Ofqual too many responsibilities and be too prescriptive. I remind her
that schedule 11 on page 192 of the Bill, which we debated a couple of
days ago, insists that Ofqual should review the structures of its
committees on a particular timetable. If the Government, and hence the
Minister, are going to be so prescriptive as to insist that Ofqual
manage its committee structures in a particular way, and prescribe
precisely how often it should review those structures, surely the
Minister should be willing to do something far more important, and
insist that Ofqual set out its forward work
programme.</div><a name="09032735000566"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001462"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman accept that a
requirement to review the committees every five years does not
necessarily mean that it has to change 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column689" />Column number: 689</div>anything, but that it has to check that it is right? That is not the
same as the micro-management to which he has
referred.</div>
<a name="09032735000567"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001463"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> No, I will not accept that. I suggest, without
wishing to revisit a previous debate, that how Ofqual reviews whether
to keep the structure and scope of its committees is exactly the kind
of issue that it should have responsibility for. Any chief executive or
management group within Ofqual who are not capable of that, frankly,
would not be fit for the job.</div>
<a name="09032735000568"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 556
sets out precisely the type of requirements in which the Government
should be interested, such as the responsibility for Ofqual to have a
forward programme of work that allows other organisations to engage
with it. Again, we are finding inconsistencies in how the Government
are framing the legislation, with micro-management in areas in which
they have no business micro-managing; and some duties that should be
placed on those bodies are not in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09032735000569"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
disappointed, but not completely surprised, by the Minister&#146;s
response on amendment 70. I know that the Government are reticent to
make Ofqual what it was originally advertised to be&#151;a genuine
watchdog that can comment on standards, and end the endless debates
that occur every August and throughout the year on whether there has
been dumbing down or standards have been maintained. It is surprising
and disappointing that Ofqual should not even be able to make
international comparisons, and that it is not encouraged to be the body
that makes assessments about the international surveys, which already
take place, and draws conclusions that might not only be relevant to
general observations about standards in English education, but be
regarded as a legitimate cross-check for the qualifications it is
supposed to regulate. I was amazed when the Minister said that she did
not want to force Ofqual to engage in endless debates about standards,
and I think that that was from her written comments, rather than an ad
lib. If Ofqual is not going to be at the centre of the endless debate
about standards, it will clearly fail to do the job that it needs to do
and that, in many senses, the Government have sold it as doing in the
media.</div><a name="09032735000570"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001464"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> At the risk of returning to a previous
debate, does the hon. Gentleman accept that we are talking about the
standard of qualifications, which Ofqual does have powers to look at,
rather than standards across the wider education system as a whole,
which it does not have powers to look
at?</div><a name="09032735000571"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001465"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I accept that that is the narrow way in which the
Government want to define Ofqual&#146;s responsibilities and that our
views differ on that, which is part of what the debate is about.
However, I am also inviting the Minister to reflect on the fact that it
is important for the Government to make comparisons with other
countries, and judgments on standards and on whether the regulated
qualifications are doing their job. It is important that there should
be an independent body commenting on the available international
evidence, which Ministers constantly use to justify their statements on
educational standards. Ofqual is precisely qualified 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column690" />Column number: 690</div>to do that job and it is somewhat disingenuous of the Minister to say
that nothing prevents it from doing so, when clearly, everything that
Ministers are saying implies that it should not tread in that area at
all.</div>
<a name="09032735000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed with the Minister&#146;s response on amendment 70, which
confirms my fear that we are heading for a body that will have no
credibility in the standards debate, will not be forced to engage in
endless debates about standards and will not be able to make
comparisons with international performance or objective assessments on
what is happening with regard to the international surveys of
education. It will essentially be a toothless regulator that will fail
to do the most important job of making objective, credible and
respected judgments about standards, which it should be able to do and
which it has a responsibility for. I am, however, satisfied with the
Minister&#146;s response on amendment 7 and beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000573"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

have now finally gone past part 7, which dealt with Ofqual, so I shall
try to get my initials right here. I congratulate the Minister on her
patience in taking us through that. I note that she is still at the
crease dealing with part 8 of the Bill on the QCDA. Schedule 11
considers and makes detailed provisions relating to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column691" />Column number: 691</div>QCDA, particularly its constitution and proceedings. The QCDA will
clearly be an extremely important body in its own right. It will not be
a non-ministerial department as Ofqual was, but a non-departmental
public body. Perhaps the Minister will say a few things about the
distinction between the two in her opening comments. The Committee
might find it useful to learn why the decision was taken to make the
QCDA a non-departmental public body, rather than a non-ministerial
Department&#151;she will be aware that there are some concerns about
the fact that there is that distinction&#151;and whether the Bill
gives it quite the independence from Government and from Ministers that
it might be
given.</div>
<a name="09032735001227"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="09032735000598"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition could perhaps be criticised for not having tabled more
amendments on this subject to probe in more depth the relationship
between the Government and the QCDA. We may want to return to that
later. Amendment 144 deals with the accountability of the chief officer
of the QCDA. According to schedule 11, the QCDA is to
consist of between eight and 13 members who will all be
appointed by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State must
appoint one of the ordinary members to chair the QCDA. Paragraph 3(1)
states:</div><a name="09032735001178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
chief officer is to be appointed by the QCDA, on conditions of service
determined by the
QCDA.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000599"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
3(2)
states:</div><a name="09032735001179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
appointment and conditions of service of the chief officer are subject
to the approval of the Secretary of
State.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000600"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the debate on Ofqual, we considered whether some accountability for
these bodies should be to Parliament through Select Committees rather
than directly to the Secretary of State. The Children, Schools and
Families Committee has considered that point, as have other Select
Committees. The amendment would delete &#147;Secretary of
State&#148; and
insert</div><a name="09032735001180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children,
Schools and Families Committee of the House of
Commons.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000601"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, it would make the Select Committee rather than the
Secretary of State responsible for approving the appointment and
conditions of service of the chief officer of the
QCDA.</div><a name="09032735000602"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual
is a high-profile body with potentially an important job. There will be
a lot of attention on whether it succeeds in resolving the standards
debate. Because of that, there has been an inclination inside and
outside Parliament to underestimate the importance of the QCDA. Its
responsibilities are set out in the schedule, in later clauses and in
the explanatory notes, which
state:</div><a name="09032735001181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
QCDA will retain the QCA&#146;s non-regulatory functions, including
supporting Ministers on developing the curriculum and related
qualifications and delivering National Curriculum
tests.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000603"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is an extremely important body and there are issues about its
independence.</div><a name="09032735000604"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
party would feel much more comfortable and supported if there was
accountability to Parliament, rather than all accountability being
placed in the hands of the Secretary of State. After all, the Secretary
of State has already been given significant powers over the QCDA, such
as the power to appoint its members. We hope that the Minister will
respond to those concerns.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column692" />Column number: 692</div><a name="09032735000605"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001480"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> On the QCDA being a non-departmental public
body, it will have the same status that the QCA currently has. It will
continue to be the key source of expertise in supporting Ministers on
the curriculum and related qualifications. It will continue to develop
and deliver national curriculum tests. Ministers are quite rightly
accountable to Parliament for the content of the curriculum and they
will continue to need an expert body that offers robust advice on
monitoring and developing the curriculum. As a non-departmental public
body, it will be at arm&#146;s length from Ministers rather than
directly under their control. That is the relationship we want it to
have: close to Ministers, but separate from them and able to provide
expert
advice.</div><a name="09032735000606"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001481"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the Minister explain why the Government decided
to make Ofqual a non-ministerial body and for the QCDA to be a
non-departmental public body? What is the justification for the
different
treatment?</div><a name="09032735000607"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001482"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The difference is that Ofqual has a
regulatory function whereas the QCDA is an advisory
body.</div><a name="09032735000608"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment proposes that the appointment and conditions of service of
the chief officer of the QCDA should be subject to the approval of the
Children, Schools and Families Committee rather than the Secretary of
State. It is similar to amendment 57, which we debated on Tuesday, and
which proposed that the appointment and conditions of service of the
Ofqual chief executive should be approved by the Select
Committee.</div><a name="09032735000609"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is problematic for two reasons. First, the QCDA is
accountable to Parliament not directly, but via the Secretary of State.
In fact, two Secretaries of State have an interest in its work. That
accountability must be reflected in the responsibility for approving
the appointment and conditions of service of the chief officer. I
therefore have a problem with the amendment in principle. Secondly, it
is not appropriate for a Select Committee to be responsible for
approving the appointment and conditions of service of an employee of a
public body that is part of Government. That is not the purpose of
Select Committees and they do not have the structures to do it. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000610"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001483"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am disappointed, but not entirely surprised. As
the Minister accurately said, to some extent we are rehearsing the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001486"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Clause 167, which is probably the shortest one in
the Bill, sets out what the QCDA&#146;s objectives should be. It says
that:</div>
<a name="09032735001182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
QCDA&#146;s objective is to promote quality and coherence in
education and training in
England.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000623"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can understand &#147;quality&#148;, which we support. However, I do
not understand the purpose of inserting the word
&#147;coherence&#148; into education and training. Clearly, we do
not want incoherence in education and training, but there is no need
for it to be an ordered and coherent activity. The market should
decide&#151;whether that is within the state sector, or between the
state and independent sector. The schools will decide what the
education should be and parents should decide what type of education
they want for their children. The more diverse the education system,
the better, so that we can use best practice from all over the country
and from all kinds of institutions.</div>
<a name="09032735000624"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see no
purpose in having the word &#147;coherence&#148; in the very short
objective that is set out for the QCDA in the clause. Amendment 34
therefore seeks to leave out the word &#147;coherence&#148; and
insert the word &#147;rigour&#148; because parents are seeking
rigour from the education system. I do not want to rehearse the debates
that we have already had in the Committee about trying to restore
rigour and standards to our education system, our qualifications and
our curriculum.</div>
<a name="09032735000625"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 387
inserts into clause 168, which concerns the general duties of QCDA, the
phrase:</div><a name="09032735001183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
desirability of promoting the acquisition of academic
knowledge&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000626"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I do not want to reprise our earlier discussions about the debate that
there has been in this country 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column694" />Column number: 694</div>between skills and knowledge&#151;the idea that one can teach
thinking, historic, or scientific skills in a disembodied way that is
divorced from the knowledge being taught.</div>
<a name="09032735000627"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the past
10, 20 or 30 years, there has been a drift away from knowledge towards
skills. Children are learning about chronology or data analysis in
history, but very often they are failing to learn about the Saxons, the
Romans, the middle ages and periods of history that are important to
Britain, Europe and the world. The children may well have those
esoteric skills, which I doubt that they will have acquired, but their
knowledge of history is sketchy. I sat in on a lesson in a secondary
school recently where they were learning about data analysis and
intuiting the evidence. A portrait of Henry VII was displayed to the
class, which were asked to intuit from that portrait things about Henry
VII. The answers that the children were coming up with were that he was
rich because he had a fur thing around his neck and that he was full of
himself because he had all this gilt on his clothing, but that is an
irrelevance. Nothing was said about his battle with the barons or the
fact that he was actually short of money, hence all the problems that
Henry VII suffered during his reign. That is not the way our education
system should be going, but it is the way that it is travelling at the
moment.</div>
<a name="09032735000628"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of amendment 387 is to insert into the objectives of the QCDA the
desirability of promoting the acquisition of academic knowledge. No
parent in this country would find that an odd objective to
insert&#151;I am surprised that that objective is not already set out
in the
Bill.</div><a name="09032735000629"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
386 inserts a subsection (d) into clause
168:</div><a name="09032735001184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons
whom, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, represent the interests
of employers or institutions within the higher education
sector.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000630"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a requirement to consult those people. Qualifications serve three
purposes&#151;they serve the students or people who take the tests,
as our education systems serves them, but they also serve the users of
qualifications, which are the institutions of higher education and
employers. They need to be consulted when the QCDA is considering its
work and the reforms that it is implementing in the
curriculum.</div><a name="09032735000631"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
388 adds a subsection to clause 170, saying that the
QCDA</div><a name="09032735001185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
have regard to the importance of maintaining the rigour of academic
qualification.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000632"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is ample evidence, which I do not want to reprise in today&#146;s
debate, that exam standards have declined in recent years&#151;such
as from the centre for evaluation and monitoring at Durham university,
about how there has been grade inflation in most of the A-levels taken
over the past 10 or 20
years.</div><a name="09032735000633"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 389 adds a subsection to clause 172, saying again
that the
QCDA</div><a name="09032735001186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
have regard to the importance of maintaining...academic
rigour&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000634"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
of the amendments is terribly controversial. They are all amendments
that the public would support. I hope that the Minister will be able to
support them this
evening.</div><a name="09032735000635"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001487"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am also interested in hearing the Government
definition of &#147;coherence&#148;, when we come to the
Minister&#146;s response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column695" />Column number: 695</div><a name="09032735000636"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall speak
to amendments 226 and 145. I hope that amendment 226 will not prove too
controversial and that the Minister will be able to reassure me in her
response, because the amendment adds an additional element that QCDA
must have regard to in pursuing its functions&#151;information
provided to it by the recognised awarding body. It is important for the
QCDA to take into account the expertise and practical knowledge of the
awarding bodies. I am sure that the Minister will say that she agrees
with that&#151;we had a similar amendment on one of the clauses
dealing with Ofqual&#146;s responsibilities and the Minister was able
to respond positively. I hope that she will be able to do so similarly
on amendment
226.</div><a name="09032735000637"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
145 is probing, to find out more about the thinking of the Government
on clause 169(1)(b), which makes some allowance for the QCDA
potentially not to be taking a responsibility for some qualifications
in the future. The explanatory notes
say:</div><a name="09032735001187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State is given the power by order to exclude
qualifications from QCDA&#146;s
remit&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09032735000638"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
is implied in clause
169&#151;</div><a name="09032735001188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
order-making power is subject to the negative procedure. This provision
is designed to allow for any future changes to the QCDA&#146;s role.
The intention is that this power could be used in particular to remove
the QCDA&#146;s functions in relation to vocational qualifications,
if the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills were to
conclude at a later date that it did not wish the QCDA to have advice
and review functions with respect to these qualifications. Any such
decision would not affect Ofqual&#146;s role in regulating those
qualifications.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000639"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested to know why the Government&#151;the two
Departments&#151;have inserted that provision into the Bill and
whether they think that it would be sensible in the future for
vocational qualifications not to be part of the remit of the QCDA. I
thought that it would be the Government&#146;s intention to include
vocational qualifications and that there was concern that they should
be treated differently from the range of academic qualifications. I
hope that the hon. Lady can therefore enlighten us about why the
measure has been inserted into the Bill and explain what consideration
has already been given by her sister Department, DIUS, into whether the
change should take place. Is there is a plan to use the exclusion power
within the foreseeable
future?</div><a name="09032735001228"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001488"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Amendment 34 would change QCDA&#146;s
objectives from those of promoting quality and coherence to promoting
quality and rigour, and I shall start by responding to the hon. Member
for Yeovil. The &#147;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&#148;
defines &#147;coherent&#148; as logical and consistent. Coherence
is currently part of QCA&#146;s objective under the Education Act
1997 Act, so it is nothing new.</div>
<a name="09032735000641"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001489"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Does &#147;coherence&#148; have any implication
for the number of
qualifications?</div><a name="09032735000642"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001490"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The coherent idea is that QCDA is not
looking at curriculum and qualifications in isolation, but can look at
them collectively to provide quality and rigorous learning programmes
for young people. It is not QCDA&#146;s role to look at the number of
qualifications.</div><a name="09032735000643"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rigour
is important, but it is intrinsic to quality so we do not need to
identify it separately. Nor should we be losing the requirement to
promote coherence.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column696" />Column number: 696</div><a name="09032735000644"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001491"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Progressive educationalists believe that a quality
education should not be rigorous and that it should be child-initiated
learning in a loose and play-based way. That would not constitute
rigour, but it could constitute
quality.</div><a name="09032735000645"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001492"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> In my view, rigour is intrinsic to quality
and we do not need to identify it separately. Coherence is important
because, as I said, we want to make sure that collectively we have
rigorous learning programmes for young people&#151;a point that we
are capturing by
&#147;coherence&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000646"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
387 to 389 would give QCDA additional general duties of having regard
to academic knowledge, academic qualifications and academic rigour. I
do not disagree that QCDA will have to have regard to such matters, but
the Bill should not specify everything that it must have regard to.
Those requirements are implicit under the Bill in its objective to
promote quality and to have regard to the requirements of learners and
higher education. QCDA could not deliver those objectives without
ensuring academic rigour, so the amendments are not
necessary.</div><a name="09032735000647"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
386 and 226 would require QCDA to have regard to information provided
respectively by representatives of employers or the higher education
sector and awarding bodies. In relation to amendment 386,
QCDA already has a general duty to have regard to the requirements of
employers and higher education under clause 168(2)(b) and (c). If there
were specific representatives whose information the Secretary of State
wished it to have particular regard to, he could direct it to do so
under subsection (3)(c). The amendments are therefore not
necessary.</div><a name="09032735000648"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
226 would require QCDA to have regard to information provided by
awarding bodies. As I said, the Bill cannot specify everything that
QCDA should have regard to and, of course, it will have listen to, and
work with, awarding bodies as it drafts qualifications criteria and
keep the qualifications system under review. If it did not do so, it
could not do its job properly, which is why it does not need to be told
to do so. There is no reason to single out under the Bill awarding
bodies ahead of all the other organisations, including subject
associations, with which QCDA will need to
work.</div><a name="09032735000649"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
145 would remove the power of the Secretary of State to limit by order
QCDA&#146;s remit in relation to qualifications. Its qualifications
remit, as defined under clause 169, is broadly the same as that of
Ofqual and covers qualifications awarded in England that are not higher
education qualifications although, unlike Ofqual, QCDA will have no
functions in Northern Ireland. That reflects the fact that Ministers
might want advice from QCDA on any qualifications or types of
qualifications that Ofqual regulates and, under clause 170,
QCDA is under a duty to keep under review all qualifications within its
remit.</div><a name="09032735000650"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
was announced last year, ministerial colleagues in DUIS will want to
review, in due course, whether QCDA should have a long-term role
advising on adult vocational qualifications. There are other bodies
that have a role in those qualifications: sector skills councils look
at the skills and qualifications needed in individual sectors of the
economy and the UK Commission for Employment and Skills will look
across the adult skills landscape. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column697" />Column number: 697</div>the QCDA is also looking at adult qualifications, there is a risk of
duplication with those other bodies. Therefore, if DIUS Ministers
conclude that they do not want the QCDA to look at post-19
qualifications, subsection (2) allows them to remove vocational
qualifications from its remit, and the QCDA would no longer be under a
duty to keep those qualifications under review.</div>
<a name="09032735000651"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would prevent DIUS from rationalising the advice that they get on
post-19 qualifications, without further primary legislation. It would
force the QCDA to keep reviewing the qualifications, even if doing so
duplicated the role of other bodies that were better placed to advise
DIUS and DIUS Ministers did not want that advice. In the light of that,
I hope that the hon. Gentlemen will not press the
amendments.</div><a name="09032735000652"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001493"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Again, I am grateful to the Minister for giving such
full responses and for explaining the Government&#146;s thinking
behind clause 169 and the excluded qualifications. She has usefully put
the Government&#146;s thinking on the record. I need to reflect on
what she has said before considering whether we have any concerns about
taking such vocational qualifications out of the QCDA&#146;s
remit.</div>
<a name="09032735000653"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
226, the Minister gave a fairly similar response to the one that she
gave when we discussed information from awarding bodies. Although she
is unwilling to accept the amendment, I hope that the QCDA will listen
closely to those awarding bodies. I shall allow the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to respond to his own amendment, as he
no doubt wishes to, but I want to put on record that I am not entirely
convinced about the clarity of the word &#147;coherence&#148; and
about whether the Bill benefits from it. If one negates the two words
in clause 167, one ends up with a fairly meaningless formula, which
indicates that the clause does not add any clarity to the Bill and is
not useful.</div>
<a name="09032735000654"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001494"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I did not feel that
the Minister&#146;s explanation of the use of
&#147;coherence&#148; was convincing. Her main argument being that
the word was in the 1997 Act when the QCA was established. The history
of the QCA over the past 11 years has been anything but coherent. One
only has to look at the administration, through ETS, of the standard
assessment tests last summer. That was certainly not coherent. Using
that word in the 1997 Act has not led to success, therefore we need the
word &#147;rigour&#148; in the clause instead of the word
&#147;coherence&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000655"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that she was also in favour of rigour, so we share that
aim. She thought that it was synonymous with &#147;quality&#148;,
but I do not believe that it is. One can have progressive, quality
exams that are. The Montessori approach is high quality, but few would
regard it as a rigorous approach to young children&#146;s education.
There are arguments on both sides about whether it is effective. The
QCDA should develop a rigorous curriculum for our schools. That is what
the Minister and parents want. I hope that the Minister will vote with
us as I press amendment 34 to a division.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001508"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I beg to move amendment 490, in
clause 170, page 92, line 20, leave
out subsection
(5).</div><a name="09032735000676"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001509"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take
Government amendments 491, 492 and
494.</div><a name="09032735000677"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001510"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Beginning with amendment 490,
clause 170(5) makes explicit provision for the QCDA to develop, set or
administer certain tests or tasks, which the QCA has been doing
successfully for some years in relation to key and basic skills
qualifications. The subsection mirrors one inserted into the Education
Act 1997 by the Education Act 2002 to reflect that work. We need the
QCDA to do such work in the future, but having reviewed the provision,
we concluded that the QCDA can do those things under clause 175 of the
Bill. Therefore, the provision is not needed and should be removed from
the
clause.</div><a name="09032735000678"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
491 clarifies how clause 171 will work. The clause allows the QCDA to
assist Ofqual in the development of qualifications criteria&#151;it
is therefore a key clause to make Ofqual effective. One of the key
reasons for establishing Ofqual as an independent regulator was to get
rid of the current conflict of interest in QCA&#146;s functions,
where it is responsible for both the development of criteria of
qualifications and their regulation, including public assurance about
the maintenance of
standards.</div><a name="09032735000679"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
future, we envisage the process to operate as follows. The QCDA will
draft or amend the criteria for public qualifications. It may do so off
its own bat&#151;for example, if it is time for a review of the
criteria&#151;or it may do so because the Secretary of State has
asked it to. If it was the latter, the Secretary of State may have
issued a determination under clause 138, setting out the minimum
requirements for the qualification on knowledge, skills or
understanding. Once the QCDA has developed the draft criteria, it will
send them to Ofqual, which will then check and confirm that it is happy
that the criteria allow standards to be maintained. If it is, it will
formally adopt them, proceed to regulate against them, and invite
awarding bodies to submit proposals for qualifications that meet the
criteria. That will be a useful check on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 699</div>quality of the QCDA&#146;s draft criteria. It also means that Ofqual,
not having been responsible for developing the criteria, will be
credible when it provides assurance about the qualifications developed
against them. But if Ofqual was not happy with the draft criteria, it
would send them back to the QCDA for redrafting. The decision on
whether to adopt the criteria will be fundamental to the confidence in
the new
system.</div><a name="09032735000680"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
491 will change clause 171 so that the QCDA has a duty to assist Ofqual
in setting criteria where a section 138 determination has been made.
Giving the QCDA a duty reflects the importance of the clause, and,
given the need to avoid a conflict of interest, we would expect the
QCDA to undertake criteria development where such a determination has
been made. Linking it to section 138 will allow the Secretary of State
to retain an overview of the QCDA&#146;s priorities: by issuing such
a determination he sets an expectation that it will be drafting the
criteria. But it is an important principle that Ofqual continues to own
the criteria to allow it to maintain a control of standards, which is
why the duty only kicks in if Ofqual makes a
request.</div><a name="09032735000681"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
where a section 138 determination has not been issued, the QCDA may
still assist in setting criteria&#151;although it will not be under a
duty to do so. As I have said, we would not expect to issue a section
138 determination as a matter of
course.</div><a name="09032735000682"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
492 and 494 follow on from amendment 491. Amendment 492
clarifies that the assistance that QCDA may provide to Ofqual in
connection with Ofqual&#146;s qualification functions does not
include financial assistance; it would be peculiar for one public body
to be able to provide financial assistance to another. To ensure there
is not a more general overlap between the respective powers of clauses
171 and 175, amendment 494 clarifies that clause 175 cannot
be used to provide assistance that is within the scope of
clause 171. On the basis of that explanation, I hope that
the Committee will accept the
amendments.</div><a name="09032735000683"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

qualifications which are approved by the QCDA and Ofqual must be funded
by the Secretary of State, notwithstanding any advice which may be
given to the Secretary of State by the Joint Advisory Committee for
Qualifications Approval or any other
body.&#146;.</div><a name="09032735000685"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would insert a sixth paragraph at the end of clause 170,
which sets out QCDA&#146;s duties and powers in relation to
qualifications within the agency&#146;s remit. The amendment would
ensure that all qualifications that are approved by QCDA and Ofqual
would be funded by the Secretary of State, notwithstanding any advice
that the Joint Advisory Committee for Qualifications Approval or any
other body might give
him.</div><a name="09032735000686"></a><div class="hs_Para">JACQA
is new and has a low profile, so I have no criticism of you,
Mr. Chope, if you are unaware of it. For the
Committee&#146;s information, however, I have obtained a paper
entitled &#147;JACQA: Frequently asked questions&#148;. It is not
clear how frequently the questions are asked, but the first question,
&#147;What is JACQA?&#148;, suggests that they are not asked very
frequently at all. The paper explains that JACQA is</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 700</div><a name="09032735001189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a new committee
that is being set up to advise the Government on the public funding of
14-19 qualifications in England. We want to ensure that all
publicly-funded qualifications help young people to unlock their
talents and achieve their aspirations&#151;we are therefore
introducing a new process to ensure that public funding is directed
only at those qualifications that meet this
requirement.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000687"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the second question, &#147;Who is on JACQA?&#148;, the
paper
notes:</div><a name="09032735001190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;JACQA
will be made up of representatives from employers and all parts of the
education and training sector. It will be co-owned and jointly chaired
by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (subsequently to become
the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency), and the Learning
and Skills Council (subsequently to become the Young People&#146;s
Learning
Agency).&#148;</div><a name="09032735000688"></a><div class="hs_Para">JACQA
is an important body for the reasons given in the answer to the fifth
question, which explains that JACQA is an advisory committee and,
although it does not have any statutory powers,
it</div><a name="09032735001191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
make recommendations to the Secretary of State on which 14-19
qualifications should be eligible for public
funding.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000689"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government talk about setting up independent bodies such as Ofqual and
QCDA to give independent advice and make rational judgments about
particular qualifications, but the paper&#146;s 13th question
reads:</div><a name="09032735001192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Is
it possible for a qualification to be accredited by Ofqual, but then
rejected for funding by
JACQA?&#148;</div><a name="09032735000690"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
answer, significantly,
states:</div><a name="09032735001193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Yes;
accreditation and Section 96 approval are separate processes. A
qualification could be accredited and then privately
funded.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000691"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
qualification could therefore be approved by Ofqual and QCDA, but not
receive any
funding.</div><a name="09032735000692"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
have the Government decided to set up JACQA? It means more bureaucracy
and an additional power for the Secretary of State, and essentially
cuts away much of the independence that the QCDA, arguably in
partnership with Ofqual, has. Those bodies can develop qualifications,
consult and do independent work, but ultimately, on the basis of an
obscure body, they can discover that none of those qualifications will
be funded by the
Government.</div><a name="09032735000693"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001512"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I have listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman
has said, and that is precisely the situation that we find ourselves in
now with the international general certificate of secondary education,
which has been approved by the QCA, or Ofqual, and now we await a
recommendation from that body to find out whether there will be
funding. Meanwhile, we have a two-tier system in which the independent
sector is allowed to teach the qualification and the state sector is
not.</div>
<a name="09032735000694"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001513"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. It is not just an
argument for educational boffins. It has a real practical impact now,
and it is a mechanism through which the Government can fail to fund
qualifications they do not like. It is a mechanism through which they
can pursue a narrow range of qualifications, rather than allow a market
in qualifications to develop in the way that we discussed in part 7 of
the Bill. Perhaps it is a way for the Government to deliver the
slightly vague notion of coherence that we found out about at the
beginning of this part. That appeared to be something to do with
quality in the Minister&#146;s mind, but we suspect it is more about
the Government dictating centrally which qualifications they do and do
not like and preventing a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column701" />Column number: 701</div>genuine market in qualifications. That is a real concern to us.
Essentially, it means that there is a power to veto the measures and to
veto qualifications that may be good and of use in the private sector,
and which state sector schools and colleges may wish to use, but which
they are not permitted to use because the Secretary of State vetoes
them. The amendment is a perfectly sensible
one.</div>
<a name="09032735000695"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09032735000696"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001514"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> According to all my hon. Friend&#146;s research,
is it a matter of public knowledge whether the Secretary of State
always follows the advice of his advisory body, or whether he has
supreme power
anyway?</div><a name="09032735000697"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001515"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is a very good question. I am desperately
looking for the answer on my list of frequently asked questions about
JACQA. Unfortunately, I do not have it. My hon. Friend raises a very
important point and I think that the Minister, who is smiling in an
encouraging way, intends to answer that question when she sums up. She
might also say when the first meeting of JACQA was. It would be helpful
if she clarified which qualifications have been referred to JACQA for
its
advice.</div><a name="09032735000698"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is important because it means that we could have high-quality
qualifications that would be of use in the private sector and that
maintained schools might wish to use. The qualifications could be
denied to those schools not because of QCDA or Ofqual, but because of
some obscure committee giving advice to a Secretary of State, who might
wish to strangle qualifications that he or she sees as competing with
the range of qualifications approved by the Government. I therefore
hope that the Minister can respond to some of the points made,
including those made by my hon. Friend, and assure us that she is going
to get rid of that dreadful committee and allow QCDA and Ofqual to do
the job that they are there
for.</div><a name="09032735000699"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001516"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As the hon. Gentleman explained, his
amendment would require the Secretary of State to fund any
qualification approved by both Ofqual and QCDA, regardless of advice
given by JACQA or anyone else. The amendment is a little unclear but I
assume that by &#147;approved by Ofqual&#148; it means
&#147;regulated by Ofqual&#148;.</div>
<a name="09032735000700"></a><div class="hs_Para">This measure
will give to QCDA the power that currently rests with the Secretary of
State to decide which regulated qualifications should be funded. That
is not an extra power; it makes more transparent the operation of the
existing power. Funding approval goes to the Secretary of State under
the Learning and Skills Act
2000.</div><a name="09032735000701"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual&#146;s
role is to ensure that regulated qualifications are of good quality,
whether those qualifications are used by maintained schools, colleges,
independent schools, employers or others. However, just because a
qualification is of good quality does not necessarily mean that it
should be approved for funding in maintained schools and colleges.
Qualifications used in state schools must fit in with the national
curriculum. More generally, the Government&#146;s 14-to-19
qualification strategy sets out how we plan to rationalise the
qualifications offer to make sure that it is easily understood,
provides clear progression routes and meets the diverse needs of all
young people.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column702" />Column number: 702</div><a name="09032735000702"></a><div class="hs_Para">The strategy
is partly in response to complaints from schools that the current
qualifications offer is confusing. We want to make it easy for young
people to see what options are available to them, and to ensure there
are no dead-end routes. It is entirely legitimate for the Government to
decide which qualifications to fund, and, in particular, to decide not
to fund some regulated qualifications. We have said, as a matter of
policy, that we will normally approve funding only for qualifications
that are regulated by Ofqual. Paragraph 21 of schedule 12 reinforces
that by requiring ministerial consultation with Ofqual prior to
approving funding for a qualification that is not regulated.</div>
<a name="09032735000703"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have put
in place the Joint Advisory Committee for Qualifications Approval,
known as JACQA, which is a joint committee of the Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority and the Learning and Skills Council. If the Bill
is passed, it will be a joint committee of the Qualifications and
Curriculum Development Agency and the Young People&#146;s Learning
Agency. JACQA is an advisory committee that first met in December 2008.
It provides Ministers with informed advice on which qualifications are
consistent with the qualifications strategy; but it is, and should
remain, Ministers who are responsible for decisions on which
qualifications to fund. They are accountable to Parliament for those
decisions in a way that QCDA would not be.</div>
<a name="09032735000704"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001517"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is the Minister saying that her prime concern is
that QCDA might approve qualifications that are not consistent with the
national curriculum, and that she wants JACQA to check on that
incompatibility?</div><a name="09032735000705"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001518"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> JACQA is there to advise Ministers on any
issue. My point is that Ministers are accountable to Parliament,
whereas QCDA is not, and that Ministers should be responsible for
decisions on which qualifications to fund.</div>
<a name="09032735000706"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001519"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Other than inconsistency with the national
curriculum, what reasons might there be for being concerned about or
rejecting a
qualification?</div><a name="09032735000707"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001520"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I suppose that the main concern would be in
relation to our 14-to-19 qualification strategy going forward in
maintained schools. We have said on numerous occasions that we intend
to have only four principal qualification options available nationally,
beyond 2013, that are eligible for public funding: GCSEs and A-levels,
diplomas, apprenticeships and progression pathways within the
foundation learning
tier.</div><a name="09032735000708"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would require the Secretary of State to accept a
recommendation by QCDA to fund a qualification, but would also require
him to ignore a recommendation by JACQA, which will be a joint
committee of QCDA. The current arrangements are transparent and the
accountability is clear, whereas the amendment would be confusing. I
therefore invite the hon. Gentleman not to press the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09032735000709"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001521"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am afraid that I still have concerns about this
matter. It seems odd to establish all these independent bodies,
including QCDA, and then to reserve all these powers to the Secretary
of State. The Minister has explained that she would be concerned about
national 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column703" />Column number: 703</div>curriculum issues, and that might be understandable, but it is not clear
to me whether the availability of a qualification that was in some way
inconsistent with the national curriculum would necessarily compromise
the duty on schools to follow the national
curriculum.</div>
<a name="09032735000710"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
gave much more of a clue to the Government&#146;s thinking when she
spoke about their desire for a limited number of qualification options
and their desire to control the qualifications offer. That is much more
what this is about. I understand her concern that we could have a
proliferation of qualifications in the future, and that it might be
difficult for universities and others to make judgments about them. I
also understand that there might be a disadvantage to young people in
educational institutions where certain qualifications are not on offer,
but if the Government seek to regulate the qualification market in the
way that I suspect they intend to, which is signalled by the
establishment of such a body, the safety
valve&#151;</div><a name="09032735000711"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001522"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if his
amendment is accepted, the danger is that Ofqual will look at funding
considerations when deciding whether to regulate a qualification? That
is not the purpose of
Ofqual.</div>
<a name="09032735001230"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001523"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am not sure why Ofqual would need to consider
that, particularly as the QCDA will already have an important
responsibility in that area. We suggest that the qualifications
approved by both QCDA and Ofqual should be funded by the Secretary of
State. Allowing those qualifications to be used in the maintained
sector is a safety valve when the Government&#146;s qualifications
offer does not do the right job. That safety valve should be available
to hold the Government to account. I am disappointed with the response,
and I will seek to press the amendment to a vote.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001537"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Chope, in my first contribution to the
Committee&#146;s debates. This is an important part of the Bill, and
there are a number of other important parts that I hope the Committee
will consider this evening.</div>
<a name="09032735000740"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
amendments seek to ensure clarity about where the responsibility lies
for the curriculum as applied to schools and, importantly, early years
providers. Obliging the QCDA to require the Secretary of State&#146;s
permission to publish, disseminate or facilitate the publication of the
curriculum would ensure that it needed the Secretary of State&#146;s
clear agreement to the curriculum, early learning goals and other
educational programmes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column705" />Column number: 705</div><a name="09032735000741"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
reasons why that is important and why it is important to tie the
Government closely into the workings of the QCDA. First, although the
QDCA has operational responsibility for the day-to-day workings of the
system, clear and unambiguous lines of responsibility must go back to
the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is accountable to
parents, students, teachers, early years workers and
providers.</div>
<a name="09032735000742"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
early years foundation stage is a new part of the curriculum, and
considerable concerns remain about how it impacts on the early years
sector. Some 2,000 child minders have left the child care sector since
the EYFS was put in place. The Secretary of State will need to monitor
closely the impact of the EYFS, because a careful balance must be kept
between the implementation of the strategy and providers&#146;
ability to continue to provide an important part of our child care
system. The EYFS is complex and highly prescriptive, and it is clearly
having an impact on providers. That is why it is important for the
Secretary of State to be kept involved. The Department&#146;s own
consultation highlighted a lack of clarity on responsibility in that
area, and we feel that the amendments would help.</div>
<a name="09032735000743"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might also
be useful at this point to remind the Committee of the problems that
other hon. Members are having with another non-departmental public
body, the Learning and Skills Council. Hon. Members will be aware of
the funding crisis in the further education sector. As a result of
close questioning by hon. Members, Ministers have had to admit that
they were not fully aware of the work being done by the LSC, perhaps
because it is a non-departmental public body.</div>
<a name="09032735000744"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that such lack of involvement and knowledge of what is going on
will be acceptable in such an important matter as the curriculum. The
Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families needs to be aware
of what is happening. To avoid doubt, the amendments would make it
crystal clear that the Government are ultimately responsible for that
important area of
policy.</div><a name="09032735000745"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
553 recognises provisions made by the Government that allow certain
providers of early years care with a proven record of offering
excellent early years education to request an exemption from the EYFS.
That amendment would put a clear responsibility on the QCDA to ensure
that information about exemptions is readily available, particularly
information on how a provider can make an application.</div>
<a name="09032735000746"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 12
will enable the Secretary of State to set up a body, including the
QCDA, to review cases for exemptions from the EYFS and to keep those
cases under review. The Government have taken seriously the concerns
expressed by some providers, hence the exemption procedure. Perhaps the
Minister is also aware of the concerns raised about the nature of the
exemption process. Exemptions are possible in theory, but they seem to
be more difficult to come by in practice. In undertaking to disseminate
information on the matter, the QCDA will be able to assess whether the
exemption process is practical and proportionate and ensure that the
system is workable.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001538"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I am sure that the hon. Lady shares my concern
that the option of exemption is given only for a limited
time&#151;two years, I think. Would her amendment make exemptions
possible for a much longer period, given the QCDA&#146;s
views?</div><a name="09032735000748"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001539"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> That is not the objective behind the amendment,
although I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s concern. Our concern is a
more fundamental one about the exemption procedures and processes,
which I hope the QCDA would consider if it had more responsibility in
that area. I am not sure that I like a system that includes exemptions,
because it shows that the system has a fundamental weakness in being
unable to accommodate certain providers, notwithstanding what my hon.
Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said about the
Montessori system, which offers what some parents want in terms of
quality early years care. My concern is why we do not have a system
that can accommodate everybody. It probably shows a weakness in the
system, although I take the hon. Lady&#146;s
point.</div><a name="09032735000749"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
548 would require the QCDA to provide an annual report on the
curriculum. That would play an important role in keeping everybody who
is interested in the workings of the QCDA aware of its work and provide
an important opportunity to assess the early years foundation stage at
a critical time. The QCDA is uniquely placed, because it looks at both
the curriculum and training and it can pull those together. Early years
has not had a great deal of time given to it in the Committee. It is
rather a shame that some very important early years provisions, and
provisions on children&#146;s trust boards and Sure Start, have been
shoe-horned into a Bill that has little to do with those subjects.
Those provisions have been overshadowed, so I would therefore like to
focus on the early years
stage.</div><a name="09032735000750"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a growing body of evidence that, despite spending &#163;17 billion
in the past decade, the improvements in every child&#146;s ability to
reach their potential regardless of their start in life are simply not
coming through, which we see when we look at the results from key
stage 1. The Committee will be aware that early years
education and care is critical if a child is to reach his or her
potential. The QCDA therefore has a critical role in the curriculum in
the early years stage and in training. By the age of two, a child from
a more privileged background will already have an academic advantage
over their poorer peers and the difference is likely to become more
pronounced as their school careers
progress.</div><a name="09032735000751"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre
report shows that the quality of early years care has a significant
effect on a child&#146;s early years achievement levels. In
particular, there is a positive effect from attending higher quality or
more effective pre-school settings on a child&#146;s subsequent
outcomes in maths and reading at the end of year 5. We are not seeing
the significant expansion in early years education through the early
years entitlement and the more general availability of child
care&#151;around 90 per cent. of three and four-year-olds now receive
some form of early years education in a formal setting&#151;translate
into results for children from our most deprived areas.</div>
<a name="09032735000752"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statistics are stark. In 2005, 71 per cent. of the most deprived 10 per
cent. of children in this country achieved national standard in
writing; yet by 2007, that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column707" />Column number: 707</div>figure had fallen to 68 per cent.&#151;I received those figures from
the Minister in answer to parliamentary questions. When it comes to
reading, the trend is again in the wrong direction, despite the
investment. Fewer children in the most deprived 10 per cent. of
communities achieve the national standard in key stage 1. An annual
report from the QCDA could look at that and throw a spotlight on it,
and on all the other issues, such as the need to review the EYFS, which
is critical.</div>
<a name="09032735000753"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report
could also look at what training needs need to be adapted to ensure
that children get the start in life that they need. It is important to
include training in the report. It is in line with QCDA&#146;s
objectives as set out in the Bill, and other answers to parliamentary
questions have revealed yet again that there has been a decline in the
number of child care staff qualified to level 3 in the 30 per cent.
most deprived areas in the country. I remind the Committee that one in
four early years staff are still not qualified to the most basic
standard. That is the case behind the amendments.</div>
<a name="09032735000754"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain the meaning of the Government amendment? The original
meaning of the Bill will be quite significantly changed by it.
Originally, the Bill meant that not all regulated assessments would be
kept under review. Does she mean that the QCDA will keep every
assessment under review, or are non-regulated assessments excluded? If
the latter is true, will she outline exactly what is a non-regulated
assessment and which assessments would be
affected?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001540"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> A common theme of many of the amendments we
have been dealing with is that they seek to put a lot of detail into
the Bill about how QCDA and Ofqual should do their work. I am sure the
Committee will be familiar with what I am about to say. As a matter of
good practice, legislation should as far as possible set out the
organisation&#146;s objectives, give it the necessary powers and
leave the how&#151;the processes it should use and so on&#151;to
the organisation to decide. How the bodies need to do things may change
over time as circumstances change in ways we cannot currently predict.
So the less process we put on the Bill the
better.</div><a name="09032735000756"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
548 falls firmly into that category. It may indeed be appropriate for
QCDA to publish regular reports on the curriculum, but there is no
reason to require it to do so in the Bill. Amendments 549 and 551 would
require QCDA to gain the Secretary of State&#146;s permission before
publishing or disseminating information about the curriculum or early
learning goals and educational programmes. This is unnecessary. I think
it would be unduly burdensome and bureaucratic on both QCDA and the
Secretary of State for permission to have to be sought before QCDA
could exercise some fairly core functions. Amendment 552, similarly,
would require the Secretary of State&#146;s approval before QCDA
could provide services or other assistance. This again would be unduly
burdensome.</div><a name="09032735000757"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001541"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The Minister is trotting out the line that this is
burdensome. We have heard her say that at earlier stages of the
Committee. I suggest that a burdensome role is perhaps part of the
ministerial responsibility. Given the current problems with the
Learning and Skills Council and the lack of understanding that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column708" />Column number: 708</div>Minister responsible for that part of the organisation shows in
explaining what was going on, surely the Secretary of State should have
a role in understanding what is going on with these sorts of
non-departmental public
bodies.</div><a name="09032735000758"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001542"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The amendment says that the Secretary of
State&#146;s approval would be required before QCDA could provide
services or other assistance. If a school came to the QCDA seeking
advice on the implementation of the curriculum, why should the QCDA
have to seek ministerial approval before providing the advice
requested?</div><a name="09032735000759"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
550 and 553 relate to the early learning goals and educational
programmes which are part of QCDA&#146;s remit. Amendment 550
requires that these must be as defined by the Secretary of State. The
amendment is not necessary because the QCDA is already bound to the
Secretary of State&#146;s definitions. Clause 173(5) states
that</div>
<a name="09032735001194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the early
learning goals and educational programmes&#148;</div>
<a name="09032735000760"></a><div class="hs_Para">are those requirements
specified under section 39(1)(a) of the Childcare Act 2006. Under this
Act, the early learning goals and educational programme are already
specified by the Secretary of State in section 2 of the statutory
framework for the early years foundation stage document. QCDA has no
power to change these existing legal
requirements.</div><a name="09032735000761"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 553 proposes an additional power for the QCDA to publish and
disseminate, or facilitate the publication or other dissemination of
information relating to exemptions from the early years foundation
stage. I agree that QCDA needs to be able to publish such information,
but this amendment is not necessary to enable that. QCDA has a power in
clause 173(4) to publish and disseminate information relating to the
early learning goals, educational programmes and assessment
arrangements for the EYFS. This would include information relating to
exemptions.</div>
<a name="09032735000762"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Lady will be willing to withdraw the amendment. Before I move
to Government amendment 493, it would be extremely remiss of me not to
wish to hon. Lady a happy birthday. She reminded us of it on Tuesday.
She also asked me about the thinking behind Government amendment 493.
It will ensure that the QCDA can keep all regulated assessment
arrangements under review. As drafted, clause 174 restricted
QCDA&#146;s general review function to assessment arrangements that
were not regulated assessments, in other words, assessments that were
outside the orders made under sections 128(3) and 128(5) of the 2002
and 2006 Acts and therefore outside Ofqual&#146;s scope. In the
explanatory notes to that provision we confirmed that this was not
intended to stop QCDA reviewing regulated assessment arrangements where
that was appropriate for purposes connected to its other functions. But
for the sake of consistency with the approach of the Bill to
QCDA&#146;s other functions we have decided to make this
explicit.</div><a name="09032735000763"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001543"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for taking the time to go
through such a detailed response to this group of amendments. I am
reassured that she agrees that it may be appropriate for a report to be
issued by this organisation but it is not required by the Bill and I
hope that feeling of it being appropriate is something that will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column709" />Column number: 709</div>communicated to it. We would all want to be mindful of the work it is
doing in this important area of the curriculum.</div>
<a name="09032735000764"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
amendment 553, again I was reassured somewhat by the Minister&#146;s
response that she agreed that there was already a function that the
QCDA could disseminate information in this area. I hope that it goes
further than that and the QCDA actually looks at the procedures and
processes behind the exemptions, as the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole said earlier. She raised an issue around time limits of the
exemptions. There is a great deal of concern about complexity in this
area. I do not agree that there is no need to clarify the Secretary of
State&#146;s role within the QCDA and I remain concerned that there
are problems with non-departmental public bodies and understanding the
level of responsibility that Ministers are willing to take for
decisions made by non-departmental public bodies. I am mindful that the
Committee has long proceedings today so I will not push this to a vote
but I thank the Minister for her comments. I beg to ask to leave to
withdraw.</div><a name="09032735000765"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001544"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I beg to move amendment 147, in
clause 182, page 96, line 26, after
&#145;school&#146;, insert &#145;or
Academy&#146;.</div><a name="09032735000779"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
that burst of activity, we need to take stock of clause 182, which
gives us the interpretation of part 8 of the Bill. I draw hon. Members
attention particularly to subsection (1) in which a maintained school
is defined as a community, foundation or voluntary school. Amendment
147 would insert &#147;an academy&#148; after
&#147;school&#148; in order to include academy in this part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09032735000780"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am keen to find out from the Minister whether there is any significance
in the exclusion of academies from this part of the Bill, and what the
effect might be of excluding or including academies in this part of the
Bill. Presumably, if any particular thinking underlies this, it might
be that academies enjoy&#151;or certainly used to enjoy&#151;a bit
more freedom in relation to the curriculum than other maintained
schools.</div>
<a name="09032735000781"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view, of
course, is that there is nothing wrong with having that curriculum
freedom. All schools ought to enjoy that curriculum freedom, and it
should not simply be available for those schools that the Government
have cherry-picked and made academies, many of which are, of course,
still categorised as being in the national challenge category because
of their poor results. In fairness, those poor results are usually
inherited from the previous schools that were serving tough catchment
areas and were perhaps not doing well for a prolonged period.</div>
<a name="09032735000782"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our desire is
to extend academy freedoms in that respect to all maintained schools,
not to deny them to existing academies. However, there is a need to
treat academies rationally and fairly within the group of all
state-funded schools. Indeed, we will come to that issue later in
relation to another clause under which academies

McCarthy-Fry:</b><b class="B"> </b>The effect of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would be to extend the remit of the QCDA
beyond that of its predecessor, the QCA, to include matters relating to
curriculum and assessment arrangements in academies. As hon. Members
know, academies differ from other state-funded schools in their
regulatory framework through funding agreements rather than
legislation, which brings with it the freedom to adopt innovative
approaches to raising standards. Academies also differ because of the
involvement of independent sponsors. Those differences are fundamental
to the academies programme and must be preserved. The autonomy of
academies has been a key feature of their success, and we know that
academy principals and sponsors take seriously any proposals that could
lead to the erosion of their independence.</div>
<a name="09032735000784"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001546"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the Minister explain why the freedoms to
innovate in relation to the curriculum, which I welcome, are denied to
other maintained schools&#151;including high-performing maintained
schools?</div><a name="09032735000785"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001547"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The reason is that, in general, academies
are in areas that have had significant difficulties and are deprived.
Those freedoms should operate in that way to enable children who are
not reaching the required standards to do
so.</div><a name="09032735000786"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001548"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Perhaps I will try another approach. Would she
consider giving those same freedoms to other schools in challenging
areas with poor results that have good
leadership?</div><a name="09032735000787"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001549"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> A feature of our policy is that we have a
range of different methods by which we are improving education
throughout the country. Academies are just one way of doing that and we
are committed to extending our academies programme. However, we are not
saying that we should have academies across the entire school
estate.</div><a name="09032735000788"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
general policy has been to avoid placing requirements on academies
through legislation unless academy involvement has been essential to
make the proposed arrangements work properly. We will be coming to
clauses later that relate to that. In the case of the children&#146;s
trust, academies should be given the opportunity to represent the
interests of their
pupils.</div><a name="09032735001232"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09032735000789"></a><div class="hs_Para">Academies
are required to teach a broad and balanced curriculum and to teach the
programmes of study in the core subjects of the national curriculum.
Beyond those requirements, we are keen to allow them the freedom to
develop a curriculum that is driven by the needs of their pupils in the
circumstances in which their pupils find themselves. We do not believe
that it will help academies, which generally speaking are our schools
facing the most challenging circumstances, to impose a greater
curriculum and assessment requirement on
them.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column712" />Column number: 712</div><a name="09032735000790"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001550"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It may not surprise hon. Members to hear that I
found the Minister&#146;s response totally and utterly unconvincing.
It is completely dotty to deny to high-performing maintained schools
the freedoms that academies enjoy over the curriculum. What possible
reason can there be for denying the top maintained schools the freedoms
to innovate in the curriculum when we give them to some of the most
challenging schools throughout the country, many of which are listed
among the national challenge schools, and some of which have weak
leadership and cause great concern to the Department? At least there
would be some consistency and rationality in Government policy if those
freedoms to innovate, which the Government appear to argue are
important to enabling schools in challenging circumstances to do
better, were extended to other schools in challenging circumstances
which do not happen to be academies.</div>
<a name="09032735000791"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
the Phoenix school in west London has one of the most challenging
intakes anywhere in the country, was one of the most poorly performing
maintained schools 10 or 15 years ago, was very nearly closed, and had
police officers in and out every day because of disorder problems, and
huge numbers of supply and temporary teachers because of other
problems. How can it be right to extend curricular freedoms to
academies in such challenging circumstances but not to maintained
schools in the same circumstances?</div>
<a name="09032735000792"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
curricular freedoms should be available to all schools, perhaps
excepting those that are in special measures or have particular
deficiencies in leadership. However, there is no justification whatever
for the policy that the Minister has just set out, and there is no
coherent reason for the Government&#146;s position, which is entirely
arbitrary and unjustifiable. If those powers to innovate in the
curriculum really are as important as the Minister implied by the fact
that they have been given only to academies in such circumstances,
surely they should be available to all schools.</div>
<a name="09032735000793"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not
suggest, as the Minister also implied, that academies be rolled out
throughout the entire school estate; all I suggested was that the
powers to innovate in the curriculum be available consistently to every
single school. She should be embarrassed to come to this place and put
before the Committee views that have such weak grounding in any
argument and on any statistical basis. Although we do not wish to
extend onerous responsibilities to every school in the country, the
only way in which we can signal our dissatisfaction with the lack of
logic in the Government&#146;s policy is to ask for a Division on
amendment 147.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001574"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Clause 184 looks at the bodies that should work
together to improve services for children in all our communities across
this country. Effective joint working was one of the most important
recommendations in the original Laming inquiry, yet six years on we are
still some way from achieving that goal. Indeed, Sir Alan Steer, while
giving evidence to the Committee, said of children&#146;s trust
boards
that</div><a name="09032735001195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;pulling
together all the services around the child...would certainly be
good, but that is very much speculating on a desired outcome, rather
than evidence that one can see at the
moment.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>5 March 2009; c. 113,
Q13.]</div><a name="09032735000840"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
lack of effectiveness of children&#146;s trust boards to date was
echoed by the Audit Commission&#146;s report of October 2008, which
stated that after five years there is little evidence that they have
improved outcomes for children and young people. One specific criticism
was that many of the representatives on children&#146;s trust boards
lack a mandate for committing resources. The importance of engaging
missing partners was also reinforced. The amendments attempt to address
those problems and look at some of the other issues raised. A desire
for consistent and effective joint working through the
children&#146;s trust boards has driven the Government to put aside
the Audit Commission&#146;s advice that they should not proceed in
making children&#146;s trust boards statutory in the
Bill.</div><a name="09032735000841"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause sets out some of the details on who will be involved in
children&#146;s trust boards to try to make that working a reality.
Taking forward children&#146;s trust boards and enshrining them on
the statute book is something that the Audit Commission was clearly not
happy with. It heavily criticised them because of its concerns over the
effectiveness of the organisations, so the amendments would address
those issues and look particularly at the membership of
children&#146;s trust boards in the light of the evidence we received
on that in the evidence sessions and in separate
submissions.</div><a name="09032735000842"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
195 seeks to address some notable omissions in what are called relevant
partners in the Bill. It would include in section (2) short-stay
schools, representatives of children&#146;s centres, extended schools
and from general practitioners. The Government&#146;s original
proposals focused on how pupil referral units, GPs and Sure Start
centres might properly be involved in children&#146;s trust boards,
yet the Bill does not appear to have taken up that challenge. At the
start of the consultation leading to the Bill, the Government set out
with some vigour their stall on who should have a duty to co-operate,
stating clearly that schools, early years settings and other universal
services must take a leading role. The consultation set out that the
proposal was to involve schools, general practitioners and Sure Start
centres formally in children&#146;s trusts. All respondents to the
Government&#146;s consultation process felt that Sure Start centres
in particular should be engaged with children&#146;s trust boards. A
suggestion was even made that Sure Start children&#146;s centres
could be managed through children&#146;s trust boards.</div>
<a name="09032735000843"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
Bill is economical with changes and does not make some of those
suggested during the consultation in relation to the bodies that might
be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column718" />Column number: 718</div>required to co-operate. The DCSF&#146;s own consultation showed that
getting the right people to the table was pivotal to ensuring that a
corresponding strong voice was given to all relevant bodies involved in
improving outcomes for children. I hope that the Minister agrees that
the amendment would help to ensure that the right people are in place
to make those decisions and make the bodies far more
effective.</div><a name="09032735001233"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="09032735000844"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister might know that Save the Children put out a very good
briefing. It, too, raised the concern about the lack of reference in
the Bill to pupil referral units being a relevant partner. Will she
also take this opportunity to clear up another question about
membership of children&#146;s trust boards? I believe that a recent
Department of Health consultation stated that somebody responsible for
vulnerable children would be on children&#146;s trust boards, but the
Bill does not indicate that that assertion will be carried through by
her Department. Is this planned to be added, and if so how will it be
put in
place?</div><a name="09032735000845"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
75 echoes points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton on other occasions about the importance of protecting
academy freedoms. We need to get the right bodies to the table to make
decisions about the future of our children, but we also have to accept
that academies cannot be treated in the same way. The Bill will put a
statutory obligation on an academy to be a relevant partner, which
would mean that it would have to participate in children&#146;s trust
boards. Although an academy might choose to do so&#151;we heard no
resistance to such an input in our evidence sessions&#151;we heard
resistance to an obligation being placed on academies that might take
away from their autonomy. Listing academies as a relevant partner would
contribute to the continual erosion of academy freedoms that we have
seen over time. The amendment would ensure that this change does
nothing more to undermine those very important freedoms, which will
make academies successful for
children.</div><a name="09032735000846"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001575"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I assume that the hon. Lady&#146;s position is
that all schools should have that freedom, not just
academies.</div><a name="09032735000847"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001576"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b><b class="B"> </b>My amendment refers specifically to
academies. From the start, academies have set great store by their
independence. Although a strong argument could be made for academies to
be involved in the workings of a children&#146;s trust board, the
Government must accept that they fall into a different category. Many
would choose to work with boards to improve outcomes for children, but
academies and head teachers might be concerned about the bureaucratic
burden that an obligation would place on them. I think that subsequent
amendments will pick up on that
point.</div><a name="09032735000848"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001577"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I shall begin with amendment 75. This part of the
Bill deals with the principle of co-operation to improve well-being.
When we look at the members of the children&#146;s trust boards, we
will seek much further clarification, because we are all concerned
about extra burdens and bureaucracy, but I find it difficult to
disagree with the principle of bringing those particular bodies
mentioned in subsection (2) into the requirement to
co-operate.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column719" />Column number: 719</div><a name="09032735000849"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am extremely
surprised that Conservative Members want to exclude academies. By
definition&#151;and as the Minister told us this
afternoon&#151;academies will deal with some of our most vulnerable
and disadvantaged children, and if ever there was a need to be able to
tap in quickly to support services, it will be under those
circumstances. Indeed, the principle of schools in general being called
into that general duty was fought tooth and nail from the Opposition
Benches when the Children Act 2004 was discussed in Committee. We also
argued very strongly that GPs should be included; we were certainly
working
together.</div><a name="09032735000850"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have noticed a huge omission that has become greater over time and that
goes back to 2004 Act: housing bodies are missing. The provision may
refer to &#147;the local authorities&#148;, but when one considers
housing associations and arm&#146;s length management organisations,
all Members will have dealt with tragic cases trying to sort out
housing for families with disabled children. Whenever there is a case
of something extra, I suggest that it should be added at this point. As
far as I am concerned, it is five years too late, but it should be
there, and I shall table the amendment on Report if the Government are
not willing even to look at this. I would be disappointed if the
Government did not look at it, because they have made such progress in
improving conditions for families with disabled children, but there is
a lot more to do where housing is
concerned.</div><a name="09032735000851"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we are looking at vulnerable children, we can reflect on the fact that
Shelter suggests that 1 million children live in unsuitable housing
conditions. That has a huge knock-on. I do not think that it is
sufficient, with ALMOs and independent ownership of housing
associations, just to mention local authorities. That is why we need
the schools brought in&#151;as the Bill does this time&#151;because
schools have become more independent from local authorities, which I
support. We need a balance and I believe that organisations must
co-operate to improve well-being but we must ensure that we do not make
that duty unnecessarily onerous.</div>
<a name="09032735000852"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 367
specifically refers to &#147;pupil referral units&#148;. We have
used that term here very deliberately because we are aware that there
is a proposal to rename them, but its use is appropriate at this stage.
It is particularly interesting that the Government consulted on the
inclusion of such units. When we look at the analysis of the responses
to the consultation, there is a whole paragraph, which starts by
saying:</div><a name="09032735001196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nearly
all responses to this question suggested that the duty should be
extended to all the suggested bodies particularly schools and FE
colleges.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000853"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on for a number of different institutions, but it does not mention
in the summary what the response was on the pupil referral units other
than in the first sentence, which suggests that there was general
support.</div><a name="09032735000854"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
feel particularly strongly about pupil referrals units being included
in the list; there are quite a large number of them, about 450. I know
that 11 are in special measures and that the one in Poole has been
languishing in special measures for far too long. We have to consider
the reasons why children are in pupil referral units.</div>
<a name="09032735000855"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have acknowledged that there is a lack of reliable and
detailed information about the characteristics and outcomes of children
and young people receiving alternative education and provision. The
data available tells us that the most likely reason for a young person
to be looking for alternative provision is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column720" />Column number: 720</div>exclusion. Other reasons for being placed in a PRU are physical, mental
and emotional ill-health; teenage motherhood; pupils having
difficulties dealing with the mainstream school system; or perhaps even
being temporarily without a school place.</div>
<a name="09032735000856"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some 75 per
cent. of pupils at PRUs have special educational needs and, sadly, a
large number of young people who attend a PRU have committed a crime in
the last year. When one looks at the very different characteristics of
the pupils&#151;and there will not be a very large number of them in
any particular unit&#151;the services needed are all medium, highly
specialist services, whether child and adolescent mental health
services, or other support to stop them going go too far down the path
of crime. There is a strong case for making sure that PRUs are firmly
in the centre of this duty to co-operate and therefore that they have
very close relationships with the relevant partners. It is not
surprising that in 2007, 88.3 per cent. of 15-year-old pupils in PRUs
did not gain a single GCSE at grade A* to C, because this is a group of
young vulnerable people who deserve better.</div>
<a name="09032735000857"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are attempting to address that with the change to short stay
state schools and the title itself is interesting, because we know that
young people tend to languish for far too long in PRUs. As the
Government are taking such a stance, in an area which so desperately
needs reform, why not go that one step further and include pupil
referral units in section 10 of the Children Act 2004? I will be really
interested in the Minister&#146;s reply to that. Can she provide
details on how the Government will ensure that providers of alternative
education in the private and voluntary sector can be involved in the
work with children&#146;s trusts, because that will be important for
alternative providers, and say how that will fit into the work of the
children&#146;s trusts?</div>
<a name="09032735000858"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
suggestions are sensible. We have got notes, circulated by the
Minister, about a possible suggestion on how GPs can be tied into the
duty through being nominated by primary care trusts. It is desperately
important that GPs are more engaged with the whole agenda and
&#147;Every Child Matters&#148;. We have to make sure that we get
it right in the Bill. We have had long enough to reflect since our
discussions in 2003 and the enactment of the Children Act 2004, and we
need to get this list of partners right at this
stage.</div><a name="09032735000859"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001578"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I thank both hon. Ladies for their
contribution. The hon. Member for Basingstoke mentioned the Audit
Commission report &#147;Are We There Yet?&#148; Its criticisms did
not take account of the rapidly developing policy context, or the fact
that change was often in reaction to local government&#146;s own
expressed views in response to consultation. It does not fully reflect
the children&#146;s plan messages about strengthening
children&#146;s trusts, the revised statutory guidance on
children&#146;s trusts, or consultation on the new legislation, all
of which address the problems highlighted in the report. In particular,
putting children&#146;s trust boards on a firmer statutory footing in
the Bill does much to answer the criticisms in that
report.</div>

it? That is not long ago.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column721" />Column number: 721</div><a name="09032735000861"></a><div class="hs_Para">My comments
also referred to evidence that we were given by people working at the
chalk face who question the effectiveness of children&#146;s trust
boards. I understand her point, that a great deal of effort is going in
to make the organisations more effective, but she cannot completely
ignore the evidence that we were
given.</div><a name="09032735000862"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001580"></a>Sarah

shall move
on.</div><a name="09032735000864"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments deal with membership of the children&#146;s trust, which
organisations should be placed under a statutory duty to co-operate
with the partnership as relevant partners and which should not. As the
children&#146;s trust is fundamentally about bringing together all
those with an interest in children&#146;s well-being, we naturally
take an inclusive
view.</div><a name="09032735000865"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that it is important that the organisations listed in amendments
195 and 367 are part of the co-operation arrangements. Sure Start
children&#146;s centres are already represented by their constituent
partners&#151;the local authority, the primary care trust and
Jobcentre Plus. We also plan to legislate for the children&#146;s
trust board to consult the advisory board of each children&#146;s
centre in the local area when preparing a children and young
people&#146;s plan. We are confident, therefore, that the interests
of children&#146;s centres and of the parents and children that they
serve will continue to be
represented.</div><a name="09032735000866"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001581"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I hear what the Minister says, but why is she
going to such great lengths to put children&#146;s centres at
arm&#146;s length from children&#146;s trust boards, when clear
evidence came through from her departmental consultation that the
relationship should be much closer? What is the basic reason for not
making the centres a partner in children&#146;s trust
boards?</div><a name="09032735000867"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001582"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The constituent partners and those with
responsibility for children&#146;s centres&#151;the local
authority, the primary care trust and Jobcentre Plus&#151;are already
relevant partners, so it is not necessary to have those in as
well.</div><a name="09032735000868"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a large range of private, voluntary and independent providers of
extended school services to schools. Many are already actively involved
in the work of the children&#146;s trust. The clause will for the
first time allow them to become members of the children&#146;s trust
board by local agreement. We can see value in seeking to place their
membership on a statutory footing, but it would be difficult to do so
without requiring that all PVI providers be directly represented, which
could create practical difficulties and hinder the effective operation
of the
trusts.</div><a name="09032735000869"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
mentioned GPs, who of course have an important role to play, but they
are a varied group of independent contractors. As with the PVI
providers, making them relevant partners would not be an effective way
of engaging them at this time. However, once new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column722" />Column number: 722</div>arrangements for children&#146;s trusts have settled down, we intend
to identify and share best practice to make sure that the work of GPs
is effectively embedded in the children&#146;s trust. In the interim,
we have strengthened the statutory guidance to make it explicit that we
expect children&#146;s trusts to consider inviting individual GPs,
members of the professional executive of the PCT or representation from
a practice-based commissioning group to be part of the
children&#146;s trust using the flexibilities of section 10(1)(c) of
the Children Act 2004 and clause 185(2) of the
Bill.</div><a name="09032735000870"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to both hon. Ladies, the particular needs of pupils in pupil
referral units or short-stay schools are taken into account in the work
of the trust, as they should be. We expect that to be happening
already.</div><a name="09032735000871"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001583"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The Minister said, &#147;We expect&#148; that
to be already happening. I am sure that there are many things that we
expect should be happening, and perhaps in some areas such things are
happening, but the Audit Commission report would suggest that
implementation of the children&#146;s trust boards has been patchy.
Is the Minister happy to say about something as important as pupil
referral units that she simply hopes that it happens on the
ground?</div><a name="09032735000872"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001584"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The hon. Lady jumped in a little
precipitately&#151;I have not finished my remarks on short-stay
schools or pupil referral units. We had thought that making them
relevant partners would be unnecessary, as they are part of the local
authority, not separate legal identities, so the interests of pupils
would be represented by the local authority. However, in view of the
strength of feeling on the issue, I am pleased to confirm today that we
now propose to use regulation-making powers under paragraph 3 of
schedule 1 to the Education Act 1996 to apply also to PRUs the
requirement on schools to become relevant partners. We consider it more
sensible to use that existing power, rather than to list PRUs in the
Bill, as it will enable the requirement on PRUs to be modified in a way
that reflects their
position.</div><a name="09032735000873"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I understand the motivation behind amendment 75&#151;that membership
of the children&#146;s trust will mean that academies and other
schools lose their independence&#151;we think that some things are
just too important for academies not to be involved in them, and the
children&#146;s trust is one of them. The aim is not to fetter the
autonomy of academies or to extend the control of the local authority
over them&#151;far from it. Making academies relevant partners and
members of the children&#146;s trust board gives them a seat at the
table as an equal partner when strategic decisions about local
children&#146;s services are made. This is an empowering measure, not
a disempowering one. Academies can add their voices to local decision
making about how resources are used, what services are prioritised and
how they are commissioned&#151;decisions that directly affect the
support services available to their
pupils.</div><a name="09032735000874"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
legislation requires partnership working, but in most cases academies
are already working with a range of local partners for the good of
their pupils. Because of their location and history, academies are
already working with some of the least advantaged children in our
communities. By working closely with other partners in the
children&#146;s trust, academies and others will be better placed to
obtain the right support for their pupils from the right partners at
the right time.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column723" />Column number: 723</div><a name="09032735000875"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned housing. Of course we
recognise the importance of good housing to the well-being of children,
young people and their families. We fully support the aim of ensuring
that housing is fully plugged into the work of the children&#146;s
trust, but we do not necessarily see how we could make such bodies
relevant partners. District councils, which have responsibility for
housing in two-tier authorities, are already relevant partners of the
children&#146;s
trust.</div><a name="09032735000876"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001585"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Part of my constituency is covered by a county
council and district councils. I cannot tell hon. Members how difficult
it is to secure housing for families with special needs. It takes the
intervention of someone such as me to bring the parties together. That
desperately needs to be
addressed.</div><a name="09032735000877"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001586"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I was going to move on to say that district
authorities are already relevant partners. However, registered social
landlords, which I think the hon. Lady also mentioned, do not need to
become statutory relevant partners to become part of the
children&#146;s trust. Their inclusion can be negotiated locally.
Section 10(1)(c) of the Children Act 2004 already provides the
flexibility for them to join the children&#146;s trust, and proposed
new section 12A(3) of that Act, inserted by clause 185(2), extends the
same flexibility to membership of the children&#146;s trust
board.</div><a name="09032735000878"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the indicative regulations make clear, we intend to say in the new
regulations governing the new joint children and young people&#146;s
plan that children&#146;s trust boards will need to consult all
social housing providers in preparing that
plan.</div><a name="09032735000879"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise to the Committee. I misattributed to Caroline Abrahams the
quote that I read out
saying:</div><a name="09032735001198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
development of our school and community early-intervention teams. All
the agencies put their resources in. It would not have happened without
our children&#146;s
trust.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000880"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
quote was actually from the Audit Commission report. I wanted to put
that right on the
record.</div><a name="09032735000881"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis of the assurances that I have given the hon. Members for
Basingstoke and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and particularly the
Government&#146;s commitment to introducing secondary legislation in
respect of PRUs, I hope that they will be prepared to withdraw or not
press all three
amendments.</div><a name="09032735000882"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001587"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for her response and for
giving way a little on at least one of the points that we raised. I am
pleased to hear that she understands the strength of feeling behind the
argument for including pupil referral units and I look forward to
seeing the secondary legislation, although it is a little tiresome that
that has not been sorted out before now. It was clear from the initial
papers that the Department issued, well in advance of the Bill&#146;s
publication, that pupil referral units should be included and it seems
rather late in the day for the Government to be changing their mind
now, but I suppose we should be thankful for the
change.</div><a name="09032735000883"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am still not convinced by the Minister&#146;s saying that the
constituent parts of a children&#146;s centre will be represented on
children&#146;s trust boards but not the children&#146;s centre
itself. Surely it is the children&#146;s centre management that
drives the availability of local services through the children&#146;s
centre; and the management need to be there to hear about the long-term
planning for local services 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column724" />Column number: 724</div>in order to ensure that those services are made available through the
local children&#146;s centre. I do not understand the
Minister&#146;s logic.</div>
<a name="09032735000884"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
I understand the problem of trying to galvanise all local GPs to become
involved in the local children&#146;s centre. I am sure that most
areas, like my constituency, have a management group for GPs, with a
lead general practitioner who can easily become involved in the
deliberations of the children&#146;s trust board. Again, I believe
that the Minister will have further ideas for regulations on how to
involve these people. It is important to have the right people at the
table if we are to make those bodies work. That is particularly so when
it comes to help; we all know of the problem of involving our local
health care services in the children&#146;s trust boards.</div>
<a name="09032735000885"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not
hear a response from the Minister to my request to clarify what her
colleagues in the Department of Health meant when they said in a recent
consultation that someone for vulnerable children would be on the
children&#146;s trust board. She may want to make it clear
now.</div>
<a name="09032735000886"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001588"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for giving way. It is
our intention that the interests of vulnerable children should be
represented by all the partners on the board. I am sure that the hon.
Lady will agree that they will need to take a partnership approach to
such complex problems. When it comes to vulnerable children, we are not
dealing only with health.</div>
<a name="09032735000887"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001589"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for making that clear.
However, making everyone responsible may mean that no one is
responsible. Given that Lord Laming indicated that a regular report
should be given to the children&#146;s trust boards on vulnerable
children, the Minister may need to clarify further how it is to work.
If every member is responsible, it is possible that no one will be
driving forward the agenda for vulnerable children. The matter may need
a little more thought.</div>
<a name="09032735000888"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was the
Government who established the academies, and it was the Government who
said that their autonomy and freedoms were absolutely vital. And it was
the Government who said that we should treat them differently from the
start, when they were introduced in Parliament. It is interesting that
those important freedoms are now being taken away. I cannot accept the
Minister&#146;s proposals. Things should be dealt with differently. I
am not in a position to withdraw the amendment. I shall probably press
it to a Division. I reserve the right to come back to amendment 195

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001604"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I beg to move amendment 211, in
clause 184, page 97, line 36, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(9A)
Arrangements under this section shall not diminish the powers of school
leaders in fulfilling their responsibilities for the day to day
management of their
school.&#146;.</div><a name="09032735000910"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is designed to ensure that the role of being a relevant
partner does not detract from head teachers&#146; prime
responsibility, which is about managing schools. This point was very
well made by one of our witnesses, Daniel Moynihan, from the Harris
Federation of south London schools. To remind the Committee of the
strength of his argument, he
said:</div><a name="09032735001199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Co-operating
with children&#146;s trusts is a very good principle, as long as
children&#146;s trusts focus on integrating services and making them
available, in an easy way, to individual students. If it takes away the
freedom of head teachers to be responsible and accountable for running
their schools, that would not be such a good
thing.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 44,
Q107.]</div><a name="09032735000911"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an important point to consider as we look at the remaining clauses
in this part of the Bill. Dr. Moynihan said that there were issues that
needed clarification. Perhaps the Minister could take the opportunity
to tell us how the Bill sets out to ensure that this new requirement on
head teachers does not detract from their responsibility in managing
schools. This is a point that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole hinted at in her intervention on me just before the break. Those
individuals who are running our schools have immense responsibilities
already. They have time commitments. They need to be at their schools
to ensure that they are running the way that we would expect them to
do.</div>
<a name="09032735000912"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know from
the Audit Commission and other reports that if we are going to have a
successful and effective network of children&#146;s trust boards,
those who are partners in the proceedings, whether they are head
teachers or other individuals, will have to give a considerable
personal commitment to ensure that children&#146;s trusts boards
operate effectively. How does the Minister intend to ensure that this
does not become burdensome for head teachers? Perhaps after hearing the
evidence of people like Dr. Moynihan she will be more sympathetic to
this
amendment.</div>
<a name="09032735000913"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001605"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Thank you, Mr. Chope. I hope that
we have all enjoyed some refreshment in our hour&#146;s
break.</div>
<a name="09032735000914"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
hon. Lady that I understand the concerns of the Association of School
and College Leaders and others about the clause. I am grateful for this
opportunity to reassure them that children&#146;s trusts are about
partnership working and not about surrendering autonomy. A significant
number of schools are already actively engaged in their local
children&#146;s trust without loss of power to run their own affairs.
I do not think that the police, the PCTs or any of the other current
relevant partners who have been under a duty to co-operate since 2005
would argue that they have lost autonomy. By bringing schools 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column726" />Column number: 726</div>more formally into the co-operation arrangements, the Government are
simply standardising existing good
practice.</div><a name="09032735000915"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
duty to co-operate will enable schools to combine forces and work with
other children&#146;s trust partners by consent and negotiation to
tackle cross-cutting issues and ensure that children and young people
in their areas receive the best possible services. Importantly, they
will have an equal voice on the children&#146;s trust. Schools will
be represented on the children&#146;s trust board and not all schools
will need to attend every
meeting.</div><a name="09032735000916"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools
will influence the children and young people&#146;s plan by saying
how and what they will contribute to the overall strategy. Yes, the
children&#146;s trust board will monitor how effectively schools have
been meeting that commitment, but only in respect of the specific
individual commitments they have made to the areas of joint activity
covered by the plan. Likewise, schools will participate in monitoring
and reporting on the compliance of other members on their individual
commitments.</div><a name="09032735000917"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
people have said that we should be more directive and more prescriptive
of trust board members, but we have resisted that. We believe that the
principle of consent is key to good partnership working. The clause
does not introduce any levers to allow children&#146;s trusts to
direct how schools should operate. Nor does it remove or take
precedence over any of the existing powers or duties of the head
teacher or governing body for running and managing the school. I hope
this demonstrates that schools have nothing to fear and everything to
gain from this new duty, and I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw
her
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000918"></a>

Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for her reply and for her
reassurance. From listening to what she said, the most important
element will be the chairmanship of children&#146;s trust boards,
because if the partners are to be involved in the parts of proceedings
that relate to them and their activities, it will be important that
they are well-managed organisations, effectively chaired, and that
people&#146;s time is managed in a good way. Hopefully, the Minister
will monitor that closely to make sure that schools are not
over-burdened in the way that perhaps some are concerned about. With
the reassurances that the Minister has given, and as long as she is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001609"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and
Holderness, who is not able to be with us at this point, summarised
well the Audit Commission&#146;s remarks about children&#146;s
trust boards when he said that to date they were perhaps well-attended
talking shops that are not delivering. They are &#147;talking
shops&#148; because they focus on process rather than improvements in
helping children to reach their potential; too many of those who attend
the meetings, according to the Audit Commission report, do not have the
necessary decision-making powers; and those who can make the decisions
choose not to be as involved in the work of children&#146;s trust
boards as perhaps they need to
be.</div><a name="09032735000924"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister is acutely aware that by putting
children&#146;s trust boards in their present form on a statutory
footing, it will not be a magic panacea for solving the problems. There
needs to be real reform, clarity in the role of the bodies and a change
in the way that they work to ensure that they are effective, nowhere
more so than in the role of the private, voluntary and independent
sector.</div><a name="09032735000925"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
190 seeks to put the involvement of the PVI sector on a more formal
footing to recognise the critical role in the commissioning of a range
of services, not just early years educational services but far more
than that. The amendment has been developed with the help of the
National Day Nurseries Association and with comments from the
Children&#146;s Services Development Group. It is not something put
forward by the official
Opposition.</div><a name="09032735000926"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
their comments following the publication of the Bill, the NDNA accepted
that PVI providers may not be full statutory partners but asked the
Government to underline to children&#146;s trusts the significance of
working in partnership with PVI providers who do so much to add value
to early years education, particularly in providing specialist support
for children with disabilities and special needs. As the
Children&#146;s Services Development Group highlighted in their
comments, the front-line delivery for measures laid out in children and
young people&#146;s plans will often be provided by the PVI sector,
whether it is services for children with special needs; residential and
foster care; placements for children in the care of the state;
extending schools provision, and the list goes on.</div>
<a name="09032735000927"></a><div class="hs_Para">While it may
not be necessary to place the partnership working with the PVI sector
on a statutory footing in the more formal way that we discussed under
the earlier clauses, there is a need to consider it and to look at it
further. Indeed, many PVI providers would find it difficult to become
true partners in the sense set out previously in the Bill because many
would have difficulty attending the number of meetings involved in
becoming a partner on a children&#146;s trust board. We need to have
a clear pointer to children&#146;s trust boards indicating that the
PVI sector is absolutely key, particularly when planning for the
future, and that is not just for the implementation of plans that have
been put forward, but also for plans that have been developed for the
future provision of services.</div>
<a name="09032735000928"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
useful provision in section 8 of the Childcare Act 2006 relating to the
general functions of local authorities, which are set out in part 1 of
that Act, and it promotes a notion that, in securing sufficient
early-years provision in education, local authorities should first seek
partnerships with existing PVI providers, rather than directly setting
up their own maintained provision. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column728" />Column number: 728</div>Perhaps a similar approach by children&#146;s trust boards would help
to recognise the significant role the sector has to play in improving
our children&#146;s life chances.</div>
<a name="09032735000929"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 191
touches on the issue of pooled funding, and there are clear provisions
in the Bill enabling children&#146;s trust boards to improve services
by pooling their funding, and that is a move in the right direction
that will hopefully overcome the technical accounting problems that
some children&#146;s trust boards have experienced to date. If
children&#146;s trust boards are to be the success that we all need
them to be, surely there must be some surety in those funding streams.
I have heard examples of money being pooled, or at least the feeling
was that money had been pooled by several organisations, only to find
some way down the line that that money was not as forthcoming as had
perhaps been agreed. It would be helpful to have a provision in the
Bill indicating that a continual stream of funding is a good thing and
something that the children&#146;s trust boards should think about. I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s response because I think that the
amendments would add greatly to the way the Bill will
work.</div>
<a name="09032735000930"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001610"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I would like to comment first on children&#146;s
trust boards, which have now been put on a statutory basis. I cannot
find a clear definition anywhere in the Bill for their primary
function. One reference to children&#146;s trust boards, which was
possibly in regulation, mentioned that they relate to improving the
well-being of children and young people in that area. With something so
vague, it is difficult to measure outcomes. My general question is
whether there is a clear definition on their primary function that goes
beyond well-being and the five Every Child Matters outcomes so that we
really are clear about what they are trying to achieve.</div>
<a name="09032735000931"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment 190, I recall having a great discussion during the passage
of the Children Act 2004 on the role of the voluntary sector. Looking
back, I cannot see that that was included. Our discussion at the time
was about the voluntary sector not only being consulted within the
partnership, informally if not formally, but putting its services into
the pool. I cannot seem to relate the discussions we had all those
years ago with the Bill before us today. I obviously have sympathy for
both amendments, but that is because I cannot see what we discussed
previously. It makes a great deal of sense to ensure that the views of
voluntary and independent providers are taken into account. As the hon.
Member for Basingstoke has pointed out, there is a clear statement
within the 2006 Act on the provision of child care, taking on board
that important
sector.</div><a name="09032735000932"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
at amendment 191, I am less certain that it is necessary, given the
indicative guidance that the Minister sent us. In fact, the guidance
clearly identifies monetary payments, non-monetary resources, pooling
of resources and so
on.</div><a name="09032735000933"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I appreciate the point that the hon. Lady is making, that when it comes
down to it, money from the health sector must be made available. I am
not quite sure how we can put more pressure on so that, for example,
speech therapy, which may well be the responsibility of the health
sector, is made available, and money for respite care for severely
disabled children is made available. That pot of money comes from the
health sector as opposed to respite care money more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column729" />Column number: 729</div>generally, which comes from children&#146;s services. It is important
in a host of areas to ensure that the health money is
available.</div><a name="09032735000934"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am slightly doubtful about the amendment, but I certainly agree with
what it is trying to
do.</div><a name="09032735001237"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001611"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> First, a couple of general points. The hon.
Member for Basingstoke said that the children&#146;s trust board

Commission
report.</div><a name="09032735000936"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001612"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001613"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> No, it was the hon. Member for Beverley and
Holderness, in response to the Audit Commission report. As a result of
the changes made by the Bill, there is a definite job for the
children&#146;s trust board to do, which is to develop, review and
monitor the children and young people&#146;s plans. That will
probably mitigate them just being talked about, because there is a
definite job to
do.</div><a name="09032735000938"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, well-being
is defined in the 2006 Act as relating
to</div><a name="09032735001200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;physical
and mental health and emotional well-being...protection from harm
and neglect...education, training and recreation...the
contribution made by them to society...social and economic
well-being.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000939"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is also in the Children Act
2004.</div><a name="09032735000940"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 195, we agree that the private, voluntary and independent
sectors should be fully engaged in the strategic planning and
commissioning of services by partners represented on the
children&#146;s trust board. Their unique insight into what services
are needed to improve outcomes, especially for hard-to-reach groups, is
essential.</div><a name="09032735000941"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
flexibility to include bodies from those sectors as partners in the
children's trust already exists under section 10(1)(c) of the 2004 Act,
and this is a power that we reinforce in statutory guidance. Statutory
guidance already states that PVI providers must be represented at all
levels of the children&#146;s trust&#146;s activities. It also
urges local authorities to have regard to the views of PVI providers,
and local authorities must have a good reason to depart from the
guidance.</div><a name="09032735000942"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
supplementary guidance produced to accompany the new provisions in the
Bill, which we have shared with the Committee, will emphasise the
importance of the involvement of the PVI sectors in the
children&#146;s trust board itself. We believe that that is the best
way to overcome the practical and legal difficulties inherent in trying
to capture the array of private, voluntary and independent providers in
primary
legislation.</div><a name="09032735000943"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the sentiments behind amendment 191. Local partners have
sometimes been reluctant to use their current powers to pool budgets
and other resources, often due to uncertainty and a fear of excessive
bureaucracy. That is a shame, because where it has been done, it has
worked well. For example, pooled resources are often used to support
joint commissioning for teenage pregnancy
programmes.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column730" />Column number: 730</div><a name="09032735000944"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
aims to simplify the process of pooling funds but without adding the
element of compulsion that is proposed by the amendment. We believe
that the principle of consent remains key to effective partnership
working and to the success of the children's trust. It would also be
difficult to force the members of the board to give up part of their
budgets to be pooled for shared projects which either did not fit in
with their individual duties or responsibilities, or which they had not
agreed to participate in. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member
for Basingstoke will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000945"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001614"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Again, I thank the Minister for her response. I am
glad that she understands the point that I am making with amendment
191, particularly the need to have pooled funding to make
children&#146;s trust boards work. She is right that it is difficult
to legislate for that but unless we have full funding we will not see
the improvement in services that we all want. She seems assured that
the provisions in the Bill cut the bureaucracy associated with pooled
funding. However, I am not as confident as she is that that will
happen. Perhaps, with her words of understanding, I will withdraw my
amendment.</div>
<a name="09032735000946"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
amendment 190, the Minister has offered some reassurance to the
Committee. However, I am not sure how reassuring it is to say that
provisions are already available through the Childcare Act 2006 to
ensure that the PVI sector is involved. Clearly, the sector has not
been as involved as it wants to be. That is why organisations such as
the National Day Nurseries Association and the Children&#146;s
Services Development Group have come forward and been vocal on this
issue. I am less reassured on that matter, and would like to press the
amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="09032735000947"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001629"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I beg to move amendment 368, in
clause 185, page 100, line 40, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A)
Regulations under this section must specify
that&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) a children and
young people&#146;s plan deal with transport and travel
matters;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) a
Children&#146;s Trust Board consult the relevant local transport
authority.&#146;.</div><a name="09032735000966"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is possible that paragraph (b) will be picked up in the indicative
guidance, but I want to expand on paragraph (a), which is important.
This is a probing amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column731" />Column number: 731</div>and is designed to seek assurance from the Government that transport
will feature in the children and young people&#146;s plan. It is
important to have links with the local transport authority. When we
talk about local transport planning, we are referring to public bus,
rail travel, community transport, walking or cycling. Transport is an
integral part of children and young people&#146;s lives, enabling
them to access a range of services, facilities and experiences that
will help them to achieve the five Every Child Matters
outcomes.</div>
<a name="09032735000967"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one asks
young people what the biggest issues are that they want to talk about
and they want improvements on, it is always public transport.
Obviously, children and young people face such a large number of
barriers to travel, including safety, cost and availability in my area,
accessibility and attitude to those providing the services.
Interestingly, we have been talking about school travel and transport
for 14 to 19 education and positive activities, so we are looking to
ensure that the whole Bill takes that really important approach.
Partnership is important, because it involves all aspects of
children&#146;s lives and certainly affects all the five outcomes
from Every Child Matters.</div>
<a name="09032735000968"></a><div class="hs_Para">Importantly,
if transport were in the CYPP regulations, there would be a
co-ordinated approach to children and young people&#146;s travel and
ensure that transport was a primary consideration. By increasing
transport charges for young people, local authorities often make
decisions quite to the contrary of what is environmentally desirable.
It is also important to develop greater partnership-working across
children&#146;s services and other relevant local authority
functions. The Minister may reply, &#147;Well, local authorities have
a local transport plan,&#148; but I want services joined up, because
my experience is that transport thinks quite differently from
children&#146;s services. When I pursued inquiries, I was told,
&#147;That&#146;s transport,&#148; but that is not how it should
be; services should be integrated.</div>
<a name="09032735000969"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
also give children and young people a greater voice in influencing
transport planning. They have great ideas about what they want and, if,
as a consequence, a local authority and its partners were to come up
with some innovative solutions, such as blue bus services from villages
and special ticketing, that would be all to the good. So, I hope that
the Minister can reassure us that this matter will not be a separate
item in the local transport plan, but will be pulled into the children
and young people&#146;s plan.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001630"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I support the amendment that the hon. Lady has
just discussed. From my experience as a Member for a constituency that
covers rural and suburban areas, I know the problems that many young
people face when they try to access after-school clubs and extended
school services: the lack of an effective transport link can stop
children accessing the services that they need. The hon. Lady makes a
very powerful point that transport can be a great barrier for young
people from a very young age, and I urge the Minister to consider the
hon. Lady&#146;s comments closely.</div>
<a name="09032735000971"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001631"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The children and young people&#146;s plan
will, among other things, set out how the relevant partners will come
together to deliver certain joint services to children, young people
and their parents. The Government recognise the importance of good
transport provision for children and young people to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column732" />Column number: 732</div>enable them to access such services. I am happy to assure the Committee
that the guidance on the production of the plan will make it clear that
the children&#146;s trust board should consider transport matters as
part of the plan&#146;s development. Although that is separate from
local authorities&#146; wider transport duties, such as transport to
school, local authorities&#146; wider responsibilities in that area
should help inform the children&#146;s trust board&#146;s
consideration of transport matters.</div>
<a name="09032735000972"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
areas, some transport strategy is set by the passenger transport
authority and implemented by  the local passenger transport
executive, but we expect the children&#146;s trust board to consult
them when preparing the CYPP. We also intend the board to consult
children and young people themselves, allowing them to respond on all
issues, including transport. If members of a children&#146;s trust
board identify transport for children and young people as a shared
priority locally, there is nothing stopping them from developing a
co-ordinated approach to transport locally, although, again, that would
be a matter for local determination.</div>
<a name="09032735000973"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
on the basis of my assurance that transport will be covered in
regulations and guidance, the hon. Lady will be prepared to withdraw
her amendment.</div>
<a name="09032735000974"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001632"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister for her remarks. She has
provided a certain amount of reassurance. I notice that children and
young people&#146;s plans will have to take the matter into account
but will not necessarily have any policy within them. So I ask the
Minister to reflect further to see whether anything stronger than just
saying the matter will be taken into account could be considered, but
at this stage I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032735000975"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001633"></a>Mrs.

clause 185, page 101, line 13, at

implementation of strategies set out in the children and young

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001634"></a>The

amendment 192, in

Director of the Children&#146;s Services Authority shall be

bodies.&#146;.</div><a name="09032735000978"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001635"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> As I said my opening comments on the clause, I am
sure that the Minister does not think that simply placing a body such
as a children&#146;s trust board on a statutory footing would address
all the problems that such organisations have faced over the past few
years. However, on examining the detail in the Bill it is difficult to
pick out where the changes have been made to ensure that
children&#146;s trust boards move
forward.</div><a name="09032735000979"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned the important role of those boards in terms of
children and young people&#146;s plans, but I am sure that she has
made herself aware of the comments of Lord Laming in his most recent
report on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column733" />Column number: 733</div>children and young people&#146;s plans. I will quote a section from
that report, in case Committee members have not had the chance to
review
it:</div><a name="09032735001201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is not clear that the quality of the analyses underpinning
current&#148;</div><a name="09032735000980"></a><div class="hs_Para">children
and young people&#146;s
plans</div><a name="09032735001202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
of a consistently high level nationally to drive the resourcing of
services to meet the needs of all children. Further work should now be
done at local, regional and national levels, to improve the quality of
data on levels of need amongst children and young people, and local
authorities should formally reconsider the adequacy of their budgetary
commitment.&#148;</div><a name="09032735000981"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
there is some work to do in that area, too. I am sure that the Minister
will want to update us, in her response to the two amendments, on how
she plans to address Lord Laming&#146;s concern about the quality of
children and young people&#146;s plans, because producing the plan is
only the beginning and not an end in
itself.</div><a name="09032735000982"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill does not make a lot of things clear. The hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole is right to say that the objective behind
children&#146;s trust boards is not as clear as it might be in the
Bill. I would go further than that. The Bill also fails to make it
clear that partners not only need to have regard to the children and
young people&#146;s plan in exercising their duties, but that they
should be monitoring whether those plans are having material effect.
Surely, to have real teeth the role of a children&#146;s trust board
has to be more than just monitoring whether partners are acting in
accordance with the plan. If we are to get to the table the people who
really make the decisions, children&#146;s trust boards need to be an
integral part of raising standards for children&#146;s services, not
just bodies monitoring compliance, which is what they appear to be set
up to do in the
Bill.</div><a name="09032735000983"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should be assessing whether the right thing is being done to raise
standards for children and ensuring that the role and the work of
children&#146;s trust boards is improving young people&#146;s
lives. If those boards do not take on that role, I fear that the
improvements made will be more limited than they need to be. How will
children and young people&#146;s plans be part of a process of
continual improvement, rather than something more static, as suggested
in the
Bill?</div><a name="09032735000984"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
193 attempts to deal with monitoring effectiveness and accountability
by explicitly placing in the Bill a need for children&#146;s trust
boards to monitor the way that children and young people&#146;s plans
have made a material improvement to children&#146;s lives. It
includes a requirement for the boards to issue an annual report
detailing the impact of outcomes on children, rather than just
monitoring the compliance of the partners. That report will be sent on
to relevant partners to&#151;hopefully&#151;elicit a formal
response. Again, more must be done to try to involve our health
partners in focusing on the role of children&#146;s trust boards. If
we do not want those boards to be talking shops, as the Minister has
made clear she does not, we need to give them an active, not passive,
role in this
area.</div><a name="09032735000985"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
192 is designed to give children&#146;s trust boards a powerful ally
with a shared ambition, and to try to clarify, perhaps, exactly where
the buck stops. It is clear that responsibility for the implementation
of children and young people&#146;s plans has to lie with
children&#146;s services directors and the members in that area.
However, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column734" />Column number: 734</div>again, that is not clearly expressed in the Bill. The amendment is
designed to put that clarity in the Bill. It also picks up on more
remarks made in the Laming report on the importance of holding
children&#146;s trust boards to account and the need for a clearer,
more direct link with local authority children&#146;s
services.</div><a name="09032735000986"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001636"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I certainly support the principles behind
amendment 193. We clearly need a monitoring of the outcomes and it
would be helpful to define exactly what the monitoring will be. We need
to be clear that it will not just be a case of making vague statements
that children&#146;s well-being has to improve, because that is not
tight enough. We need something specific in this area. I also like the
fact that the amendment refers to</div>
<a name="09032735001203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;improved
outcomes for children and
families&#148;.</div><a name="09032735000987"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an important
contribution.</div><a name="09032735000988"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall say a little more on amendment 192 because, as is evident from
the sessions that we had before we started formal scrutiny of the Bill,
I am concerned that the changes might mean that we will lose a clear
line of accountability. In fact, I asked that very question of
Councillor Les Lawrence, who was clear that the statutory body was
essential. On accountability, he said that although the ownership was
shared across all the public agencies,</div>
<a name="09032735001204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am the
elected member in the locality with a statutory duty; that is enshrined
in the Children Act 2004. I have no problem in accepting that
responsibility&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 55,
Q150.]</div><a name="09032735000989"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the thrust of the answers given in that evidence session.</div>
<a name="09032735000990"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
that the new set-up could mean that we lose such great clarity. I have
found reading the indicative guidance interesting, because it asks how
the CTB and its members will be accountable for their actions. We are
told that there will be a great deal of guidance, and that the CTB will
be responsible for producing and monitoring children and young
people&#146;s plans. However, the individual members of the CTB will
continue to be accountable for delivering their contribution to the
overall plan and for fulfilling their own functions. That is
interesting because it is hidden in the new notes that we had this
week.</div><a name="09032735000991"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, I asked a question of someone in the health sector during the
Select Committee last week and I was also given the answer that
individual bodies will be accountable for their sections in the plan.
It gets tricky when there is more than one partner involved with a
particular section of the plan. How are we going to make it clear who
is accountable for what when we hope to have close partnership working?
How is the responsibility divided up? I look to the Minister for some
answers.</div><a name="09032735000992"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001637"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> On amendment 193, I assure hon. Members that
I fully support the importance of making sure that the
children&#146;s trust board holds its individual members to account.
However, the Bill as drafted already achieves that. The Bill requires
the children&#146;s trust board to prepare, publish, monitor and
review a joint children and young people&#146;s plan, but
responsibility for the implementation of the strategy set out in the
plan continues to lie with the individual 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column735" />Column number: 735</div>partners. Each is responsible for their own role within it and for their
individual contribution to the delivery of shared outcomes.</div>
<a name="09032735000993"></a><div class="hs_Para">The plan will
set out board members&#146; strategy for co-operating with each other
in order to improve the well-being of children and young people in the
local area. The board is already required to monitor and report
annually on the extent to which partners are acting in accordance with
the plan. If partners fail to honour their commitments to co-operate to
improve well-being for children, they will need to explain why to their
fellow members. That way, the Bill will ensure that the contribution of
individual board members is monitored and challenged, and that results
are made public through the annual report on
compliance.</div><a name="09032735000994"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
192 would give the director of children&#146;s services the single,
ultimate responsibility for implementing the children and young
people&#146;s plan. I appreciate that hon. Members are concerned
about ensuring that someone is leading and driving the system, but I am
worried that the amendment would work against the improved partnership
working that the Bill seeks to deliver. Responsibility for a local
area&#146;s children and young people&#146;s plan lies with the
local authority, so, while the plan may describe joint strategies with
other partners, the local authority alone is accountable for its
success, and no other partners have to take on any responsibility for
agreeing or delivering an integrated strategy for improving
children&#146;s well-being.</div>
<a name="09032735000995"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
local authority will retain a key leadership role, and the director of
children&#146;s services will be accountable for the establishment of
the board itself, the children and young people&#146;s plan will be
the shared responsibility of members of the children&#146;s trust
board. The board as a whole will be responsible for publishing and
revising the plan and for monitoring its members&#146; compliance. We
hope that greater ownership will increase commitment, but, just to be
sure, it will be backed up by the system of peer and public
accountability that I have described.</div>
<a name="09032735000996"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measures
strengthen the children&#146;s trust board and extend responsibility
for the children and young people&#146;s plan to the partners,
through their membership of the board. Those are important steps
forward in genuinely integrating services around the needs of the
child. My worry is that amendment 192 would reverse those changes and
would be counter-productive. I hope that the hon. Member for
Basingstoke will not press her
amendments.</div><a name="09032735000997"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001638"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I am minded not to press the amendments at the
moment, but I am not sure that the Minister has answered in full the
issues raised by me and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole.
I am rather concerned that the Minister has not really got the point of
amendment 193. It sounds as though she still sees the children&#146;s
trust board as a way of simply co-ordinating different activities,
rather than of trying to drive an improvement in the lives of children
in our community. There is a difference between those two things. If we
are to have a children and young people&#146;s plan that improves
every year, getting better each time a new plan is made, the boards
need a broader role in assessing its
effectiveness.</div><a name="09032735000998"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001639"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I may be able to clarify something for the
hon. Lady. She asked about Laming&#146;s concerns, to which I did not
respond. It is important to point out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column736" />Column number: 736</div>that the quality and impact of the children and young people&#146;s
plan will be monitored through the comprehensive area assessment
process. The first CAA reports, which are due in November 2009, will
assess children&#146;s services in the round, drawing on the children
and young people&#146;s plan, among other evidence. If the CAA
highlights any concerns about partnership working, section 20 of the
Children Act 2004, which is extended by clause 185(5), provides for
inspection of the children&#146;s trust board in more
detail.</div><a name="09032735000999"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001640"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for covering that point,
which I was going to come to. However, improving the quality of
children and young people&#146;s plans is only the first step in
trying to improve the lives of and outcomes for children in our
communities. I remain concerned that the board will be a somewhat
passive partner in the process, when what we need in our communities is
an active driving force that understands what works, what does not,
where we should put our money, and how we should deploy our resources.
I am still unsure that that is there, so I need to think about this a
little more and consider the Minister&#146;s comments in a bit more
detail.</div>
<a name="09032735001000"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am equally
concerned that the individual responsibility aspect of amendment 192
worries the Minister, because the idea of the buck stopping with one
individual does not worry me. Again, I need to ponder further her
comments about there being shared responsibility throughout the board,
because that will make leadership quite difficult. If there are a
number of people, who might change over time and who might represent a
multitude of different organisations, where will the leadership come
from? If things go wrong, who will take responsibility? Those are the
sorts of things that our constituents will want to know. I shall not
press the amendment to a vote, but I reserve the right to return to the
matter at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032735001001"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Sharon Hodgson</b> (Gateshead, East and Washington, West)
(Lab): I do not want to delay the Committee for long&#151;I
shall take only about three minutes&#151;because I am aware that we
have a long night ahead of us, and what I want to say is a drop in the
ocean compared with what is facing us. Some of the amendments to the
clause relate to the breadth of consultation that the Government would
be required to undertake. I know that whenever changes are made, an
inevitable cacophony of voices clamour to be heard, and we have heard
some of them tonight. I shall briefly state the case for the voice of
local authorities to be recognised, not just as influential partners in
delivery, but as democratically accountable elected
bodies.</div><a name="09032735001239"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
pm</div><a name="09032735001005"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
LGA stated in representations that it welcomes the clear placement of
local authorities in the lead on the 16 to 19 learning agenda, and the
reiteration of their centrality and planning in commissioning
children&#146;s services more widely. The premise must be that they
should focus on the complete needs of individual young 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column737" />Column number: 737</div>people so that local authorities and other partners can best support
them in the
round.</div><a name="09032735001006"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is concern that clause 185(2) on the functions and procedures of
children&#146;s trust boards should require consultation. The Bill
sets up complex commissioning arrangements and accountability in
relation to several aspects of planning and delivery at which local
authorities are at the heart. If they are to fulfil their
accountability effectively and ensure that young people receive the
best education, training and support, the Bill in its full extent
should require explicit liaison and consultation between them, the
Secretary of State, Skills Funding, the Young People&#146;s Learning
Agency, and for the avoidance of
micromanagement.</div><a name="09032735001007"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
LGA believes that the key areas for consultation should be the
functions and procedures of children&#146;s trust boards with any
additions to the remits of the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency or
Skills Funding, any commissioning functions with implications for
financial criteria, funding formula or place planning, and any
performance management or intervention functions, either with regard to
local authorities or to those bodies commissioned by local authorities
to deliver outcomes for young people. Information should be provided
and there should be discussions with the Secretary of State before
requesting that a warning notice be issued to a
school.</div><a name="09032735001008"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
such commitments to consultation, there could be considerable scope for
unintended consequences, as I am sure the Minister can imagine. In case
she cannot, I will highlight one. On performance systems, the ticking
of boxes would fail to hold to account or challenge the delivery of key
outcomes for young people, and that ties in nicely with what the hon.
Member for Basingstoke alluded to. With that in mind, will the Minister
address the local government sector&#146;s concerns, perhaps through
the LGA, and ensure that the Bill provides for proper consultation with
local authorities on key issues and, if necessary, to introduce
amendments on Report to ensure that such liaison and consultation is a
statutory
requirement?</div><a name="09032735001009"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
said that I wanted to be brief, and in closing I do not want to suggest
that we should provide carte blanche for demands for statutory
recognition of the right to consultation. The Minister may agree that
local authorities could use their existing links, perhaps with private
and independent bodies, to ensure appropriate consultation with those
bodies.</div><a name="09032735001010"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001642"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Establishing children&#146;s trust boards as a
statutory body is important, and their performance to date merits our
discussions to try to ensure that as we move forward they can do a
better job. It is disappointing that the Government chose to put
important proposals on children&#146;s centres, nursery funding and
the early years foundation stage in a Bill that is predominately about
other areas of education. It has meant that the debate on those matters
has been overshadowed and curtailed. There was not really an
opportunity in the evidence sessions to involve a number of witnesses
who perhaps would have liked to have contributed on those
issues.</div>
<a name="09032735001011"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this stand
part debate I would like to raise three specific points that we have
not covered: the relationship between children&#146;s trust boards
and other local strategic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column738" />Column number: 738</div>organisations; the importance of giving young people a voice in
proceedings; and the importance of ensuring the strategic involvement
of health in the work of children&#146;s trust
boards.</div><a name="09032735001012"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
taking the issue of how children&#146;s trust boards relate to other
local strategic organisations, there was very little in the
consultation to clarify the relationship between the boards and the
plethora of organisations that appear to operate within a community.
Issues around the structure of children&#146;s trusts and local
safeguarding boards were detailed in Lord Laming&#146;s most recent
report, issued in March, particularly the idea that local safeguarding
children boards should report to the children&#146;s trust. The
Government have said that they will adopt his report in full, and I
would like to hear from the Minister today exactly how that measure
will affect children&#146;s trust
boards.</div><a name="09032735001013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Audit Commission noted that cross working among organisations can
create complexity, ambiguity and confusion. It particularly focused on
problems in the relationship between local strategic partnerships and
children&#146;s trust boards, and recommended, in a lot of detail,
how the roles could be integrated and made more consistent. Have the
Government adopted the proposals? It is not clear from the Bill that
that has happened. Should it be made clearer in the Bill, so that there
is a clear template of operation for organisations on the ground? Will
it be tackled in regulations? Could the Minister bring the Committee up
to date on the Government&#146;s thinking?</div>
<a name="09032735001014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
involving young people in the development of children and young
people&#146;s plans is important. Obviously, this is an opportunity
to reiterate importance of consulting young people on the plans when
they are developed and the importance of ensuring that those plans are
readily available to them when finalised. I and, I am sure, other hon.
Members on the Committee have been contacted by organisations such as
Participation Works about that. Can the Minister reassure the Committee
that that matter will be addressed? If children and young
people&#146;s plans are to be more effective, as Lord Laming&#146;s
report suggested needs to happen, surely the Government need to
advocate the explicit involvement of young people.</div>
<a name="09032735001015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it
is important to ensure the strategic involvement of health in the work
of children&#146;s trust boards. For many of us on the Committee,
that issue is the elephant in the room when it comes to
children&#146;s trust boards. All of us have experienced, either
directly in our constituencies or indirectly, the problems that
organisations can have in involving health effectively.
Children&#146;s trust boards have had that problem as well. We can
have all the organisational plans in the world, but if the most
important strategic partner&#151;health&#151;is not fully
supportive, fully engaged and ready to put its money where its mouth
is, children&#146;s trust boards will not succeed.</div>
<a name="09032735001016"></a><div class="hs_Para">How can the
Minister assure us today that health is fully engaged, that the right
people will come to the table and that the chief executive of every PCT
will see children&#146;s trust boards as something that they should
prioritise?</div><a name="09032735001017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001643"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I shall be brief and, I hope, not repetitive. The
issue is about making children&#146;s trust boards statutory. I have
to comment that making something 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column739" />Column number: 739</div>statutory is not necessarily going to improve partnership
working&#151;the will on the ground has to be there.
Children&#146;s trusts are the only in option in town because Lord
Laming&#146;s review, which was a good job considering how little
time he had, looked at the existing structure rather than outside it
where more necessary change might be needed. As I continually point
out, adult social services are outside the loop and need to be more
central because they work with
families.</div><a name="09032735001018"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis that making children&#146;s trust boards statutory will
probably not do any harm, we have to proceed with it. The Audit
Commission&#146;s report showed very clearly how patchy the situation
is with children&#146;s trusts. That situation arose because the
trusts did things any way that they liked and never undertook a single
model, or even a group of models. Many different ways have been
undertaken, and it is now a matter of honing in and spreading best
practice that really works. We have been trying to implement that over
a long period and, according to the Audit Commission, have not made
much progress. What will the Minister do to spread some of the good
practice identified by the commission&#146;s report? Different
authorities have been handling their partnerships in different ways,
which is complicated, and those authorities have to face up to actually
modelling their own particular structures to make this work. That does
not necessarily have to be dictated, but there needs to be leadership
to ensure that everything
works.</div><a name="09032735001019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must also mention health, because it has clearly been the biggest
stumbling block. It is uncertain whether it has been holding on to
scarce money, and it is a problem because the Government are setting
targets for primary care trusts, which, so they tell us, have not had
funds to put into the pool, that differ from those set for
children&#146;s trusts. I hope that the children&#146;s health
strategy will make a difference, and we need to ensure that there is
leadership in place to make it work. I also emphasise the need for full
participation that involves children and young people in particular,
not just articulate groups or a select few; we need to get the views of
a cross-section of children and young
people.</div><a name="09032735001020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001644"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I will first respond to my hon. Friend the
Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West, who talked about
consultation in a general way. There was a three-month consultation on
the legislative proposals during the summer, and we will of course
consult formally on the guidance and regulations in relation to the
Bill and ensure that the Local Government Association and others are
included in
that.</div><a name="09032735001021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will return to the issue of warning notices to schools and local
education authorities when we come to part
10.</div><a name="09032735001022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001645"></a>Mrs.
Hodgson:</b> In case I did not make myself clear, I did not
mean the consultation prior to the Bill, but the consultation once the
Bill has been through Parliament and become law. In other words,
ongoing
consultation.</div><a name="09032735001023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001646"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> That is why I am confused. My hon. Friend
talked about consultation with local authorities, but they will
actually be the driving force of the children&#146;s trust boards
because it is the director of children&#146;s services responsibility
to set up those boards.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column740" />Column number: 740</div><a name="09032735001024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001647"></a>Mrs.
Hodgson:</b> Will elected members have a position on the
boards?</div><a name="09032735001025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001648"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It will be for local authorities to decide
whether they want an elected member on, consulting with or giving
advice to their
board.</div><a name="09032735001026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Basingstoke claims that the Bill concentrates far too
much on other aspects of education and that the issue of
children&#146;s centres has been sidelined. The Bill is actually, in
part, about increasing local ownership and the integration of education
and services to children. The devolution of &#163;7 billion of
funding to local authorities and the creation of a single point of
accountability for all children and young people, from nought to 19,
was one measure of that, and what we are doing with children&#146;s
trust boards and children and young person&#146;s plans is another.
To use a word that we heard earlier, there is a coherence to the Bill,
even if the hon. Lady does not agree.</div>
<a name="09032735001240"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9
pm</div><a name="09032735001027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a duty to make co-operation arrangements to involve
children&#146;s well-being and children&#146;s trusts in section 10
of the Children Act 2004. Since then, we have made significant progress
in developing the ability of partners to work together. As hon. Members
have said, progress overall has been uneven and the provisions in the
clause are aimed at rectifying that unevenness.</div>
<a name="09032735001028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
embed the proven good practice that we have seen around the country
into all children&#146;s trusts. Having an effective
children&#146;s trust board is important. Many children&#146;s
trusts already have that, but the clause reinforces that by placing the
children&#146;s trust board on a firmer statutory footing. It also
gives the children&#146;s trust board the responsibility for
producing, publishing, reviewing and implementing&#151;looking at
outcomes of the children and young person&#146;s plan.</div>
<a name="09032735001029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Current
legislation already requires most local areas to have a strategic
overarching children and young person&#146;s plan that sets out how
the partners will improve outcomes. That responsibility currently lies
with the local authority alone. We think that placing responsibility
for the plan with the board will be a power boost to local partnership
working.</div>
<a name="09032735001030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There were a
few questions about the involvement of children and young people. My
hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West and the
hon. Member for Basingstoke both spoke about that, and we place great
value on hearing the views of children and young people about the
issues that affect them. The children and young person&#146;s plan is
currently the responsibility of the local authority. Regulations
already require local authorities to consult children and young people
when drawing up their plan, and the guidance suggests ways of doing
that through youth parliaments and councils, for example, school
councils or children in care councils. Those have already proved to be
an effective means of communicating the necessity of engaging with
children and young people to local areas.</div>
<a name="09032735001031"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
specific question relating to local safeguarding children&#146;s
boards, and the recommendations of Lord Laming. As the hon. Member for
Basingstoke said, we have accepted Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations
on that point, but we need further work and consideration, and to have
more consultation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column741" />Column number: 741</div><a name="09032735001032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Health is of
prime importance and a key issue. That is why the PCT was originally a
relevant partner. Increasingly, primary care trusts must work with
local authorities to deliver their own priorities. Performance
management systems are converging, and they must complete a joint
strategic needs assessment. The NHS operating framework 2008-09
specifically identifies child health as a priority. As the hon. Lady
said, there is only so much that we can do through legislation, and the
proof of this provision will be in how people work together. I am keen
for us to use examples of best practice around the country to make
children&#146;s trust boards and children and young person&#146;s
plans work, and to improve outcomes for all children and young people
in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001651"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> This is another important clause. It puts Sure
Start children&#146;s centres on a statutory footing. The amendments
tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends seek to strengthen the
role of Sure Start children&#146;s centres in supporting families.
One of the biggest strengths&#151;although in some quarters they
would say the biggest weakness&#151;of Sure Start, is that it is
different in every community. The concept behind Sure Start
children&#146;s centres is that they can grow to meet the needs of
each community they serve. Amendment 403 is designed to ensure that
they can continue to do that after the Bill progresses through the
House, and that they retain the flexibility that we in the Conservative
party believe is their
lifeblood.</div><a name="09032735001039"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the downsides of putting services like Sure Start children&#146;s
centres in legislation is that they must be closely defined. What they
can do and, by implication, what they cannot do must be set down. In
drafting the remit of Sure Start children&#146;s centres, the
Minister has been clear about what they must provide and that they must
focus on early childhood services, as defined in section 2 of the
Childcare Act 2006. Proposed new section 5A(2) defines those who will
receive the services
as</div><a name="09032735001205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;parents,
prospective parents and young
children&#148;.</div><a name="09032735001040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
tight definition of users and services was not the starting point for
most children&#146;s
centres.</div><a name="09032735001041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Action
for Children is concerned that the Bill must ensure that there is a
balance between the core offer and responding freely to local needs. To
make that point, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column742" />Column number: 742</div>will describe one of its useful case studies. The Kate&#146;s Hill and
Sledmere children&#146;s centre is located in a very ethnically
diverse community. A number of children there spoke little or no
English when they started school and many families were isolated.
Action for Children identified that to help the children, it must first
help the parents. It launched an early-start English programme for
speakers of other languages at the centre to help children and their
parents learn English. By combining English with a focus on the
children, the course enabled the team to reach families that they would
otherwise have found difficult to
reach.</div><a name="09032735001042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
is example is the Carousel children&#146;s centre, which is run by
4Children. It meets the needs of children in the community effectively.
It has developed to include after-school provision and the support of a
pupil referral unit. It also undertakes extensive intergenerational
work to help the old and the young to learn from each other. That
successful children&#146;s centre is leading the way in showing how
Sure Start children&#146;s centres must support the wider family if
they are to improve the start in life for some of the youngest members
of the
community.</div><a name="09032735001043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
examples that I have given show how the wider family approach can help
to support the most disadvantaged children. The concern raised by
Action for Children and 4Children was also raised in the National
Institute of Adult Continuing Education briefing for Committee members,
which legitimately identified the need for children&#146;s centres to
continue to play an active role in adult learning. NIACE clearly feels
that the Bill may preclude that in the future. As we know, helping a
child to get the best start in life is not just about the child. It is
about the broader family; it is about mum, dad and the siblings.
Whether the siblings are teenagers or under-fives, they are just as
important in the life of the child. Grandparents also have a critical
role.</div><a name="09032735001044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Flexibility
is needed, as the Government said in their guidance on the planning and
management of Sure Start. Their own documentation says that no single
model will suit all circumstances. However, it is not clear that
broader support will be permissible in children&#146;s centres under
the Bill. Will the Minister confirm whether the projects I have talked
about could fall foul of the tighter
definition?</div><a name="09032735001045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
403 attempts to redress the balance by enabling local authorities to
strengthen the whole family through Sure Start children&#146;s
centres. Amendments 405 and 406 relate to provisions on consulting on
changes in the way that a Sure Start centre is run or on the closure of
a centre. There are barely three pages in the Bill given to enshrining
the concept of Sure Start children&#146;s centres into legislation,
yet a sizeable part of those pages focuses on the need to consult on
changes. Surely, a Sure Start children&#146;s centre that is
delivering a bespoke service for a community will have a clear
understanding of its community needs based on probably strong data as
well as consultation. While members of the community can give us their
views, we also need to make sure those views are backed by hard,
substantive evidence. The requirement to consult on every significant
change to the services delivered, which is clearly defined as
every</div>
<a name="09032735001206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;change in the
manner in which, or the location at which&#148;</div>
<a name="09032735001046"></a><div class="hs_Para">a service is delivered,
would put an intolerable burden on to children&#146;s centres, taking
management time away from improving front-line services. I would go
further and say it could hamper innovation and the ability of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column743" />Column number: 743</div>children&#146;s centres to respond quickly to the changing needs of
the communities in which we all live. The amendments we have put
forward would remove the need to consult on operational changes but,
importantly, retain the need to consult on any
closures.</div><a name="09032735001047"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001652"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I understand the sentiment behind amendment
403, the suggestion that Sure Start children&#146;s centres should
offer support for the wider family. Many of the sorts of service to
which this descriptor could apply, could be and are already being
delivered: early childhood services, as the hon. Lady said, defined in
section 2 of the Childcare Act 2006, and include social care and health
services for parents, carers and parents to be and assistance to
parents in seeking work through links to Jobcentre Plus services. These
services could include parenting programmes to help parents with their
children&#146;s difficult behaviour, drug or alcohol addictions or
simply finding work. All of these services should have a beneficial
impact on child outcomes and all of them form part of the Sure Start
offer in different localities. Half of children&#146;s centres are
located in schools and our programme of extended services in schools
means that those families using the co-locator facilities also have
access to the services for their older children. What we have tried to
do in clause 186 in our definition is to provide maximum flexibility,
while ensuring that all centres at a minimum provide assistance on
accessing early childhood services and activities to engage children
and their families. I would like to assure the hon. Lady that the
projects she referred to certainly would not be precluded under our
legislation. It would be a matter for local centres to decide what they
do. Our departmental guidance encourages planners to consult local
families before deciding which services to prioritise, which allows
considerable flexibility to plan around need and respond flexibly. In
our Sure Start children&#146;s centres practice guidance, which we
issued in November 2006, there is specific advice to local authorities
that they could possibly include training for fathers, mothers and
other carers including English as an additional language where
relevant, which is the case she spoke of. It is important not to lose
sight of the core offer of Sure Start children&#146;s centres, which
remains focused on very young children and their parents. It is right
to leave the planning and arrangements for delivering services to those
closest to the communities they serve. We would not want to force
smaller centres with a particular focus on early years provision to
extend their services to the detriment of the core. The key is
flexibility.</div><a name="09032735001048"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
respect to amendments 405 and 406, we believe that carers and parents
have a right to be consulted before significant changes are made to the
services offered by their local centre and where those services are
offered. In setting up Sure Start children&#146;s centres we have
placed a clear emphasis on local consultation before decisions are
taken. All the evidence is that delivering services through
children&#146;s centres, based on what families with young children
have said, works for them both in time and place and has encouraged
families to take up services. We now have positive evidence of the
benefits to all families living in a Sure Start area and the loss or
relocation of any of the services children&#146;s centres offer could
be a matter of concern for families. We would not expect local
authorities to consult on every change&#151;we agree that that would
be disproportionately burdensome&#151;but we would expect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column744" />Column number: 744</div>them to consult on significant ones. We will consult on the guidance for
local authorities on the fulfilment of their obligations, under the
Bill, to consult local people. That will provide a further opportunity
to explore in more detail how to ensure that this requirement balances
the interests of parents and children with the need to ensure
operational flexibility for local authorities. I hope that that
reassures the hon. Lady and that she will withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="09032735001241"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001653"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I am quite reassured by the Minister&#146;s
comments on amendment 403, which will have reassured many of the
organisations doing such an excellent job in helping to ensure that
children in Sure Start centres are the success that we need them to be.
I thank her for that and will not pursue the amendment now.</div>
<a name="09032735001050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still
not entirely convinced that the Minister has allayed my fears about
amendments 405 and 406. One of the big problems that children&#146;s
centres still face concerns their ability to get their services to
those who need them most&#151;those disadvantaged families who tend
not to take part in consultations or knock on the door and ask for
help. They are the ones whom we have to go out and find. They are not
the kind of people who take part in the sort of consultation enshrined
in the Bill. I remain deeply concerned that the provisions dealing with
consultation on the day-to-day services provided could not only hamper
innovation, but mean that children&#146;s services do not do
everything necessary to focus on that silent minority who still find it
so difficult to get the support needed to give their children the start
in life that they deserve. In the interests of time, I shall not press
my amendment to a vote, but we might need to return to this matter. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032735001051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09032735001052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001654"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I beg to move amendment 424, in
clause 186, page 103, leave out lines 7 to
11.</div><a name="09032735001053"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
probing amendment aims to clarify the purpose of the proposed duties of
governing bodies for each children&#146;s centre. The amendment would
delete that provision. The reason for the probe is that it is very
unclear how governing bodies and advisory boards will co-exist. The
Conservatives have tabled an amendment in the next group that
approaches this issue from the opposite direction, so I hope that we
can deal with them briefly and at the same time.</div>
<a name="09032735001054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
particularly concerned about the requirement on governing bodies,
because, as the National Audit Office noted, there are many different
models of governance of children&#146;s centre. Some are based on
partnership boards, steering groups, school governing bodies, boards of
community organisations and so on. The differences reflect the diverse
practices of the sectors involved in managing the centres, and I
applaud that diversity. To define governing bodies will cause
confusion, given that a host of different people run Sure Start
children&#146;s centres. We need some
clarification.</div><a name="09032735001055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also have advisory boards. I can see how they could work very well in
local areas, and I am fairly relaxed about them being put on a
statutory basis. My one issue is with proposed new section 5C(5)(c),
which states that an advisory board must include</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column745" />Column number: 745</div><a name="09032735001207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;parents or
prospective parents in the responsible authority&#146;s
area.&#148;</div><a name="09032735001056"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
an advisory board covers only one or two children&#146;s centres,
parents from the locality only should be included. Most constituencies,
for instance, have very different communities with different needs, and
I would not want advisory boards to be top heavy with those from,
perhaps, the more affluent parts of town. We need a good cross-section.
I therefore have a concern about that, but the major issue is that
surely, if every centre has to have a governing body, will it not
undermine the multi-purpose and community-focus nature of the centres?
Will the Minister clarify the respective roles, functions, members and
lines of accountability of governing bodies versus advisory
boards?</div><a name="09032735001057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001655"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We are pleased that there is a variety of
children&#146;s centres available, offering a range of services to
local communities. We want to ensure that they all have good governance
arrangements in place. At present, advisory boards help to fulfil that
requirement, but in the future it may be necessary to introduce
governing bodies. It is a reserve power that we will use only if and
when the time is right. As we explained in the indicative regulations,
we might want, for example, to make regulations about the
qualifications of centre managers. Some have argued that all centres
should have a qualified teacher; we disagree, but it illustrates why
this power could be needed.</div>
<a name="09032735001058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should the
need arise to introduce governing bodies for centres, they would have a
different role from that of advisory boards. It is likely that they
would be a body corporate to which other statutory functions and
responsibilities, such as a formal decision-making power, to enable the
formal exercise of corporate governance, could be attached. That could
not happen with the current advisory boards. If we ever did go down
that route, we would expect the governing body to be smaller than the
advisory board, with a more executive, less stakeholder representative
focus. It would be responsible for taking decisions on the operation of
the children&#146;s centre and, in doing so, we would expect them to
have regard to the views of users and particularly the advisory board.
We envisage there being some common membership between the governing
body and the advisory board, which would help effective co-operation
between the two.</div>
<a name="09032735001059"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we ever
decided that governing bodies were desirable, we are absolutely
committed to full consultation with all interested parties. The
amendment would restrict future flexibility around appropriate
governance arrangements for centres and I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw
it.</div>
<a name="09032735001060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001656"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister for her reply. I made it
clear that it was a probing amendment, but, in terms of staffing, I
remain concerned at the thought of potentially having a governing body
and an advisory board for one children&#146;s centre, which is not
such a large entity as a school. I will withdraw the amendment, but the
matter needs further reflection. I appreciate that it is a reserve
power, but if it were ever used, it could introduce much bureaucracy
and finding people to fill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column746" />Column number: 746</div>the positions in a disadvantaged community would be quite a challenge. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09032735001061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09032735001062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001657"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I beg to move amendment 401, in
clause 186, page 103, leave out lines 12 to
39.</div>
<a name="09032735001063"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
risk of bureaucratic overload at this point in the Bill. We have just
looked at the role of children&#146;s trust boards and the problems
in understanding how they fit alongside local strategic partnerships
and children&#146;s safeguarding boards. The amendment would remove
the need to establish yet another body&#151;the children&#146;s
advisory board. As the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said
in her remarks on the previous amendment, it seems extraordinary that
there would be a requirement to have both governing bodies and advisory
boards as well as children&#146;s trust boards, in which there is a
strong argument for having a more obvious role for Sure Start
children&#146;s centres.</div>
<a name="09032735001064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would remove the need to establish yet another body. That would be good
and ensure that we have more of the staff that we need to be engaged in
frontline activities rather than having to run these burdensome and
bureaucratic organisations. The explanatory note details that the role
of the advisory board would be to advise and assist the centre manager,
the local authority and its relevant partners to ensure that the centre
provides relevant and high-quality services. Surely making Sure Start
children centres participants in children&#146;s trust boards would
have a similar effect. They would make sure that their services were
relevant and of a high quality, and remove another costly layer of
bureaucracy. I do not mean costly in terms of money, but in management
time by taking people away from the front
line.</div><a name="09032735001065"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister really feels that it is absolutely necessary to have a
strict management structure in place, why not make it a sub-committee
of the children&#146;s trust boards and then at least it will not
just float in the ether with people unsure how it fits into the other
plethora of organisations with which they have to deal? If the prime
objective is to include parents, that is probably already being
achieved by most Sure Start children centres in the way that they
organise themselves to involve parents in helping to determine what
services are already in
place.</div><a name="09032735001066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the hon. Lady assure those of us who are worried about levels of
bureaucracy in many areas of government, particularly in the matters
that we are discussing, that she has taken heed of our concerns? Will
she also take the opportunity to reassure the organisations that I have
been talking to&#151;we have heard mention of the issue in
Committee&#151;about the schoolification of the language that is
used? Talking about governing bodies really starts to make some
organisations feel that the Government might want to indelibly link
children&#146;s Sure Start centres into schools. I am not sure that
that is their intention, but at the moment their use of language is not
helping.</div>
<a name="09032735001067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001658"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> In legislating for children&#146;s
centres, the Government are following the approach of putting into
statute recognised best practice, building on the development, work and
guidance already issued. We are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column747" />Column number: 747</div>doing so in a flexible way, recognising that, for children&#146;s
centres as with many other areas, one size does not fit all. What we
propose must be flexible for different circumstances, but we also know
that certain approaches are important to the effective running of
children&#146;s centres. The creation of advisory boards is one of
those
areas.</div><a name="09032735001068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Advisory
boards are necessary for two related reasons. First, an effective
advisory board provides support and challenge to centre managers. A
National Audit Office report found that effective management boards or
committees can support the effective delivery of children&#146;s
centres and provide focus and direction to give a good service to local
children and families. Secondly, advisory boards also provide a voice
for the community for users of services, especially parents, but also
other interested, local stakeholders. They can also work with
parents&#146; forums to ascertain the views of parents and users, who
have a right to their say on how the children&#146;s centre will
operate, but who might not be comfortable in a more formal, corporate
governance
structure.</div><a name="09032735001069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
186 also enables more than one children&#146;s centre to be within
the remit of a single advisory board and that can be effective for
clusters of centres in some areas. I hope that my explanation is
sufficient to have reassured the hon.
Lady.</div><a name="09032735001070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001659"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I wish that the Minister&#146;s response was
sufficient to have reassured me, but she does not understand that, by
setting up more and more organisations and structures, she is taking
people away from doing what we need them to do, which is to improve the
start in life of youngsters and babies. Setting up yet another board,
yet another set of meetings for people to attend and yet another set of
minutes for people to read for a meeting will do nothing to free up
people&#146;s time to do what they need to do. That is indicative of
the Government&#146;s obsession with trying to micro-manage things
and not let people get on with the job that they need to
do.</div><a name="09032735001071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that we are under time pressure and shall not press the
amendment, but it is a great shame how the scrutiny of the Bill has
been arranged. As a result, we probably do not have the time to look at
such elements in detail. Perhaps they are something that the House
really does need to return to because, as the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole said, it is incomprehensible how all the
bureaucratic structures fit together. It is no way to set up a new
body.</div><a name="09032735001072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001660"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> My comments were not quite so harsh on the
advisory boards; for example, the National Children&#146;s Bureau
feels that it is working very well in their local areas. My main
concern is having two layers
there.</div><a name="09032735001073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001661"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I am sorry. I meant that the hon. Lady was picking
up on the issue of having two organisations, which could be doing
similar things and working in parallel. I will not press the amendment
now, but I hope that the Minister will think about the comments that
have been made. I know that she shares my hope that what we are doing
today will improve the lives that young people have in all our
communities, but this is probably not the way to go about it. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001664"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> One of the most pressing problems that
children&#146;s centres face is how to involve the local primary care
trust in their work. There is ample evidence to suggest that the most
effective way to reach out to the families most in need of support is
through medical professionals such as health visitors. Yet the
involvement of health in children&#146;s centres is, at best, patchy.
More often than not, the involvement of health in a centre would have
been a result of the tenacity of individuals, not a corporate
commitment from PCTs. I am sure that the Minister is as aware as I am
that more precarious arrangements are at risk of breakdown if an
individual moves out of their job, and that has to change. I would be
interested to hear from the Minister whether the motivation for
including proposed new section 5E was an attempt to force that change
in terms of the involvement of health by placing a duty on all relevant
partners to consider whether early childhood services should be
provided through children&#146;s
centres.</div><a name="09032735001082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the intention of the Bill, but amendment 404
seeks to probe further into the Minister&#146;s thinking and achieve
the same outcome without children&#146;s centres 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column749" />Column number: 749</div>effectively losing their ability to shape the services that they need in
order to meet the needs of their individual local community. As
proposed new section 5E is currently worded, any early years service
may find its way into a children&#146;s centre, regardless of whether
it is a priority service for that community. How effective, and indeed
practical, will that be? The amendment would put children&#146;s
centres back into the driving seat in managing the services that they
provide and put a duty on the relevant partners to work with the
children&#146;s centre, rather than the other way round, which is the
way it appears in the Bill at the moment. However, I am sure that the
Minister will help us understand that
better.</div><a name="09032735001083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
404 also recognises the importance of giving priority to supporting
disadvantaged families. This is something that a number of interested
parties have raised an eyebrow about: there is no explicit mention in
the Bill of the need to do that. Despite the issues that we have
regarding not achieving the outreach to disadvantaged families, I know
that it is a priority for the Government, as much as it is for my
party.</div><a name="09032735001084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
remaining part of the amendment serves to pinpoint the pivotal role of
health visitors in children&#146;s centres. The Minister will be
aware of the Conservatives&#146; long-standing policy to reinstate
the universal health visitor service through Sure Start. I am pleased,
at long last, that as a result of the recommendations in Lord
Laming&#146;s most recent report, the Secretary of State seems to be
coming round to our way of
thinking.</div><a name="09032735001085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
399 seeks clear information on the true cost of children&#146;s
centres to ensure that there is transparency in expenditure, and also
to help the third sector organisations that want to bid for managing
Sure Start centres and providing services there. Too often, I hear the
phrase &#147;there is not a level playing field&#148; when the
third sector bids alongside local authorities to provide services.
Having information on the costs of children&#146;s centres on an
individual basis will help third sector organisations when they come to
it.</div>
<a name="09032735001086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 527
would put a duty on the local authority to consider sustainability as
well as quality of services in the childhood sector. That is important
because, when we start to look at funding streams for centres into the
future, considering the recession, we need to ensure that
sustainability is taken into account.</div>
<a name="09032735001087"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
been a lamentable decline of health visitor services that must be
reversed. We now know that 40 per cent. of health visitors are handling
case loads of more than 500 children. Indeed, 20 per cent. are handling
case loads of more than 1,000 children. The provisions that we would
put in the Bill would help to ensure that health visitors can provide
the support and have the effect that we need in our
communities.</div>
<a name="09032735001088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 528 promotes the use of private, voluntary and independent
providers. There is useful provision in the Childcare Act 2006, to
which I believe I have referred before, that requires local authorities
not to provide child care services unless they have no alternative. The
provisions in the amendment would guard against the duplication of
services and help promote the PVI sector. I urge the Minister to
consider whether there is a place in the Bill for a similar approach to
that taken in the 2006 Act because, all too often, local authorities
have taken the view that they should be the managers of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column750" />Column number: 750</div>centres and the providers of services. They have not really thought more
innovatively about how they could involve the third sector. Indeed,
only a handful of centres are run by third sector
organisations.</div>
<a name="09032735001089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay tribute
to the superb work done by Action for Children, Barnardo&#146;s,
4Children and a number of other independent organisations, including
Lifeline. They run excellent examples of Sure Start children&#146;s
centres. They are moving the agenda forward, and we should be doing
everything that we can to encourage their excellent
work.</div><a name="09032735001090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001665"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It is a pleasure to speak to amendments 369 and
370, which were tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol, West
and for Yeovil, and me.</div>
<a name="09032735001091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 404
would replace one set of provisions with another. Although it is hinted
at, I still do not see the term &#147;outreach work&#148; in either
set. That point was made by the three people from Action for Children,
4Children and the Family and Parenting Institute who contributed to the
Committee. The Bill offers an opportunity to insert the importance of
outreach work, which could then be backed up with some guidance. For
example, nobody really knows what the qualifications are for an
outreach worker. A lot of work needs doing on that. That amendment
would be quite useful, because it would enable one to focus on that
difficult aspect.</div>
<a name="09032735001092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
proposal to add sustainability. We have a conundrum: we want to
increase the quantity and quality, and we want affordability and
sustainability. However, in the early days, a lot of settings were
created, probably in the wrong place, as local authorities were set
targets to provide so many pre-school places. They went at it in a
rush, and the number of places has fallen subsequently, because they
have not been located in the right place and perhaps the quality was
not there. We must be concerned that money is not wasted in this very
large investment
process.</div><a name="09032735001093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
369 and 370 are about quality. Although the word
&#147;quality&#148; would be left out of proposed new subsection
(4A)(a) to the Childcare Act 2006, a far more specific new subsection
would be added that is far more specific
about</div><a name="09032735001208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;improving
the quality of early childhood services that are provided in their
area&#148;.</div>
<a name="09032735001094"></a><div class="hs_Para">During our debates on
the 2006 Act, we spent much time talking about quality. We did not
decide on anything conclusive, yet it is an important matter:
poor-quality child care provision is damaging, particularly for younger
children. We spoke of the development of a kitemark, which was taken on
board, but I have not heard about the idea in recent years. We need to
have some confidence about the quality of provision yet not be totally
dependent on inspections.</div>
<a name="09032735001095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
discuss how local authorities can assess and measure quality, and
incorporate a system of continuous quality improvement in early
childhood services. The Government must take that on board. The word
quality is in the clause, but we need a clear definition of its
meaning, as it can mean many things to different people. Previously, we
have focused on quality. As we progress and expand provision, it is
important to ensure that all-important quality. I await the
Minister&#146;s response with interest.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column751" />Column number: 751</div><a name="09032735001096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001666"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I shall speak first to amendment
404, which seeks to replace the duty on local authorities and relevant
partners to consider delivering services to a children&#146;s centre
with a requirement that children&#146;s centre managers work with the
local authority and children&#146;s trust boards to determine which
services will be provided. I agree that the sort of conversation
implied by that amendment&#151;one that involves centre
managers&#151;should take place, but it is not sensible to remove the
requirement on local authorities and relevant partners to consider
delivering services through children&#146;s centres. It would not be
the in the best interests of parents and children, who benefit from
joined-up services, or the centres themselves, which may otherwise be
overlooked in deliberations about service delivery. The duty in clause
186 on local authorities, primary care trusts and Jobcentre Plus will
not marginalise Sure Start children&#146;s centres. I believe that it
will ensure that they remain centre stage.</div>
<a name="09032735001097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sure Start
children&#146;s centres are already integrated into the operation of
the children&#146;s trust, as many of those involved in delivering
services in children&#146;s centres will be relevant partners in the
children&#146;s trust and represented on the children&#146;s trust
board. In regulations, backed by guidance, we will require the
children&#146;s trust board to consult the advisory board of each
children&#146;s centre in the local area when preparing their
children and young people&#146;s plan, thus improving statutory
mechanisms; thereby, those providing services on the ground, parents
and local communities can contribute to local services planning and
provision.</div>
<a name="09032735001098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Health
services already play and will continue to play an important part in
the services that many children&#146;s centres provide. The recently
published strategy for children and young people&#146;s health,
&#147;Healthy lives, brighter futures&#148;, made clear the
Government&#146;s commitment to a strengthened role for health and
children&#146;s centres, with a named health visitor linked to each
centre. However, we believe that it is right to provide local
flexibility, so that the best location of health services can be
determined locally, to facilitate access to and maximise the benefits
of those services to young children and their parents. Requiring all
children&#146;s centres to provide a health visitor service would
reduce that.</div>
<a name="09032735001099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 399
would require local authorities to publish details of children&#146;s
centre budgets annually and centre by centre, but that would place an
enormous bureaucratic burden on local authorities, and it would not
achieve the transparency on the costs involved in delivering
children&#146;s centre services. Resources for children&#146;s
centre services come from several sources&#151;the local authority,
the NHS and Jobcentre Plus.</div>
<a name="09032735001100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the local
authority were to publish only the budget details for which it is
accountable, we would see only part of the full expenditure picture.
The way in which the resources flow to centres varies should reflect
local choices, circumstances and preferences. Some authorities delegate
the majority of the children&#146;s centres revenue to the centre
itself; others commission services centrally and deploy them across a
range of centres; and others tender for a third party to run the centre
and its services under
contract.</div><a name="09032735001101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise, however, that there is still much to be done to support
centres in achieving value for money and local authorities in putting
resources where they can make the most difference for children and
families. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column752" />Column number: 752</div>We have been exploring the feasibility of designing a benchmarking
system for similar centres to compare their costs, and we will publish
the findings
shortly.</div><a name="09032735001243"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
pm</div><a name="09032735001102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will use this opportunity to respond to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset
and North Poole about outreach. It is not mentioned explicitly in the
legislation because it is already provided for in the Childcare Act
2006. Section 3 requires local authorities to identify parents who
would not access early childhood services of their own accord and
encourage them to use those
services.</div><a name="09032735001103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001667"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It is an interesting reflection that it is
specified in the 2006 Act. In all the evaluations of Sure Start
centres, outreach work is one of the weakest aspects. Perhaps we need
something on top of the existing
legislation.</div>
<a name="09032735001104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001668"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Or maybe we just need to ensure that the
existing legislation is adhered to. That is the outreach activity that
we require all children&#146;s centres to
undertake.</div><a name="09032735001105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
369, 527, 370 and 528 seek to amend the provision that we are building
into section 3 of the Childcare Act 2006 through clause 189 to require
local authorities to consider the quality, quantity and location of
existing services in the area as they make arrangements for integrated
early childhood services. On quality, I am sympathetic to the broad
thrust of amendments 369 and 370, which I believe are intended to embed
a culture of quality improvement in the delivery of early years
services.</div>
<a name="09032735001106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We share that
commitment, but we believe that it is very much within the spirit of
the existing legislation. For example, the early years foundation stage
helps ensure that whatever setting parents choose, they can be
confident that their child will receive a quality experience that
supports their learning and development. Our graduate leader fund and
early years professional status are driving up work force
standards.</div><a name="09032735001107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also recognise the extra value and expertise brought to services for
children and families by organisations in the private, voluntary and
independent sectors. We want to ensure that Sure Start
children&#146;s centre services include the best of those. We have
been clear all along that in making provision for integrated early
learning and child care within Sure Start children&#146;s centres, we
do not expect local authorities to set up in competition with existing
good-quality provision.</div>
<a name="09032735001108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that amendment 527, which requires local authorities to have regard to
the sustainability of early childhood services provided in the area, is
also unnecessary. Clause 189 makes it explicit that a local authority
must have regard to the services already available in the area when
deciding arrangements for integrating early childhood services, and it
follows that services should be
sustainable.</div><a name="09032735001109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
528, which would require local authorities to have regard to the
desirability of maintaining a range of different types of service,
including those from the private and voluntary sector, is also
unnecessary. I have explained that we have long recognised the extra
value and expertise brought to children&#146;s services by
organisations in the private, voluntary and independent sectors.
Indeed, we have made it a condition of grant that authorities consider
and consult all local child care providers before 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column753" />Column number: 753</div>deciding how child care in children&#146;s centres will be delivered.
With that, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="09032735001110"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001669"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for her thorough answers on
the four amendments. I hope that she is right that the PVI sector is
not overlooked. She feels that amendment 528 is unnecessary, but the
experience on the ground is that there is a culture of not always
looking first to the PVI sector. Hopefully those involved in the area
will read her remarks and take
heed.</div><a name="09032735001111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the hon. Lady&#146;s point that there are provisions in
the Bill that should cover sustainability, but I am again thinking of
the future. Sustainability needs to be taken into account. Ensuring
that the true costs of centres are fully understood is difficult. As
she said, the funding streams come from myriad different organisations.
That makes it difficult for elected Members to understand the true cost
of Sure Start centres, which is something that we should all be
thinking about. However, I understand her point that a true cost would
not necessarily be provided through the amendment and other streams
might be coming through as
well.</div><a name="09032735001112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s response to amendment 404 was less convincing. I do
not think that how the Bill and this provision are structured will do
many favours for Sure Start centres. They could be left in the position
of having an obligation to take on services that may not be that
helpful. The Minister talked about ensuring that Sure Start centres are
not overlooked, but there could be an unintended
consequence.</div><a name="09032735001113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Minister for her reassurances. I shall not press the issues
in the amendments, but hope that she will ponder them further, outside
the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

187 makes an important provision for Ofsted to be able to inspect
children&#146;s centres. It already has the ability to inspect the
child care and early years teaching elements of children&#146;s
centres, but it is not clear from the Bill how the new duty would fit
in with existing responsibilities. What was interesting from our
evidence sessions was that organisations that run children&#146;s
centres have very little information about the new inspection system.
The lack of detail in the Bill is not making it easy, coupled with the
lack of any information from third parties. It is difficult to
understand the Government&#146;s
intention.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column754" />Column number: 754</div><a name="09032735001118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The original

the existing provision, which apparently could already be enacted under
the Childcare Act, the same as the Government proposal in clause 187?
It is difficult to tell, because of the Bill&#146;s vagaries. Perhaps
the Minister could help the Committee by talking about the work that
has been done in advance of the Bill to consult organisations about how
the new process would
work.</div><a name="09032735001121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment clarifies that any new inspection system should not add yet
another layer of bureaucracy. Ofsted would be required to have a
unified system of inspection to lessen the burden on children&#146;s
centres without losing the important control of the quality of
services. Going back to the witness statements from the evidence
sessions, when we have organisations that are running a number of Sure
Start children&#146;s centres saying that they have no information on
the new inspection regime, I am rather concerned about the
Government&#146;s thinking. The Minister needs to take a little time
this evening to fill the Committee
in.</div><a name="09032735001122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001671"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I understand that the children&#146;s
centres and organisations in the voluntary sector that provide
children&#146;s centre services have some concerns about the
potential for unco-ordinated inspections. I entirely understand the
desire to ensure that children&#146;s centres experience inspection
as a joined-up process. That is sensible and is something that we also
wish to ensure. There is nothing in the Bill that constrains
Ofsted&#146;s ability to schedule multiple inspections in a sensible
and co-ordinated way, although when doing so it will apply different
criteria for individual services. Ofsted&#146;s recent publication,
&#147;Ofsted Inspects: A summary of the framework for all Ofsted
inspection and regulation&#148; makes clear its commitment to what it
refers to as &#147;single inspection events&#148; and I welcome
that clear and helpful statement of intent from Ofsted. I hope that
gives the hon. Member for Basingstoke assurance about the conduct of
inspections.</div>
<a name="09032735001123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that Ofsted will consult on the detail of how it will inspect
children&#146;s centres. As one would expect, that consultation will
involve a wide range of stakeholders, including private and voluntary
sector service providers. Ofsted will also consider how it intends to
integrate the scheduling of the services discussed in the amendment and
I hope that that reassurance is sufficient for the hon.
Lady.</div><a name="09032735001124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032735001672"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarity. Perhaps it
would have been useful to have had some of that either discussed with
the PVI sector before the Bill was introduced, or to have indicated
that in some way to members of the Committee, because that really
helped.</div>
<a name="09032735001125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The single
inspection event will probably address the issue that has been raised.
The other issue that we want reassurance from the Minister on is
whether there is sufficient expertise in Ofsted to be able to undertake
that type of inspection. I beg leave to withdraw the
