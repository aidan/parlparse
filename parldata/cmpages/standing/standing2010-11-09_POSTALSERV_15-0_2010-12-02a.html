                        <p class="tabbed">We
are dealing with another set of amendments relating to clause 28, where
we left off last time. First I shall discuss amendments 74 and 75 and
then I shall discuss the other two. Amendments 74 and 75 relate to
subsections (4) and (5) respectively. Maintaining the link between
Royal Mail and the Post Office is essential. It is unthinkable that the
historic link with our post office branches—be they the bigger
branches on our high streets or the smaller ones in corner shops,
perhaps in scattered rural areas or less-frequented urban
areas—which has existed over so many years should be
broken.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a good reason why the existing structure of Royal Mail Group
includes Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. That structure is historical,
and it integrates in one organisation the two sides of postal services:
the collection points where people hand in the items that they want
conveyed, if they are anything other than what can be put in a post
box, and the delivery service. The modern Royal Mail Group employs
160,000 staff and has two main functions: delivering 70 million letters
and parcels 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 520<a class="bkMark" name="Column520">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a day from post boxes to 28 million households and businesses, and
running the network of 11,900 post office
outlets.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
idea that anyone would want to separate the mail and the Post Office is
unthinkable. In fact, many people are incredulous that the proposed
legislation for privatising the Royal Mail would result in there being
no direct link between the post office network and the Royal Mail, and
that any such link would depend purely on whether Royal Mail happened
to choose to enter into an inter-business agreement to use the post
office
network.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
separation of the Post Office from Royal Mail fundamentally threatens
the future of the post office network. The Bill does nothing to
guarantee an IBA between Royal Mail and the Post Office, unlike the
current situation, whereby the Post Office provides counter services
for Royal Mail. Obviously, we understand that that is a commercial
agreement; if we had a privatised Royal Mail, it would be an agreement
between two private companies, or two separate companies. Therefore it
is, as the Minister has said, something that he has not seen, that he
is not party to and that he is unlikely to be party to in terms of the
finer details. The IBA is not included in the Bill, so when the current
IBA ends and is renegotiated, there is no guarantee that Royal Mail
will continue to use the post office network as the primary retail
outlet for some or all of its products. It will be a strictly
commercial negotiation, with no thought of the social
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
could face the surreal situation of a post office network without
postal services. It has to be admitted that that would be
bizarre—post offices but no postal services. Perhaps post
offices would get something from the Department for Work and Pensions,
if they were very lucky. Perhaps they would get additional work from
the DWP if they were super-lucky. Perhaps they would even keep the
green giros, but it would be bizarre if Royal Mail’s services
were not linked to the Post Office. Post offices are, after all, the
first place most people think of going to post anything other than a
normal letter. Off they go, to their nearest branch, with large
envelopes, packages and items destined for foreign
parts—anything on which they cannot stick just an ordinary first
or second class stamp. Where else in the world are there post offices
without postal services? People all over the world go to post offices
to post items. We have heard fine words from Moya Greene, the chief

absolutely desperate to see a minimum 10-year IBA, but it would rather
see a longer one. There is no hope of that, if it cannot even get a

a commercial agreement and as such cannot be put into the Bill. We
therefore have to find another way for Royal Mail and the Post Office

what have we come up with? We are trying to find a way in which the

wants its business guaranteed, and Moya Greene tells us that Royal Mail
wants it, too. Labour members of the Committee certainly want it, and I
believe that the Minister wants to help to secure the future of the
post office network, as do many Government Members. I think that they
recognise that to secure the network’s future, post offices need
to secure business streams; indeed, several of them have mentioned that
necessity. At the moment, when there is no guarantee that the Post
Office will get a renewal of the DWP contract for the green giros,
never mind any additional work from the Department, what on earth would
be the point of putting lots of effort into searching high and low to
secure new business streams for the post office, if the substantial
revenue brought in by the IBA with the Royal Mail, which accounts for a
third of the Post Office’s income, cannot be
secured?<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000025">&#160;</a>

thought that I would help the Minister this morning, because he likes
to think of names for the amendments. I suggest that this group be
called the Christmas cake amendments, because the Conservative and
Liberal Democrat parties seem to be trying to find lots of icing and
decorations to put on the Christmas cake. In their wonderful glossy
blue document, there are wonderful ideas about what the Post Office
will look like, with the lovely little local post offices and the
computers and chairs that will be moved in. They have all those
different little aspects—the decorations and icing—that
will make the post offices so absolutely beautiful, but they will take
away the cake. There will be no cake, because there will be no Royal
Mail IBA on which to base all

business being channelled through post offices. On top, we would like
everything else—foreign currency exchange and all

local post offices that branch out into diversification projects.
Without the good cake underneath and a nice layer of marzipan, however,

just collapse—I know that from baking cakes. I hope, when the

                           </strong> Absolutely. We are proposing two amendments to
seek another way to preserve the historical link between the post
office network and the Royal Mail. It is a straightforward
idea—we simply want to add post office branches to clause 28.
The amendments would place an obligation on Ofcom to include post
office branches in the provision of access points to meet the needs of
users of the universal postal service. By seeking to insist that Ofcom
includes post office branches in that way, our intention is to secure
the future for the post office network. That future would be secure
whatever the will or whim of a future Royal Mail, which might be a
privatised Royal Mail or might be one whose chief executive officer or
priorities might
change.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000031">&#160;</a>

in the mind of Government there is a desire to break the link between
Royal Mail and the post office network at some time in the future, I
see no reason why there should be any objection to amendment 74.
Refusing to accept it is tantamount to an admission that the Royal Mail
may well choose to make different arrangements for access points and
move away from using post offices, and that the Government condone that
thinking. Therefore, if the Government are serious about their interest
in the future of the post office network and about responding to the
demand of the National Federation of SubPostmasters for a guarantee of
at least 10 years’ custom from Royal Mail, the Minister should
accept amendments 74 and
75.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000032">&#160;</a>

However, at the moment, it could very well be another outlet—an
outlet with far fewer branches across the country. We have seen what
has happened to banks in local villages—they have all closed,
effectively. We have seen what has happened to some of the smaller
branches of the big chains—many people have seen local Co-ops
close, for example. The problem is that people fear—I certainly
do—that without something written down, there is the option to
go somewhere else with fewer access

post offices will be commercially viable, and that we introduced access
criteria requiring 7,000 or 8,000 post offices to be open to meet those
access criteria. He endorsed those access criteria in his document. Not
only that, but we put in money to enable 11,900 post office branches to
remain open and, yet again, he has chosen to continue that subsidy for
the next couple of years. He has actually been following the policies

<em>Hansard </em>as saying that, given that 7,000 post offices had
closed, the IBA could not have been that important. But that speaks for
the importance of the IBA, because despite the fact that it
provides  a third of post offices’ income, we still have
only 4,000 economically viable post offices. There is a point about the
commercial relationship between Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd
post-privatisation of the Royal Mail. Royal Mail will be in a much
stronger bargaining position than Post Office Ltd. The Minister said
earlier that Post

provides a service to at least one other postal collection and delivery
company, so the notion about vacating its exclusive agreement that
Royal Mail is worried about does not stand. Even if that were true, it
is redundant, because the other businesses in the market are basically
bulk pick-up and

relevant. It happens to be an agreement between Post Office Ltd and

given that the same access points and criteria existed under the Labour

Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East.
Royal Mail business is crucial business for the post office network. If
there had not been the commitment from the Government to the additional
subsidy, access criteria and such business with the Royal Mail, the
future for the post office network would have been a lot bleaker. It
must be said that we kept a lot more post offices open than were
commercially able to be open. The Minister knows that we kept the best
part of 7,900 post offices
open.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000053">&#160;</a>

the Minister is saying. We can all agree on a perfectly reasonable
formulation. The IBA is important, nevertheless 7,000 post offices have
closed because the economic climate for them is difficult. The Minister
has said that he will introduce new ways in which to do business with
Post Office Ltd, which will make more post offices viable, but that is
not in tension with the view that the IBA is
critical.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000054">&#160;</a>

However, we have said on a number of occasions that the Bill is
different from the previous one, because we are discussing a privatised
Royal Mail. What might happen between a privatised Royal Mail and the
business agreement that it chooses to make is different from the IBA
that we were considering, which concerned sister companies within the
Royal Mail Group. In the 2009 Bill, we had always intended to keep
Royal Mail in majority public ownership, so that link would have
remained, but it certainly will not do so in the new scenario that the

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us get back to the actual idea of the post office network as an access
point, because I am sure that the Chair would like me to move on to
amendments 78 and 89. We have said a considerable amount
about amendments 74 and
75.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
78 inserts into clause 30 new requirement 3A, which would cover access
to postal services via the post office branches. The reason for this
amendment is that, as they stand, the requirements of clause 30 do not
provide for that particular item. They may provide for collection from
access points, but they do not provide for post office branches to be
those access points. We have tabled amendment 78 with the same aim as
amendment 74. The purpose of the amendment is to enshrine in
legislation the requirement that Ofcom should include post office
branches as access points to the services of the provider of the
universal postal service, which at the moment is Royal Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The purpose
of amendment 78, as with the previous amendment, is to find a way in
which people can be certain of being able to use the post office
network to access the services of the universal service provider. This
is not about saving post offices for post offices’ sake; this is
about the consumer. This is about people being able to go somewhere
local and not having to go into the middle of a town 20 or 30 miles
away. Put simply, they should be able to go to their local post office
to post a package or register a
letter.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
this instance, it is about not only enshrining in legislation the
principle that the post office network should provide access points,
but giving the Secretary of State the power to specify exactly how many
access points there should be. The reason for that is, as has been
suggested, a universal service provider might think that its needs
could be served by a network of some 4,000 outlets. Currently we have
11,900 post offices. Of that number, perhaps 7,000 or so would be
adequate to meet the access criteria that were introduced by the
previous Labour Government and, as I have said, have been accepted by
the Government and restated in their recent document on the future of
the post office network in the digital
age.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
access criteria clearly state that, nationally, 99% of the population
are to be within 3 miles of the nearest outlet, and 90% are to be
within 1 mile. In deprived urban areas, 99% are to be within 1 mile.
Some 95% of the total urban population are to be within 1 mile, and 95%
of the total rural population are to be within 3 miles. Overall, 95% of
people in each postcode district are to be within 6 miles.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000070">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously, the
purpose of those access criteria is to ensure reasonable access to post
offices in both urban and rural areas. Without the criteria, there
would be no control of the overall shape of the post office network. We
believe that a viable, sustainable post office network is a critical
part of the social infrastructure for many communities. We introduced
the access criteria to ensure that such communities would continue to
be fairly served by a national post office
network.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have said, the access criteria could be met with a network of some
7,000 post offices, but we made additional investment to keep open
11,900. If the Government are serious about keeping open that number of
post offices and about keeping the network as we know it now, here we
have a mechanism that they could use. The Secretary of State would have
the power to specify the number of post offices to be used as access
points to the services of the provider of the universal postal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister may argue that it is up to the privatised business to decide
what it does, how many access points it uses and where those access
points are located. Here, we are talking about a national network; it
is a universal service, which we want to be easily accessible for
everybody in the UK. Given that all parties now agree on the access
criteria for post offices, the Secretary of State should have the power
to specify that the provider of the universal service should use post
offices as access points, as well as how many post offices that should
be, and I can see no good argument against
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000073">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is helpful to have that spelled out. One
cannot imagine any rational person who would not want that to be the
case, but it seems that we are still not getting any indication from
the Government that they understand the nature of the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To return to
the point about the Secretary of State, if the Government are serious
about protecting the post office network, the straightforward solution
would be for the Secretary of State to have and exercise such powers.
What is the point of using large amounts of taxpayers’ money to
subsidise the post office network, if everything in our power is not
done to secure the most obvious source of income for the post office
network, which is the work involved in providing access points to the
universal postal service? It seems positively perverse not to do that,
when such powers could so easily be there. Other countries, as my hon.
Friend has mentioned, have no such hang-ups about not letting the
Government have a say in this. Elsewhere, where there has been
privatisation of the mail service, there has also been legislation to
protect the post office network and to specify its use for the access
points for the universal postal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">While
we do not want to see the privatisation of Royal Mail services, if it
is going to happen, what on earth is wrong with including a mechanism
to protect the post office network in the legislation? That is clearly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 529<a class="bkMark" name="Column529">&#160;</a>
                           </div>what the overwhelming majority of the public want to see. Most people
cannot imagine that the situation would ever be any different. The
Government specify all sorts of regulations that private providers have
to comply with—I am sure that the hon. Member for Bedford would
love to regale us about some of those, and there are many. Look at the
various schemes that the energy companies are expected to participate
in; there is nothing wrong with a specification in that
respect.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I feel that
the Government are being obstinate and not listening to the public,
while refusing to take the necessary steps to secure the post office
network’s future. This is the ideal opportunity for the
Secretary of State to specify the use of the post office network and to
stipulate a minimum size for it. The alternative outlook is very bleak
indeed. We have been told that nothing can be done about an
IBA—the Minister has said so—because it will be a private
commercial matter. Therefore, sub-postmasters and other Post Office
employees are supposed to hope that Royal Mail will want to use the
post office network.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
absolutely no sign yet that there will be anything like the guarantee
of a 10-year IBA, or of any continuation after the current IBA expires.
Even if the Royal Mail decides to use the post office network, what is
to stop it from negotiating a much reduced IBA? The Royal Mail could
decide that, in the interests of cutting costs, it prefers to have a
much smaller network, and it could therefore choose to use only a
certain number of post offices as its access points—if it even
chooses to have post offices as preferred access points.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This issue
presents the ideal opportunity for the Minister to secure the future of
the post office network, so I ask him to look favourably on our
amendment. He should support the post office network; rejecting the
amendment will send a clear signal out, not only to all who work in the
post office network but to the many people in our communities who use
it, saying that the Government do not care if post offices survive or
not.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000080">&#160;</a>

should be clear that amendment 89 is simply in keeping with the
amendments that I have already discussed. It is about enshrining in
legislation the role of post offices as access points for the universal
postal service. I want the Minister to explain why he is so busy moving
around the decorations on the top of the cake without actually having a
cake to start with. He needs to take this seriously and to find a
mechanism. That is a mechanism, and if he does not like it, perhaps he
could come up with a better one that would actually guarantee Royal

have heard evidence from both Ofcom and Postcomm, and it is accepted
that Ofcom will be the vehicle for the regulation of the privatised
Royal Mail. However, the apparent agreement does not mean that
proposals, as they stand, are perfect. Effective regulation is vital,
especially when we bear in mind that the Bill 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 530<a class="bkMark" name="Column530">&#160;</a>
                           </div>takes a publicly owned company and makes it subject to 90% privatisation
with 10% employee mutualisation, which is effectively complete
privatisation. We must, therefore, ensure that the legislation gives
Ofcom the necessary tools to be able to regulate a privatised Royal
Mail not only in the market interest, but in the public
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
privatisation proposal is set against a backdrop of regulatory
uncertainty. Postcomm is reviewing and reforming its practices, and the
handover to Ofcom will naturally provide some challenges. If we add the
uncertainty arising from the Postcomm review and the vagueness of what
the private versus public share of Royal Mail will be following the
sale, we can all agree that it is quite a task for any regulator to
undertake.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
emphasises two points. First, as I have alluded to previously, the Bill
is being introduced—in much the same way as the
Government’s agenda for reducing the deficit—too soon and
too fast. I urge the Minister to slow down and review the Royal
Mail’s position following modernisation and regulatory
review.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
bearing in mind the uncertain territory that we find ourselves in, we
must ensure that the Bill is watertight in guaranteeing that the
universal service obligation and the Post Office will be protected in
the interests of consumers. Ensuring that the universal service
obligation is protected is what motivates my objection to subsection
(3) and is the reason why I firmly support amendment 73. The Bill, as
it stands, specifically states that Ofcom must have regard to the
universal postal service’s financial sustainability and
efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why
is there no mention of the public service element of postal services?
Why do the public not have express protection in the Bill? A privatised
Royal Mail will clearly be delivered and regulated according to profit
and loss, and the consequences of that have no boundaries. I do not
consider that suggestion as completely out of the realms of reality. On
the contrary, it seems more like a business reality that any business
would take in the interests of its shareholders. Subsection (3)
guarantees that Ofcom’s regulation will be driven by profit and
loss, and, without a firm provision to protect it, the universal
service obligation will become a victim of the accountant’s
pen.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000089">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">More
stringent regulation is vital to protect both the universal service
obligation and our post offices. The Government seem to have an
unbridled belief that the USO will be safe in private owners’
hands. However, we only have to look to the Netherlands to realise that
that might not be the case. Within a year of the mail market being
fully opened to competition in April 2009, the managing director of
TNT’s European mail network, Mr Kunz—I have struggled to
pronounce his surname—has said that the universal service
obligation

fear that the universal service obligation is not sufficiently
protected by the Bill. When instructing Ofcom, the Bill expressly
points to financial sustainability and efficiency without taking into
account larger considerations,

			Column number: 531<a class="bkMark" name="Column531">&#160;</a>
                           </div>which puts the USO at risk. That obligation is vital to many groups, and
once again I would like to consider small-business
owners.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Last
night, Neil Haylock, who owns a small business in my constituency,
shared his genuine concerns. He thinks that his business would suffer
as a consequence of the Bill. The mutual relationship between Royal
Mail and small businesses is important—they depend on each
other. The research undertaken by the Federation of Small Businesses
shows that a large majority of small businesses use stamped mail and
are regular users of post offices. Exposure to market conditions and
ineffective regulation will hurt small-business owners. The pressures
of unrestrained competition will result in a diluted universal service
obligation. There is a real chance that the obligation will become
nothing more than a “Jurassic Park”
relic.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Small
businesses rely on the universal service obligation, access points and
the footfall created by post offices on the high street. Those
businesses are the key drivers for growth in our economy, and it is
vital at this time that they receive all the support that they need.
The Government should be helping, not harming, them. They need to grow
and innovate rather than change their business models to compensate for
a diluted universal service obligation and a change in the provision of
post office services. The Government have not thought through the
impact of the Bill on all members of our communities, who, without
strong protection for the USO, will be damaged.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is vital
that the link between Royal Mail and the Post Office remains. The
inclusion of post offices in the Royal Mail Group is historic, and
ensures a synergy between delivery and collection, leading to an
effective service. As illustrated by my hon. Friend the Member for
Llanelli, the idea of separating the Post Office from the Royal Mail is
such an outrageous thought that Government Members have convinced
themselves, I think, that the Bill will not do that, but one wonders
whether they can see the wood for the trees. The link between the two
is ensured by entering into a contract that confirms that the Post
Office is to be the primary retailer for the Royal Mail. That
guarantees one third of the Post Office’s business. Without that
income, there will be closures and substandard service. That contrasts
starkly with the current position, in which post offices are given the
security of contracts with Royal Mail. The Bill does nothing to
guarantee the inter-business agreement, which the Post Office so
heavily relies
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
privatised Royal Mail will renegotiate existing contracts in an effort
to reduce costs, and if a cheaper alternative is found the Post Office
will, in my view, be dropped more quickly than the Liberal Democrat
manifesto promises and
pledges.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Opening
up Royal Mail to the brute force of private markets will create a
situation where financial considerations squeeze out social
consequences and that is nowhere more true than with regard to Post
Office contracts.  As an IBA between Royal Mail and Post Office
Ltd  cannot be placed in legislation as it is a contractual
agreement, the Government have not managed to find another solution
that ensures that the future of the link between Royal Mail and Post
Office Ltd is protected. Amendments 74 and 75 offer the Minister a
solution to that problem and guarantee that the historic link between
Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd will remain.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000097">&#160;</a>

these amendments we can make certain that Ofcom is obliged to protect
post offices by including them as access points. The amendments will

free from the threat of the ever-changing nature of a private company.
Post offices will be secure regardless of the intentions of the
management at a privatised Royal Mail. Unless the Minister’s
intention is to see the link broken I can see no reason why he and
Government Members should not support these amendments and guarantee
the future of the post office network.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000098">&#160;</a>

amendments sends a message to all post offices that a privatised Royal
Mail may move away from using them and may find alternatives for access
points. Alternatively, if the Minister wants to stand up for post
offices, to guarantee their future and to put their minds at rest, he
should support these amendments and encourage his hon. Friends to do
the same. It is vital that the Minister considers these amendments. He
should not leap to his feet and begin by customarily christening
amendments in his rather tiresome way.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000099">&#160;</a>

that the regulatory framework laid out in the Bill is strong enough to
protect the service that so many of our constituents rely on, whether
it be small and medium-sized businesses or those that rely on the

relation to profit and loss with no consideration of the social and
economic impact. If the Minister chooses not to take these amendments

                           </strong> I rise to discuss amendments 74, 75, 78 and 89.
Amendment 74 would make it clear that Ofcom should include post office
branches as access points. Amendment 75 would make it clear that access
points include post offices. Amendment 78 would mean that the universal
service provider must be in compliance with a universal postal service
order under clause 29 and provide a universal service in compliance
with clause 30. The amendment includes post offices to be set in
regulation laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State. Amendment
89 refers to the universal service conditions to be set by Ofcom under
clause 35 and would add access points<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">Currently
the minimum set of universal services does not include post offices.
That would seem strange. As we know, other countries include
collections and deliveries on the one hand, and access points, counter
services and post offices on the other, as part of the universal
service obligation. The Dutch and the Germans are the two prominent
examples. Why do they do that? They do it because it is vital to do so
when a mail service is privatised; otherwise, the obvious way for
executives of a newly privatised mail service to make cuts and to
maximise their remuneration and bonuses is to cut costs. A simple way
to cut costs is to cut the number of post offices for which Royal Mail
will have to
pay.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
say that it seems strange not to include post offices, but it is only
strange if we think that one of the objectives of the public authority
is to set the level of public service, because that is what we are
talking about here; there is a tension between a commercial imperative
and a social utility. It is not strange if someone thinks that the
Government’s objective should be to sell any

                           </div>assets for the highest possible price. This is where I may be able to
add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull East said.
I do not think that the Minister wants the Post Office network to
decline—not at all—but he finds himself in a situation
where the intention is the objective of keeping a Post Office network
and that objective is in tension with the imperative to get a decent
sale price for Royal Mail. That is where the tension lies.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would say
that the whole of the Bill is deliberately structured to alert
potential buyers of Royal Mail to the fact that post offices are
expendable and therefore that potential buyers should take that into
account when bidding.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000104">&#160;</a>

again later, that everyone understands that the definition of access

This may be the pessimism of the intellect that Gramsci famously wrote
about, but I prefer to have the good intentions of the Secretary of
State in statute. I have asked the Minister whether he has read
“Politics as a Vocation,” because it is very clear that
good intentions do not matter; consequences matter. As the clause is
written, the Secretary of State can exclude services from the universal
service but he cannot add them. That point is worth

into statute provision for access points, and statutory criteria for

                           </strong> Again, that is a fair point, but statutory
provision is important. This is not an easy issue. The Minister has a
difficult task, because technology and how people live their lives has
made the services less heavily used. There is also the political
dimension, because a Liberal Democrat will have made much of his career
on tuition fees and post offices, but there are now difficulties in
both areas. I do not mean that as a partisan point. I have some
knowledge of the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire, and she has
campaigned on those issues very effectively in the past.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is a
difficult issue. The hon. Gentleman made a fair point on Germany having
12,000 post offices for 80 million people, but I would be
delighted to see statutory provision for post office numbers in the UK,
because it would give important reassurances to consumers. The
Minister’s optimism on the future of the post office network is
exhilarating in some ways. If he is so confident, I cannot see any
reason why he would oppose writing into statute the informal access
criteria that we have currently. I suspect the answer is—this is
not a criticism of him, because politicians have to deal with competing
imperatives—that if the Government want the money for the Royal
Mail privatisation, they have to make it worth the bidder’s
while. That is why the Minister is uneasy about writing statutory
provision.

                        <p class="tabbed">To
protect the post offices, the Minister should create a regulation that
defines the level of service, such that the informal Government access
criteria are maintained and, consequently, so is the overall number of
post offices. If the Minister genuinely believed his claims that a
purely commercial relationship between Royal Mail and the Post Office
would deliver that, he would have no reluctance in doing so. If he is
right, it would make no difference to the commercial reality and would
have the benefit of reassuring all stakeholders, because they would
have the best of both
worlds.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has stated on a number of occasions his confidence that
something like the IBA will continue after privatisation, when Royal
Mail and Post Office Ltd will be separate companies. He has also noted
statements from senior Royal Mail management to that
effect—statements that we heard in evidence. What do those
statements amount to? They amount to good intentions and rhetoric, as
opposed to something that we can hold on to and grasp
firmly—that is, statutory protection. The Minister admits that
he has never seen the IBA and that he will not see any future
iterations of it. He says that he does not know to what extent its
terms can be changed in accordance with the contract, and that no
Secretary of State or Minister would. In any event, the IBA could be
renegotiated at any point following privatisation, to the detriment of
Post Office Ltd. It happens all the time in the commercial
world.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000135">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s response to such an argument is to say, “Well,
Post Office Ltd will be in a strong bargaining position.” As the
Committee may know, I do not think that Post Office Ltd
vis-à-vis Royal Mail will be in a position of any strength in a
commercial negotiation. As we know from an answer that the Minister
gave us the other day, Post Office Ltd is one tenth of the size of
Royal Mail. It is dependent on securing Royal Mail’s contract
for counter services. After the separation of Post Office Ltd and Royal
Mail, any agreement between the two organisations will be purely
commercial as Royal Mail seeks profits and dividends. Bearing down on
suppliers such as Post Office Ltd will be inevitable and natural for a
privatised Royal Mail, which will also be working to cut costs. That is
what business does, and rightly so. It is also worth considering that
the bonuses of most of the senior executives—again, it is the
way of the world—will be dependent on cutting Royal
Mail’s
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000136">&#160;</a>

have a pat answer, but from the evidence we have heard it seems
unlikely that anyone will come in and challenge a privatised entity in
the letters business. So much depends on the status of the current IBA
and whether there is, as I strongly suspect—in fact, I am
sure—a hidden subsidy to Post Office Ltd. So much 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 537<a class="bkMark" name="Column537">&#160;</a>
                        </div>depends on that. The Minister will say, “We do not know what is
in the IBA.” He has said in the past that it is a purely
commercial agreement as it stands. They are entwined in one
organisation at the moment. We know from the evidence we heard that
Post Office Ltd’s board has four Royal Mail representatives out
of the six members, whereas Royal Mail Group has Paula Vennells. I
think one of the 11 members on the Royal Mail Group board is from Post
Office Ltd. In this entwined relationship—this sibling
relationship or whatever we want to call it—it is very likely
that Post Office Ltd will get a favourable contract, to put it no more
strongly than that. Would it not be a case of Royal Mail cutting off
its nose to spite its face if it pushed a hard bargain with a company
that is within its own group, and in which the boards are entwined? I
think the hon. Gentleman will agree that that is at least worth
considering.<p class="tabbed">When
we consider the interests of a privatised Royal Mail and the
executives, most of whom hope to go to a privatised Royal Mail, we must
treat their words with caution. The Minister insists that statutory
protection for post offices is unnecessary. We have heard that that is
not an approach taken in other countries. When the Dutch and Germans
privatised their post offices, they provided statutory protection,
because they did not want the privatised entity making profits by
cutting the post office network, which is an obvious way to do so. No
one is criticising the privatised entity for wanting to do that; it is
what private companies do in the commercial sector, as they have a
legal duty to maximise shareholder interest. The question is how to
frame regulation so that those natural imperatives of the privatised
entity are
constrained.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000138">&#160;</a>

the danger with his great concern—I am sure that it is not a

suggests that all private companies do is cut to make profits and that
they never innovate. It would be rather like a debate on telecoms
privatisation—I have not checked <em>Hansard</em> to see whether
that was debated in Committee—in which the only concerns were

governance by that stage. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that
the post office network seems an obvious place to start for a

According to his remarks, about a third of Post Office Ltd’s
funding comes from the IBA, and other moneys come from subsidy and from
whatever is generated in revenue. He has rightly referred to the fact
that the Government currently have a contract with POL, but my worry is
about what might happen in future. It is a gamble, and one that the
Minister has to make, certainly in terms of trying to generate more
revenue. His gamble is that we can put £1.3 billion in, and I am
sure that he would admit that not all that will be subsidy. The pie
chart showed that about 48% of it was going to be subsidy, so what is
that? My maths is not very good, but it will be about £650
million in subsidy, with the rest supplied in various ways, including
the roll-out of the new services.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000147">&#160;</a>

partial success would be a huge success, given the technological
changes, the different ways in which people live their lives and the
challenge of trying to get the Government to do everything through the
Post Office—it was pointed out earlier that that is like the
previous Government, which is a fair point. Unless the Government are
prepared to have the maintenance of the post office network as a
strategic imperative in everything that they do, even if that comes at
the expense of efficiency because things can be done quicker online,
the Post Office is in a difficult position. I suspect that that is what
happened under the previous Government.

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me a
chance to further explain our post office policy. We take a rather
different approach to providing Government services through the post
office network from that of the previous Government, when Ministers
from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills simply defended
the status quo. We think that if Departments want to be more efficient,
make savings in processing or other public services and introduce
online services, they should be encouraged to go ahead. Those people
who cannot go online should think of using the post office network.
That is a completely different, 21st-century approach that helps
Departments to make savings while ensuring that Government services are
accessible to all citizens, and it is why we have a better chance of
success than the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000150">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> More people are going online all the time. I
took the Minister to mean—he will correct me if I am
wrong—that although many people carry out transactions online,
the post office will provide services for people who do not. Is that a
fair assessment? The problem with that approach is that it is a
declining share of the market, and the number of people who are not
online will go down and down. Even my mother, who is 70, has started
doing things online. My father is nearly 90, and he has not. Perhaps
this is about 90-year-olds. All jokes aside, my point is
serious.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000151">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, and I am
glad that he is dealing with the impact that new technology is having
on the markets. He is right that it is a challenging problem, and I
have made no secret of the fact that sorting it out will require a
range of approaches. For some Government services, however, even those
who do almost everything online will need to use the post office. The
policy statement makes it clear that we wish to see the post office
network positioned to deal with things such as identity verification,
which will be required to help people digitally access more Government
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000152">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister has real enthusiasm for trying to
roll out services to the post office network. However, to use one of
his words, a lot of it is “musty”—we must do this,
but are we going to? We are dealing with a declining part of the
population that transacts business offline. The Government will provide
a subsidy and have a contract with Post Office Ltd to provide services.
However, what happens if the Minister’s laudable attempts fail
to turn round those 8,000 post offices, which is two thirds of the
network? Even if he partly succeeds, he will still fail. Unless he can
turn round 8,000 post offices, there will be a gaping hole at the heart
of Post Office’s revenue. That is where the IBA becomes
important. A third of any business’s income is important, but
this case is particularly important, because five years down the line,
the Minister might have rolled out some
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000153">&#160;</a>

the evidence session, part of the challenge in the digital era concerns
the reduction in mail services.<a class="bkMark" name="10120233000154">&#160;</a>
