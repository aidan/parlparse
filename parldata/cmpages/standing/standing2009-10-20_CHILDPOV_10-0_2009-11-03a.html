Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Good afternoon,
Mr. Key. May I be the first to welcome you to the last
sitting on the last day of our deliberations on this very important
Bill? It is good to have you back with
us.</div><a name="091103155000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
lunch, I had been speaking to the first part of amendment 7 about the
central importance of job creation being at the heart of local
authorities&#146; quest to eradicate child poverty in

amendment, which deals with family
resilience.</div><a name="091103155000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
will be relieved to hear, Mr. Key, that I do not intend to
go over the ground that I covered when we discussed family matters on a
prior amendment, but I would like to add a bit of new material to
support why  I think that proposed new sub-paragraph (ii) in
amendment 7 could usefully come into clause 21. I shall
start, if I may, by quoting from a document that I have been sent by
Relate, which I believe may be one of the organisations to which the
Financial Secretary referred when he said that the Government
give</div><a name="091103155000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#163;7
million to third-sector organisations that work with such
families&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Child
Poverty Public Bill Committee, </i>29 October 2009; c.
242.]</div><a name="091103155000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
a strong suspicion that Relate may be one of
them.</div><a name="091103155000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Relate
states, perhaps unsurprisingly from its point of
view:</div><a name="091103155000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Relationship
breakdown is a key cause of child poverty. Local Authorities cannot
tackle child poverty without tackling relationship
breakdown.&#148;</div><a name="091103155000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to make several points on the same theme. It
states:</div><a name="091103155000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Preventing
relationship breakdown wherever possible, and facilitating responsible
post-separation parenting increases the likelihood that households will
have at least one salary coming in&#148;,</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div><a name="091103155000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">and, as we have said
many times in this Committee, work is the best route out of poverty, so
it is obviously important. Relate also discusses
the</div><a name="091103155000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;large
number of non-resident parents contributing neither income nor
care&#148;</div><a name="091103155000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
far as their children are
concerned.</div><a name="091103155000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we talk about relationships, it is important to remember that
post-separation, relationships can be better or worse for the children.
If they are better, they can have a positive impact on income and
dealing with child poverty. Relate goes on to make several suggestions
about where work on that area could be done. It talks about
children&#146;s centres, work with primary care trusts and referrals
from general
practitioners.</div><a name="091103155000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon was correct when he said in our discussions
last week that he believed that I was involved with such organisations
in my constituency. In fact, last Thursday evening, I went from our
second sitting to meet the director of children&#146;s services for
my local authority, so that I could introduce her to a voluntary group
in my constituency that is hoping to work in that area with the local
authority.</div><a name="091103155000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have done some research on the background of the Ministers, and I
believe that I am right in saying that  the Under-Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland,
worked for the Children&#146;s Society in a prior life. I am sure
that she has avidly read the excellent publication, &#147;A Good
Childhood&#148;, which was brought out by the society. She will have
noted, as I have, at the top of page 22, the fact that children rate
more highly than their parents do the importance of good relationships
in a family and trying to avoid family breakdown. We know that, from a
child&#146;s perspective, that is incredibly
important.</div><a name="091103155000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
last organisation that I would like to pray in aid when talking about
the second part of amendment 7 is an excellent one: the Bristol
Community Family Trust, which is not far from the constituency of the
hon. Member for Northavon. It manages to reach one in three new mothers
in Bristol&#151;well over 900 mothers a year&#151;and mothers and
fathers, with its relationship course, &#147;Let&#146;s Stick
Together&#148;. All that is done in a non-stigmatising,
non-moralising way. It is not about hitting anyone over the head; it is
not about telling people that they do not have perfect lifestyles or
relationships. As I said last week, it is all about giving people the
skills and support to make a success of their lives. I agree with
Relate that it can have a critical impact on child poverty.</div>
<a name="091103155000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
amendment in the group&#151;not in my name but that of the hon.
Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North&#151;is
amendment 72, which adds to the clause consideration of</div>
<a name="091103155000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the levels of
benefit and tax credit take up among the eligible
populations&#148;.</div><a name="091103155000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an important point. The facts show that if every benefit and tax
credit to which families of children living in poverty are entitled
were taken up, at a stroke 400,000 would be taken out of poverty; that
is a significant figure. That would obviously help the Government and
all of us to move a long way towards reaching the child poverty
targets. The hon. Lady is on to something. The Government run take-up
campaigns across the benefit system for all groups, and they would
clearly have a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>significant impact on the issue that we are considering. For that
reason, I generally support the hon. Lady&#146;s
amendment.</div><a name="091103155000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="091103155000404"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): Good afternoon, Mr. Key.
I would like to say a brief word about amendment 72 and then
come back to amendment 7. Amendment 72 highlights the importance of
take-up. It is vital that where the state has identified a level of
income to which families with children are entitled, they receive that
entitlement. The key method of supporting low-income families with
children&#151;those with whom we are most concerned in the
Bill&#151;is the child tax credit, so I was surprised to see in the
households below average income statistics the figures for families
with children and their receipt of child tax credits. Table 4.4 shows
that of all 12.8 million children in the country, only 60 per cent. are
in families receiving child tax credit. That suggests that take-up
might be a significant issue. While it is true that child tax credit
does not apply to the entire income scale&#151;it cuts off at about
&#163;58,000&#151;that fact knocks out only about the richest 10
per cent. or so of families with dependent
children.</div><a name="091103155000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000405"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Helen
Goodman):</b> I am sorry to intervene, but could the hon.
Gentleman say that again,
please?</div><a name="091103155000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000406"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The whole thing? I was quoting a figure from table
4.4 of the households below average income report, page 65. It
categorises children according to the benefits that their parents
receive. It says that of the 12.8 million children in Britain, 60 per
cent. are in families receiving child tax credit. I would assume that
if every entitled family received the tax credit, the figure would be
about 90 per cent. We know that there is a slight lack of take-up by
case load in particular, which one might have thought would result in a
figure of 80, 78, or 75 per cent., or whatever. I was startled when I
looked at the figures to see 60 per cent., because that implies that
around a third of families who are entitled to child tax credit are not
getting it. That is a higher number than I have seen before. I am
starting with this point to give the Minister time to reflect on it.
Why are up to a third of those entitled to child tax credit not getting
it? Amendment 72 flags up the importance of take-up and, if I
understand that figure correctly, there is an important gap in the
system.</div>
<a name="091103155000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come back
to amendment 7 and what should be included in the regulations on the
local child poverty needs assessment, my feeling on the point about job
creation is that it is almost impossible to imagine a local child
poverty needs assessment that did not take account of the need for
jobs. It is inconceivable that one could have such an assessment and
strategy that did not take jobs into account, so sub-paragraph (i) of
amendment 7 is perhaps
unnecessary.</div><a name="091103155000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to say a word, however, about family resilience. In our earlier
debates, the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire would perhaps have
felt that those of us on the Committee who took a different perspective
from him were simply refusing to accept something that was blindingly
obvious and which was staring us in the face. Given that he might
anticipate being on the other side of the Committee as a Minister in
the Department for Work and Pensions in six months&#146; time, it is
worth probing his reasoning a little further.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div><a name="091103155000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman rightly pointed out that children of lone parents are twice
as likely&#151;that is how it looks from the figures, but they are
certainly significantly more likely&#151;to be in poverty than
children in two-parent families. From that, he infers the need for
amendment 7, which would include family resilience in the Bill, but I
want to give him one example of why we might reach the wrong policy
conclusion if we approach the issue in that
way.</div>
<a name="091103155000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
suppose that young women with low educational attainment and low
aspirations are more likely to have children young and outside a stable
couple relationship, which means that they are then more likely to
become lone parents and to be in poverty. They are likely to be in
poverty partly because their low educational attainment will mean that
any job that they get might not be very good and might be low paid, and
if they have young children, they will, of course, be in poverty
anyway. The problem, as it were, is the low educational attainment, not
lone parenthood per se, although that clearly makes life more
difficult. The policy response to such young women is not couple
therapy or Relate, but education, although perhaps the response would
involve parenting classes for those women&#146;s parents and all
sorts of other things.</div>
<a name="091103155000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is just
one example, and I will not labour the point, because we need to make
progress. What I am trying to say to the hon. Gentleman&#151;I want
to call him my hon. Friend because I think that he is sincere in what
he is saying&#151;is that just because someone in one group is more
likely to be poor than someone in another group, we should not think
that the title of that group tells us everything that we need to know
about them. Clearly, we want to keep stable couples and parents
together and we want to help people make healthy relationships, but if
our goal is to tackle child poverty, we have to see the big
picture&#151;why do people become lone parents?</div>
<a name="091103155000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing that we need to remember is that lone parenthood is not
principally about married couples splitting up, because most lone
parents have never been married. We have a whole set of policy
responses for young women who are lone parents and who have never been
married, and we have a set of responses for divorced people, people who
have had casual relationships and ex-cohabitees. Lone parenthood is
linked with poverty, but talking just about family resilience makes it
sound as though family resilience is the key to unlocking everything.
However, lone parenthood has diverse causes, and there are diverse
policy responses. Supporting couple relationships is a good thing to
do, but it is perhaps a smaller part of the overall picture than the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s simple statistical correlation might lead him
to conclude. That is all that I want to communicate.</div>
<a name="091103155000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the
issues in the amendment are important, but I am not sure that they need
spelling out in the Bill. I would, however, be interested to hear about
take-up, because the shortfall on child tax credit is apparently rather
large, so it should be a focus for action by local
authorities.</div>
<a name="091103155000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000407"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> May I begin by saying what a pleasure it is to
serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr.
Key?</div>
<a name="091103155000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
begin this mini-debate on amendments 7 and 72 by saying something about
the importance of job creation. To be honest, I find it totally
astonishing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>to be on the receiving end of the implied criticism that the Government
have not paid sufficient attention to job creation in their range of
policies. Job creation does not appear as one of the factors in the
clause because the provisions are about how, not what.</div>
<a name="091103155000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
attention of the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire to the vast
amount of work being done on job creation. First, for example, we have
the working neighbourhoods fund, which was introduced in April 2008 and
which consists of a &#163;1.5 billion three-year settlement. It is
distributed to the 61 local authorities with the worst concentrations
of worklessness, but the Conservative party opposes
it.</div>
<a name="091103155000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="091103155000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then,
there is the new future jobs fund, which is worth &#163;1 billion. It
aims to create 150,000 new jobs. Again, the Conservative party opposes
it. Then, there are apprenticeships. We have provided an &#163;11
million package to create 3,000 new apprenticeship opportunities.
Again, the Conservative party opposes it. The Conservative party has
opposed the flexible new deal, local employment partnerships, which are
helping 250,000 people into work, and routes to work, which will help
50,000 long-term unemployed young people to access existing
jobs.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000409"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Earlier, we discussed whether we should have a
specific reference to regional development agencies in the Bill. Both
Opposition parties say that they want to close down the RDAs, which
have been an absolute engine of job creation in the regions. David
Blanchflower, the former member of the Monetary Policy Committee, said
that the unemployment rate would be 5 million higher if the
Conservative party&#146;s plans were implemented. Opposition Members
really need to start thinking about these issues in a clearer and more
constructive manner.</div>
<a name="091103155000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 7
and 72 relate to clause 21, which sets out the requirement for local
authorities and their partners to prepare and publish a needs
assessment. That forms the basis of the joint local child poverty
strategy, which must be published under clause 22. Clause 21(2) and (3)
give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations that may
prescribe the contents of the needs assessment.</div>
<a name="091103155000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment
7, hon. Members suggest that the regulations made under clause 21
should require local authorities and their partners to consider job
creation and family resilience. We heard from witnesses on  20
October about the important work that local authorities and their
partners can carry out to tackle child poverty. It is clear that
supporting and improving outcomes for families and working with local
employers on the availability of jobs in their areas and the removal of
barriers to parental employment are important elements of effective
local child poverty strategy.</div>
<a name="091103155000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
those elements have a vital role, we also heard that we must not set
our partners in local government an impossible task. For the purposes
of the needs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>assessment, we must ensure that we do not impose undue burdens by asking
local authorities and their partners to measure issues on which they do
not have access to data and which they cannot measure. The issues as
framed and as highlighted by the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire are complex, and local authorities will not be in a
position to measure them directly.</div>
<a name="091103155000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now
to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks on family resilience. I am glad
that he has read the report from the Children&#146;s Society, but I
hope that he read in the appendix the acknowledgment to the person
whose idea it was to set up the inquiry into the condition of
childhood. The point about that excellent piece of work by the society
is that it looks at things from the child&#146;s perspective and
offers a complete picture of child well-being, while the Bill is about
child poverty, and they are not the same
issue.</div><a name="091103155000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me return, however, to the issue of parenting and resilience. In 2007,
a report on parenting and resilience commissioned by the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation described family resilience as a complex concept
that refers to a family&#146;s ability to manage in difficult
circumstances and to achieve outcomes that are better than anticipated
given the pressures that the family face. The report indicates that
resilience is difficult to measure and that approaches vary to child
resilience, parental resilience and family resilience. It is not clear
how a local authority or its partners would measure the concept as set
out in the amendment.</div>
<a name="091103155000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, the
hon. Gentleman takes an issue&#151;on this occasion, family
resilience&#151;asserts that it is important and says that it should
therefore be in the Bill. The remarks made by the hon. Member for
Northavon on that matter were eminently sensible. The problem that lone
parents face is worklessness. The hon. Gentleman might know that there
is a 55 per cent. chance that a child in a lone parent family is living
in poverty, if their parent is out of work. For a child living with a
workless couple, the chance increases to 68 per cent. I wish to draw
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the fact that it might not be
the family&#146;s status but the other things going on in that
family&#146;s life that are
significant.</div><a name="091103155000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
something is not in the Bill, that does not mean that it is not
important, nor that the Government are not paying attention to it. The
Department for Children, Schools and Families has a number of
programmes that support families in which there has been family
breakdown. It has &#163;5 million for pilots dealing with support for
separated parents. Over the next two years, we are providing &#163;7
million strategic funding to a number of third sector organisations
that work directly with families experiencing relationship conflict,
and we have provided &#163;3 million to third sector organisations
such as Relate. We have just announced an increase in the number of
family intervention projects. All those things are going on outside the
context of the Bill, and I therefore urge the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire not to confuse something that is important with
something that needs to be in the Bill. Another institution that we
have established, and which provides support to families, is Sure
Start. The Conservative party, of course, is not committed to
maintaining the level of funding for Sure Start
either.</div><a name="091103155000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall return to the draft regulations, which we have made available to
the Committee. They state that, alongside the other risk factors and
drivers of child poverty, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>needs assessment will require local authorities to consider the level of
both in and out-of-work poverty in their locality, and assess the
barriers to parental employment. The needs assessment will also set out
information about family size and structure, and require local partners
to assess the well-being of children in poverty in relation to each of
the five Every Child Matters outcomes. In that way, the needs
assessment will identify the employment and family support needs in the
local area. We will, of course, consult on the regulations before they
are
laid.</div><a name="091103155000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North is right
to highlight in amendment 72 the importance of ensuring that
parents take up all the benefits and tax credits to which they are
entitled.</div><a name="091103155000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="091103155000410"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Apart from being
concerned about the take-up of child tax credit, I am also extremely
concerned about the take-up of the child care element of it. That used
to be a separate tax credit&#151;the child care tax credit&#151;but
it is now a child care element of other tax credits. In the Treasury
Committee, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs representatives
were not able to say what that take-up was, even though there had
previously been problems with low take-up. Will my hon. Friend the
Minister say a bit more about that, and indicate whether the Government
might be able to provide some figures, if not now, at some later stage?
The ability to pay for child care is absolutely critical if parents,
particularly single parents, are to get
work.</div><a name="091103155000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000411"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Both my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for
Northavon have raised the take-up of tax credits, and my hon. Friend is
right that that is as important as the take-up of benefits. The latest
estimates that we have are for 2007-08, and suggest that take-up of
child tax credit is 81 per cent., rising to 92 per cent. for households
with incomes of less than &#163;10,000. This is a phenomenally high
take-up compared with, for example, the family income supplement, which
is the benefit that was aimed at the in-work poor 20 years
ago.</div><a name="091103155000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000412"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that figure. She
will know that take-up is measured in two ways: the proportion of the
money that is claimed and the proportion of people who claim. Could she
clarify whether her 81 per cent. or 90 per cent. numbers are
expenditure-based figures, in other words amounts of money? Does she
have the case load figures and can she explain the discrepancy between
the 60 per cent. in the household below average income figures and the
sorts of figures she is
quoting?</div><a name="091103155000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000413"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I will have to write to the hon.
Gentleman&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I will write to
the Committee on that
point.</div><a name="091103155000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to say something about what we are doing to improve take-up in
cities, as it is important. We set up the take-up task force chaired by
Sir Trevor Chinn, which published its report in the summer. Hon.
Members will no doubt have had an opportunity to look at that. In
essence that report proposes a more joined-up approach to encouraging
take-up. One thing we are doing is piloting the placement of HMRC
advisers in Sure Start children&#146;s centres to promote take-up and
reduce error 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>in tax credit claims. We are also piloting raising the childcare element
of the children&#146;s tax credit to 100 per cent&#151;in most
places it is 80 per cent.&#151;to see what impact that
has.</div><a name="091103155000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North
was not here to speak to her amendment, but I wanted to address those
points because they have been raised by other hon. Members. I hope that
the Committee will agree that it is important to leave the specific
detail of the issues that the needs assessment must cover to
regulations, rather than insert them in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="091103155000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000414"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Will my hon. Friend deal with the point about the
take-up of the child care element which the HMRC reps were not able to
answer? Or will she undertake to write to the Committee? It is a
specific element and its take-up has been heavily criticised. Nobody
quite knows why, on the most recent questioning, HMRC could not even
provide the figures. Will my hon. Friend look into that and let us
know, as it is such a key issue when it comes to tackling child
poverty?</div><a name="091103155000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000415"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Of course I will be happy to look into it. If the
information is available I will supply it in the letter to the
Committee that covers the take-up
questions.</div><a name="091103155000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I hope that the Committee will agree that it is important
that the requirements in the needs assessment regulations must be
deliverable by local authorities and their partners, but that the
issues of family support and employment, including take-up of benefits
and tax credits, are already covered by the draft regulations. I hope
that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire is reassured that I
have presented adequate draft regulations to the Committee that meet
his concerns and so will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="091103155000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000416"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I would like to respond to a number of points made
in the debate. I should like to reassure the hon. Member for Northavon
that I recognise that low educational attainment and aspiration are
fundamental to the issue we are discussing, as is the prospect of work
in terms of men whom women may want to partner or marry. Job creation
and family resilience are closely connected from that point of view. My
proposal would work alongside those two
areas.</div><a name="091103155000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry that the Minister responded in a semi-hostile way. I did not
fully understand her logic. She said that there were a number of
important areas but that did not mean that they should be in the Bill.
That logic slightly escapes me. There is perhaps an argument the other
way. If something is important, then perhaps it should be in the Bill.
She mentioned a number of issues and made a number of accusations, to
which I need to respond. She talked about the new deal. The fact is
that there are many critics of the new deal in her own party. If we
examine its effectiveness&#151;whether it has provided value for
money for the taxpayer and done the best possible job for the people
who have been through it&#151;and if we look at the churn, it is
clear that we should have higher aspirations. As taxpayers we should be
demanding slightly more for our money. That is where our thoughts on
welfare reform are heading, and I thought that that was where the
Government were heading as well.</div>

committed to providing even more apprenticeships. We recognise that
they are important. She is also right that my party is not a fan of
regional development agencies. When I referred to them this morning, I
was careful to include any organisations that might follow them. We,
perhaps like the Liberal Democrats, want a more local form of economic
regeneration. In my own area&#151;the east of England&#151;we have
little in common even with the Cambridge economy, and certainly not
with East Anglia&#146;s. There are arguments for localising the
important work of economic regeneration
more.</div><a name="091103155000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for Sure Start, I am sorry that the hon. Lady repeated her accusations.
They were tried by her party in the recent Norwich, North by-election,

can he suggest that he can maintain the current network of Sure Starts
and take out such a large chunk of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000420"></a>Andrew

to probe an issue that was covered in some detail this morning. I wish
to illustrate the difficulties that were raised particularly by the
local government representatives at their evidence session. There is a
problem in being able to show the relevance of the target that the
amendment would delete in the local government context. We considered
that in some detail this morning in relation to Paul Carter&#146;s
evidence and the difficulty over the 48,000 children. We discussed it
in terms of proxy targets, which covered quite a lot of the issue. It
will still be useful to give the Minister the opportunity to justify a
little more clearly than she did this morning the relevance of the
target to local government officers, who succinctly expressed the
difficulties of meeting
it.</div><a name="091103155000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000422"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
again, Mr. Key. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member
for Henley for bringing the Committee&#146;s attention to this point.
In part 2, the definition of child poverty is different from the one
that applies in part 1, which includes the duties on the Government.
The definition in part 2 is slightly narrower to exclude the persistent
poverty target, but it includes the relative low income target, which
uses the figure of 60 per cent. of median income.</div>
<a name="091103155000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we heard
from the experts in the evidence session on 20 October, that target is
one in which the key method of achievement tends to be through the tax
and benefits system. The evidence given by Richard Kemp from the Local
Government Association is helpful. He argued that local authorities
might have a role in safeguarding communities and preparing for new
industries and new opportunities. However, he said
that</div><a name="091103155000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
are other areas&#151;which might rightly be in the Bill&#151;where
you think that you have given us a duty to do something, but I will not
be able to have any effect on it because those levers are outside my
control. That is why we concentrate on the areas where we do have
control.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Child

discussed in this morning&#146;s debate about duties and what local
authorities can do, the 60 per cent. target&#151;I am not suggesting
that it is not valuable or that it is not important for the
Government&#151;poses practical difficulties for local authorities.
To put it another way, Councillor Kemp referred to the levers outside
his control. Given that the Bill sets an absolute low income target and
a combined low income and material deprivation target in clause
24&#151;those targets apply to local authorities&#151;what levers
do local authorities have that apply to the relative low income target,
but do not apply to the absolute low income target or the combined low
income and material deprivation targets? What does the clause 2 target
in clause 24 add to the Bill that cannot otherwise be achieved, given
what local authorities can practically do? We all recognise that local
authorities have a big role to play, but it is not clear how local
authorities, as opposed to central Government, can deliver that
target.</div><a name="091103155000083"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000423"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Let me first address the remarks made by the hon.
Member for Henley, who suggested removing the reference to the relative
low income target from clause 24(3). The clause sets out the definition
of child poverty that covers the needs assessment and local strategy.
Subsection (2) states:</div>
<a name="091103155000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
child is to be taken to be living in poverty if the child experiences
socio-economic disadvantage&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div><a name="091103155000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3) provides
that households experiencing socio-economic disadvantage include those
experiencing relative or absolute low income and material deprivation.
However, the definition in the clause is not limited to those
measurements, and local authorities may choose to use additional
measurements to determine levels of socio-economic disadvantage in
their area. It is not immediately clear what the hon. Gentleman intends
by his amendment, as it would not lessen the breadth of socio-economic
disadvantage. I understand that he is interested in the flexibility
that the definition in clause 24 affords to local partners
in assessing child poverty and taking action to address it,
particularly in relation to raising family income.</div>
<a name="091103155000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities and their partners understand their communities and are in
a position to reach them in a way that central Government cannot. They
have a clear role in raising family income and tackling child poverty,
by driving economic regeneration and neighbourhood renewal, providing
high-quality education in early years services, administering financial
help such as housing and council tax benefits for families on low
incomes, encouraging families to take up financial support, and joining
up national and local partners to provide personalised skills and
employment support.</div>
<a name="091103155000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning
we discussed the measurements to be used at local level, so I do not
need to delay the Committee significantly on that. I made it clear that
there were a range of measures, such as NI 116, the relative low income
child poverty indicator, the national indicator set, and the index of
multiple deprivation. Those measures cover child poverty and the range
of risk factors associated with it. Persistent poverty is not a narrow
definition, and I believe that we are consistent in the two parts of
the Bill.</div>
<a name="091103155000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
evidence session, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
mentioned the relative income measure, and said that he thought that it
was not relevant at a local level. I do not understand how something
can be relevant at a national level if it is not relevant at the
aggregation of a lot of local levels.</div>
<a name="091103155000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000424"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way as she
referred to a point that I raised during the evidence session. The
evidence that we received suggested that local authorities could play a
role, but that it would be difficult for them to focus on the 60 per
cent. target&#151;the relative low income target&#151;as they do
not have the levers to do that. They have the levers to focus on severe
poverty and more general issues, which could be swept up in some of the
other targets. I asked that question because that was where the
evidence was taking us.</div>
<a name="091103155000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000425"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I think that that pulls me back to my first
point, which is that national performance is an aggregation of the
local performances.</div>
<a name="091103155000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000426"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I will try to make this clearer. The difference
between national Government and local government is that local
government has some levers, to use Councillor Kemp&#146;s word, while
the national Government have other levers. The evidence of Councillor
Kemp suggested that the levers available to local government did not
lend themselves to the 60 per cent. target, but rather to other
targets.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div><a name="091103155000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000427"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is not quite
right. All the levers that are pulled&#151;to use the Heath Robinson
metaphor&#151;will, we hope, have an impact on the income measures.
Those could be actions taken at local authority level, such as job
creation, or things done at national level, such as on child tax credit
take-up. All those measures will have an impact. It could be that the
levers in the hands of central Government are more finely attuned, but
it is not true to say that things done by local government will not
have just as much impact on income levels. If they did not, there would
be no point to part 2 of the
Bill.</div><a name="091103155000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000428"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Will the Minister explain, therefore, why clause 24
provides a separate definition of child poverty? Why not just refer to
clauses 2 to
5?</div><a name="091103155000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000429"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I will come back to that, if the hon. Gentleman
will let
me.</div><a name="091103155000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman referred to subsection (2), which
states:</div><a name="091103155000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
child is taken to be living in poverty if the child experiences
socially economic
disadvantage&#148;,</div><a name="091103155000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
asked why we should include that in the Bill. By doing so, we can
promote activity with local authorities that goes beyond the targets,
which is something that he has promoted on many occasions&#151;both
for children in the looked-after sector, who are often perceived to be
at the bottom of the pile, and for families who might not fall under a
financial limit, but whose level of material well-being we are trying
to
improve.</div><a name="091103155000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000430"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving
way&#151;she is being generous. I agree that there is an opportunity
in the Bill to go further with regard to local authorities, because
they have the levers to address specific matters such as looked-after
children. The problem is that the evidence we received from the local
authorities was that they did not really have levers for the relative
poverty target. In that case, if we are to tailor our targets for
particular authorities and make them as relevant as possible, why do we
not tailor clause 24 a little more and take out the relative low income
target? We are trying to get an answer to that
question.</div><a name="091103155000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000431"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Although it is enjoyable to debate with the hon.
Gentleman, the proposal was only a probing amendment, and I am not
entirely convinced that this debate is taking us anywhere. My argument
is simple: we need to be consistent between what we do at local level
and what we do at national level. I really do not think that I can
helpfully add any more to what I have

know that there is no point to part 2 in its current form.
There is clearly a lack of understanding of how things work out on the
ground. The lack of levers and data on the ground will make
things particularly difficult for local government. However, I beg to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000435"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Albeit late in our proceedings, I wish to speak to
an amendment that would have a fundamental impact on the scope of the
Bill.</div><a name="091103155000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
25 gives a definition of a child, which is necessary for a child
poverty Bill. The definition used is familiar, as it refers to a person
under the age of 16 or those aged 16 to 18 years and eligible for the
receipt of child benefit. That definition is usually used in the
official
figures.</div><a name="091103155000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
32 would take the age in the Bill to 18 years, meaning that it would
cover all those under 18. If it were not accepted, surely we would be
doing a disservice to the purpose of the Bill, which is to tackle child
poverty. We are not using the definition of a child that is used in the
UN convention on the rights of the child. That is not a clincher, in
the sense that we can use whatever definition we want, but we are a
signatory to that UN convention and, under it, anyone under the age of
18 years&#151;regardless of whether they are studying or receiving
child benefit&#151;has the
right</div><a name="091103155000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
a standard of living adequate for the child&#146;s physical, mental,
spiritual, moral and social
development.&#148;</div><a name="091103155000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot understand why we want the Bill to distinguish between some
17-year-olds and others. We will be including under the Bill
17-year-olds who, on average, are more prosperous. Staying on at school
is correlated with the affluence of parents, as the Government
acknowledge, hence the existence of means-tested education maintenance
allowance. On average, those 17-year-olds who stay on at school come
from better-off households, yet those who drop out of the school system
at the age of 16, for example, will be excluded under the Bill. The
Bill thus excludes a series of vulnerable young
people.</div><a name="091103155000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first group who are not included is those famous NEETs&#151;16 and
17-year-olds not in education, employment or training&#151;of whom
there are an estimated 124,000. Surely, if we are concerned about child
poverty, a 16-year-old who is not being educated or trained, nor doing
a job, has to be pretty high up on our list of teenagers whom we are
bothered about. However, unless the Minister accepts amendment 32, the
Bill will exclude them. It will also exclude 16 and 17-year-olds living
independently, who do not count as children under the definition. It
will also exclude care levers, because they leave the care system at 16
and live independently. We know that that group has a very high risk of
poor outcomes, yet they are being
excluded.</div><a name="091103155000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000436"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I wanted to mention exactly that group. Many young
people come out of care and are dumped into bedsits by local
authorities that are, it seems, relieved to lose responsibility for
them. We are excluding that most vulnerable of groups&#151;they are
vulnerable to prostitution and all sorts of exploitation&#151;from
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>scope of a child poverty Bill. I hope that Ministers will listen to the
powerful point that the hon. Gentleman is
making.</div>
<a name="091103155000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000437"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; he puts the
point very well.</div>
<a name="091103155000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
issue surrounding defining a child by whatever the benefit regulations
of the day happen to be. We know what the child benefit rules are now,
but they could shift. A future Government could abolish child benefit
for the post-16 group, which, in turn, would exclude those people from
the scope of the Bill altogether. Alternatively, a Government could
means-test the benefit, so better-off 17-year-olds would be out and
poorer 17-year-olds in. The definition of a child could vary from year
to year, but not according to anything &#147;real&#148;, as it
were. From one year to the next, someone could cease to be a child, not
because they got a year older, but because the benefit rules had
changed, and that seems odd.</div>
<a name="091103155000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000438"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The deputy leader of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
party advocates means-testing child benefit. Is there a prospect that
the policy will come
in?</div><a name="091103155000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000439"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Not if we have anything to do with
it.</div><a name="091103155000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key point is that we need to define a child in common-sense terms that
accord with the spirit of the Bill. Why have just a child poverty Bill?
One could argue that we should have an adult poverty Bill or a
pensioner poverty Bill. We have a child poverty Bill because we are
talking about people who are growing up, dependent on others and at a
formative stage of life. That implies that the definition of a child
should not be linked to a particular set of benefits or to something
that might change over time. It certainly implies that vulnerable young
people should not be excluded. There could be a pair of twins&#151;it
must be a pair, I suppose&#151;one of whom was a child while the
other was not. That would be ludicrous, would it not? Under the Bill,
if one 17-year-old twin was at school and the other had dropped out,
one would be a child and one would not. Surely the Minister accepts
that that is absurd.</div>
<a name="091103155000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary might say, &#147;Ah yes, that is all very well.
We really care about unemployed 17-year-olds and we have all these
programmes to deal with them, but we need standard international
definitions,&#148; as he has argued in the past. There is nothing
stopping us having standard international definitions if all we want to
do is compare our statistics with other countries but, to return to an
earlier point, the Bill should be about the welfare of children and
young people in this country and we should have a definition that works
for that purpose. There is nothing stopping us collecting the figures
on other bases for international comparisons&#151;we are doing it
anyway and it is not a problem&#151;but let us have a definition that
goes up to 18. We have signed up to that definition under the
international convention. It would cover a lot of vulnerable young
people whose welfare is surely just as important&#151;if not in some
senses more important, in that it gives greater grounds for
worry&#151;as the welfare of the 17-year-olds who are within the
scope of the Bill who, on average, come from backgrounds that are more
affluent. We are including some young people whom we are less worried
about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div>because they are doing well, while arbitrarily and artificially
excluding some whom we have been more worried about. I commend the
amendment to the Committee.</div>
<a name="091103155000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000440"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
again, Mr. Key, in our final Committee
sitting.</div><a name="091103155000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon has explained the effect that amendments 31
and 32 would have, but I must say to him that our aim is to end child
poverty. We want, through the Bill, to meet the targets that are
applied to dependent children. My principal response to his case is
that we want the targets to relate to dependent children. He
acknowledged that in his remarks. When we talk about children in
ordinary parlance, we are talking about young people who are dependent
on others, and that is the group that the definition in the Bill
describes.</div><a name="091103155000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000441"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> When I heard myself talking about that, I thought,
&#147;Ooh, &#146;eck, have I just undermined my arguments?&#148;
However, a 17-year-old NEET is financially dependent on his or her
parents, so why preclude them from the
Bill?</div><a name="091103155000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000442"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The Bill addresses the issue of improving
children&#146;s living standards. It is right that the definition of
a child in the Bill should relate directly to the financial support
that the Government provide for families in respect of
children&#151;that is the effect of the clause. Under the definition,
a child is financially dependent on their parents. Many young people
over the age of 16 who are not in full-time education might well be
earning in their own right. They are not necessarily dependent, so they
are not covered by the measurement of child poverty. That sets the
boundary in the right place. The definition follows the approach that
is taken in the survey of family resources, which has been the main
survey used to measure child poverty since it began in 1993-94. The
definition was also used in earlier child poverty statistics. One
benefit of using that definition is that it gives us a continuous data
series that runs back to, I think,
1961.</div><a name="091103155000119"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000443"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the school
leaving age is going up to 18? By providing support through the
education maintenance allowance, which is highly valued in my
constituency, so that children may stay on at school beyond 16 to 18,
are not the Government providing more support to 16 to 18-year-olds
than has been given
previously?</div><a name="091103155000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000444"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right about the
increase in support for that group. I was going to mention the increase
in support for another group who have rightly been
mentioned&#151;care leavers. Support for that important group was
addressed by the Children and Young Persons Act 2008. My hon. Friend is
right to draw attention to the additional funding and support that we
are
providing.</div><a name="091103155000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon anticipated that I would make this next
point. If we are to meet the targets in the Bill in a sustainable way,
national and local strategies will need to go wider than the definition
of children that is used in the target, and will certainly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>cover youth unemployment and training. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Northampton, North has pointed out, we have raised the participation
age. We are also ensuring that all young people benefit from education
or training, whether combined with work or not, through the future jobs
fund, which supports young people into employment.</div>
<a name="091103155000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The European
Union has started to publish data on poverty among under-18s. On the
most recent data that it has published, for 2007, it is exactly the
same as the proportion in child poverty under the households with below
average income statistics. As the European Union series
emerges&#151;it was first published in 2005&#151;it will enable the
level of poverty in that group to be tracked.</div>
<a name="091103155000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall sum
up my argument with two points. First, it is right to refer to
dependent children in the way in which the Bill does, because that is
what most people understand by the term &#147;child&#148;.
Secondly, that approach has the great strength of giving us a
continuous data series for comparison, going back to 1961, I
think.</div><a name="091103155000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000445"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I am sure that my
former colleagues at the Institute for Fiscal Studies would enjoy
reworking the data back to 1961 on a slightly different definition. I
have to say that I am convinced by the argument. The Minister says,
&#147;We have done worthwhile things for 17-year-olds who are not
defined as children.&#148; I am sure that the Government have done
that, and can therefore get the credit for those things if they are
included in the scope of the Bill. We can have consistent data over
time on a range of definitions, because we know from the data what the
17-year-olds who were not in education were doing. We would therefore
know who is excluded and who we would want to start including, if we
agreed to the amendment. I return to my central point, which is that we
are making arbitrary and
artificial&#151;</div><a name="091103155000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000446"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> This is a small point, but I do not think that we
have the data going back to 1961 for under-18s in poverty&#151;that
would be difficult. However, we know the figure for children, as
defined in the
Bill.</div><a name="091103155000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000447"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> A 17-year-old who responded to the family
expenditure survey in 1961 as an adult, because they had left school,
would presumably have had to say what they were doing. I assume,
therefore, that the survey would show whether they were in employment
or getting benefits, and if they were getting benefits in their own
right they would have been counted as a separate benefit unit. I seem
to recall that the Minister had that data, but I am open to
correction.</div><a name="091103155000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

time.</div><a name="091103155000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
debates on the Bill have generally, I hope, been constructively
conducted, but there is no doubt that there is a view of the Bill that
could be described as cynical and sceptical, and which has been
advocated by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness on
one or two occasions. That view is that the Bill is essentially
distraction legislation. At the very point when the Government are
about to fail to meet their 2010 target, which has been in place since
the late 1990s, they have come up with a new idea&#151;a Bill to
enshrine a target for 2020. One can imagine someone sitting around
somewhere in the Treasury looking at forthcoming issues, spotting a bit
of a problem with the 2010 child poverty target and saying,
&#147;What are we going to do about it? We&#146;ll come up with a
Bill enshrining a target for 2020 and nobody will particularly mind,
because we have our eyes on the slightly more distant horizon and all
will be well&#148;. In other words, it is a case of, &#147;Do not
judge us on what we deliver, judge us on our intentions,&#148; which,
if one wanted to make a partisan point, has often been the approach of
this Government.</div>
<a name="091103155000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 1
intends to return us to the here and now&#151;the nitty-gritty of
delivery on previously announced targets to ensure that they do not go
by the wayside and that the distraction legislation approach does not
work. The Bill enshrines something more demanding than the 2010 target.
As the Financial Secretary said:</div>
<a name="091103155000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
arrangement that the Bill sets out is significantly more demanding for

we should not forget the 2010 target and I hope the Government do not

certainly not given up on it. In a moment, I will set out in further
detail why this new clause would be very
constructive.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000460"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I will speak at length while the hon. Gentleman has
a drink. The base line figure is 3.1 million, I think, for
the before-housing-costs measure in 1998-99, so getting halfway there
would be 1.55 million, if going halfway to zero. He has a figure of 1.7
million. Is that because he is going only halfway to 10 per cent.? I am
not quite sure why a figure of 1.7 million has been
chosen.</div><a name="091103155000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000461"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> That is the basis of the number, as I understand
it. The hon. Gentleman is now looking at me sceptically. On the basis
of the shortfall that the Government refer to, one sees a figure of
600,000 and at the moment we are on 2.3 million, so I think that that
was where we got the 1.7 million number.</div>
<a name="091103155000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000462"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I might be able to shed some light on this. The
base figure is 3.4 million children below the poverty line, so 50 per
cent. would be 1.7 million. The IFS estimate was that we would get to
1.1 million, hence the 600,000
figure.</div><a name="091103155000153"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000466"></a>Mr.

Political knockabout is holding this Government to account, ensuring
that cynicism is not the driving purpose behind a piece of legislation
dealing with such an important issue. The new clause is a perfect
opportunity for the Government to show that their intentions are not
cynical or there to distract, but serious and proper. If they accept
the new clause, they will show that they are prepared to be held to
account for 2010, as well as for their far away
promises.</div><a name="091103155000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000467"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend anticipates and exactly explains my
argument. New clause 1 is constructive. The purpose of the Bill,
described by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, is to hold
the Government&#146;s feet to the fire. That is a good expression,
but why should we not hold the Government&#146;s feet to the fire
with regard to the 2010 target? We also hear the argument that the Bill
forces Governments to have strategies and reports, and to focus their
mind. I think that argument is persuasive, but why not start that
process sooner rather than later? Why not have some analysis in a
proper report to Parliament on what has worked? Why has there been
progress in reducing the number of children in relative poverty living
in workless households, but not in working families, as pointed out by
the Institute for Public Policy Research? How much of the progress has
been because of income transfers, or other factors such as education,
child care, family breakdown and all the various points that we have
debated in Committee? Why did progress stall a couple of years ago? For
two years child poverty numbers went up and then stayed
static.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div><a name="091103155000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">All of that
could be addressed in a report that could provide useful analysis and
guidance for future actions. We could have a better appreciation of the
significance of the recession&#151;a point that has come up once or
twice during our proceedings. The evidence from the likes of the
Institute for Fiscal Studies is that the recession does not have a
straightforward negative impact on child poverty, although one might be
forgiven for thinking that it does, listening to some of the things
that Ministers have said&#151;in Department for Work and Pensions
questions on 29 June in
fact.</div><a name="091103155000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

infer from that that the current economic circumstances&#151;the
recession&#151;have driven child poverty up, but we know that not to
be the case. Child poverty is a relative measure and, because median
incomes tend to be hit harder by recession than those who are on
benefits, by and large there is a small negative effect. There is an
impact on the public finances and, to be fair, in the course of the
evidence session the Financial Secretary made it clear that that was
the concern. It is worth bearing in mind that there is a choice that is
often followed. I refer the Committee to the evidence given by Mike
Brewer:</div><a name="091103155000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government had a choice, particularly at the time of the fiscal
stimulus. They had a choice between where to spend the money and they
chose, for example, to keep the higher rate of personal allowance,
which they introduced under a personal, temporary measure, rather than
spend it on tax
credits.&#148;</div><a name="091103155000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mention that because the Government might have acted differently if
they had had to submit a report to Parliament in the near future
explaining the progress towards the 2010 target. Perhaps a bit of
hauling of the feet to the fire in the immediate future might change
policy decisions on the upcoming public borrowing
requirement.</div><a name="091103155000162"></a>

brought in by the Government before the election that never was if
Ministers had known that they would have to produce a report showing
the impacts? My hon. Friend will be aware that there are still losers

with the 10p tax issue. I felt strongly about it, but only in relation
to women between the ages of 60 and 64, for whom there has never been
any compensation. If the hon. Gentleman looks closely at what happened,
families with children, for the most part, were big gainers. I have
looked up the figures for my constituency. There were very large
amounts of money a week, not just 10p on the tax. The hon. Gentleman is
quite wrong about the impact that that measure had on families with
children, albeit that it impacted unfairly on other groups,
particularly women.</div>

Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness rightly says, it would

introduction of the
Bill.</div><a name="091103155000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000478"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I will be brief. A report on progress on the 2010
target would be welcome. I should explain my earlier intervention. When
the 1998-99 baseline figures were originally produced they were 3.1
million. The Government then changed to a different equivalence scale
which took them to 3.3 million. Then Northern Ireland was brought in
which takes us to 3.4 million. That explains my confusion. I apologise
for that. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
for not pointing it out at the time. However, it raises an intriguing
point about what constitutes progress towards a target that we used to
think was zero but now turns out to be 10 per cent.</div>
<a name="091103155000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am about
to try to get the Government off the hook slightly: if we make the 2010
goal attainable, they might try to attain it. If we start with 3.4
million and we are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>trying to get, not to zero in 2020, but to 1.2 million children, then
half way is not 1.7 million, it is 2.3 million. That would
be half way to the target, not half way to abolition because they have
given up on abolition. The current figure is not 2.3 million; it is 2.9
million and has been 2.9 million for the last five years. We have made
no progress on child poverty in the last five years. So even getting
from 2.9 million to 2.3 million would be a real achievement in those
three years.</div>
<a name="091103155000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps it
is naive of me to suggest this, but if the Chancellor knew that the
2010 goal was 2.3 million, not 1.7 million, he might think that it was
feasible and he might take measures in the pre-Budget statement, even
at this time. Could the Financial Secretary mention to the Chancellor
that, were he to take measures that would take a projected 600,000
children out of poverty by 2010, we would be prepared to regard that as
reaching the 2010 target? I am happy to place that on the record. It
raises a serious question about what constitutes progress on the Bill.
We thought that we were heading for zero. Now we know that we are only
heading for 10 per cent., so it is not quite as unattainable as we
originally thought.</div>
<a name="091103155000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000479"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> This is an honest inquiry. I am aware that Liberal
Democrat Members rarely converse about these matters. Has he cleared
that statement on the record with the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr.
Cable), as I would hate him to be taken by
surprise?</div><a name="091103155000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000480"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I shall do so during the imminent Division in the
House. I cannot see any reason why we would not want a report on
progress towards the 2010 target. We might have an argument about what
the 2010 target is, but a clause to that effect in the Bill would be
entirely welcome, regardless of whether it is in these precise words or
at this point in our deliberations. A report would be entirely
welcome.</div><a name="091103155000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000481"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the
new clause because it gets to the heart of some of what the Bill is
about. I understand that there is some cynicism among Opposition
Members, but I am surprised at what the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire has been saying. It seems to go something like this:
&#147;The Government, in order to distract attention from what
they&#146;re doing and because they&#146;re worried that they might
lose the election next spring, are trying to pass legislation that will
tie us lot into something that we don&#146;t particularly want to do.
Therefore, we&#146;re trying to push the ball back and talk about
what happens in 2010.&#148;</div>
<a name="091103155000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were the
Government doing that, it would be unworthy. It would also be unworthy
to use the Bill as a political ploy or dividing line. I do not think
that it is. I think that the vast mass of organisations that have given
us evidence are concerned about having a straightforward approach to
dealing with child poverty. To deal with the point made by the hon.
Member for Northavon, the reason why it is child poverty and not
everybody else&#146;s, is that all the statistics show, as he knows,
that children are the most likely people in this country to be in
poverty. They can do nothing about it because they are dependants. That
is also the point of defining the age range, although I agree that over
the next three, four or five years, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>attitudes towards 16 to 18-year-olds will change dramatically. We may
well have to go back and ask what a child is, because our understanding
of what young people between 16 and 18 should be doing is
changing.</div>
<a name="091103155000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
about the numbers, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire knows,
because he and I have sat on the Treasury Committee together and have
been through the figures, that the Government have always been
accountable for the figures. There has always been the opportunity to
press. There have always been criticisms of the fact that the 2010
target is challenging, that there were hiccups at certain points and
that it depends on the definition of poverty. One of the important
factors in the Bill is that we are not just looking at relative and
absolute poverty; it is about material deprivation as well, which is
stunningly
important.</div><a name="091103155000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000482"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As the hon. Lady says, the Government have always
published the figures and been accountable, the Treasury Committee asks
questions about them and so on. However, the view that the Government
have taken and that we have supported is that a statutory framework
would add some value. The point of new clause 1 is to include within
that statutory framework something to do with the 2010
target.</div><a name="091103155000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000483"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The hon. Gentleman has conceded that he was wrong
to be cynical, which I certainly welcome. In the years to come, I think
that issues of material deprivation will be more important than ever.
It was interesting that when Save the Children gave a presentation on
the subject, the issue that the young people brought up time and time
again was going on holiday. There was a time some years ago, when I was
a newspaper reporter, when if one talked about a family being in
poverty, someone would say, &#147;But do you know they&#146;ve got
a colour television set? They can&#146;t be poor.&#148; Now it
seems that people say, &#147;Well, they can&#146;t be poor, they go
on holiday.&#148; Actually, it is right that Parliament should assert
that children and families are entitled to go on holiday and have
friends round for tea. It is expected that children should have their
own bedroom and other such things. I hope that it will also be possible
to introduce measures about living space, which I discussed with my
hon. Friends the other
night.</div><a name="091103155000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000484"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The whole purpose of the Bill is to put child
poverty targets on to a statutory footing to ensure that Governments
take them seriously and deliver them. The purpose of the amendment is
to ensure that the 2010 target&#151;the immediate one&#151;is not
forgotten. I therefore hope that the hon. Lady will support the
amendment or tell us now why putting the 2010 target in the Bill is
harmful.</div><a name="091103155000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000485"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I will come to that. I agree that there has to be
transparency. It is also important that we are able to measure properly
what is happening and follow through the statistics. One of the most
important measures in tackling child poverty&#151;the only such
measure in the Budget or the previous year&#146;s PBR&#151;is the
change in housing benefit rules, which has come into force while the
Bill has been making its way through the House. The rules were to be
changed around October-November time so that more child benefits could
be retained rather than double-counted and clawed back. That was
worth&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div>hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire should remember this, because
he was on the Treasury Committee with me and we heard this
together&#151;either &#163;250 million or &#163;350 million,
which was calculated to get a certain number of children out of
poverty. I am sure that, as with the similar change in housing benefits
for pensioners, local authorities will have problems, but I suspect
that the change in housing benefit rules will ultimately lead to a
change in the numbers. That will probably happen next
spring.</div><a name="091103155000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked why it is necessary to
enshrine the measure in legislation, and we have discussed part 2 of
the Bill. It is important to recognise that there have been efforts to
address the issue and to get all the other agencies involved without a
statutory framework. That was done through the new deal for communities
programme, which was introduced in 2000 or 2001. The local strategic
partnerships were also set up so that all the agencies could come
together, starting with the poorest 25 per cent. of local authorities,
to bend their purchasing power to tackle poverty. While that had some
effect, it did not work particularly well, so it is important to have
legislation stating that all the agencies should work together to
tackle child poverty. There should be a statutory framework, not only
for the Government target, but also for local agencies and authorities
to bend their purchasing
power.</div><a name="091103155000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next issue is why we do not tack on to the Bill a provision that
requires the local agencies and authorities to say what they are doing
in three months&#146; time. The Government have been open about the
difficulties that they face in meeting next year&#146;s target. No
one is in any doubt about that: the Work and Pensions Committee has
probably looked at it, the Treasury Committee has certainly looked at
it and there have been questions in the House. We all know that there
are difficulties.</div>
<a name="091103155000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
could have been dramatically avoided if, instead of taking 2.5 per
cent. off VAT, we had spent the money and tacked it on to tax credits.
The hon. Gentleman might recall that that was one of the things that I
proposed on the Treasury Committee, but the other members were not
startlingly enthusiastic about it. The cost of the VAT cut was
&#163;2.6 billion, which was the exact amount needed to deal with
child
poverty.</div><a name="091103155000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000486"></a>Mr.

billion.</div><a name="091103155000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000487"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I recall that it was &#163;2.6 billion, but I
will look again at the figures. I have the disadvantage of not having
inspiration coming to me via pieces of paper while I speak. As I
recall&#151;I will look at the papers that we had at the
time&#151;</div><a name="091103155000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000488"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I think that I can help the hon. Lady, although I
was off the Treasury Committee by the time that this happened. The VAT
cut was worth &#163;12 billion. The increase in the personal
allowance, which was made permanent, was worth &#163;2.6 billion,
which could have been used for increasing tax
credits.</div><a name="091103155000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000489"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I recall that, at the
time, we could have said, &#147;Instead of tacking it on, we can
increase the tax credits and that will, at a stroke, deal with the
whole problem of child poverty.&#148; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>However, there was not a great mass of people jumping up and down
saying, &#147;That&#146;s a really clever idea.&#148; We need to
recognise that, although we all agree with the end of child poverty, we
are not always so happy about voting for the means to do it,
particularly when times and priorities are
tight.</div><a name="091103155000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000490"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The hon. Lady is making a persuasive case for new
clause 1. Does she think that, had the new clause included a statutory
obligation to put the report in place, that may have increased her
leverage and influence in the Committee and that she might have won
that
argument?</div><a name="091103155000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000491"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> No, I do not think that at all. That was some time
ago, when circumstances were different and we were looking at different
options. To make the first aim of the Bill, which is effectively being
passed in the new year, the production of a report in three
months&#146; time is not quite the point. The Bill is supposed to end
child poverty. However, I understand and share Committee
members&#146; concerns. It is a bit like the example of full
employment with unemployment still at 5 per cent., but in this case,
ending child poverty means that the figure is still 10 per
cent.</div><a name="091103155000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
passing legislation that has some challenging targets and a lot of
important measures that relate to changing the way that people work and
that considers the work of a range of local agencies to find ways to
co-operate and tackle a problem that has defied Governments for a good
period, it is not constructive to say that a report must be produced in
three
months.</div><a name="091103155000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000492"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I point out that quite the opposite is true?
There could be nothing better than a report on what progress the
Government have made, including what has worked and what has not, to
create the platform from which, based on a realistic assessment of past
efforts, we can move towards the diminution, if not the eradication, of
poverty among those who technically qualify as children under the
Minister&#146;s aim. Surely, it is the right thing to do: it is
focused on the now and on understanding what has gone on before, and it
informs the future. The hon. Lady should support the amendment, because
it is absolutely in line with what she has
said.</div><a name="091103155000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000493"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> It is actually a new clause, not an amendment. We
have had reports on what has happened with the 2010 targets. We have
had reports on what works and on what is projected to happen. I hope
that we will have some more measures in the autumn statement, which we
will get soon, that will help to deal with some of the problems that we
face tackling child poverty as we come out of the recession. It is not
very impressive to suggest passing legislation that will at first
produce a report, knowing about all the work that has gone into it and
knowing what issues and challenges are involved. That is more a
demonstration of Opposition petulance than of having a concerted
commitment to taking the powers in the legislation, which will be
difficult to implement. It will be challenging and will call on a whole
range of agencies to look again at some of their work and priorities,
and it will take some time for the effects to work through.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div><a name="091103155000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The focus
should be on getting the legislation and workings in place, and after a
reasonable time, we can come back, see how the legislation has worked
and ask, &#147;Has this way of getting local authorities to work
together and look at these measures worked?&#148; We also need to ask
how we are getting on with tackling not only absolute and relative
poverty, but material deprivation. There are some real challenges,
including in relation to
housing.</div><a name="091103155000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
very much hope that the result of the Bill will be to reduce child
poverty and that how we regard the issue will change. I also hope that
the legislation will make us much more intolerant of some of the
material deprivation that affects the lives of poor children, as well
as making us intolerant of the absolute and relative poverty in which,
unfortunately, too many children in this country still
live.</div><a name="091103155000202"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000494"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making some
important points. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire made the
point that, on the whole, there has been a constructive tone to these
debates. He is right, and I am glad that that has been the general tone
of the Committee. The arguments presented have not been
overstated&#151;there has been the odd exception, but on the whole
that has been true. I welcome such an approach.</div>
<a name="091103155000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
heard, the new clause would require the Secretary of State to publish a
report on progress towards reducing child poverty by half by 2010. I
suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the aim of such a report is, in
fact, already covered in the Bill, because clause 8 will require the
Secretary of State to publish a strategy that sets out the measures
that will be taken to meet the child poverty targets in clauses 2 to 5.
To ensure that the Secretary of State reports on the progress on
tackling child poverty, clause 13 will require the Secretary of State
to produce and lay before Parliament an annual progress
report.</div>
<a name="091103155000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through that
combination, what the hon. Gentleman is endeavouring to secure with the
new clause will be delivered, although it is true that it will happen a
little later&#151;I suppose that three months after the Bill&#146;s
Royal Assent is likely roughly to take us up to summer next year. The
process that I am describing will take a little bit longer. He said
that his aim is to keep feet to the fire regarding the 2010 target, but
he does not need to worry too much on that score. Feet will be kept to
the fire on that, as we have seen and, no doubt, will continue to
see.</div><a name="091103155000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon suggested that, according to one
interpretation, we would actually hit the 2010 target. His former
colleagues in the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that, on
the basis of the measures that have been announced, child poverty is
likely to reduce by 1.1 million by the end of the financial year
2010-11. On the calculations that the hon. Gentleman set out, that
would be halfway towards eradication as defined in the Bill&#151;it
is kind of the Liberal Democrat party to laud the Government&#146;s
success.</div>
<a name="091103155000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
way that we could look at the matter is in relation to the absolute
poverty target, which has already been halved. We could say that we hit
the target on that basis, but many people would accuse us of shifting
the goalposts rather radically if we did so. I think that it has always
been understood that the 2010 target meant a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>reduction to 1.7 million from 3.4 million, or that it related to the
number living below the relative poverty
line.</div><a name="091103155000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
I suggest to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire that, in
effect, what he wants to happen will happen in due course under the
arrangements already in the Bill. Having an extra report next summer is
not really going to help. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw the motion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000495"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his
comments. However, the strategy and reports contained in the Bill
relate specifically to the 2010 target. On that basis, new clause 1
would add something to the Bill. I shall therefore press for a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000527"></a>Steve

were doing.</div>
<a name="091103155000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have now
reached the final group of new clauses, which touch on a fundamental
point about the Bill&#151;whether it is possible to achieve the 2020
child poverty target with benefit rates that are not themselves above
the poverty line. Under new clause 2, someone who is wholly dependent
upon benefits or tax credits would have an income of at least 60 per
cent. of the median poverty line. New clause 4 was tabled by the hon.
Member for Beverley and Holderness, and I have added my name to it. I
know that the Committee appreciated hearing the evidence of Rev. Paul
Nicholson and the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, who suggested amendments along
these lines. I shall return to new clause 4 in a moment.</div>
<a name="091103155000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 2
is fundamental. We talked earlier about levers and what local and
central Government can do. New clause 2 is about what central
Government can  do and the rate of social security benefits and
tax credits. If we do not accept new clause 2, there is a logical
inconsistency in the Government&#146;s position. To quote the Bill,
they want to &#147;eradicate&#148; child poverty, but they are not
prepared to set the rates of benefits and tax credits at levels that
lift people clear of the poverty
line.</div><a name="091103155000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="091103155000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
rhetoric at moments such as this is, &#147;Yes, but we do not want
people on benefits. We want them in work.&#148; Unless we are going
to have full employment, nobody out of work and nobody at home looking
after their children, there will always be somebody on benefits and tax
credits. The question is whether it is acceptable to have a Bill about
eradicating child poverty and an explicit lever of Government policy
that puts people into child poverty. It is that fundamental
inconsistency that we are seeking to raise through new clause
2.</div>
<a name="091103155000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
spirit of inquiry, I asked the House of Commons Library staff to do
some sums for me, which they are always pleased to do. I asked them to
compare the poverty line in the Bill&#151;60 per cent. of
median&#151;with what somebody wholly dependent on benefits and tax
credits would have to live on. They came up with some very interesting
figures. They calculated that a lone parent on benefits and tax
credits&#151;getting average amounts of housing benefit I
assume&#151;is already clear of the poverty line. That does not mean
that there are no lone parents living in poverty. The House of Commons
Library figures show that taking the Government&#146;s tax benefit
model tables and assuming full take-up with people getting everything
to which they are entitled, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>including, I think, an average amount of housing benefit, a lone parent
would already be clear of the 60 per cent. median poverty line.
However, the figures also show us that many lone parents are not clear
of the 60 per cent. median poverty line. That raises an issue of why
not, to which we shall come back.</div>
<a name="091103155000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Couples,
interestingly, are not clear of the poverty line. On average, a couple
with one child, getting all the benefits and tax credits to which they
are entitled, based on the tax benefit model tables, is 7 per cent.
below the poverty line and a couple with two children is 11 per cent.
below the poverty line. On the basis of those figures, the Government
are paying couples with children a benefit and tax credit rate below
the poverty line while trying to pass legislation to eradicate child
poverty.</div><a name="091103155000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000528"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Has the hon. Gentleman just identified or described
what is sometimes called the couples
penalty?</div><a name="091103155000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000529"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> No, for reasons that I will explain. There is a fair
point about rates of benefits and tax credits to couples relative to
their poverty line, which is different from that of lone parents. There
are relativities in the system. Why do lone parents get more money? It
is not necessarily pro rata to their needs but because they are, on
average, more deprived in other ways. The amount they are paid in
benefits and tax credits is trying to do something else, as well as
meet needs.</div>
<a name="091103155000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000530"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I asked the Library to produce similar
figures&#151;though not for the same purpose&#151;at the time of
the 10p tax issue or disaster, whatever one wants to call it. It was
particularly marked that in two-parent households with children, income
and poverty levels were entirely dependent on quite small changes to
the number of hours worked. If both parents worked a few hours or one
of them worked full time, the relative changes in the income level were
marked. Could the hon. Gentleman say how the figures he has would look
if one person did part-time work or if one worked full time, so that
their entitlements
changed?</div><a name="091103155000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000531"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> To be clear about the figures I am using, the
question I asked was, &#147;What would be the income of a couple with
children wholly dependent on benefits?&#148; In other words, the bit
of their income that the state controls. That is not to do with wages.
If they are earning, as the hon. Lady rightly says, there can be quite
big jumps as soon as they do 16 hours or whatever it happens to be. My
point is that there will always be families with children, couples and
lone parents wholly dependent on benefits and tax credits. It would be
odd of the Government to set benefit and tax credit payments below
their own poverty line, when they are passing legislation to eradicate
child poverty. I do not see how those measures can sit together. That
is linked to the minimum income standard argument that we will
discuss
later.</div><a name="091103155000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have discussed a theoretical situation with a hypothetical lone parent
and couple. The actual situation is much worse. Half of the children in
poverty are in non-working households; 30 per cent. have non-working
lone parents and 19 per cent. are in non-working two-parent households.
That means that almost 1.5 million of the 2.9 million children in
poverty are wholly dependent on benefits or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>tax credits. Even if we could deal with the 1.5 million children from
working households who are in poverty by providing better child care,
education, training  and jobs, we would be left with more than
1.2 million children below the Government&#146;s poverty line and
would fail to meet our 2020
target.</div><a name="091103155000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
Governments have set benefit and tax credit rates high enough to lift
people clear of poverty. I have moved from the hypothetical to the
real: 30 per cent. of children in poverty have lone parents. There is
no reason why they are in poverty other than the level of benefits and
tax
credits.</div><a name="091103155000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000532"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s logic is impeccable.
What assessment has he made of the effect on incentives to work if
benefits were raised to remove those families from poverty? Even if
poverty is technically eradicated under our relative definition, will
not the culture of worklessness and other problems persist if families
do not gain the benefit of being in the
workplace?</div><a name="091103155000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000533"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. There are many
trade-offs in these matters, and he highlights
one.</div><a name="091103155000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point is that we can do one of two things. We could say that we are
legislating to stop people living in poverty, which we define as being
below a certain level. If we are aiming to eradicate poverty, another
arm of Government cannot leave people in poverty. The other option is
to say that it is a specific aim of Government policy to pay people
below the poverty line so that they are driven into work. Under that
world view, driving people into work is more important than people
having a standard of living above the poverty line. We cannot do both
things at the same time, but the Bill tries to  do
that.</div><a name="091103155000265"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000534"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a persuasive case. Like
the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, I have anxieties about
this discussion. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon.
Member for Northavon is saying, but I am concerned about the potential
for creating regional ghettos. Parents who have been out  of
work for a long period are likely to be in areas of profound market
failure, where employment is hard to come by. I am not saying that the
benefits system is what it should be, but if we provide an even better
benefits system to prevent people from being in poverty, we may end up
consigning generation after generation to increased dependence on the
state. Does he share that
concern?</div><a name="091103155000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000535"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. One
measure of poverty in the Bill is persistent poverty. How can we avoid
children living in persistent poverty in such unemployment blackspots?
We can and do try to get mum or dad&#151;or both&#151;into work.
However, many are dependent on benefits for three years out of four. If
we do not give them enough to live on, relative to the thresholds, we
will not achieve the target in the Bill. We could set benefits at such
a level that we drive people to take jobs, come what may, because they
cannot otherwise survive. My worry is that we are saying inconsistent
things.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div><a name="091103155000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000536"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a logical and analytical
dissection of a real issue. I am not sure what the answer is, and I am
not sure that he is
either.</div>
<a name="091103155000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000537"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I suppose that I am asking the Government to be
explicit about what they do. Do the Government set benefit levels to
lift people out of poverty? Clearly not. We define poverty in the Bill,
and benefits and tax credits are not enough to lift a couple out of
poverty. What are the Government doing? Will they state explicitly that
when benefit levels are set, they are not trying to lift people out of
poverty, but seeking to provide people with short-term relief as a
temporary measure for something else? What about long-term sick and
disabled people and the argument, &#147;We want them to get a
job&#148;? A set of people exists who are not going to get a job.
What do we say about those people if we consign them to long-term
dependence on a rate of benefit that we have spent the last three weeks
defining as poverty? That is my point.</div>
<a name="091103155000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000538"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The hon. Gentleman spoke about the number of
two-adult households that live in poverty, which is very striking. Does
he agree&#151;he hinted at this point&#151;that often in those
families, at least one adult is not capable of working? Often, someone
is not able to work because of a disability or a long-term illness.
Sometimes, they have been involved in crime and are in and out of
prison, or they might be transient and unable to work. Does he agree
that there are often explanations of why two-adult households that do
not work and live in poverty are in that position? They will sometimes
be attracting other benefits.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000539"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Absolutely. That reinforces my point. The glib
response to my point is, &#147;Yes, but work is the answer. Work,
work, work. Let&#146;s not pay people too much money because it
discourages them from working. The real way to get people out of
poverty is to get them to work.&#148; I wonder whether there will
always be more than 1.2 million children living in households that are
wholly dependent on benefit, because their parents are long-term
unemployed, sick, temporarily unemployed, or whatever. Unless benefit
levels are set at or above  the poverty line, is it physically
possible to achieve the 2020 goal?</div>
<a name="091103155000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">What has
frustrated me about our discussions&#151;I did not think about this
until I looked at the numbers&#151;is that until we ask ourselves
about the right level of benefits relative to the poverty line, we
cannot think about whether we will ever achieve these goals. That comes
back to our 2017, panicky, pulling-the-levers-of-income-transfers
point.</div>
<a name="091103155000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give
one more example of my point. For a low-income household, it is
something even more alarming. The risk of being in poverty changes
according to whether someone is on a certain benefit. The national
average for the risk of living in poverty is 29 per cent.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am sorry, there is a 23 per
cent. risk. Children whose parents claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance
have a 70 per cent. risk of living in poverty. If their parents are on
income support, it is a 54 per cent. risk, and if their parents claim
working tax credit, it is a  29 per cent. risk&#151;that is
the number I read out by mistake.</div>
<a name="091103155000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">A child is
three times as likely to live in poverty if their parents claim
JSA&#151;of course, because they are unemployed. However, the point
is that JSA is set by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>Government. Income support and working tax credit are set by the
Government. The Government explicitly set benefit rates that inflict
three times the risk of living in poverty on those children whose
living standards they
determine.</div>
<a name="091103155000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000540"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I entirely accept the logic of what the hon.
Gentleman says. Regardless of the legislation, does he believe that we
should set benefit rates above the poverty line? Is that the right
thing to do in the broadest sense, regardless of the Bill? Is that the
right policy?</div>
<a name="091103155000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000541"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> This is where new clause 4 comes in. I am saying
that, if the poverty thresholds and the targets in the Bill mean
anything, we should at least think about those thresholds when setting
benefit rates. We patently are not doing that. It would cost a lot of
money&#151;I do not know how much because the numbers are quite
complicated, but it would be billions of pounds, and I am certainly not
committing to that&#151;but if we set benefit rates each year without
thinking about the thresholds on which we are legislating, we might as
well give up as we are not going to achieve our goals. That is my
point.</div>
<a name="091103155000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000542"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I remember reading those figures as  well,
although I might have been looking those for a different year. However,
I think that the group that is most likely to be in poverty is families
on housing benefit. Being on that benefit is one of the prime
indicators of poverty. A measure that allows families on housing
benefit to retain more of their child benefit is an effective way of
tackling of chid poverty, because it puts more money into exactly
families that are at the highest risk of
poverty.</div><a name="091103155000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="091103155000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000543"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The hon. Lady is right. There is a 53 per cent. risk
for people on housing benefit, which is higher than the average, but
still lower than the risk for those on jobseeker&#146;s allowance. I
have no problem with helping families on housing benefits&#151;they
are, on average, a poor group who should be helped. However, surely the
Treasury has worked out internally whether we will ever achieve the
goal of the Bill as long as we pay benefits below the poverty line,
which is what we are doing. Is it possible to achieve the 2020 target
without paying benefits and tax credits at or above the 60 per cent.
median? It might not be. Furthermore, a single parent who claims
everything should be clear of the poverty line, but 30 per
cent. of children in poverty are the children of single parents on
benefits. Why are so many of them still below the poverty
line?</div><a name="091103155000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
let me turn to the issue of minimum income standards, which is
addressed by new clause 4&#151;I shall speak to it now to save me
from coming back to it. I have suggested setting benefit levels by
making them relative to the poverty line under the Bill, but another
attractive approach would be to make them relative to what people need
to live on&#151;the Joseph Rowntree Foundation used to talk about
&#147;subsistence&#148; and &#147;modest but adequate&#148;
levels. The measure would enable an intelligent discussion about the
adequacy of benefit levels, which I am afraid we do not have in British
politics at the moment. We simply set benefit levels  on the
basis of what they were the previous year, plus a bit more.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div><a name="091103155000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every
Government have been terrified of opening a can of worms by asking how
much is enough to live on. However, that is done in plenty of other
countries, such as Norway, Sweden, Germany and Canada. Minimum income
standards are not novel. Unless and until we talk about how much we are
paying people who have no other income and how that relates to their
need, I am not sure that we can address the issue of child poverty
properly. The living standards of adults without children have fallen
massively in the past 15 years, as they were the group whose benefits
were least prioritised. Benefits for children and pensioners are linked
to earnings, but there are groups of people who are highly dependent on
benefits whose living standards have fallen and fallen, and who cannot
attain the &#147;modest but adequate&#148;
benchmark.</div><a name="091103155000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall conclude my remarks by saying that all I am pleading for is that
we cease setting benefit levels arbitrarily. Benefit levels now are
essentially what they were post war, when most of the current situation
was invented. Benefits have been uprated on a whole variety of ad-hoc
bases with no relation to anything outside&#151;that is the key. When
we are setting benefit and tax credit levels, let us relate them to
something real, whether that is the definition of poverty in the Bill,
or a minimum income standard that is needed for someone to have a
modest and adequate standard of living, rather than just plucking them
out of the air and saying, &#147;How much cash do we have this year?
Let&#146;s add inflation, plus a little bit.&#148; We should set
benefits objectively, which would be a firmer foundation for tackling
child poverty in the
future.</div><a name="091103155000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000544"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is my pleasure to have tabled new clause 4, on
which the hon. Member for Northavon just commented. The new clause sets
out an entirely different approach. Nowhere in the Government&#146;s
measurements of poverty is there any estimate of what it costs per week
to live healthily in the UK. Low income is a statistic, not a measure
of the weekly cost of items in a family budget. The centre for research
in social policy at Loughborough university and the family budget unit
at the university of York define a minimum income standard as
follows:</div><a name="091103155000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
minimum standard of living in Britain today includes, but is more than
just, food, clothes and shelter. It is about having what you need in
order to have the opportunities and choices necessary to participate in
society.&#148;</div><a name="091103155000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government themselves, in the explanatory notes to the Bill,
state:</div><a name="091103155000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children
are materially deprived if they live in households that cannot afford a
range of basic activities, such as...school trips for the
children, or celebrations on special occasions, or if they cannot
afford basic material goods, such as fuel to keep their home
warm.&#148;</div><a name="091103155000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
targets in the Bill must be credible. It would be offensive to claim
credit for meeting a statistical target, or making progress towards it,
if the target means nothing to children living in households lacking
basic material goods. To avoid that, I suggest that we must take
minimum income standards into consideration to ensure that the income
distribution calculation of the poverty threshold never falls below the
income required to meet basic
costs.</div><a name="091103155000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000545"></a>Ms

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000546"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I shall give way to the hon. Lady in a moment, if
I
may.</div><a name="091103155000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
new clause does not prescribe what the Government must do, but it does
suggest that they must keep up to date an assessment of what a minimum
income standard would look like. That would at least allow policy
makers to compare what that looks like with the actual moneys that
families receive. This is the right time to demand a proper,
evidence-based minimum income standards methodology against which to
check the adequacy of the Government&#146;s income
thresholds.</div><a name="091103155000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000547"></a>Ms

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000548"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I will, as I said, give way to the hon. Lady in a
moment.</div><a name="091103155000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon refused to commit to, or say that he
necessarily supported, raising the benefits threshold, despite having
pointed out the logical inconsistency of a Bill that says that it will
eradicate child poverty but none the less does not ensure that benefit
levels put families above the child poverty level. The right hon.
Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) always puts the case that
a combination is needed. Perhaps we are talking about more generous
benefits combined with time limits on the period for which people can
access them. I do not blame the hon. Member for Northavon for not
taking an intervention on this point, as he had been generous at taking
interventions, but if I had been allowed to intervene yet again, I
would have asked whether he thought that more generous benefits coupled
with time limits might have been an appropriate
approach.</div><a name="091103155000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 would not oblige the Government to change what they do, but it
would mean that they would have to provide the information that I
described, against which one could then measure actual outcomes,
especially if any Government&#151;whichever party was in
power&#151;claimed to be serious about eradicating child
poverty.</div><a name="091103155000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000549"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Given that the Conservative party did not support
the minimum wage, which was the basic
underpinning&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>There is no point
Conservative Members groaning about it. The minimum wage represented
the basic underpinning of the whole tax credits system&#151;there has
to be a minimum wage to be able to have the tax credits. I do not think
that that party even supported the minimum income guarantee for
pensioners. Given that, how on earth does anyone think that that party
will be taken seriously when talking about minimum income
standards?</div><a name="091103155000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000550"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Some of my colleagues had anticipated the quality
of that intervention. We might as well discuss Disraeli or CND, which
doubtless features in the hon. Lady&#146;s past. We have to deal with
policy today. If she bothered to read the new clause, she would see
that it does not say that these amounts must necessarily be paid out.
It says that the Government should publish and maintain the
information, which anyone&#151;child 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>poverty campaigners and so on&#151;could use as a lever with which to
engage with the Government and hold them to account on eradicating
child poverty. Despite the hon. Lady&#146;s years on the Treasury
Committee, I think that she fails to understand the combination of tax
credits and the minimum wage. Of course, the minimum wage&#146;s
actual impact, given the provision of tax credits, is rather more
slight than perhaps she would have us
believe.</div><a name="091103155000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000551"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> In the interests of not ending the harmony that we
have enjoyed in Committee, I will support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
new clause. Does he agree that having benchmarks for different sorts of
families would allow us, for the first time, to assess whether the
benefits structure disadvantages particular families? For example, the
benefit levels for families with three children or with one child could
be compared with the needs of such families. I do not have a strong
feeling on whether the benefits system adequately compensates for the
costs of additional children, so the benchmarks would help us to do
that. That would give us some useful benchmarks for families with
different numbers of children, or for pensioners as opposed to
non-pensioners.</div><a name="091103155000295"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000552"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I completely agree; obviously I defer to the hon.
Gentleman on data gathering. Those benchmarks would provide another way
of looking at benefits and, in the context of the Bill, at child
poverty and the reality of what it is like to live in families with
such incomes. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, as that approach
would help us to understand better the granularity of poverty and the
way in which it impacts differently on families with different
make-ups. He has already noted that, under the existing set-up, couples
technically appear to be more likely to be in poverty, when claiming
benefits, than a lone parent&#151;that is the so-called couples
penalty. Although I hope that the Government will consider the new
clause, it is probing, and I have spoken to it in that
spirit.</div>
<a name="091103155000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000553"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> We have had a really important debate, and I am
grateful to the hon. Member for Northavon for setting out so clearly
and cogently his case for new clause 2. He claimed that the Bill will
be fundamentally intellectually incoherent and dishonest unless we have
an answer to his question. Notwithstanding the fact that he said he was
not committing his party to spending the money required to bring those
benefits up to the level that would bring all the groups he talked
about out of poverty, the fact remains that he has identified an
inconsistency between what the Bill states it will do and the fact that
benefits are currently set below the poverty targets in clauses 2 to
5.</div><a name="091103155000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a couple of bigger questions that underlie the whole debate. The
issue of work incentives has been raised&#151;absolutely
correctly&#151;by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
Concern was raised about the fact that one could perversely trap
communities&#151;if not in poverty then in the benefits
system&#151;by increasing benefits to a level that leads to problems
with work incentives. The Treasury monitors that issue closely and
looked at it extremely carefully when the issue of income disregards
was addressed, so I shall listen with great interest to what the
Minster says about work incentives.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div><a name="091103155000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
huge issue that is relevant to the debate is that of the economic and
fiscal circumstances within clause 15 and the overall fiscal envelope
in which the benefits system exists. It is already large and adding
significantly to the debt and deficit problems that the Government
face. We need a wider discussion about that and to be absolutely clear
on the overall limits before going down that
route.</div><a name="091103155000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to new clause 4, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Beverley and Holderness,  I noted what he said and was
reminded of aspects of  our discussions about the adequacy or
inadequacy of clause 4, which sets out the absolute low
income target within the Bill, when several hon. Members commented that
they did not think that that was particularly demanding or even
especially useful. My hon. Friend might be on to something there, which
suggests that the minimum income standard route could be an alternative
for examining that matter.</div>
<a name="091103155000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northavon mentioned several European countries with a
similar methodology. I picked up in the course of my reading that a
minimum income standards approach is used in America. It is based on
the cost of a basic but nutritious diet, and then there are dozens of
different poverty lines for different types of household, and they are
updated each year to take account of general price
inflation.</div><a name="091103155000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="091103155000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Groups
that dislike that way of looking at poverty&#151;I believe that the
IFS has at times been among them&#151;have said that that would lead
to too small a group being classified as being in poverty, and that
might be a reasonable objection. However, it is interesting to note
that, despite the use in the United States of minimum income
standards-type poverty definitions, the official US poverty rate has
fallen by less than 3 per cent. in  40 years, which would tend
to suggest that people do not get left behind as economic growth
happens, because the figures are updated according to what it costs to
feed a family. The standards actually include more than
food.</div><a name="091103155000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been an important and interesting debate. My hon. Friend the Member
for Beverley and Holderness said that new clause 4 was a probing
amendment. I shall listen with interest to what the Government say
about it, but he could well be on to something, and the new clause
might give us slightly more useful data than clause 4
would.</div><a name="091103155000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000554"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> The Bill makes a clear and robust commitment to
eradicating child poverty. It is clear in clause 8(5), which covers the
strategy, that financial support is an important building block of an
effective child poverty strategy. We will consider all potential
methods of achieving our child poverty targets when we develop our
strategies, including assessing the role of support for those who
cannot work. I fully appreciate the good intention behind the new
clauses, but we do not believe that they are necessary in practice. It
could actually be unhelpful to include them in the Bill, for reasons
that I shall set
out.</div><a name="091103155000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are committed to ensuring that the tax and benefits system provides
adequate financial support. Families in the poorest one fifth of the
population are &#163;4,750 a year better
off&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000555"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> As I was saying, we are committed to ensuring
that the tax and benefits system provides adequate financial support.
Families in the poorest one fifth of the population are &#163;4,750
per year better off as a result of personal tax and benefit changes
since 1997. I would like to draw hon. Members&#146; attention to some
facts and, picking up on a point made by the hon. Member for Northavon,
show that the tax and benefits scene and the way that different
families are treated in the situation in which they find themselves,
are both complex and not straightforward
issues.</div><a name="091103155000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000556"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I very much welcome the commitment that the Minister
just gave to the adequacy of benefit levels. Can she clarify whether,
when the benefit rate for, say, an under-25 single person is set at
&#163;50.95 a week, that is deemed to be adequate, based on what an
under-25 needs to spend money on? Is it set with reference to anything
real? Is there reference to what they spend on food, fuel, clothing and
so on? Is the figure concrete, or is it just what it was last year plus
a
bit?</div><a name="091103155000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000557"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will give me a little time
to develop my argument, he might understand our
position.</div><a name="091103155000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Benefits
are linked to various indices. For example, at present,
jobseeker&#146;s allowance is linked to the retail prices index,
housing benefit is linked to the Rossi index, child benefit has gone up
25 per cent. in real terms since 1979, and child tax credit was
increased by &#163;75 above the earnings index in 2009. We have in
statute various indices to which benefits are linked in order to
achieve various policy objectives. Obviously, one of the key policy
objectives since 1999 has been raising the standard of living for
families with
children.</div><a name="091103155000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently,
if hon. Members look across the whole period, they will see that we do
not stick to the indices. We make subjective judgments to set increases
over and beyond the statutory indexation provisions. That means that,
for a lone parent with one child aged five, the real terms increase in
the period from 1997 to 2009 has been 30 per cent. For a lone parent
with two children, it has been 50 per cent. For a couple with two
children aged five to nine, the percentage change in real terms has
been 27 per
cent.</div><a name="091103155000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
factor that we need to take into account is passported benefits.
Obviously, the calculations to which the hon. Member for Northavon
refers do not take account of the value of passported benefits, such as
free school meals. If we were going down his suggested route, we would
need to take that into account, too. Finally, when looking at those
benefit levels, we need to take account of the new benefits that we
introduced to supplement people&#146;s standard of living at
particular times. For example, we introduced the health in pregnancy
grant and the Sure Start maternity
grant.</div><a name="091103155000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation is complex. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman tabled the new
clause before research was done by the Library. He had anticipated that
all the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>benefit levels were below the relative poverty threshold. He is smiling,
so I know that I have hit the point. As the hon. Gentleman said, for a
lone parent with one pre-school age child, the threshold is
&#163;205. The benefit is &#163;235, so that family are above the
threshold. As for the couple with two children, the benefit is
&#163;330, as is the relative poverty threshold, so that family is
not below the poverty
threshold.</div><a name="091103155000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could talk about the additional support for families with disabilities,
the implications of housing benefit and the differences between tax
credits, but I hope that members of the Committee will accept our
record, which is one of not only indexing benefits but, when
opportunity allows, raising them and improving the relative position of
such families. One of the crucial aspects of the Bill is that it must
be based on a growth strategy for the economy. Once the economy is
growing, it will, of course, be easier to be more generous with
benefits&#151;something that will remain open to
us.</div><a name="091103155000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 would require the Government to pursue the method of
guaranteeing that the level of out-of-work benefits would be sufficient
to lift children out of poverty. However, placing that guarantee in the
Bill would reduce the flexibility that it provides for forthcoming
strategies. It would force a focus on a particular approach to tackling
child poverty that might not be as effective as other options, but we
are not sure that it would be a sustainable approach to tackling
poverty. We all know that escaping poverty through work has wider
beneficial impacts on families compared with escaping through financial
support alone. Entering work has many social benefits. It will reduce
stress in the family and provide role models for children. A major
problem with the new clause is the impact on financial incentives to
enter employment, and we need to consider that negative impact
alongside the other perfectly sensible things to which the hon.
Gentleman has
referred.</div><a name="091103155000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must also recognise that many aspects of the benefits system are
designed to provide short-term support in response to changing
circumstances, such as short-term unemployment rather than long-term
sources of income. The new clause does not take account of that purpose
of the benefit system and could have an unintended impact on its
effectiveness. As drafted, the new clause requires the changes to be
introduced on Royal Assent, and that is not
achievable.</div><a name="091103155000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guaranteeing
that out-of-work income is sufficient to lift a family out of poverty
would be technically difficult to deliver. The poverty line for a year
can only be calculated after the year in question has ended and once
the median income has been calculated. Therefore, the Government would
not know exactly how much benefit would need to be paid to a particular
group of households to raise their incomes above the current poverty
line.</div><a name="091103155000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now deal with new clause 4, even though the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness, who tabled it, is not here. On 22 October, the
Committee heard evidence on the role of minimum income standards in
tackling child poverty. New clause 4 proposes that the Secretary of
State should have regard to minimum income standards in carrying out
his or her duties, and that he or she should commission research into
the subject. The Government welcome the Joseph Rowntree 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>Foundation&#146;s research on minimum income standards, and we
continue to follow its research with interest. However, although we
recognise and appreciate the intention behind the amendment, we do not
agree that the approach should be enshrined in
law.</div><a name="091103155000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have consulted extensively on the long-term measure of child
poverty. Minimum income standards were ruled out because different
research methods tend to make different assumptions and it is difficult
to get one answer to the simple and single question: how much income is
enough? Family circumstances obviously vary considerably. Even if it
were possible to define income adequacy on a fully consistent basis, it
would be difficult to generate a long-term robust time series, which is
essential for measuring progress. In fact, the researchers explicitly
say that their minimum income standard should not be treated as a
poverty threshold, though they propose that it is relevant to the
general discussion of poverty and living
standards.</div><a name="091103155000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have consulted extensively on the nature of the targets and there is
widespread consensus and support that they accurately reflect the way
to tackle poverty in the UK. Taken together, the four income targets in
clauses 2 to 5 define a stretching goal. Achieving them will not only
mean the lowest poverty rates since records began and in line with the
best in Europe, but will tackle material deprivation and mean that the
same families are not persistently poor. Although temporary periods of
low income, such as that caused by a short spell of unemployment, can
create difficulties, the most damaging effects of poverty are caused by
long-term and recurrent spells of relative low income. The approach set
out in the Bill&#151;using a combination of four targets&#151;is
therefore a crucial part of ensuring that poverty does not affect
children's life chances over the long
term.</div><a name="091103155000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there were also technical difficulties with new clause 4, with adhering
to the minimum income standards. With the survey techniques we use to
assess household income it is not feasible to ensure that no household
falls below a certain income level. That is why other targets have been
set at levels of 5 or 10 per cent. rather than
zero.</div><a name="091103155000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 also suggests that the Secretary of State should commission
research on minimum income standards. Such research is important.
However, as the latest research by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation&#151;published in 2008 and updated this summer&#151;is
robust, it would not represent a particularly good use of Government
resources to seek to replicate
it.</div><a name="091103155000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
advising the Government on their strategy, the child poverty commission
will be completely free to make a full exploration of the minimum
income guarantee. The Government would be perfectly happy for it to do
so when it is formulating its advice on the strategy to the Secretary
of State. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Northavon will
accept what I have said on these matters, see that the Bill puts in
place measures for achieving improvements in the incomes of our poorest
families, and withdraw the new
clause.</div>
<a name="091103155000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000558"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The first half of the Minister&#146;s
reply&#151;&#147;We have put benefits up by more than
inflation&#148;&#151;was the answer to a different question. I do
not dispute the statement, but that was not the point of either
amendment. The point was, &#147;Are benefit rates set relative to
something 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>real?&#148; The fact that they are higher than they were last year,
plus a bit, still does not make them relative to anything
real.</div><a name="091103155000348"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
Minister said that the Government want flexibility, but the only
flexibility that my new clause 2 prevents them from having is the
flexibility to pay benefits below the poverty line. She made a serious
point about the difference between short and long-term support. If the
Government were to commit to those who are on long-term
benefits&#151;for example, the children of the long-term sick might
be guaranteed not to be living on poverty benefits&#151;that might
represent progress. She seemed to make two conflicting comments. One
was that there would not be minimum income standards because people
would disagree on how to set them, and the other was that she did not
want to commission research because the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has
just published robust research. If we could not have statistics because
people disagree on how to obtain them, we would not have the Bill
because there are plenty of variations in the figures that we have.
That is not a credible
argument.</div><a name="091103155000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we heard evidence, it was pointed out that a young woman under 25 is
allocated &#163;50.95 a week to live on, but evidence suggests that
&#163;43 a week is needed for food for a decent, healthy living
standard. Fuel and other bills cannot be paid from the remaining
&#163;7-odd, so young women in that age group who are on benefit are,
by definition, eating less than is healthy for them. If they then
become pregnant, they will at that time have been eating
unhealthily.</div><a name="091103155000379"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="091103155000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Budget
standards and minimum income standards would enable us to consider what
such young women need for a decent standard of living, and to make that
the benchmark. Fiscal considerations would determine whether we hit the
benchmark, but not knowing what the benchmark is is unacceptable and
inexcusable. I know that the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness
will not press his new clause, and that is a shame because it would add
something to the
Bill.</div><a name="091103155000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that new clause 2 would immediately incur a lot of cost, and
that there are difficulties when measures are introduced
retrospectively, so I will not pursue it, but I hope that it has given
Ministers and their officials food for thought. We cannot legislate on
child poverty without thinking about benefit rates relative to the very
thresholds that we are enshrining in legislation. If we have achieved
even that in the debate, we have achieved something. I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="091103155000328"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">C</i><i class="I">lause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000559"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> May I say a few words of thanks on behalf of the
Committee? We have all enjoyed serving under your chairmanship,
Mr. Key, and that of Mr. Caton, your co-Chairman.
I thank the Clerks for the way in which we have been kept efficiently
at our task. We have had a fascinating series of discussions, and we
have had a thorough debate on the Bill&#146;s content. The support
from members of the Committee of all parties for tackling child poverty
is encouraging.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div><a name="091103155000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friends have followed these matters closely and, in some cases, for a
long time. I am grateful for their help, support and arguments. The
hon. Member for Northavon has great expertise in the matter, which he
deployed to good effect. We have benefited from the contributions of
the hon. Members for South-West Bedfordshire and for South-West
Hertfordshire, and other Opposition Members.</div>
<a name="091103155000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
particularly pleased to establish common cause with the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness on antipathy to split infinitives, if not much
else. I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for Work and Pensions,
who has helped to steer her first Bill as Minister through the
Committee with such aplomb  and gusto.</div>
<a name="091103155000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
our officials, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, the Doorkeepers, the police
officers and all who have fulfilled their duties so
ably.</div><a name="091103155000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000560"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Further to those remarks, may I add my thanks to
you, Mr. Key, and to Mr. Caton for chairing our
proceedings so efficiently, effectively and good naturedly? May I also
add my thanks to the Clerks, the attendants, the police, and the
<i class="I">Hansard </i>writers? I also thank the witnesses whom we heard during
our first four sittings. Their evidence guided us, and was helpful to
the
Committee.</div><a name="091103155000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Ministers. The Financial Secretary is absolutely right to say
that the Committee has been conducted in a good natured way. I thank
him for the steadiness and calm that he brings to such matters, and I
thank the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who brought
her own qualities, which the Committee has thoroughly enjoyed in the
past few days, to our
proceedings.</div><a name="091103155000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Member for Northavon. It appears that his whole career
was but preparation for the last few days. To see someone so in their
element was a joy. However, I sympathise because this is probably as
good as it gets for
him.</div><a name="091103155000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Whips, my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay and the hon.
Member for Leeds, East, for keeping things running smoothly and for
some Divisions where there was a bit of excitement. The clever use of
the conventions of the House by the hon. Member for Leeds, East to
ensure that the Bill was unamended never ceased to
impress.</div><a name="091103155000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should particularly like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Bedfordshire for his sterling work. He brings an almost
passionate expertise to this issue and is highly regarded by all those
who are focused on
it.</div><a name="091103155000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
comparison with the Finance Bills, of which I have more experience,
Back Benchers from all parties have made considerable contributions. I
thank my hon. Friend the Member for Henley, whose expertise on local
government matters was valuable, and my hon. Friend the Member for
Beverley and Holderness, who enlivened the Committee with his
forthright views&#151;he was never knowingly understated&#151;and
added a great deal to our
Committee.</div><a name="091103155000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091103155000561"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I associate myself with the remarks that have
already been made. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West
graciously allowed me to hog the amendments that we moved. He was
champing at the bit and I am grateful to him for allowing me to let
rip.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div><a name="091103155000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I were to
table an amendment on Report to delete paragraph 19(1) of schedule
1&#151;the disqualification of hon. Members of this House from the
chairmanship of the child poverty commission&#151;I hope that that
would be approved without Division, just for fun,
really.</div><a name="091103155000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
associate myself with the comment made about the positive nature of
this Committee. During the Committee stage of my first Bill in this
House in 1997, Government Back Benchers were literally doing their
Christmas cards. This has been quite different. All the Labour Back
Benchers are knowledgeable, have a track record 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>and a lot to contribute. I appreciate their tabling their own amendments
and making their own arguments, enriching the quality of our
debate.</div><a name="091103155000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have given the Bill a good going over. I am only sad that we cannot get
straight on with Report and that we have a few weeks to wait. I thank
you for your chairmanship, Mr. Key, and look forward to
serving under you
again.</div><a name="091103155000345"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
