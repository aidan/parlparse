Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): We have had the opportunity to have
lunch, and I shall now conclude the remarks that I was about to make
when we adjourned.</div>
					<a name="07030683000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Minister has approached the Committee&#146;s work
with an open mind, and has been helpful and honest. It was not that
that was new this morning, because we have been getting used to his
approach throughout the Committee, but he injected the new and
enlightening suggestion that Ministers should agree with proposals that
they advocated. The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire showed some
surprise at that suggestion, and I wonder what his reaction would be if
I mentioned the Child Support Agency. Perhaps that is a little
unfair.</div>

						<a name="07030683000443"></a>
							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): The hon. Gentleman
was reading my expression as I was being teased. We had the tantalising
prospect of the Minister announcing that he was thinking through a
colleague&#146;s policy before concluding whether it was right. That
raised the prospect in our minds of him going to the Department of
Health, knocking on the Minister&#146;s door, and saying,
&#147;Rosie, I just can&#146;t do this.&#148; He then let us down
by saying that having thought the matter through carefully,
surprisingly, he agreed with his colleague. That was the surprise that
the hon. Member for Bedford
detected.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000444"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> Even more enlightenment is shining upon us today,
and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
comments.</div>
					<a name="07030683000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Turning
to the matters of greater substance that are before us, and the need to
set up a national top-down body&#151;that is proposed in my
amendment&#151;I understand the arguments and the logic for not
accepting that, but the need for a national dimension to assist local
involvement in health networks in doing their job remains, and the case
for that is strong. On day one of LINKs&#146; existence, there will
be no such body, and if they eventually get together and create a
membership organisation, they will need the resources to do so. I urge
my hon. Friend the Minister to bear that in mind. Funds must be
sufficient for that
task.</div>
					<a name="07030683000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
hon. Friend did not have time to deal with the issues that I raised on
amendment No. 184, and perhaps they can be looked at elsewhere. The
question in my mind, having dangerously dipped into the draft contract
documents that were made available last week, is whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 531</div>it might be possible for the role of the host to be more significant
than that of the LINK. We shall have to explore that further, but there
has been sufficient movement on these matters and acknowledgement of
their importance for me not to press the
amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000445"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The Minister addressed his hon. Friend&#146;s
amendments well, but I just want to indicate the purpose of my
amendment No. 201&#151;he may want to intervene&#151;because I
stumbled over it, and he may not have picked up its
purpose.</div>
					<a name="07030683000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
clause makes it clear that a local authority could not be a host
organisation, but does not make it specifically clear that any other
provider of care services&#151;such as a national health service
organisation&#151;could not be a host organisation. The point of the
amendment is to indicate that it would be just as awkward for the
independence of LINKs if they were hosted by an NHS or any other
organisation providing services as it would be if they were hosted by a
local authority.</div>
					<a name="07030683000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the purpose of my amendment, and I would be grateful if the Minister
could help me out on
that.</div>

						I appreciate that. In that case,
my amendment has not been covered. The point of the amendment was to
say that the same logic would surely apply. If the Minister and the
Department did not feel that a local authority was an appropriate host
because it also provided services, surely it would be equally logical
that, as well as not being a LINK, other such organisations should not
be a host either. If the Minister and the Department do not agree, I
will welcome an explanation of why there is an inconsistency between
the two. I am not satisfied that the point has been dealt
with.</div>

Pugh:
						</b> I shall be as brisk as I can, because some of the
territory has been covered.</div>
					<a name="07030683000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a lot of sympathy for
the Minister. He has been endowed with the brilliant idea of LINKs by
the Department of Health, and has done his best to explain it with as
much clarity as possible. The idea remains fundamentally unclear to a
number of us. I understand that a LINK is an organisation that can
morph&#151;I think the Minister used the word
&#147;flexible&#148;. In other words, it can co-opt people as and
when it wants; it is a moveable feast. It is not like a forum or a
community health council, with an established or defined
membership&#151;a core membership was the expression used by the hon.
Member for Bedford&#151;but it is said to be more versatile, more
potent and more effective in some ways. We all find the absence of
defining regulation just a little worrying. I accept the
Minister&#146;s response, which was that all will be defined by some
sort of contractual arrangements when LINKS are established. As we are
unfamiliar with the contracts that will be established, we are none the
wiser about what a LINK will be.</div>
					<a name="07030683000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seem to know what a LINK is
not, and what it cannot be. A list of conditions in paragraphs (a) to
(g) gives various things that it definitely is not. That list is a
mixed bag, which covers providers, commissioners, some things that are
trusts and some that are not, but it does not seem to be complete.
Private providers, who are now clearly part of the health service, are
omitted. That might have been what amendment No. 201 was getting at. I
will not go over the arguments in connection with that. There seems to
be a benefit in specifying a level playing field, even though I think
it pretty unlikely that any private provider would wish to become a
LINK or would be acceptable as one.</div>
					<a name="07030683000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 229 follows up on
a point raised by the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, which is
the spectre of Joe Public coming along to his first LINK meeting and
finding himself surrounded by health officials, health professionals
and health apparatchiks of one kind or another, and feeling restrained
in what he could say. The legislation lays out quite clearly that
trusts cannot be LINKs, but it does not seem to lay out so clearly what
trust members can be or cannot be. I have had occasion to observe that
people who belong to one quango reappear almost magically in another.
If they are affiliated to one organisation, they get themselves
affiliated to an associated organisation.</div>
					<a name="07030683000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 229 attempts to
make it clear that, whoever is on the LINK, it will not be people with
a prominent position on any of the trusts. In considering the matter, I
decided that there is not an overwhelming case for excluding all trust
employees, because an awful lot of people work for the health service
in one capacity or another; the result would be the exclusion of
enormous numbers of people and of a wide range of relevant
expertise.</div>
					<a name="07030683000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire alluded to the fact that there
are occasional possibilities for conflicts of interest. For example, if
a midwife were a LINK member&#151;I cannot see why she should not
be&#151;what would be the appropriate course of conduct if the
subject of discussion were the closure of maternity units? Likewise,
what would be the appropriate course for ambulance people if the
positioning of an accident 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 533</div>and emergency department were under discussion? Those are relevant
issues, and amendment No. 229 is intended to probe how conflicts of
interest will be
addressed.</div>
					<a name="07030683000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 228 would add what I believe to be a necessary completing provision
to the proposed legislation. If health providers are to be excluded in
general, let us exclude all of them, rather than just those that are
NHS trusts.</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000453"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> A number of amendments have been proposed on the
issues of who can or cannot be a LINK, on hosts and on conflicts of
interest.</div>
					<a name="07030683000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 228 would include independent sector providers in the list of
bodies that cannot become a LINK. The Government have an open mind on
the amendment, because one can see its purpose exactly. Let us take the
case of a BUPA hospital&#151;not that the Government have anything
against BUPA hospitals. Clearly, there would be an inconsistency if the
clause as currently drafted did not allow an NHS foundation trust to be
a LINK, yet allowed an independent hospital to become a LINK. One can
see that there might be circumstances in which a local authority would
wish to contract in that regard. On the other hand, it might be
desirable to have bodies such as Mind or a voluntary service
organisation as a LINK, the difficulty being that the relevant body
might be a service provider of social care.</div>
					<a name="07030683000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have difficulty
with the wording of the amendment. The
phrase</div>
					<a name="07030683000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any organisation
providing local care
services&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
comprehensive. Bodies such as Age Concern might provide, for instance,
meals on wheels services to a particular neighbourhood, yet be a minor
provider of services in the area overall. Therefore, although the
amendment has a valid purpose, we have difficulties with the
definition.</div>
					<a name="07030683000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 229 seeks to ensure that the chair of any organisation that
provides local care services cannot become the leader of a LINK. Again,
on the face of things, there is a potential conflict of interest in
that situation. However, two arguments present themselves. The first
is, I admit, a weaker argument, which concerns flexibility. In a
certain area, the LINK might want to appoint a respected and
knowledgeable individual who is the holder of a position with a local
care service delivery organisation. The second argument is stronger. It
is that conflicts of interest will be covered by the codes of conduct
to which reference was made in the previous debate. In answer to my
hon. Friend the Member for Bedford, I made the point that the
principles of conduct in public life covered by the Nolan commission
apply.</div>

Stunell</b> (Hazel Grove) (LD): Will the Minister acknowledge
that the strength of the argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member

(4)(d) to (h) in the chair of the LINK might inhibit its capacity to
look at a particular service area, even when an interest has been
declared?</div>

							<a name="07030683000455"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> It may do; it may also do the opposite, because
such a person would carry a great deal of weight. In line with the
policy of being as least prescriptive as possible, we believe that the
codes of conduct in public life are a better way of dealing with the
issue of conflicts of interest. Obviously, local LINKs will take such
matters into consideration when they are
established.</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Straying from my brief and
referring to amendment No. 201, the Government want to enable
independent providers to be hosts of LINKs, although we have a problem
of definition regarding whether they should themselves be LINKs.
Whether or not independent providers deliver care services,
demonstrating to a local authority that they can manage any potential
or perceived conflict of interests would be an issue dealt with in the
contract. It is a matter of definition&#151;an inevitable consequence
of the fact that we are trying to introduce a broader regime and to
join organisations. We want LINKs to be as free as possible to decide
how they are governed, and we believe that the codes of conduct are a
better way of addressing that than prescription in legislation. For
those reasons, I resist amendments Nos. 228 and
229.</div>

Pugh:
						</b> I thank the Minister for speaking to the amendments
on their merits. I appreciate his dilemma, and I am grateful that he
has been so frank and open minded about it. Clearly, there is a problem
with a situation in which an independent provider also functions as an
advocacy body, because one would not want such a body to have its feet
under the table of a LINK. That is something that perhaps members of
the Committee will want to take away and think about, because there is
a problem of establishing a level playing field, and a need to exclude
a BUPA hospital from effectively becoming a LINK.</div>
					<a name="07030683000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It has been
entirely appropriate to point the Committee to the Nolan requirements,
which have been used as an argument against previous amendments.
However, the requirements work best when applied to relatively formal
organisations that have an officer whose job it is to advise people
when they step out of line. We are supposing that LINKs will be a
relatively flexible arrangement in that there might not necessarily be
a defined structure or an officer to offer the proper advice at the
proper time. Therefore, while the Nolan requirements are a good answer
in theory, we might get into all sorts of difficulties in
practice.</div>

						The hon. Gentleman is probing
right to the heart of the principles of the Bill, and I congratulate
him on doing so. In the regime that the Bill proposes, the function of
giving proper advice would be undertaken by the host organisation. Just
as a monitoring officer or a section 151 officer in a local authority
has a relationship with elected councillors, a host organisation would
have a relationship with a LINK. That is common practice in this
country, and I would argue that such relationships are well
established. I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

long. I am sure that colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Benches will do
the same. The clause refers to the duties of services providers to

the services providers. The amendment would include within the

definitions seem unduly narrow, bearing in mind the breadth of bodies
and organisations that provide such care services. Hopefully, the
amendment will be helpful to the Government in that it would widen the
range of those who need to respond to local involvement networks. If
they are included elsewhere, I should be grateful if the Minister
helped us out. If they are not, our purpose is genuinely to open them
up to the same scrutiny and duty to respond as any of the other defined
providers.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000462"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> Essentially, all the amendments are more or less on
the same track, but this matter is possibly of greater significance and
does not fall to some of the arguments that the Minister has presented
so far.We are talking about private providers not in so far as
they are advocates or anything else, but in so far asthey have
a duty to respond. I suspect that the Government&#146;s response will
be that private providers are usually commissioned by a primary care
trust or a public body and that, if LINKs have complaints, they ought
to take them up at first base, which is the PCT that has the permission
to service. That strikes me as a poor model of patient
involvement.</div>
					<a name="07030683000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
wish to cite a couple of real examples. I have been involved in a
debate in this place about the Cornwall out-of-hours service, which was
presumably commissioned by the Cornwall PCT. When critics tried to find
out problems about its performance, they found it extraordinarily
difficult and had to resort to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to
get any valid information to assist them. The public were fairly
confident that things were going wrong, but getting any real response
from the provider organisation was the devil&#146;s own
job.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 536</div>
					<a name="07030683000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In similar circumstances, by and
large the Merseyside PCTs commissioned a private provider. That
provider has had difficulties. Identifying the difficulties has been
very hard. In one case, a senior member of the private
provider&#146;s IT staff actually left, complaining that the service
was delivered wholly inadequately, but was subject to a gagging order.
When inquiries were made to the PCT about what was going wrong, we were
told that it could not define exactly what was going wrong because
certain things were commercially confidential, and that there were
certain things that it, frankly, did not know about and had to find
out. LINKs do not have the capacity to go directly to the private
provider and say, &#147;You are providing national health services.
What is going on?&#148; Worse still, without such an amendment, it
will not have to respond at all. That is wholly inadequate. It should
be able to respond, if only to say that it is working to its contract
with the PCT, the PCT is satisfied, so ask the trust next. However, to
have a situation in which our major services, such as out-of-hour
services, can be
delivered&#151;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000463"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> A patient&#146;s journey through any part of the
health process should be capable of being monitored. It should be the
same process and as easy right the way through, notwithstanding the
fact that the services may be provided by different groups of people.
If it were made more complicated, that would get in the way of the
patient involvement that we are so keen to
provide.</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000464"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> Patients essentially want a response from the
provider. The majority of people do not even understand what a PCT is,
let alone how to approach it. They simply know that there are people
delivering services. They know&#151;or will know&#151;that there is
a LINKs organisation designed to find out why the service is not being
delivered particularly well and they will expect a response from the
service providers, not a remote response after the PCT has had a board
meeting and discussed the
issue.</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000465"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I suspect that hon. Members on the Labour Benches
in this Committee will agree with the sentiments that have been
expressed by Opposition Members. In simple terms, should not the
private and voluntary sector be subject to the same regime as the
statutory sector if they are providing health and care services? That
seems entirely reasonable. I want to explain how that point can be met
by the legislation. We have a convincing argument&#151;the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove raises his eyebrows.</div>
					<a name="07030683000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a similar problem to
that which we had when we debated the statutory duty to co-operate. As
a principle of policy, it is not desirable to impose statutory
obligations on independent providers. Traditionally, it is not done in
this country. It conflicts with the points being pushed by the hon.
Members for Hazel Grove and for Southport. Having said that, we will
ensure that independent providers of publicly funded health and social
care comply with LINKs&#146; powers by ensuring that commissioners of
the service include the requirement&#151;in this case, the obligation
for access&#151;within the contracts, through the directions of the
Secretary of State.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 537</div>
					<a name="07030683000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">While it is consistent to say
that it is not desirable to impose statutory duties directly upon
providers, it is reasonable for the taxpayer to say that, if we are
commissioning said organisation to provide health and social care
services, as is the case under the clause, the contract into which it
has voluntarily entered to provide those services, brings with it a
responsibility to comply with the duties that are on the statutory
sector. That is a perfectly reasonable policy to hold. It is in line
with wider Government policy and it is the arrangement that is in place
in relation to patients forum powers over health services.</div>
					<a name="07030683000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some 28,000 contracts
between the public sector commissioners and the private or independent
providers of social care. It is not our intention, or that of the
Committee, to force the renegotiation, mid-term, of those contracts
because of the costs that that would entail and, more important
perhaps, the disruption that there would be to patients&#146;
services.</div>
					<a name="07030683000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept
that, in the short term, there will be differences between the public
sector and the independent sector in relation to LINKs&#146; powers.
However, we will require those powers to be included as new contracts
come into place. In the meantime, any independent providers will be
expected to be positive in their working relationships with the LINKs.
That is our approach to the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07030683000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give
further reassurance to the hon. Members who tabled the amendment, under
which the definition of services providers would include any provider
of services, including the independent sector, the clauses allow the
definition of services provider to be extended by regulations,
therefore allowing future flexibility to reflect changes in the
organisation of the NHS, or other circumstances&#151;what I refer to
as the Bromley and Chislehurst point: we have to legislate for the
unforeseen as well as for the foreseen.</div>
					<a name="07030683000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, measures in the Bill
meet the concerns outlined in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member
for Southport, without taking what I argue is the undesirable
step&#151;and possibly one subject to challenge&#151;of placing
statutory duties on independent bodies. I hope that that satisfies hon.
Members who tabled the amendments.</div>

amendment by a different route. That is entirely laudable, but given
that the Minister spoke about the private sector&#146;s tendency to
challenge a decision to lay statutory duties upon it, one hopes that we
will not find further down the line that the private sector will find
another cause for challenge under competitive tendering legislation. If

						</b> Amendment No. 129 raises that old chestnut in the
drafting of Bills: the difference in meaning between
&#147;shall&#148; and &#147;may&#148;. It would substitute
&#147;shall&#148; to require the Secretary of State to make
regulations requiring providers to give access to LINKs for the weaker
&#147;may&#148;, which implies that there is no such
requirement.</div>
					<a name="07030683000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I turn to
amendments Nos. 220 and 221. The clause will give the Secretary of
State regulatory power to create the conditions that must be satisfied
before the LINK can gain access for the purpose of observation. If the
management of premises are not keen to allow access, the conditions
listed in the clause&#151;there are many of them&#151;could be used
to assist them in resisting or delaying LINK access. It could be rather
bureaucratic and time consuming for a LINK to present a case for why it
should have access and to have to overcome hurdles and so on before
gaining
agreement.</div>
					<a name="07030683000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
when in disputed cases it is agreed in principle that access can be
granted, that access will be subject to limitations set out in
regulations on the extent of a duty, whether generally or in a
particular case, and provisions imposing or authorising the imposition
of conditions and restrictions. Regulations might also limit the duty
to allow entry to certain types of authorised representative, the
number of authorised representatives and the hours during which a duty
applies. Such regulations could be used to place hurdles in the way of
LINKs trying to carry out their job.</div>
					<a name="07030683000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the Minister to consider,
for example, the limitation on hours. It could be seen as entirely
reasonable if used to limit access to within working hours, but it
could also cause problems if a LINK comprising mainly volunteers, as
LINKs will, wished to visit in the early morning or evening because
some of its members might otherwise be at work. It is worth recalling
that at present, under the 2003 regulations, patients forums enjoy a
presumption in favour of inspection</div>

					<a name="07030683000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Definitions are very important
in any Bill. As a lawyer, I take due note of definitions. I want to
draw out the definition of inspection. The obvious place to look first,
albeit not over lunch, is the &#147;Oxford English
Dictionary&#148;&#151;a dictionary for which I have great respect,
not least because my wife, when she was ill, did the extraordinary
thing of reading through it. That is not something that necessarily
attracted me to her, but it has given her the upper hand in Scrabble
and has given me due reverence for the book.</div>
					<a name="07030683000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">When looking up the definition
of inspect, there is an important and significant point to bear in
mind. We need to see whether that definition matches up with the
Government&#146;s intention as set out in their draft policy. In the
Bill, the Government seek to put some flesh on the bones of their
intention in relation to the duty merely to enter and view. It is
important to see how that compares with what is a proper duty to
inspect, which is, at the moment, a statutory duty relating to forums.
The definition in the &#147;Oxford English Dictionary&#148;, as my
wife would no doubt have told me if I had not looked it up myself,
is</div>
					<a name="07030683000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to look carefully

means more than to view. The important word is
&#147;critically&#148;. To find out something&#146;s character or
condition requires a proactive step beyond viewing.</div>
					<a name="07030683000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is important because when
one looks at the policy statement that was helpfully provided to the
Committee, the intention referred to on page 2 is</div>
					<a name="07030683000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to enable LINKs to gather
information about the services provided to local people. There will be
times when it is right to see how those services are provided and to
collect people&#146;s experiences whilst they are currently using
them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to
state how important it is to observe the nature and quality of
services. The concern is that that is only one stage. It is dealing
with LINKs on the basis that they are gathering information and
intelligence, but it does not take it any further. There is a
recognition in that statement that LINKs make an important contribution
to the process of service improvement, to supporting the work already
undertaken by the regulators, and to incorporating the user perspective
in their work.</div>
					<a name="07030683000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern that has been expressed to me by the Barnet and Chase Farm
Hospitals Forum as well as by others before the Committee is that the
efforts to mainstream effectively the operation of LINKs in terms of
entering and viewing does not properly deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column540" />Column number: 540</div>with the true value of forums at present. The concern is that the aim is
simply to incorporate their work within the regulators&#146; current
work. I invite the Minister to give examples of where there has been
duplication of work with the regulators that means that LINKs have to
be effectively mainstreamed within the regulators&#146; own
inspection regime.</div>
					<a name="07030683000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Why does the
Minister not pay regard to best practice around the country, not least
in areas such as Barnet and Chase Farm, where the forum has carried out
proper inspections in the past months in anti-coagulation clinics,
wards, catering services, accident and emergency, and patient phone
services and is to follow that work in relation to blood testing
facilities, stroke facilities, maternity and obstetrics, pharmaceutical
and cancer services. They are all areas in which the statutory duty to
inspect has been properly carried out by that forum among others, and
it should be incorporated in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07030683000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chairman and the secretary
of my local forum say that the abolition of the right to inspect would
be catastrophic, and that in some ways the</div>
					<a name="07030683000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;spot inspections of cleanliness
and patient management are far more effective than planned inspections
by organisations such as the Healthcare
Commission.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The forum
has a role, and it should not be absorbed by the existing regime of
regulators and inspection.</div>
					<a name="07030683000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The draft
policy statement goes on to say that LINKs will provide important
intelligence to the regulators, which does not give due respect to the
forums&#146; work. They are not simply intelligence gatherers for the
regulators; they in their own right have a proper role of inspection on
behalf of patients. That role should not be taken away or absorbed, but
that will be the effect of not having &#147;inspect&#148; on the
face of the Bill. Why is &#147;inspect&#148; not in the Bill? Is
&#147;The Oxford English Dictionary&#148; definition incorporated
in the Bill in terms of the LINKs&#146; role of entering and viewing?
If not, their role should be expanded to include inspection.</div>
					<a name="07030683000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the inspection issue, I pay
tribute not only to the OED, but to Jonathan Swift and &#147;A Tale
of a Tub&#148;, which
was:</div>
					<a name="07030683000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Written
for the universal improvement of
mankind.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">No doubt the
Minister would like to pursue that goal. The critique was of a teacher
who restricted his pupils&#146; exposure to knowledge, and there was
a concern that prosperity would suffer if they were kept in ignorance.
It is not necessarily the intention to restrict the LINKs&#146;
pursuit knowledge or to keep them in ignorance, but we should give due
regard to Swift&#146;s words, in which it is
resolved</div>
					<a name="07030683000114"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to keep you in
an almost universal ignorance of our studies, which it is your inherent
birth-right to inspect.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister reassure me
his intention is not to keep the LINKs on behalf of patients in
universal ignorance? The concern is that the Bill should at least
include a power to inspect. It may not be an inherent birthright of
LINKs or of patients, but because of the money that we pay in taxes and
because of their value, the Bill should at least include the right to
inspect. The policy statement does not leave me content or in a spirit
of happiness. To draw on Swift again, however, his definition of
happiness is</div>
					<a name="07030683000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
perpetual possession of being well
deceived,&#148;</div>

shall follow on from the point that my hon. Friend the Member for
Enfield, Southgate made about the particular value of spot checks. The
point has been made to me, too, by people with whom I have spoken. I am
concerned by pages 4 and 5 of the policy statement, which set out a
significant diminution of the current rights of patients&#146; forums
to enter and inspect, and to make spot checks.</div>
					<a name="07030683000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statement says that LINKs
will only be able to enter and view, rather than inspect, and only with
prior notice, rather than carry out spot checks. It then sets out a
number of other savings and restrictions. The LINK will have to
have</div>

5 states that a ground for exempting the LINK&#146;s right to enter
and view&#151;never mind inspect&#151;is that it has not given
prior written notice. The proposed regime is far more restrictive than
the current one, where the only restriction is on anything that would
interfere with patient safety or well-being. What is the justification
for that? On the face of it, the new regime will be much weaker in

						</b> I am pleased to support my hon. Friend the Member
for Enfield, Southgate. We thank him for opening this debate by
mentioning Jonathan Swift, whose name and character is always relevant
to proceedings in the House of Commons, although even his great powers
of satire would be stretched to cover the present Government. On
occasions, he would have been forced to conclude as he retired and
sheathed his pen that nobody could have made up what he had heard that
day. As well as mentioning Jonathan Swift, my hon. Friend introduced us
to the formidable Mrs. Burrowes. None of us will play
Scrabble against her for money. We have all been well warned about the
formidable lady and we will brush up our language when speaking to
her.</div>
					<a name="07030683000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate and for Bromley and
Chislehurst have raised further serious concerns about the Bill and the
unnecessary translation from forums to LINKs. I should like briefly to
build on what they said. Definition is not the sole 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column542" />Column number: 542</div>issue, although that is important&#151;as are words. There has to be a
reason why the term &#147;inspect&#148; has been removed from the
legislation. That puzzles all the people whom we speak to in the
forums. The subject came up when I met representatives from some 23
forums last month. My note says that</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Patient representatives
need to be able to gain access to any facility where patients were
being treated, and ask the necessary questions. Whether a power was
defined as inspection, or audit, or something similar it was important
that the NHS did not have the power, except in the most obvious and
understandable circumstances, to exclude patient
representatives.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fear that something has been done to them in relation to this change is
held widely among those who have contacted us and submitted
evidence.</div>
					<a name="07030683000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I
turn to the published evidence submitted to the Health Committee, which
has been dealing with this matter. Without spending too much time on
this, it has not taken me long to find things relating to inspection.
The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Forum says LINKs should
have</div>
					<a name="07030683000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At least
the same remit as PPI Forums to cover Social Care as well as Health. A

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000480"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I am grateful for that intervention, because the
short recess has refreshed me and has allowed me to find a key quote
from Hounslow. The Hounslow Primary Care Trust, West Middlesex
University Hospital, Ealing Hospital, Ealing Primary Care Trust,
Hillingdon Primary Care Trust, Hillingdon Hospital And The West London
Mental Health Trust PPI Forum says, in is
submission:</div>
					<a name="07030683000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;If
the new LINks do not have the power of access to premises providing NHS
services, many Trusts will breathe a sigh of relief. Without regular
monitoring/inspections the LINks will not have the information they
need to help the Trusts to
improve.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point about health trusts breathing a sigh of relief may be confirmed
by evidence from the NHS Confederation, which represents the leaders
and managers in the health service. They are not bothered about the
power of inspection being lost&#151;perhaps because that suits them.
The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health has some
expertise in the area. In its submission, it says the following about
the change in the inspection
power:</div>
					<a name="07030683000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;This
would replace PPI Forums&#146; existing power to inspect premises and
it appears to be a more limited right than that currently enjoyed by
PPI Forums, which gives them the power to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 543</div>inspect, for any purpose relevant to the Forum&#146;s functions,
premises owned or controlled by Strategic Health Authorities, PCTs, NHS
Trusts, NHS Foundation Trusts, local health boards, local authorities,
GPs and ophthalmic
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						So,
forums themselves think that there is something suspicious about the
change in the wording, and about the loss of the inspection power, and
the CPPIH thinks the same, but the NHS Confederation, which represents
managers, does not. As my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate
asked, &#147;Why the change?&#148; What is the distinction that is
intended in removing the power of inspection? If it is intended to give
forums exactly the same rights as before, why change the wording? If
the concern is that the powers of inspection are too onerous on trusts,
where is the
evidence?</div>
					<a name="07030683000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred to the
regulations, which mention spot checks. Of course, the more
paraphernalia that must be gone through for an inspection, the easier
it is to cover up anything that might be wrong. I am not suggesting
that that kind of thing might occur deliberately. However, if one is
looking for evidence of things that might have gone wrong and that
might be affecting patients, there is good reason to bring out that
evidence. Some of the cases on Clostridium difficile have been
discovered as a result of spot checks by patient forums.</div>
					<a name="07030683000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should be a reason for
the proposed change, but at the moment, I cannot see that the change
suggests anything other than a step back from the sort of access and
monitoring that we would like to see. There is general suspicion about
it. If it is designed not to alter the powers of forums, it should not
be made, and if the change is significant, the significance should be
spelt out. At present, it looks like a diminution of powers&#151;one
that is unwelcome to those who know most about the matter, and to those
who represent patients as opposed to
managers.</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000481"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I want to say a few words on inspection. The problem
facing us is that we still do not know what LINKs will be, which makes
it almost impossible to generalise about the powers that they should
have, about the need for criminal record clearance, or about the issues
that their visits to hospitals will raise. That seems to be the root of
the problem.</div>
					<a name="07030683000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
some sympathy with the idea that we need a spot-check principle.
Something like poor hospital food, or even whether patients eat the
food that they are given, can be discovered only by spot check. If any
advance notice is given, no food will be found lying for hours by the
hospital bed.</div>
					<a name="07030683000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do
not underestimate how complex a process inspection can be, so I
understand to some extent why there is a debate and why it is not
evident that one side is right and the other is wrong. Years ago, when
as a student I worked in an old-fashioned mental hospital, I was
familiar with hospital visitors trooping through with what was called a
tour of inspection. The day that the tour of inspection took place was
a day of absolute misery for the patients for whom we were supposed to
be caring. They were swept aside while we cleaned every surface we
could find and spread disinfectant around the place. The visitors were
thoroughly satisfied that all was well, because everywhere looked spick
and span. That is not an adequate inspection.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div>
					<a name="07030683000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inspection is a relatively
complex process and needs to be done thoroughly and effectively. I
would have thought that that would make a case for more
consultation&#151;I hate to make a case for more of it&#151;with
the hospitals that are inspected and the people who want to inspect. A
regime can be established that is satisfactory to both, and if the
Department of Health were to conduct such a consultation and publish
the results, we could reach a conclusion with which everybody would be
satisfied.</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000482"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The answer to the last point is that that will
take place.</div>
					<a name="07030683000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that I want to get across to the Committee is that the powers proposed
in clause 156 will allow the Secretary of State to impose a duty on the
service providers, as we have discussed in respect of previous clauses,
to allow authorised representatives of LINKs to enter, view and
observe&#151;I shall come back to the OED in a moment&#151;the
carrying on of activities on premises controlled by service providers.
Those regulations, provided for in subsection (1) of, require two
things. First, they require consultation. I find myself in the position
in which Ministers often find themselves in such debates when members
of the Committee ask, reasonably enough, to see the results of the
consultation on the regulations. I am asking for a power for the
Secretary of State to make regulations subject to that consultation,
which will cover the point made by the hon. Member for
Southport.</div>
					<a name="07030683000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
reassure the Committee that those regulations will be subject to the
affirmative procedure, so the points that have been made in respect of
the amendments can be made in respect of the regulations. It is
reasonable to ask for powers to place some conditions and limitations
on the duty&#151;on the number of people who could conduct a visit at
a particular time, for example, or the hours during which a visit can
take place.</div>
					<a name="07030683000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members have made comments about health services, and hospitals in
particular. We are talking about the full panoply of care services, and
I see why there might be some scepticism given the fact that a visit
could be undertaken only by an authorised person. To enable LINKs to
gather information on all aspects of service provision, there are of
course times when it will be appropriate to enter the premises and view
the range and quality of the services provided. We therefore plan to
provide LINKs with the power to enter health and social care premises,
which will give them the opportunity to hear from people as they use
the services. The inclusion of social care premises is a big step
forward, as patient forums have the power to enter only health
services. That is important to enable LINKs to gather the views of
those who use the services, who often have little opportunity to make
their voices heard.</div>
					<a name="07030683000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The need for safeguards to be
in place and for some services to be exempt is met for the protection
of vulnerable people. For example, we do not think that it would be
appropriate for LINKs to have powers to enter people&#146;s homes,
although social care services can be provided in people&#146;s homes.
I am sure that hon. Members would agree with that. My argument is that
the bottle is half full, whereas the sceptics are arguing that it is
half empty. I see their point, and suggest that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div>regulation and consultation is the way forward. However, the powers to
enter will help a LINK to form a view of the services by giving people
in receipt of those services the opportunity to feed in their
views.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07030683000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, not
all those involved in LINK activity will need to undertake that role.
Those who are able to exercise the power must have the right skills,
perhaps have the right training, be cleared by the Criminal Records
Bureau, and be able to demonstrate an understanding of patient
confidentiality and the right level of sensitivity. When the details
have been finalised, we will specify which premises a LINK may enter
and view. We will provide a new code of conduct on visiting to set out
for LINKs, their hosts and the organisations that will be visited how
the arrangements will work. LINKs will be expected to co-operate and to
co-ordinate their activities with the regulator. We will ensure that
that duty is in regulations, and we will consult
widely.</div>
					<a name="07030683000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked
whether the &#147;Oxford English Dictionary&#148; provides a
definition that the law recognises. The answer, as you might expect,
Mr. Chope&#151;I mean no disrespect to learned friends,

Committee.</div>
					<a name="07030683000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The serious
point is that we believe that &#147;inspect&#148; carries the
connotation of inspectors, such as the Healthcare Commission and the

connotation of a formal inspection role. LINKs&#146; members are not
inspectors or regulators as covered by the inspectorate regime. The

						The

apart from changing the word? Is he declaring that there is no change
whatever in the power that forums previously had to do their work when
they entered premises and inspected? Can he guarantee to the Committee
and every member of forums that nothing in the Bill will prevent them
from doing anything that they previously did because the word
&#147;inspect&#148; is not there, and that it has been changed only
because someone might think that LINKs were

intention. There is no restriction, limitation or curtailment of the
powers of the patients forum in connection with the word
&#147;inspect&#148; as opposed to the powers of LINKs in connection
with the words &#147;view&#148; and &#147;observe&#148;. There
is also no intention to omit powers. The difficulty for me in arguing
the case is that the consultation on the regulation may result in some
variation, but it is not the intention to change the meaning of the
word &#147;inspect&#148; from that in the &#147;Oxford English
Dictionary&#148;. I am trying to be as open as I can with the hon.
Gentleman, but the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate wishes to push me
a little further.</div>

							<a name="07030683000487"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I hear the Minister saying that, in a sense, the
clause is spurred on by concerns about connotations. That works both
ways. The natural connotation of the words &#147;enter and
view&#148; is passive. As applied to the activities of LINKs, the
concern is that they will have a passive role of gaining intelligence,
whereas the words &#147;spot inspection&#148; and
&#147;inspection&#148; would denote a more active role. The
connotations, to use the Minister&#146;s phraseology, go against what
the Minister is saying. He said that the existing roles will
continue.</div>

							<a name="07030683000488"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						I am advised that there is no
change in definition, but the hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. The
counter-argument is that the connotation would be held by employees and
potentially by patients themselves. People see
&#147;inspectors&#148; and &#147;visitors&#148; in different
ways. For the record, the Government&#146;s intention is simply to
avoid confusion with professional regulatory bodies such as the
Healthcare Commission. The people who will be involved in LINKs are lay
people, however much experience they have, which is why they are being
asked to undertake the functions that we are discussing. As such, they
will be able to take up the view of the patient and adopt a
service-user perspective and feed that into a regulator&#146;s
assessments by, for example, informing the Healthcare
Commission&#146;s health check process.</div>

Burt:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
concession&#151;this is an important part of the Bill. What precisely
is he saying has arisen because of the confusion about inspectors? Is
he in some way saying that those who are being inspected are confused,
and that that is a problem? Is he saying that the confusion is in the
minds of members of forums because they are placed in an unfortunate
position by being considered to be inspectors, and that they therefore
cannot build appropriate relationships with trusts? Is he saying that
it is more important to have inspections conducted by inspectors, and
that what forums do is less important? The powers to visit, to see, and
to be proactive&#151;forums raise issues publicly and get things
done, as my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate
said&#151;are as important as anything that the Healthcare Commission
or any other body has. What is the problem with a confusion over
inspection? Why should such confusion cause a difficulty that the
Government want to address? Where is the evidence that a problem has
been caused by the issue of, and confusion about,
definition?</div>

							<a name="07030683000490"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I had not expected
such a forceful probing about the word &#147;inspect&#148; and the
words &#147;view and observe&#148;. I take the common-sense view.
The word &#147;inspect&#148; carries a connotation of professional
inspection; the words &#147;view and observe&#148; do not, but that
does not rule out the idea that viewers and observers can go to an
establishment and be awkward so-and-sos. My personal view is that if I
were a member of the public, I would sooner trust a group who have
experience of holding hospital and care services to account in my local
area, which can refer that to my council&#146;s overview and scrutiny
committee and get the local press coverage that would no doubt result.
Such a group is a lot more powerful than a few suits coming up from
London to stay in the Malmaison hotel for the weekend, which is what
normally happens, although I am not decrying the professionalism of the
inspectors in any way, or doing down the professional standards of
Malmaison hotels.</div>
					<a name="07030683000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is reading too much into the Government&#146;s intent.
The change of wording from &#147;inspect&#148; to
&#147;view&#148; clarifies the role of LINKs and is a more accurate
description of what they do. To reassure him, the change will not
represent a curtailment of the power of the patients
forums.</div>

							<a name="07030683000491"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> May I just be clear? Is my hon. Friend saying that
in practice, what patients forums do now is effectively to enter, view
and observe rather than inspect, as we are now having a debate about
those words? I should like clarity on his point that the Healthcare
Commission&#146;s inspectors are mainly lay people. I take it that we
are talking about the extent and nature of people&#146;s training to
carry out the function either of inspection or of entering, viewing and
observing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000492"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> On the point of definition, I can confirm that
that is the case. Regarding lay people, I believe that I made the
reference&#151;I certainly intended to&#151;in respect of LINKs
rather than of professional bodies that inspect. That was the
distinction that I was trying to
draw.</div>
					<a name="07030683000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have covered
the points made in amendmentsNos. 220 and 221 regarding
access, but I have not covered amendment No. 219, tabled by my hon.
Friend the Member for Bedford. He wishes to delete the word
&#147;may&#148; in subsection (1) and insert the word
&#147;shall&#148;. To be consistent and to back up my arguments
about the other amendments, I must accept his amendment. To give the
Secretary of State discretion over whether she or he makes regulations
would negate the arguments that I have made to reassure hon. Members on
the other amendments. Therefore, I propose to accept the amendment to
give that reassurance.</div>
					<a name="07030683000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as acknowledging the
Committee&#146;s role, accepting the amendment makes an important
point. If one allowed circumstances in which the Secretary of State
could not make regulations, the LINKs could not do their job as the
Committee and the House have described it. I am assured by my advisers
that I need not change line 1 of subsection (2), because if the
Committee accepts my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment, there shall be
regulations. I urge Committee members to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 548</div>accept that amendment, reject the others and return to the points made

Stunell:
						</b> I rise to ask the Minister to clarify how the
measures will work in respect of tertiary health care. I do so in
connection with an institution with which both he and I are
familiar&#151;the Christie hospital in south Manchester, which
provides specialist cancer care for a large number of people in our
area, right across Greater Manchester and beyond. A significant number
of LINKs would be involved in monitoring what is going on there. At the
moment, there is a separate specialist patient and public involvement
in health forum covering the Christie hospital. Its work is valued by
the hospital, and it is believed to be very effective in doing
it.</div>
					<a name="07030683000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until now, we
have been discussing primary and secondary care&#151;district general
hospitals and units that provide care for a comparatively restricted
area, where co-ordination and co-operation across local authority
boundaries is more or less trivial to achieve. However, in that
particular case it seems that there would be a significant number of
local authorities and LINKs. I have received representations from a
member of the existing Christie forum, who is a constituent of mine,
saying that there seems to be a real risk that the valuable work that
is done in that specialist area of monitoring via the existing body
could be lost. I wonder whether the Minister would give us some
indication of how he sees the process working in those specialist
circumstances, and what assurance can he give to my constituent who
serves on the existing
forum.</div>

							<a name="07030683000494"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I was fearful then that just as the hon. Gentleman
could not find Hounslow, I would not be able to find Christie&#146;s,
but I have located it in south Manchester. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point presents a similar challenge to that of my hon. Friend the Member
for High Peak with regard to bodies that cover more than one area. His
experience will be the same as mine: however much local people insist
on having local services on their doorstep as far as certain types of
health provision are concerned, when it comes to cancer and other
related diseases, their first question will be, &#147;How do I get to
Christie&#146;s?&#148; It is an acknowledged world centre of
excellence.</div>
					<a name="07030683000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
debate on the duty to co-operate, it is interesting to note the caveat
that I expressed regarding some health trusts in relation to the
example of Great Ormond Street. I asked the Committee to consider the
danger that many local authorities throughout the country would try to
enter into agreements with Great Ormond Street. That example, and that
one only of all last week&#146;s deliberations of the Committee, made
it into the <i class="I">Local Government Chronicle</i>. That rather shows the
journalistic values of the LGC, but it also shows the seriousness with
which people take these points.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column549" />Column number: 549</div>
					<a name="07030683000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LINK for the area in which
the tertiary health service exists will be able to enter, view and
observe, and so on. We expect that other LINKs will enter into
agreements with that body to provide a specialist way in which the
tertiary service can be provided. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove
said, there are specific arrangements in place at the moment and
because patients come to Christie&#146;s from all around the country,
not just our region, that seems a sensible
arrangement.</div>

							<a name="07030683000495"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I appreciate what the Minister is saying, but to
some extent he has drawn attention to what will be the real risk. If
everything falls to the south Manchester LINK, or any Manchester LINK,
not only will it have the job of managing or monitoring the primary and
secondary health service in its area, but the specific job of managing
Christie hospital, which draws on patients from a much wider area, as
the Minister rightly says. The existing forum is made up of people
drawn from the much wider area. The constituent to whom I referred was
somebody who had an experience of treatment at the hospital, and who
subsequently became a staunch friend of the hospital and a member of
the forum. If we narrow the field from which a LINK might be drawn on a
narrow geographical basis, it might lead to a considerable loss of
expertise. Bearing in mind the point, which the Minister undertook
before, that existing members of forums would have a route into the new
system, he might like to consider how we might deal with what are
perhaps not more than 20 or 30 specialist hospitals throughout the
country, which are acknowledged centres of excellence, drawing from a
very wide area.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000496"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.
I did not respond to the Jonathan Swift quotation, but I shall respond
now by referring to Chairman Mao, who wisely said that the goat that
belongs to everyone starves to death. In other words, if it is
nobody&#146;s job to do it, it does not get done. The hon. Gentleman
is making an important point through the example of Christie&#146;s,
and my response to it is twofold. First, we were wise to resist
amendmentNo. 198, which related to resources. Manchester city
council would have to call on extra resources if it were asked to
provide additional services in Christie&#146;s, for example, through
its host contract and its LINK. That would have to be reasonably taken
into account. Secondly, the LINK for that area would be able to take
on, under the flexible arrangements put forward, specific roles,
functions and categories of membership to ensure that institutions such
as Christie&#146;s would be subject to proper scrutiny in this way
and that a person from outside the area could be a member of that
LINK.</div>
					<a name="07030683000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore we do
envisage providing bespoke coverage for these very important bodies and
institutions, but providing it through this framework means that it is
somebody&#146;s job to ensure that that happens. The danger in other
examples&#151;I appreciate the point the hon. Gentleman makes about
the existing provision, with which I am familiar, as he would
expect&#151;is that they would fall between two stools. Therefore I
agree with him and hope that he is satisfied by my
response.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): My hon. Friend&#146;s answer
is illuminating. I think that he has got the balance right. On one end
of the scale, dozens of LINKs might want to make their own inspection
of Christie hospital. At the other end of the scale, only the area in
which the hospital stood would be able to have any input at
all.</div>
					<a name="07030683000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has just spoken about people from outside a LINKs area being
able to be on the LINK for that area. That is a way forward, as is the
need&#151;which I think I mentioned earlier&#151;for LINKs to
liaise with each other and for a mechanism to exist whereby a LINK that
has a concern with Christie hospital is able to work closely with the
LINK for that area to make sure that those concerns are taken
forward.</div>

							<a name="07030683000498"></a>Mr.

						</b> I thank my hon. Friend and agree with him. That is
indeed what we are trying to do. In practice, that will happen because
of the cross-border relationships that exist. I have always wished that
the world was divided neatly according to local authority boundaries,
as that would make life more straightforward. However, he makes a fair
point.</div>
					<a name="07030683000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am
conscious of Committee members&#146; concerns about the provisions in
this clause, and that they will wish to see the regulations and the
result of the consultation on those. I am also conscious of the paradox
always faced by Ministers in asking for a power without the regulation:
not being able to promote genuine consultation and yet be not too
specific for Committee members. Therefore I hope that I have answered
the points to their satisfaction, particularly in relation to the
meaning and interchangeability of the words &#147;inspect&#148;,
&#147;view&#148; and &#147;observe&#148;. On that basis, I ask
for support for the

that good intentions can often turn out in practice to be another
tightening of the centralist screw that keeps control where it needs
it, and makes it more difficult to hear the voice of the patient and of
the ordinary citizen. We still do not really know what LINKs will be.
We are pretty sure that they will not be virtual entities, although we
cannot be certain. It will be left to local discretion and we do not
quite know what LINKs will look like. We do not know how many people
will be on the LINKs. We do not know whether LINKs will be small enough
to be manageable, effective and do their job or large enough to include
everyone who wants to be part, but who will therefore be rendered
ineffective because of that. We do not know whether there will be
sufficient money for the training of all those people, not least those
who will have the ability to look at premises and inspect, monitor or
audit them. However, they must be capable of doing their job, and if
there are large numbers of new people, where on earth is the suggestion
coming from that there will be enough funding to train
them?</div>

messed about by constant change. We do not know whether they will hang

exactly what it says or has it been changed subtly to the advantage of
managers and to the detriment of patients? We are concerned because we
have not received an

					<a name="07030683000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
this stage, we now put our broad concern to the Government. Widening
the involvement of bodies and parties in the process of monitoring and
scrutinising the health service is well intentioned, but there is a
danger of losing baby with the bathwater. I do not think that any of us
have had presented to us&#151;and in all fairness, I do not think
that the Minister sought to present to us&#151;the fact that anything
had gone drastically wrong with the forums. There were no criticisms of
their work; no evidence was presented of how they had fallen down on
their job; there was no evidence of the system being disrupted by the
activities of forums; and there was no suggestion that individual
troublemakers were causing difficulties for those who managed and
worked in the trusts or the staff who work so hard in the health
service. There was no evidence of any problems with the forum. What we
see here once again is the desire to meddle and the desire to change,
coupled with the sense that something is being taken away and that the
power of the centre is being strengthened.</div>
					<a name="07030683000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that reason, and because
those who work so hard in the forums feel so angry and upset about what
has happened&#151;but, no doubt, if the Bill is passed and the
measure goes through, will commit themselves to serving the health
service and patients wherever they may be, and will probably stick with
it&#151;we say on their behalf that we do not think that the forums

of reform and

Pugh:
						</b>
						This is the latest in a series of
abolitions. Community health councils have been abolished, and forums
are now being abolished and replaced by LINKs. All those organisations
have certain things in common: they are all essentially consultative
organisations. They differ in structure, membership and influence. They
are all affected by the changes. The constant change affects their
ability to function and be effective. There is also a loss of
institutional memory. However, to be fair, none of them is a decision
maker. The decision makers in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 554</div>health service are invariably the quangos. I turned to my community
health council when the children&#146;s A AND E moved out of my town.
It agreed with much of what I said but was powerless to prevent the
move.</div>
					<a name="07030683000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later on,
consultants suggested that the adult A AND E move out of town. I turned
to the patients forums and they backed me wholeheartedly. Although I
was grateful for their backing, the decisive factor was a change of
mind by the trust, which had as much to do with finance as it did with
the delivery of services.</div>
					<a name="07030683000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at things in the round,
the proposals are endeavouring to address a genuine democratic deficit.
One would have thought that the democratic deficit would easily have
been solved by making the quangos themselves accountable to local
people or having local people or locally elected people make the
decisions.</div>
					<a name="07030683000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government seem to take the view that health decisions, or decisions
about health services, are best made by the experts. They suppose that
the people on the quangos are experts. Things being done another way
appears to them to lead to madness, chaos, populism, liberal democracy
or whatever. The Government basically have that rooted view.</div>
					<a name="07030683000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
there is a clever new argument that the Minister has presented in the
course of these deliberations, which has also been presented by other
Ministers, and that is to distinguish between participative and
representative democracy. The former is a democracy in which people do
not actually decide. They just in some way participate. They get
consulted and informed. That is obviously better than not being
consulted and not being informed, and obviously good consultation is
better than poor consultation. What we are arguing about here is simply
models of consultation. I accept that consultation by itself is a type
of restraint. Consultation that is coupled with a power of further
reference is a further restraint, but it falls a long way short of what
I would like to see, which is democratic accountability. However, the
Government clearly do not envisage that happening in the immediate
future. All that we appear to be doing here is making a few timid steps
in that direction. None the less, I am grateful for that because over
the past few years, things have been moving in the opposite
direction.</div>
					<a name="07030683000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
predict how LINKs will grow and flourish. I would not like to lay bets
on what we will be saying about them in years to come. However, it is a
risk to change things. There is always a risk in doing that and one
always assumes that in taking the risk there must be some prima facie
case that the Government are looking at that says previous arrangements
have not worked as well as expected, or not done the job
intended.</div>
					<a name="07030683000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are not saying that the patients forums have not taken the
quangos to task in a sufficiently robust manner. If that was their
rationale and they thought that they had a better way of doing that, I
would warm to their proposals. If that is not their reason, they must
have another one. The fact that they have another reason renders me
fairly suspicious of their intentions and supportive of what is being
moved.</div>

						I should like to speak to
amendment No. 181. Before doing so, may I just say that I would not
want the further champagne moment on amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column555" />Column number: 555</div>No. 219 to be allowed to pass unnoticed. I am surprised that the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire forgot to mention it. Amendment No.
181 is designed to provide a proper transition between PPI forums and
LINKs, so the position is not the same as that which the Conservatives
have taken. If LINKs come about, we will have to deal with how we go
from where we are now to where we want to be. My understanding is that
the Bill will be enacted by the end of this year&#151;assuming that
it achieves Royal Assent, that is&#151;and that patients forums and
the commission will be abolished, say on31 December this year,
with LINKs coming into force the day after. Whenever that happens,
there will have to be a means of dealing with the changeover as
cost-effectively and smoothly as
possible.</div>

being successful. Secondly, on his point about transition, he will
remember the long-drawn-out demise of the CHCs and the difficulties in
staffing, contracts and everything else. He will want to make the point

to make, because the hon. Gentleman has just made it for me, which is
absolutely fine. If LINKs come about, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman
and others from all parts of the House will want the system to grow and
to start as strongly as possible.</div>
					<a name="07030683000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new duty on local councils
to contract for LINKs will come into force at the right time after the
abolition of the forums, but that is not the same as LINKs being in
place and fully functioning on the day after forums cease to exist. It
is important that we consider such matters, because if there is a
hiatus, or confusion and gaps of one kind or another up and down the
country, we will miss out on the opportunity to get the public involved
in something that many may wish to do, including those who are not the
sort to have been involved in committees in the past and might not have
been on CHCs or patients forums.</div>
					<a name="07030683000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We might also miss the
opportunity to have as many members of patients forums as possible
joining LINKs. The Minister of State, Department of Health, my right
hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central(Ms Winterton),
has gone out of her way to say again and again that there would be
nothing better than for all members of patients forums to become
members of LINKs. LINKs would involve many more people than just those
people; none the less, they would form an important basis of stability
for the new LINKs. However, if we do not have a proper transitional
arrangement, some of those people will disappear and opportunities will
be lost.</div>
					<a name="07030683000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concept
of LINKs, in the way that the Government have presented it, is highly
ambitious. We have never tried anything like it before. It is easier to
think in terms of the committee&#151;we are all used to committees.
Local government wants to have the new responsibility and welcomes it.
That is welcome, but we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 556</div>saw in our evidence sessions that although the leaders of local
government whom we questioned very much supported the principle of
LINKs, they had not had the time to go into the detail, which I fully
understand. I suspect, therefore, that the level of awareness
throughout the country of what will be needed, in setting up hosts and
so on, will be variable to say the least.</div>
					<a name="07030683000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bedfordshire is already quite
well advanced on that, however. I recently met two members of staff
from Bedfordshire county council whose job it is, or will be, to
concentrate entirely on helping to deliver the links of the LINK in
Bedfordshire. However, that will not be the case everywhere and there
will be variable states of readiness. Once the legislation is in place,
we will need to wait for further regulations and guidance. Consultation
on some of those documents will be needed, which is welcome. Budgets
will need to be in place. Advertisements will need to be published to
attract potential host organisations, and discussions and negotiations
will be needed with host organisations about what is needed in
particular parts of the country. That will all take
time.</div>

done at all. I will need some persuading to believe that it will take
place by 1 January next year. Some comments from my hon. Friend the
Minister on that point would be welcome. If that should prove to be the
case and it should be obvious by 1 September that the delivery will not
take place throughout the country, I hope that my hon. Friend will be
able to show willingness and open-mindedness towards delaying the
abolition and so on of the forums and the commission by three or six
months to ensure that the new system, when it starts, works as fully as
can be expected and, to use a phrase that is used increasingly in

Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I rise to support the

							<a name="07030683000510"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I believe that it came into effect in December
2003. Why did the Government not learn the lessons from setting up the
patients forums in whichever year that took place? We must remember
that everyone who sits on a forum does so voluntarily, and 4,500 people
around the country have developed expertise and experience in similar
things to what the LINKs will be expected to do. It seems most perverse
not to take advantage of that experience. My understanding is that when
the CHCs were abolished members were allowed to become members of the
forums. They were not encouraged; it was not an automatic process, and
as a result the development was haphazard. Some joined, some did
not.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 557</div>
					<a name="07030683000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we must have LINKs, why not
base them on the forums? Instead of transferring the assets of the
forums back to the Department of Health, the assets and personnel
should form the core of the new LINK. That would seem a logical
progression, and a perfectly sensible and joined-up thing to do. The
Government could benefit from the individuals&#146; expertise. If
some did not want to participate as a member of a LINK, fine. They
could look for other people to take on that role. I have yet to hear a
single argument from a Government Member about why it is appropriate to
proceed in the way that they propose.</div>
					<a name="07030683000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick up on the point
made by the hon. Member for Bedford about transition arrangements. He
mentioned what is happening in Bedfordshire country council, and he
will not be surprised that Shropshire needs to get a look in.
Shropshire has thought ahead&#151;because the provisions in the Bill
do little to help determine how the LINKs will be
established&#151;and will convert the forum into a LINK. The county
council has set up a body whose title does not easily trip off the
tongue: it is called the Shropshire PPI self-adopter committee. The
chairman of the Shropshire County primary care trust PPI forum has been
appointed as a facilitator, effectively to step into that role and to
start to work with interested bodies on how the LINK should be formed.
That is clearly a sensible model. The Minister might say that that is
what should happen around the country. I hope that he will, because it
will show that Shropshire, as usual, is ahead of the Government and
ahead of the game&#151;well, for the purposes of this Committee, it
shares that honour with Bedfordshire. If he does not say that, he must
explain what he expects the existing forums to do. I hope that he will
take this opportunity to do so.</div>

						</b> I begin by echoing a few points that I made
earlier. First, I do not think that there is anyone in the room who
does not regret having had to go through two reorganisations in such a
short space of time. Obviously, it would have been better if we had not
had to do so. Secondly, &#147;abolition&#148; is a very emotive
word, but it is also a technical term that is necessary to the Bill. If
clauses 160 to 162 were called &#147;Seamless merger of patients
forums etc.&#148;, I am sure that there would not be any such
problem.</div>

							<a name="07030683000513"></a>Tom

Gentleman executed his intervention very well indeed. Just as an aside,
I recall that 10 years ago almost to the day, the hon. Gentleman and
I&#151;the Tories did not turn up&#151;were debating health policy
at Stepping Hill hospital. One question was, &#147;Could you explain
the fundamental difference between the health policies of your two
parties?&#148; The hon. Gentleman expounded Liberal policy at great
length, and when it was my turn to reply, I said, &#147;The
difference is that we will put ours into practice,&#148; which we are
and have been doing successfully.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 558</div>
					<a name="07030683000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everyone accepts that there were
some very good community health councils, but that equally there were
others that we did not hear of, and others still that we would rather
not have heard of, because they did not do their job as well as others.
I do not know the forums&#146; movements quite so well, but I hazard
a guess that the same is true now.</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the hon. Member for

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000515"></a>Tom
Levitt:
						</b>
						The hon. Gentleman is right. I
am about to spell out why the need for that reform&#151;at the
moment&#151;is fundamental. Indeed, there are opportunities for
reform which did not previously exist. There are three reasons why
there must be reform now. First, to stop the trichotomy between the
good, the not so good and the best, the LINKs or the patient
involvement forums&#151;whatever form the bodies take&#151;must be
subject to scrutiny and oversight. The Bill links that&#151;with a
small &#147;l&#148;&#151;to the local authority process of
scrutiny, which only three or four years ago was still in its infancy.
There is now in local authorities a more mature system of scrutinising
what happens not only in the local authority world, but in the public
sector generally.</div>
					<a name="07030683000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we must expand the
sphere of influence and take in care, which means examining how the
voluntary and private sectors provide care. That in turn would involve
legal changes to the patient involvement process. Thirdly, there is now
a huge grey area between local authorities and health bodies and their
responsibilities for promoting public health. Barriers have been
imposed on what forums can scrutinise and examine, and it is necessary
to break them down. Those are three reasons why we can improve on what
we have now, and we must move forward.</div>
					<a name="07030683000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the Bill, but
particularly during the few hours in which we have discussed part 11, I
have been impressed with the way in which the Opposition, and the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire in particular, have taken such a
constructive view and engaged with the Bill. However, by voting against
any one of the three clauses, he would be suggesting that we should
have LINKs as well as the forums. That would be the consequence of
voting against any of the clauses, unless, of course, he votes down the
whole Bill. I think that he would agree that if we did not have a
patient involvement process at the moment, he would be hard pushed to
fault the proposal for LINKs. Only the fact that we are moving from one
process to another is causing disruption.</div>
					<a name="07030683000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer the Committee to our
earlier proceedings when I put the point about abolition to the

					<a name="07030683000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;We

number of forums, and quite frankly, in many parts of the country, they
do not have a high public profile. Furthermore, they are not linked to
the democratic process and to democratic accountability&#151;points
made by the hon. Member for Southport. Those concerns must be
addressed. We have a local authority scrutiny process, which was not
available before, but into which we can tie the new proposals. I hope
that we can get over the emotional response to the word
&#147;abolition&#148;, and move on in order to build a better
process, seamlessly, on new year&#146;s

fundamental questions. He asked the first not just from the point of
view of the Opposition, but from that of Conservative policy, with
which he is consistent. He is quite right to ask those two questions

five years since the legislation that established patients forums came

there has been significant change in health and social care provision

are needed to support a stronger voice for users and citizens and to
keep pace with that change, and that a system based on the scrutiny of
individual institutions is no longer appropriate. We want the new
system to be able to consider both health and social care so that
arrangements to promote and amplify the voice of users and the public
can be joined up across the entire
system.</div>
					<a name="07030683000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire raised the fear that the focused
voice of patients could be swamped if the Government are successful in
their goal of widening participation. On the contrary, such a
strengthened body, involving a swath of voluntary organisations, and
support, patients and carers groups, and so on will in fact strengthen
the umbrella body of the LINKs and give greater weight and authority to
the focused voice of patients, in particular owing to a more widespread
and professional approach.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column560" />Column number: 560</div>
					<a name="07030683000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon. Friend the Member for
High Peak hinted, there is a patients forum for every NHS trust,
foundation trust and primary care trust in England. Each forum has on
average eight members who, although I do not criticise their work at
all, clearly do not represent all the people in the areas covered by
their trusts. Forum members tend to speak about their own
concerns&#151;that is understandable; it is what we have asked them
to do&#151;rather than about those of the wider community. Membership
of forums is formalised through a process that tends to be exclusive. I
recognise that that was wrongly anticipated in the legislation. Thus
they attract only a narrow section of the population. The LINKs, by
contrast, are intended to seek the participation of a wider group of
people, including members of voluntary and community sector
organisations and individuals from each local area, and do not involve
a formal appointment
process.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07030683000414"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07030683000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
changes are necessitated by the significant changes that are taking
place in the health and social care system&#151;for example, the
changing configuration of primary care trusts; the changing role of
PCTs in relation to the commissioner of services; and the move towards
the joining together of PCTs and social services, which is a key aspect
not just of better provision of services but of covering the health and
social care of our population in an efficient and affordable way. The
movement that has occurred in Herefordshire, where the PCT and the
social services are joining together in a single trust, is of enormous
importance. Notwithstanding that example, the local area agreement
process and the other measures in the Bill are bringing together the
partners in this sector. In order to reflect those changes, we need an
accountability framework as well as the performance framework that we
have already
debated.</div>
					<a name="07030683000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
moving towards greater choice in service delivery. There is a more
comprehensive range of means of delivery, and quite right too. The
edges between the statutory sector and the private independent sector
are becoming blurred, to the benefit of patients and citizens more
widely. Finally, on this point, the increased joint commissioning
across health and social care is important.</div>
					<a name="07030683000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members and
colleagues on my side of the Committee would be right to ask,
&#147;Where have these changes come from? Are they a bolt from the
blue?&#148; It is possible to follow the development of policy over
the past seven to eight years, including at the time when the patient
forums were being introduced. Hon. Members may have seen House of
Commons Library research paper 07/01 on the Bill. The Library should be
commended for the excellent way in which it presents such information
for our benefit. That document points out on page
92:</div>
					<a name="07030683000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On 22 July
2004 the Government published the report of a review into NHS
&#145;arm&#146;s length&#146; bodies. John Reid, then Secretary
of State for Health, announced that the number of such bodies would be
reduced, saving at least &#163;500
million&#151;&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is
from a Government who are accused of establishing quangos; the reality,
in that area as in all areas, is the opposite&#151;</div>
					<a name="07030683000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and increasing resources that
could be channelled directly to frontline NHS patient care. One of the
&#145;arm&#146;s length&#146; bodies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column561" />Column number: 561</div>affected was the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in
Health, which would be
abolished.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will come
on to that when we consider clause 162. The document
continues:</div>
					<a name="07030683000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
review document said...Stronger more efficient arrangements to
provide administrative support and advice to Forums will be put in
place.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was written
in July 2004.</div>
					<a name="07030683000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The research
paper points out that the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement
in Health, which was involved in the review, took part in the review of
patient and public involvement that followed the 2004 report. Extracts
from the overview paper that it submitted to the expert panel set up by
the Government early in 2006 are reproduced in the report. I advise the
Committee to look to the words of the commission:</div>
					<a name="07030683000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Commission argued
that it was not feasible to continue with the current system and
instead recommended a system of local
networks.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Its
description of the failings of the current system included</div>
					<a name="07030683000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the high levels of frustration
within the system caused by discordance between vision in legislation
and
implementation&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07030683000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
may be a fault of legislation as well as of implementation, I admit,
but it is real nevertheless. Secondly, it states that the Department of
Health emphasises that</div>
					<a name="07030683000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the service improvement function,
monitoring and review of services is too often the sole pre-occupations
of Forums.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, it
says:</div>
					<a name="07030683000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Too
much has been expected of too few people. It is unrealistic to expect
volunteers, however committed, to do all the things that are expected
of Forums to improve all of the NHS services in their area, as well as
to engage the wider community in holding the NHS to
account.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">It then deals
with other problems, not criticisms of the activities of the
individual, and it recommends the setting up of networks similar in
concept to those that we are debating now.</div>
					<a name="07030683000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The force majeur for change is
to be found in the evidence of what is happening on the ground. It is a
result of the changes that are taking place. It is not reform for
reform&#146;s sake. It is creating a framework of accountability to
supplement the other changes proposed under the Bill within the
framework of sustainable community strategies, the statutory duty to
co-operate on partner organisations and local area agreements. One of
the four main funding streams is meant to join health and social care
in order to provide services to suit the individual rather than the
service provider. I believe that the case for change is
strong.</div>
					<a name="07030683000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
181, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford, deals with my
hon. Friend&#146;s concern that organisations should not fall between
two stools. My contention is that all patient forums as well as the
commission should remain functional until all links have been
established. If only one local authority were slow to establish a link
for its area, every other area would have to run the two systems in
parallel. Not only would that be impractical, but it could be hugely
expensive. To meet the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point, my hon.
Friend is keen to ensure that change is done in a way that will lead to
improvement. He is right to point out that the Government should not
and cannot be hasty in implementing those changes.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column562" />Column number: 562</div>
					<a name="07030683000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There is no
commencement date on the measures before the Committee, but we envisage
that it will be in the spring of 2008. Many of the measures that have
been put forward in the Bill ensure that new frameworks are in place
for April 2008. That is the beginning of the three-year spending period
within which we intend to provide stability for the funding of public
services. It explains why we are going through what we are going
through in terms of PCTs&#146; historic deficits. It explains why we
are creating the new accountability framework. It explains why, in my
answer to the hon. Gentleman about the commencement date of the new
performance risk management, I said that 2008 would be a desirable
date. That puts into the jigsaw that crucial piece required to ensure
service improvement in a devolved era&#151;namely, allowing
participation by a wide group of patients and potential patients in the
improvement of
services.</div>
					<a name="07030683000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">Patrick
Hall:</b> I find my hon. Friend&#146;s remarks very helpful. When he
referred to spring, I presume that he meant that the new system would
be under way by April 2008. That gives us a bit more time. However, in
order to prepare, money will need to be spent up front. Will he address
that point in order to give us further
reassurance?</div>
					<a name="07030683000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">Mr.
Woolas:</b> I think that I can give that reassurance through the
general powers of local authorities&#151;they will be watching the
progress of the Bill closely&#151;and the money that will be made
available through the new burdens procedure, because that procedure and
the agreements with Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury concerning in-year
spending apply. It is obviously desirable that commencement dates
coincide, when possible, with financial years. For some reason, the
financial year in this country runs from April to the following March.
I have never understood why, but it is probably something to do with
accountants&#146; holidays. We have criticised lawyers, but let us
not go on to
accountants.</div>
					<a name="07030683000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
hope that I have convinced the Committee that the case for change is
strong. I also hope that hon. Members are convinced that that will
provide the direction of travel, which they say they want and which we
want, towards more devolution and decentralisation. I ask the Committee
to resist the opposition to the
clause.</div>

Burt:
						</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s comments, and I
shall not bat each and every one back to him. The Library&#146;s very
good research paper enables me again to quote the then Minister,
Melanie Johnson, on page 91. When the Government announced in July 2004
that the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health would
be abolished, she made it clear in relation to the
forums:</div>
					<a name="07030683000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They
will not be abolished, nor will their independence be
undermined.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030683000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
commitment has obviously been
broken.</div>
					<a name="07030683000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
draw attention to the fact that we have forced from the Minister the
tough expression that effectively the patient forums are the wrong
people to do their job. They are being blamed for the fact that
although they volunteered, others did not, and that is why they are
seen to be
exclusive.</div>

Burt:
						</b> No, I will make my point. I hear what the Minister
says, and I know that it comes from the commission review&#151;that
is my third point&#151;which is again a top-down analysis of what is
wrong. That contrasts with the evidence given by forums to the Select
Committee. It is a difficult point. I know that the Minister is not
criticising the individual members of the forums&#151;no one here has
done that&#151;but somehow, because they do not institutionally
represent a wide enough group of people, that seems to be their fault,
and yet another attempt is being made to broaden, deepen and widen.
That attempt was made when the forums were set up after abolition of
CHCs in 2000. What will happen if the right people do not come forward
to provide the base material for the LINKs? Will they too be
scrapped?</div>
					<a name="07030683000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The feeling
is left that those who constituted CHCs and the forums have, despite
their best efforts, not quite performed institutionally as the
Government wanted, so they are digging them up and starting again. How
many times will that be done? A line should be drawn in the sand on
their behalf to say, &#147;Enough&#148;. We take the
Minister&#146;s point, but we do not agree. There is a question mark
over the process that has left so many people at grass roots level
dissatisfied. Accordingly, I move that the clause does not stand part

							<a name="07030683000541"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> We are now considering the abolition of the
Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. The word
&#147;abolition&#148; is in the Bill and has definite meaning.
However, it would be wrong to pass this clause without making one or
two remarks about the commission, which, despite living under a
sentence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 564</div>of execution for a long time, has continued to do what it was asked to
do by the Government when it was first set up. It has helped
patients&#146; forums to carry out a number of important tasks, which
I mentioned earlier. Those tasks have a wider dimension than what is
going on in a particular locality. I am referring to such things as
national surveys on the use of telephones in hospitals and the quality
of food in hospitals, and the current survey on personal dignity in
hospital wards. It is unlikely that those things would have been done
had they been left to individual forums. That goes back to the point
that I made about the need for a national dimension to be
organised.</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand what the clause is about, but we should not let it pass
without at least acknowledging that the commission has done what it was
asked to do and has continued to do that in what have been conditions
of uncertainty for some time now. We should thank the staff of the
commission for sticking to the job that they were asked to do. Judging
by what my hon. Friend the Minister said, abolition will take place
possibly in March or April next year. I am sure that between now and
then the staff will be professional enough to continue to carry out
their task as they have done thus
far.</div>

way in which the hon. Member for Hazel Grove saw it. I genuinely

						</b> I thought that the hon. Gentleman would take it in
that way. Who knows? His proposal in amendment No. 206 may well be
covered in other legislation, as he detected earlier from his
ministerial experience. Does he agree, in terms of general common sense
and use of English, that when such things happen in legislation,
perhaps there could be a note stating, to help those reading the
current draft, that there is a link somewhere else, so as to keep us in
the
picture?</div>

an enormous amount to do. Adding yet another aide-m(c)moire for us

						</b> The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question&#151;I am grateful to him for giving me time to find
it&#151;is set out in section 242 of the National Health Service Act
2006. It covers both health and social care by using &#147;care
services&#148;, which he used in amendments to previous clauses in
part 11 of the Bill. We agree that the duty should be extended, which
is why, as has been rightly said, the measures are an add-on to
existing legislation.</div>
					<a name="07030683000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about a note in the
Bill was debated by the Modernisation Committee, and the explanatory
notes provided work in that way. I understand that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point of view was resisted, and I add the other
argument that it is helpful for the Minister to be able to draw on such
examples to show that the policy is joined up. Section 242 of the
National Health Service Act 2006 refers to section 11 of the Health and
Social Care Act 2001.</div>

						</b> It does seem that a gap in the Bill may be created
by not specifying the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. I will
make it explicit that the NHS should consult. The Bill requires the NHS
to consult LINKs. However, I recognise that it is a question of
balance. Although we would expect NHS bodies to consult LINKs as a
matter of course, the danger of singling them out in legislation is
that it may provide cover to NHS organisations that only want to
consult LINKs. There are examples of bodies only consulting the
organisations specified in
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07030683000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
objective of Government policy would be that, in not too many years to
come, organisations including LINKs would be consulted as a matter of
course. It is a question of balance. We sought to ensure that NHS would
consult LINKs through the mechanisms and procedures of contracts that
we put in place. Specifying such a course of action may be used as an
excuse not to consult other bodies. Much of the Bill is about the duty
to consult and
involve.</div>

						I shall be succinct, rather than
brief, because this is a serious matter. To those of a suspicious cast
of mind, the introduction into the clause of
&#147;significant&#148; and &#147;substantial&#148; is
worrying. Surely that indicates a mechanism by which consultation can
be restricted. It appears that this is a mechanism to cut out concerns
that were considered trivial when raised in the past by those on
forums. Who is to decide what is substantial and significant? It is
suggested that the provision will avoid needless consultation on
trivial matters. However, there is a danger that those deciding what is
significant and substantial may not have the same point of view as, for
example, those representing patient
interests.</div>
					<a name="07030683000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
mentioning the representations that we have received from forums, I
again draw attention to the submission made by the Commission for
Patient and Public Involvement in Health, which has drawn attention to
those concerns. It
said:</div>
					<a name="07030683000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
a crucial difference between this clause and the previous

CPPIH welcomes the government&#146;s recognition of the need for
clarification of when the duty to consult applies, we are concerned
that under the Bill&#146;s proposals this duty may apply in only a
narrow range of
circumstances.&#148;</div>

the conclusions that it had come to would have informed this Committee.
Be that as it may, the question is this: why has the measure been

					<a name="07030683000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue arises from the
outcome of a judicial review that was brought last year by an
individual against the decision of the North Derbyshire primary care
trust to tender for the provision of a family doctor service in north

tender was won by a United States healthcare giant called United
Health, known in this country as United Health Europe.</div>
					<a name="07030683000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment does not tread on
that territory, however. It addresses the duty to consult users of
health services and the outcome of the High Court judgment in June 2006
that the duty may apply to contractual changes. That outcome was not
altered by the Court of Appeal&#146;s judgment in August that the
decision to award the contract be quashed and the tender process
started again with public consultation. I want to ensure that changes
in providers of health services which are proposed by primary care
trusts are subject to the duty to consult.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000558"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The group of amendments is wide ranging. The hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire was brief and concise, and raised an
important point about the inclusion of the word
&#147;significant&#148;. Let me explain where we are coming from.
The changes that we are making are to section 242 of the National
Health Service Act 2006, which was formerly section 11 of the Health
and Social Care Act 2001. They are important changes, the reasons for
which I should like to explain.</div>
					<a name="07030683000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it stands, section 242 is a
wide-ranging duty on the NHS to involve and consult patients and the
public. It does not recognise the different scale of changes, however,
and the fact that it might not be meaningful for NHS bodies to apply
the same duty to involve and consult for all the changes that they
make, however minor they may be. Furthermore, without some kind of
threshold, the duty has the potential&#151;this is a genuine
fear&#151;to bring about that often heard complaint of consultation
fatigue. We are trying to ensure that the changes to service delivery
that affect patients and service users are subject to consultation, but
that minor, day-to-day decisions, which we fear could be subject to
mischievous or vexatious interpretation, are not. By inserting the
threshold, we are aiming to ensure that when a change has a significant
impact on the range of services and the manner of their delivery, the
consultation required by section 242 is undertaken. Without such a
threshold, we fear that NHS bodies would have to consult patients and
the public on even the most trivial
changes.</div>

						</b> Who decides a dispute? What happens if LINKs believe

not?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000560"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The scrutiny regime that is being created would
have a view on whether a change was significant. It would ultimately be
a matter for legal interpretation. The professional inspectorate would
also have a view of what constituted a significant change. If a
hospital seeks to hide behind the idea of significance by saying that a
change is not significant, we would point to those aspects of the
legislation that refer to the delivery of services. The Government are
attempting to take away some of the management operational decisions of
trusts&#151;I would not quite call them trivial&#151;as opposed to
the direct delivery of services.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000561"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b>
						I suspect that everybody in the
Committee understands that there is a level of triviality to which
consultation ought not to descend. However, hon. Members will know of
plenty of examples of individual cases that may in themselves be
insignificant, but which have a much broader application. For example,
complaints about a particular ward on a particular day may be said to
be trivial or insignificant, but may be part of a broader pattern. Will
the Minister throw some light on the grey area that the current wording
of the Bill creates?</div>
					
					<a name="07030683000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030683000562"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> My argument is not that day-to-day management
decisions do not have an impact on patient services, and I hope that it
has not been interpreted that way. In some instances, such decisions
can and do impact on patient services. By giving examples, I might be
better able to explain the intent behind the measure. In every case,
whether an issue is significant or substantial will be determined by a
number of factors. A reduction in bed numbers, for example, might
result from there being too much capacity in the hospital, or because
there are other means of providing care that makes a number of beds
superfluous. A GP may change their opening hours because services are
being provided in a different way, but without any noticeable change
for patients. NHS bodies will need to weigh up each case and apply the
threshold appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07030683000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key is to ensure that
patients and the public are properly consulted in planning for the
provision of services. That is important in relation to section 242.
The measure allows NHS bodies to plan and deliver effective
consultation activity that is more likely to be meaningful to the
patients and members of the public that it will involve. The crucial
argument is about what affects patient services, the planning of
decisions by NHS bodies, and the consultation of public and patients.
The definitions of the words &#147;significant&#148; and
&#147;substantial&#148; are open to interpretation, as with the
word &#147;reasonable&#148; in a court of law. Cases on the cusp of
the definitions will give rise to controversy. The Government are
trying to ensure that there is meaningful consultation over the
planning for the provision of services.</div>
					<a name="07030683000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 218 is a
consequential amendment that follows on from amendments Nos. 209 and
210, so I do not need to speak to it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 570</div>
					<a name="07030683000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having looked carefully at
amendment No. 222, we consider that it will have no effect on what the
clause already provides. If there is a change in the provider of
services, the requirement to consult already applies assuming that
there will be a substantial impact on the manner in which the services
are delivered to their users. If, as I believe, the amendment is
intended to extend that to any change of service provider, even if it
has no effect on the manner in which services are delivered to users,
we do not support that. It is likely that service providers will change
over time, but just because a provider changes that does not
necessarily mean that the service will too. We do not believe that it
is sensible to consult patients and the public when the only change is
to the name of the organisation providing a
service.</div>

Hall:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend not acknowledge that even if
what he says about the service not deteriorating or changing is
absolutely right&#151;presumably the reason for changing the provider
is to improve the service&#151;it is legitimate for the public to be
concerned and ask questions about what might in some cases be perceived
as the privatisation of national health services? Surely that is a
perfectly legitimate matter for the public and others to engage
in.</div>

							<a name="07030683000564"></a>Mr.

proposed subsection would add no additional meaning to new subsection
(1B)(c). The</div>
					<a name="07030683000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;significant

					<a name="07030683000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">My argument on
amendment No. 217 is similar. As I understand it, the proposal is to
consult patients and the public on something that may or may not have
an impact on services actually received by users; for example, if a
change of service provider might result in a change of service. The
clause currently gives us something far more meaningful: the
requirement to consult on something that will have an impact on
services.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 234, in
clause 164, page 118, line 10, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) on any
disagreements between the Trust and the Local Involvement Network or a
Local Health Overview and Scrutiny
Committee.&#146;.</div>

am aware that Members selflessly give up their lunch as part of their
duties during Committee. I am reluctant to have them give up their
dinner as well, so I shall be very
brief.</div>
					<a name="07030683000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
states that primary care trusts must produce a report on the
consultation that they have carried out and the influence that it has
had on commissioning. The amendment suggests that, as part of this,
they highlight any major disagreements between the overview and
scrutiny committee and the PCT, and between the PCT and the
LINKs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 572</div>
					<a name="07030683000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment was tabled because
that is precisely what they would be most reluctant to do, but
precisely where the areas of concern would be, and where consultation
would have failed.</div>
					<a name="07030683000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having examined my amendment, I
must say that I wish I had included the word
&#147;significant&#148;, because as it is drafted at the moment, it
would seem to force them to list almost any disagreement of whatever
type. Therefore, if it helps, I will pre-emptively withdraw the
amendment. However, if the Minister wishes to respond, we will hear him
out.</div>
