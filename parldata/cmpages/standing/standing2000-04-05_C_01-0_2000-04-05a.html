</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Amess </B>(Southend, West): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
You and I entered Parliament 17 years ago, Mr. Gale. This is the fourth Parliament that we have enjoyed together. I speak for many others when I say that we have come to admire you as a man of great integrity and as a very hard-working Member of Parliament, fair-minded and determined but in every sense a champion of the underdog. I welcome your chairmanship of the Committee. The previous Committee of which I was a member that you chaired concerned a health matter. I am not suggesting that you were the champion of the underdog then, but I recall that I bored on at great length on several issues but always remained in order. I thank you for your indulgence during the hours that we spent in that Committee.

<P>
The good news is that I do not expect to have to make such lengthy speeches in this Committee. I moved the sittings motion to allow us to sit next week, for several reasons that concern me. I hope that we will all then have an opportunity to reflect on where we are with the Bill.

<P>
It is not immodest to claim that the Bill is noble because I do not regard myself as its chief architect. The plaudit for that should go to other hon. Members. One would have thought that the matter could have been dealt with just this one sitting; it goes without saying that we die unless we exist in an environment of a certain temperature, just as one dies if one does not eat or does not breathe air. Everyone should welcome the Bill. We had a splendid Second Reading with, I think, the largest turnout of any Friday. That was due not to me but to the excellent organisation behind the Bill. In all, 143 Members of Parliament turned up to support it, many others could not be there for genuine reasons, but we hope that they will be able to support it when it returns on Report. We had 22 speeches, covering a range of issues.

<P>
I have read carefully the Hansard report of the debate. Although 143 hon. Members supported the measure, it would be disingenuous of me to claim that everyone wholeheartedly agreed with it. I spoke for longer than I had expected on Second Reading, but I wanted to take all the interventions. I said to my right hon. Friends the Members for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) and for Penrith and the Border (Mr. Maclean) that I accepted that they were being constructive and that I very much wanted them to serve on the Committee, and I reinforced the point when we discussed the money resolution. I wanted them to be here, as they would probably have improved the Bill. Hon. Members would have been given the opportunity to make their detailed points concerning financial repercussions and duties on landlords.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) talked about the affirmative resolution on Second Reading, and the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) mentioned Northern Ireland. I fully expected all hon. Members with concerns to volunteer to be on the Committee. As we know, one need not serve on a Committee to table amendments. I tried to encourage others with concerns to serve but they were busy with other matters. I do not know what more I can do than suggest that such hon. Members serve on the Committee.

<P>
The main reason why we must sit next Wednesday is the Government's position. I welcome the Minister, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin). I say gently that I fully accept that he has difficulties with the Bill because Lord Whitty, the Minister with the lead responsibility on the subject, sits in another place. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs Gilroy) was at the meeting with the Government before Second Reading on 10 March; we had worthwhile conversations with Lord Whitty. There were difficulties concerning the number of definitions, but I felt that the meeting was constructive and that we had arrived at a compromise with which we could all live.

<P>
Before hon. Members groan, I should say that I regard myself as a straightforward person. Politics can be something of a game and there might be a sub-plot. If there is one, I hope that it will emerge this morning or next week. There seems to be a difference between what I thought we had agreed during the private meeting and the amendments that have been tabled.

<P>
I say to the Minister that I have no problem with taking three clauses from the Bill and inserting the new clause, but I have problems with the detail of the new clause. In essence, it seems to change the original thrust of the Bill. If I laid down and accepted it completely, the Bill's supporters would be annoyed with me for meekly giving way to the Government's new direction. I pay tribute to Miss Jenny Saunders and National Energy Action, which has done an enormous amount to promote the Bill. As I said on 10 March, although I find it awkward to be in a consensual role, I hope that we might persuade and encourage the Minister to reflect on the subject.

<P>
The new clause would first remove the requirement to set the eradication of fuel poverty as an objective. On 10 March, one or two of my colleagues grimaced at the expression ``fuel poverty'' and I remarked on it myself. Let us forget about the words: we are talking about people who cannot afford enough heating to ensure they are reasonably comfortable. I accept that the Government have a problem with definitions, but given the huge talents in the civil service it cannot be impossible to arrive at an acceptable definition. In fact, I felt following the meeting with Lord Whitty that we had arrived at an acceptable definition.

<P>
New clause 1 appears to restrict those who would be helped to lower-income households. If that restriction is accepted, there is a danger that only those on benefit will be included in the measures and other categories of people, who are also in need of assistance, will be excluded.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): I support the sittings motion, as we need time to discuss the issues. My hon. Friend has said that he does not want to exclude people who are not on benefit and that he wants the Bill to be inclusive. When then does the Bill not apply to Scotland?

<P>
<B>Mr. Amess:</B> My hon. Friend is tempting me into a debate on Scotland, but knowing the mind of our Chairman I will resist him. However, if I am called to move amendment No. 2, on Northern Ireland, I think my hon. Friend will come to understand my feelings about developed powers. I am concerned that new clause 1 will restrict the categories of people who can be helped under the Bill.

<P>
The hon. Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman) asked the Prime Minister a question. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the light of announcements already made, no one can doubt the Government's commitment to end fuel poverty, but there is still a great deal of ground to cover. Can my right hon. Friend assure the House that the inter-ministerial group that is charged with setting out the Government's fuel proverty objectives and how to meet them will report back as speedily as possible and enable us to eradicate that scourge forever.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I did not discuss that question with the hon. Lady. She asked it, but I agree with its sentiments. I was delighted with the Prime Minister's reply. He categorically stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes, I can give that assurance.-[Official Report, 22 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 978.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is good enough for me. If the Prime Minister gives an assurance that he wants to eradicate fuel poverty, I am delighted. There can be no argument.

<P>
I am surprised, then, that the Minister has tabled new clause 1, which-whether or not there is some confusion on the matter-does not encapsulate the spirit of the Prime Minister's reply to the hon. Lady on 22 March. I can see that my hon Friend the Member for West Chelmsford wants to reflect on that point. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton who was responsible for winning a commitment from the Government for the inter-ministerial group to set a target date for the eradication of fuel poverty. All those who support this measure were delighted with that commitment. The Minister himself supports the aim of eradicating fuel poverty. Before he became an Under-Secretary, he signed three early-day motions to that effect. I know that we can argue about the import of early-day motions, but I also know that I do not have to convince him that it is a good Bill.

<P>
For those and many other reasons-the Bill has huge support, and we are all busy people-the idealistic hope was that we could deal with the Bill in one morning sitting. However, because some of those hon. Members who have raised questions were not available to serve on the Commitee, and because I am concerned about the intent of the Government's new clauses, I believe that we should sit next Wednesday in the morning and the afternoon. I hope that the Committee will support the sittings motion.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I support the suggestion of the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) that we should sit next week. I, too, have some fundamental concerns about the Government's amendments. We shall need time to ensure that the pledges that have been made by a series of Ministers will be honoured and that the expectations of the hundreds of Members of Parliament who signed early-day motions in support of a 15-year programme to insulate millions of homes will be fulfilled. That will take some time. It is regrettable that when hon. Members become Ministers, they shed all their previous commitments and withdraw their names from all early-day motions. However, the record shows that the Under-Secretary put his name to several early-day motions supporting the principles outlined in the Bill.

<P>
The Prime Minister has pledged to eradicate fuel poverty, saying that it is a serious problem that affects millions of people. One of the key factors that we shall need to establish-if not today, next Wednesday and, if necessary, the following Wednesdays-is how many millions of people the Government believe are affected by the problem. Is it 4.3 million? Is it 5 million? Perhaps it is 8 million?

<P>
We need to know what definition of fuel poverty the Government intend to use. If amended, the Bill would cover only lower income groups. That sounds good in principle, because it would ensure that someone who owned a manor house with 25 bedrooms did not qualify. However, that definition could exclude a substantial number of people in fuel poverty who are just on the edge. Under those criteria, they will not receive benefits. They will miss out on the measures proposed in the Bill, and will remain in fuel poverty.

<P>
The definition of fuel poverty is important. Changing the criteria from the recognised definition of 10 per cent. of disposable income to 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. of gross income does not magically make things better for those who used to be covered by the 10 per cent. disposable income criteria. They will no longer be covered; they will continue to suffer fuel poverty. They will not be miraculously swept out of fuel poverty and be sitting in warm homes simply because the definition has been changed slightly.

<P>
We need to know also how long the programme will take. The hon. Members, who signed those early-day motions, many of whom are here today, signed up to a 15-year programme. Where is that programme? What is the final target date? It seems to have disappeared from the Bill under the Government's amendments. That is a source of enormous concern. We shall have to return to the matter, if not today then in the days and weeks to come.

<P>
Finally, we need reassurance that what the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) said last night does not apply and that the Government are not seeking to make the provisions into a wishy-washy Bill. The Bill that became the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 springs to mind as an example of such legislation.

<P>
We should be concerned about the hard, concrete delivery-I shall not use that phrase again-of the Bill's aims. I am worried that the Bill will not ensure that fuel poverty is eradicated if new clause 1 is agreed to. I am also worried that within a fixed 15-year period, the millions of people whom the Prime Minister acknowledged to be seriously affected will not be sitting in homes that are properly insulated and sufficiently warm.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I shall speak briefly in support of the sittings motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West. I should like also to add a word of caution about the length of time for which the Committee could consider the Bill.

<P>
I share the concerns expressed about new clause 1 by my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake). We need proper time to debate the provision and to try to persuade the Government that it is not needed. It contains rather vague wording. It would require an authority to publish a strategy that sets out policies for ensuring
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that as far as reasonably practicable the homes of persons on lower incomes can be kept warm at a lower cost.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The rest of the clause is also vague and would make the Bill open to subsequent arguments. Neither the Bill nor the new clause define a lower income. An income may be low for some people but not for others. Governments, regardless of their political complexion can behave very differently according to the financial circumstances of the Treasury.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West and the hon. member for Carshalton and Wallington were also concerned about being signed up to a 15-year time scale. That has always been one of the main themes of the campaign, but to the best of my knowledge the Government have made no corresponding commitment. It is important to include such a commitment in the Bill, so that the Government or a future Conservative Government cannot backslide during the next 15 years.

<P>
Let me add a word of warning. I have some authority to do so, having been a Government Whip with responsibility for private legislation. Indeed, last year, I piloted my own private Member's Bill through Parliament. Fortunately, I had 100 per cent. support from the Government, although that did not necessarily mean that I had 100 per cent. support from Opposition Members-that is probably more difficult to overcome than Government objections.

<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West said, the Bill has significant suppoort in the House. However, I am not naïve or stupid enough not to recognise that it is also opposed. As hon. Members know, it is easy to pick off private Member's Bills during their passage through the House. Proper sittings are needed because important issues must be thrashed out and because we hope to persuade the Minister of the wisdom of our views, including those that apply to the new clause. However, we would do no one a service if we talked out the Bill by taking full advantage of the sittings motion. It would be best to get the Bill through Committee as quickly as possible, but with sensible, rational debate on the aspects that we think could be improved and enhanced. Perhaps it can leapfrog other Bills that are in the list of private Member's Bills, to enhance its opportunities at the most critical stage of its life-Report stage. I warn my hon. Friend and any supporter of the Bill that if its Report and Third Reading are on the last available Friday of this Session, it will be desperately exposed and open to being picked off by one hon. Member who does not share our enthusiasm for it.

<P>
I urge hon. members to accept the motion, but not to indulge in the luxury of using it to its ultimate degree. We need to get the Bill out of Committee, and if we must make some compromises resulting in a Bill that is three quarters of a loaf rather than a whole one, even that, sadly, will be better than no loaf at all. We must take that approach to protect the Bill on Report.

<P>
<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): I support the sittings motion. It is important that we have time to take in the implications of new clause 1. I tend to be among the optimists in the House and I take to heart the words of wisdom of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford about proceeding with due diligence and haste. We should not delay too long, but we need a period of reflection to enable us to maximise the potential of the Bill and fulfil the aspirations of the 400 hon. Members who have signed the early-day motion. It is difficult to understand why any hon. Member would not support the Bill during this particularly cold week, but that is a possibility.

<P>
I have some concerns about the differences between the Bill presented by the hon. Member for Southend, West and new clause 1. Now is not the time to go into detail, but they include the vagueness of the definitions of fuel poverty. I am not sure that I share the concerns that have been expressed about the phrase ``lower incomes'' in the new clause. That could be preferable to a firm reference to low incomes, but we need time to debate it.

<P>
The differences between new clause 1 and the Bill with respect to the relationship between objectives and targets should be fully explored. There may be good reasons for the change, because fuel poverty can be tackled in many ways. One way, which is an important element of the Bill, is through energy efficiency measures. However, downward pressure on the costs of keeping a home warm can be exerted by reductions in taxation such as VAT on fuel, by regulatory measures such as the Utilities Bill, which will reduce the price of electricity by 10 or 20 per cent. and by increasing people's incomes. Goodness knows, the goalposts have been moving rapidly in recent Budgets, especially in the latest one, so tackling child and pensioner poverty by increasing incomes must be taken into account.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
If we are serious about tackling child and pensioner proverty, we must also be serious about tackling fuel poverty because there is a great difference-and great unfairness-between people who spend 5 per cent. of their income on fuel bills and people who are in extreme fuel poverty, who, as we have seen from reports from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, spend as much as 20 to 30 per cent. of their incomes on fuel. Among those are the many people who, sadly, die each year-the excess winter deaths, which the campaign that backs the Bill has so clearly brought to our attention each year. I am optimistic that we will tackle fuel poverty because I am optimistic about our measures to tackle child and pensioner poverty.

<P>
I mentioned the Utilities Bill, to which we might return. Along with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, I had the singular pleasure among Committee members of serving on the Standing Committee that considered the Utilities Bill, which is already having an impact. It is difficult to make the sort of estimates that hon. Members would like to be included in this Bill, but we must be certain that it will be effective in bringing about an early end to fuel poverty. We talked about 15 years-

<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> The hon. Lady has just reached the point that I wanted to ask her about. Does she consider that 15 years is a realistic period in which that can be achieved?

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his timely intervention. When I entered Parliament, I thought that 15 years was an extremely ambitious target, but after 25 years of campaigning to end fuel poverty-I was a founder member of the Scottish fuel poverty forum-and having done a considerable amount of work with other hon. Members in examining the shifting goalposts that I have just mentioned, my optimism extends to thinking that 15 years is by no means ambitious. In fact, it probably underplays what we could achieve. However, with so many shifting goalposts, it is exceptionally difficult to estimate what it will cost. Those of us in the warm home Bill group have been trying to work out the figures, and we found many reasons to be optimistic about how it could be paid for, as the hon. Member for Southend, West said in his opening remarks.

<P>
Many new avenues have become available to us. The housing Green Paper was published this week. I have not had time to read it in detail, but it certainly seems that the Bill could pay for itself through savings in health and housing over 15 years. Those are difficult calculations, but my instincts tell me that it will at least pay for itself over 15 years. That is a reason to support the sittings motion because we need to hear what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has to say about the Government's approach.

<P>
I received written answers on this subject in November and December. Indeed, the question that was answered on December 21, the day before the Christmas recess, might have been the last question of the millenium. We have had time to reflect on the matter since the Bill was drafted and new clause 1 was tabled. I wonder whether the Prime Minister's recent contribution to the debate confirmed the content of the response to my question in December.

<P>
In response to my question, my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government have introduced a wide range of programmes to tackle low income and poor energy efficiency, which are the main causes of fuel poverty, as well as the liberalisation of the energy markets which has lead to significant falls in the cost of keeping warm. An inter-ministerial group, chaired jointly by the Minister for Energy and our noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, has been set up to consider the impact of all these initiatives on fuel poverty. The group will seek to develop a more accurate picture of the extent of the problem, how quickly it can be addressed, and at what cost, so that a target date can be set for the elimination of fuel poverty in England-[Official Report, 21 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 528W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that remain the Government's approach?

<P>
Our debates on what is meant by fuel poverty must draw on what is happening in that inter-ministerial group. I hope that the Under-Secretary will say something about its meetings so far and its timetable for setting objectives. When will it be able to recommend a target date for the elimination of fuel poverty in England?

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Simpson </B>(Nottingham, South): I, too, consider it a privilege to serve on the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. In paying tribute to the people who have played a part in tackling fuel poverty, we should acknowledge the all-party genesis of the Bill, which stretches back a number of years. My first involvement in such a Bill was when Sir John Hannam tried to push a Bill on home energy conservation through the House. He put in many years of work before he managed to introduce a private Member's Bill.

<P>
An unsung hero in that process was the Minister, Robert Jones, who gave a phenomenal amount of open-handed help to identify the grounds on which it was possible to make progress. If anyone brought home to me the value of extra sittings of a Committee and the need to clarify a Minister's objectives, it was Robert Jones. He said that the objectives in a private Member's Bill are not to seek perfection, but to try and get right what we can. If we identify what can be done and do it well, it will prepare the ground for all that is to follow. Those who followed the Bill's precursors also benefited from that wisdom-Baroness Maddox, who took the matter on to the next stage, myself, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton, and now the hon. Member for Southend, West. We are part of a process. It will not end here; it will move the policy on incrementally, which will eventually meet the objective of eliminating fuel poverty in the United Kingdom.

<P>
The most important reason for wanting additional sittings is to clarify which limited but important objectives are to be included in the Bill. The Government's amendments include a number of worthy terms that are dangerously unspecific. Unless we give ourselves time to reflect on those terms, we could do a disservice to the process, getting bogged down in a lack of clarity rather than addressing the key objectives. The Committee needs to consider several terms, on which I hope the Minister will reflect. For instance, the phrase ``reasonably practicable'' is difficult to define, and the term ``lower incomes'' is open to an enormous range of interpretations. It would be extremely helpful if the Bill gave some clarity to the terms used and to the objectives that the Bill attempts to meet. It would help also to re-impose a time frame on the Bill's objectives.

<P>
I was quite amused during the debate on the money resolution that took place in the House last night. The right hon. Members for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) and for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) rightly raised important questions about money issues. They asked how much money would be involved, how it would be raised and whether it would come from the public domain. It would be extremely helpful if we were able to discover the component parts of those costs. It is by no means certain that those costs would have to be paid entirely out of the public purse. In fact, it could probably be done at no cost to the public purse. It would have a cost to society, but those costs could be met in different ways. If we can legitimately talk about the various cost choices rather than how much it would cost, the Committee will have done Parliament a considerable service.

<P>
The challenge of addressing fuel poverty has two distinct aspects-those who live in fuel-poor households, and those who live in fuel-poor homes. We should recognise that it may not be possible to devise a strategy that will address both. One of the tragedies of life is that those who live in fuel-poor households are often moved around-or they move themselves around-from one fuel-poor home to another. The core of the problem is how we deal with housing conditions. A sobering reflection after the presentation of the Green Paper yesterday, is that this country is starting the century with a housing stock that does not meet the minimum standards that Scandinavia set itself in the middle of the previous century. I mention that to define-without blame-the scale of the problems that Parliament must tackle.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins </B>(Luton, North): My hon. Friend makes a strong point which relates to how to pay the costs of warm homes. Does he agree that, if the nation had invested more in warm homes, we would be better off collectively, because over time we would save enormous amounts on national energy costs, as well as making people warmer in their homes?

<P>
<B>Mr. Simpson:</B> That is absolutely right, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton mentioned, in the recent warm homes hearings it was useful to be able to see where the cost savings would come in a process of investing in the quality of housing. Savings would be found in the quality of people's lives. There would be savings on housing stock maintenance and in the national health service. Directing people into work and making them tax contributors rather than benefit dependents would be a cost saving. A series of savings and gains would be derived from the virtuous circle of eliminating, instead of ignoring, housing and fuel poverty. A stronger argument is, perhaps, that it costs a lot to deal with this matter well, but it costs more to do it badly. We need to ask how to meet the costs in the best way for society-especially people who are fuel poor.

<P>
The issue affects more people than just those who are fuel poor. Climate change dramatically alters the context of our debate. For all the wisdom brought to the debate in Scandinavia up to 1945, I doubt whether climate change featured at all. However, it will probably be the biggest factor driving political policy-making this century, to limit the damage done in a century of neglect. The scale of the problem is awesome. The Kyoto conference called for a 60 per cent. cut in the planet's carbon emissions by 2050, and the Government's draft climate change programme responded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The challenge of climate change cannot be underestimated. Developed Country emissions will have to be reduced by more than 60-70 per cent. globally  reductions of as much as 90 per cent. may be required. For comparison, the targets agreed in the Kyoto protocol will only cut developed country emissions by 5.2 per cent. between 2008 and 2012.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have not a shred of doubt that part of the challenge will involve domestic carbon emissions from fuel-inefficient housing stock in this country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brake rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. I have been listening carefully to the debate. The Committee has a high regard for the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of the subject, but we are going rather wide of the sittings motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I shall try to keep to the point. Does the hon. Gentleman expect the Minister to give an outline of the different impacts on climate change of adopting the criteria of a 10 per cent. disposable income, a 10 per cent. gross income, or a 20 per cent. disposable income.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. That is precisely the line of argument that I wanted to dissuade hon. Members from taking up at the present time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simpson:</B> I note the hon. Gentleman's point. I will not pursue it, but I hope the Minister will come back to the Committee on that. It is one argument for additional assistance.

<P>
I should like the Minister to use the extra time that I hope will be granted under the sittings motion to explain how the Bill will be consistent with other Government policy targets and objectives. Specifically, I hope that the Committee will have the time to address the issue of a timetable. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton was asked whether the measures could be delivered in 15 years. Like her, I assumed that they could be, which means that they ought to be delivered in even less time. I was fearful of admitting that until yesterday when I say the Green Paper that the Government are bringing forward, in which they set a target of 10 years for ensuring that the social housing stock is brought up to a decent standard.

<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will come back to the Committee to explain whether there is a case for removing the time frame from the Bill when we are seeking to impose time frames in other areas of Government policy. How can the fact that we are seeking to remove the time frame from this policy area accord with the time-specific obligations that we have set for eliminating child poverty and for delivering decent standards in social housing? The additional sittings would give the Committee an opportunity to ensure that the Bill is consistent with the other objectives being set out as non-negotiable benchmarks against which current policy commitments are being made. I do not wish to push the Government into an area with which they are reluctant to engage. I wish only to make the Bill consistent and coherent with other policy initiatives.

<P>
In terms of the Bill's objectives, we need to be clear about what we can seek to obtain legitimately and modestly in such an important Bill. We need to be clear that we are seeking to establish a new point of policy in the process. Secondly, we need an opportunity to ensure policy consistency and coherence. I fear that, without additional sittings, which will give us an opportunity to reflect on the clauses which are being proposed, the Bill could lose coherence rather than deliver it.

<P>
It is incumbent upon us to reflect on the marker that we put down for the future. We are addressing the issue today only because of groundwork carried out by our predecessors, and we have a duty to prepare the groundwork for those who will follow, hopefully with their own private Member's Bills. I hope that we can take those responsibilities seriously, and I hope that granting us the additional time will give us the space to do so.

<P>
<B>Ms Joan Walley </B>(Stoke-on-Trent): I welcome the opportunity to serve on the Committee because the Bill is important. I certainly look forward to serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, because I am sure that you will keep us in order throughout our proceedings, which is important because we have such significant business to deal with.

<P>
I wish to speak in support of the sittings motion, but I want first to congratulate the hon. Member for Southend, West on promoting the Bill. I am conscious that those who have the opportunity to introduce a private Member's Bill on this subject take up a baton that many people, both inside and outside the House, have been carrying on behalf of so many to whom it really matters that we end fuel poverty. In serving on the Committee, I hope to lend my support to bringing about the Bill's objectives-warm homes and energy conservation. In all my work in support of these measures, along with many others, I never forget why I am here because I am aware of the extent of fuel poverty and aware of the importance of ensuring that we meet our climate change obligations; the two issues must be considered together.

<P>
I wish to bring to the Committee's attention the work of the Select Committee on Environmental Audit, a new Select Committee that was set up after the last election. Its brief is to consider what needs to be done to integrate environmental issues. I refer in particular to that Committee's seventh inquiry, which considered energy efficiency. In that inquiry, we tried to consider the wider picture, not only of global warming, but of how we can set and meet targets for energy efficiency. We considered the issue from a local, national, international and global standpoint. The report set out recommendations on fuel poverty. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The persistent problem of fuel poverty in the UK is a continuing national scandal. Its contribution to 30,000 extra winter deaths (including some caused by cold within the home) and the fact that up to four and a half million people are significantly affected, should be addressed with the sort of urgency and determination usually reserved for more sudden crises here and abroad.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Government welcomed that recommendation, to which they wish to respond in full. However, to follow it up, we must have joined-up thinking right across Government. We must ensure that, in its future Budget proposals, the Treasury considers how its policies can help to bring about the necessary changes. We must also consider how, through the work of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Trade and Industry, all aspects of policy on energy efficiency and fuel poverty can be co-ordinated.

<P>
I also welcome the interministerial working group on that issue. There is evidence that it is doing its job, not least in the publication yesterday of the Green Paper on housing. Although I have not had the opportunity to study it in detail, I bring to the Committee's attention chapter 12 on tackling fuel poverty and improving energy efficiency. That should give us hope that, through the working group, there is an opportunity to consider how all aspects of policy can be tied up together.

<P>
I understand that there might be a problem in that the Government might not be able to go as far as we would like. Indeed, when the Environmental Audit Committee was set up, the Deputy Prime Minister referred to us as the terrier biting the Minister's trouser leg. I have every confidence in the Minister, who I know has a long-standing track record on issues of environmental sustainability. Through the skills, competence and humour that he brings to the House, he has a way of crystallising what is needed and ensuring that it can be delivered. I hope that the sittings motion will give him extra support, enable him to respond to hon. Members' concerns and allow him to table amendments giving the Committee the confidence that the problems dealt with by the Bill are being treated as a national disaster. I am struck by the acute nature of these problems when I go into the houses of constituents who do not have any way of keeping warm. Some people would not benefit from any amount of extra assistance with bills as the heat will go out through the roof, so proper capital investment is needed. I hope that we will be able to equip my hon. Friend with what he needs to return to the House with appropriate proposals.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
In case my hon. Friend has any further difficulties with proposing legislation that we can all happily go along with, I should point out one of the other actions taken by the Environmental Audit Committee. Along with many others, it pressed for a green Ministers conference. The green Ministers committee, a sub-committee of the Cabinet Committee, has now been established. It is a forum where environmental sustainability issues can be thrashed out and resolved and where environmental policy that appears to contain contraditions within contradictions can be dealt with. Does my hon. Friend agree that that green Ministers forum might be a practical means of ensuring that fuel poverty is ended within a realistic time frame?

<P>
I sat in the Chamber last night during consideration of a financial resolution in connection with the Bill and heard the words of the right hon. Member whom I think represents-[Hon. Members: ``Bromley and Chislehurst.''] I have some difficulty in recalling the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, as I remember him in a previous incarnation in the House. He referred to the extortionate cost of implementing the Bill's aims. However, we must consider the cost of not implementing them-especially the health cost. As a civilised society, we cannot afford the health costs of not implementing the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> I am pleased that my hon. Friend is a member of this Committee and that she is giving us the benefit of her experience in the Environmental Audit Committee. Did that Committee examine the efficiency and best practice programme published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which showed, for example, that public sector landlords could expect to save in the order of £300 and £400 per dwelling per year by making comprehensive energy efficiency improvements?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that we are discussing a sittings motion. I am trying to be lenient, but the debate is starting to stray wide of the mark. The matters currently under discussion can and should properly be raised later during our consideration of the Bill. At the moment, there is little sign that we shall reach those debates.

<P>
<B>Ms Walley:</B> I acknowledge the depth of knowledge on these matters possessed by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton and her grasp of their detail. We must ensure that when such savings can be made, the information is fed back to people who are in leadership positions and who will make decisions on the extent of Government support for the Bill.

<P>
Let me illustrate why the Bill is so important. For many months, the Environmental Audit Committee pressed the Treasury to grant more concessions on the value added tax that is applied to energy-saving materials, but Customs and Excise told us that that was not allowed under European legislation. That has now been reversed and Budget 2000 signals the Government's change in policy on VAT on such materials. The Government's support for the Bill is consistent with other aspects of their policy. If my hon. Friend the Minister does all that he can to ensure that we implement the Bill over 15 years instead of 10 years, he will have done a good job. By the same token, our sittings motion will have proved that time taken now is in the interests of the long-term future of the planet.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during the proceedings on the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, I remind hon. Members that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. Adequate notice must be given of all amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those that are tabled in the morning and reached in the afternoon.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Amess:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) in relation to Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 15, in clause 6, page 3, line 8, after ``Wales'' insert ``and Northern Ireland''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Amess:</B> I forgot to apologise for my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) who is our spokesman on this subject. He meant no discourtesy by not being here this morning, but when the British public, in their infinite wisdom, decided practically to wipe out Conservative Members of Parliament in the general election, they did not anticipate that the Liberals would be so supportive of the Government. As a result, we are somewhat stretched and my hon. Friend has to represent us on the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill. I hope that he will share our deliberations next week.

<P>
The amendment was tabled in response to a speech that the hon. Member for East Antrim made on 10 March, which was supported by the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth). Its purpose is to test and clarify how Northern Ireland will fare. The suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the uncertainty about its future make it difficult to know how best to eradicate fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. Were the Assembly in operation, this would be a devolved matter, as it is in Scotland.

<P>
If my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford had been present, I would have directed that comment at him. The Labour party is committed to eradicating fuel poverty in Scotland in eight years. It is important that we test the matter as it relates to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The principle that fuel poverty is a scandal that should be ended applies as much to Northern Ireland as it does to the rest of the United Kingdom.

<P>
I shall share with the Committee a few stark facts about how disadvantaged Northern Ireland is as a region. In the UK, unemployment is 9.8 per cent., of which long-term unemployment is 45.6 per cent. In Northern Ireland, unemployment is 14.5 per cent., of which long-term unemployment is 67.3 per cent. That huge difference reflects the lack of job opportunities in Northern Ireland. The UK's gross domestic product is 99 per cent. of the European average, but Northern Ireland's is only 79 per cent. Those who are dependent on social security constitute 13.5 per cent. of the population in the United Kingdom as a whole, but a fifth in Northern Ireland. The average gross weekly income per household in the United Kingdom is £369.39. In Northern Ireland, it falls to £326.30. Again, that is a huge difference.

<P>
Northern Ireland is also disadvantaged in energy. The average household's weekly spending on fuel, light and power is £12.09 in the United Kingdom, but £15.06 in Northern Ireland. The cost of fuel in Northern Ireland has risen by an average of 2.8 pence per unit compared with only 0.18 pence per unit in the United Kingdom over the same period. I very much hope that the Committee will accept the evidence that there is a real problem of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. Northern Irish politicians have expressed their support for the Bill. Members of all parties have signed early-day motions. For very good reasons, Northern Ireland Members feel that their constitutents, too, should benefit from a Bill that will be of enormous benefit to many people in England and Wales. I hope that the Minister may be able to clarify the situation in Northern Ireland in the light of the present political uncertainty.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> It is a pleasure to serve under you once again, Mr. Gale. I am now on four Standing Committees. The amendment, as the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) has just said, would lead to the extension of the powers in the Bill to Northern Ireland. I am advised that fuel poverty is being tackled there from a number of different fronts: for example, the Northern Ireland domestic energy efficiency scheme that is currently under review. It is intended, subject to ministerial clearance, to introduce a new scheme of assistance, on broadly similar lines to the home energy efficiency scheme, with effect from 1 April next year.

<P>
The Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland is piloting three innovative energy efficiency schemes in socially and economically deprived areas with the objective of using the energy efficiency measures as a catalyst for promoting social inclusion. The Department is also working in partnership with other key energy players in Northern Ireland, providing energy efficiency measures to a series of miscellaneous schemes targeted on vulnerable groups. Positive action is clearly being undertaken on fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. In addition, of course, pensioners there will be benefited from some of the measures introduced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, such as the reduction of value added tax on fuel and the great increase in the winter fuel allowance.

<P>
The matters with which the Bill deals have been transferred to the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has the power to legislate in these areas. As hon. Members know, the Assembly is currently suspended, but we hope that the suspension will be short-lived. The hon. Member for Southend, West will appreciate that this is a matter over which my Department does not have a great deal of influence, and the mere setting of a target will have no effect on the political process in Northern Ireland.

<P>
In the current circumstances we do not believe that it will be appropriate to extend these provisions, committing resources on behalf of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is right that, when the suspension is lifted, as we hope it will soon be, local politicians who understand the particular needs of people in the Province should take these decisions. I therefore suggest that the amendment should not be made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation, but I think that it would be helpful if we drew a distinction between the mechanisms for addressing fuel poverty and the important role that the House and national legislation have in setting targets and obligations for the United Kingdom as a whole. As impressed as I was by the Minister's list of activities and programmes taking place in Northern Ireland, in all probability one could list equivalent programmes and initiatives in any other part of the United Kingdom.

<P>
In the warm homes group in Parliament, which I have the privilege of chairing, we have a whole series of presentations that not only come from different parts of the country but are delivered with different social partners. Some are in the voluntary sector; some in the energy sector; and some in local authorities. They all mirror the initiatives and partnership frameworks that the Minister listed in relation to Northern Ireland. The Bill is intended not to prescribe or define the specific partnerships for delivery but to set a framework in which we hold ourselves to account in relation to the whole of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The duty to monitor and report will no doubt be reflected in the bids for slices of the financial cake that come from the different Assemblies or the Scottish Parliament. By including Northern Ireland in that framework, we make the point that the United Kingdom as a whole has a problem and recognise that the manifestation of that problem will be different in different parts of the United Kingdom. There will be regional differences in our approach to the problem of fuel poverty in Yorkshire and in Cornwall, for example. It is right that the partners in each area should be the driving force in finding how best to tackle the problem.

<P>
To turn the Minister's argument on its head, if we were presented with an amendment in Committee that suggested that we take Cornwall out of the Bill because people will go ahead in their own way there, we would not entertain it. Hon. Members, quite rightly, would say that it is not a question of how it is done but whether it should be done: whether one is under an obligation to address the problem.

<P>
We do not wish to prescribe, and the Bill does not attempt to prescribe, how different Assemblies and diferent parts of the United Kingdom should tackle and eliminate fuel poverty. It unites us, though, in a commitment to acknowledging the problem and facing the challenge, and asks us to report back on how we are setting about tackling it. I struggle to see how I would feel, if I were a Northern Ireland Member, if the United Kingdom Government failed to consider Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingedom. It seems to have been specifically excluded from the broad framework of targets and obligations that we are trying to set out. There is the considerable danger of sending out that the message that this Committee-and, by implication, this Parliament-does not take an interest and does not have a view about fuel poverty in Northern Ireland, even though, as the hon. Member for Southend, West pointed out, the extent of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland is more severe and extreme than in many other parts of the United Kingdom. In the context of social solidarity and honouring Parliament's obligations, there is a compelling case for including Northern Ireland in the Bill. I hope that the Committee will support the amendment, and that the Minister will reflect carefully on the downsides that could result from not including Northern Ireland.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr.Brake:</B> If it becomes clear that the Assembly will be suspended for a long time, when would the Minister consider it appropriate to intervene to ensure that the Bill applies to Northern Ireland?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If the Assembly is suspended for a long time, Parliament as a whole will have to decide how to proceed in Northern Ireland. We have gone to much trouble to devolve power to Northern Ireland, and it would be silly to take it away given that the issue so obviously belongs with the devolved Assembly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Amess:</B> It is clear that the remarks made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson) have removed the gloss from what the Minister said earlier. It would be churlish of me to pretend that I was an expert in energy efficiency matters in Northern Ireland, but if we had the benefit of the wisdom of the hon. members for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) and for Belfast, South, we might know whether such measures would make any difference to Northern Ireland and would deal with the terrible problems to which the hon. Member for Nottingham, South referred.

<P>
The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton referred to the eradication of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland, and the Minister dealt with her point about setting a target for that. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland signed the early-day motion in support of that, so he must be enthusiastic about it. I want to keep the spirit of consensus going in the Committee, although I am tempted to say that we are dealing with problems that arise as a result of devolution and concern the political situation in Northern Ireland. I know that it will disappoint the hon. Member for Nottingham, South, but in the light of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 13, leave out from ``the'' to end of line 14 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`need for a household to spend more than ten per cent. of its income after housing costs have been paid on keeping the home warm.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 4, in page 1, line 13, leave out ``at reasonable cost'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at a cost not greater than ten per cent. of the household's disposable income'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
 
<P>
No. 6, in clause 2, page 1, line 18, leave out ``at reasonable cost'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at a cost not greater than 10 per cent. of the household's disposable income'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 8, in clause 2, page 2, line 10, leave out ``at reasonable cost'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at a cost not greater than 10 per cent. of the household's disposable income'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Simpson:</B> The amendment centres on the meaning of ``reasonable cost''. The clause defines fuel poverty as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the inability of a household to keep warm at reasonable cost.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that remains in the Bill, local authorities, energy companies, private landlords or tenants will be faced with an impossible conundrum. Surely, there will be disagreement about the meaning of ``reasonable''. Each member of the Committee is a reasonable person, but if we were asked to put a figure on what we consider the reasonable cost of keeping our homes warm, I doubt whether any of us would put down the same figure on a piece of paper. If you, Mr. Gale, were required to arbitrate on which figure was reasonable, I would not envy your role as a broker. It would be like selecting the winner of a bonnie baby competition-the only guarantee would be that you would alienate every parent whose infant was not chosen as the winner. You would upset those of us who put down a figure that was dismissed as not reasonable.

<P>
There is an arbitrariness to the definitional base of the term in the Bill, which it would be helpful to remove. Should we move to definitions based on housing standards, disposable income or gross income? It is legitimate for the Committee to debate that.

<P>
The amendment that I tabled would replace ``at reasonable cost'' with a definition expressed as the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>need for a household to spend more than ten per cent. of its income after housing costs have been paid on keeping the home warm.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the definition of fuel poverty that many campaigning organisations outside this House have tended to use. It is an important benchmark, although not cast in stone. It is the rough basis on which campaigning organisations, whether church-based or housing-based, have tried to define the scale of the problem in their localities and regions. The Committee should reach a framework definition that has clarity, and sets out the terms of reference for those outside this House who must implement the Bill.

<P>
The Bill will impose a number of duties to define targets, objectives and programmes. Without clarity, it is hard to see how meaningful progress will be made. People will end up arguing with each other about whether the problems are being addressed. Little progress will be made if the defining base of the programme is reasonableness. I hope that the Committee will accept an amendment that will provide the clarity required by agencies working at the sharp end.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I support amendment No. 3, and amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 8, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) and I. The definition of fuel poverty and reasonable cost that is chosen will have a significant impact on the number of people who will be helped by these proposals. The difference in the number of households that would be helped if we were to adopt the 10 per cent. of gross income figures suggested in the briefing as a reasonable cost, as opposed to the 10 per cent. of disposable income, is 1.1 million. It has a significant effect, hence the importance of the amendments and of tying down a specific definition in the Bill.

<P>
To take a worked example, a household with an income of £150 a week and housing costs of £50 a week has £100 of disposable income. If 10 per cent. of gross income as opposed to 10 per cent. of disposable income was the criterion for defining whether the family were fuel poor, they would receive no assistance if they spent £14.99 of the £100 on heating. There is a clear need for specific definitions and the Government must assess the impact of going for what is perhaps a weaker target.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
The use of the ``lower incomes'' criterion leads me to believe that the Government may allow only people who are receiving benefits to be entitled to assistance. While there are extremes that one would want to exclude from the scope of the Bill, it would be wrong to tie it down to people in receipt of benefits when we know that many constituents who fall just outside the limit and miss out on benefits are in some hardship. To say that people who are not in receipt of benefits should receive no help is too draconian.

<P>
Does the Minister agree with what the Minister for the Environment, his right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) said at a SERA conference in February 1997? He said that 8 million households in the UK suffered from fuel poverty. The Minister must surely agree with his right hon. Friend. Therefore, the definition of fuel poverty must be 10 per cent. of disposable income rather than the 20 per cent. figure that has been mentioned in other documents.

<P>
I am afraid that there may be scope for a Government split on this issue, because since the election most of the documents have referred to 4.3 million fuel poor households. Will the Minister confirm whether what the present Environment Minister said in opposition is the case, and there are 8 million UK households in fuel poverty, or whether the figure is 4.3 million, as the Government now contend. Since 1 May 1997, has the balance of 3.7 million households in fuel poverty been dealt with, and are those people now all sitting in warm, comfortable and well-insulated homes? I suspect that that is not the case, much as I would like it to be.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will explain where the balance lies between the 8 million households in February 1997 and the 4.3 million that are talked about now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South. There are so many examples that one could use to reinforce the point about reasonableness. For instance, some regard MPs' salaries as very reasonable and others as little more than petrol money. The famous Sir Gerald Nabarro referred to his parliamentary salary as petrol money-he had about 10 rather large motor cars. Reasonableness is a subjective judgment. It is not something that one can define objectively; it is an appropriate term to use in the Bill, and if it were used in other legislation, it would be challenged on the same grounds.

<P>
Heating costs do not rise in proportion to income. Heating costs for someone who is relatively well off are often no more than those for someone who is very poor. The formula proposed by my hon. Friend would, in line with the Government's intentions, focus most attention on the poorest. There are also those who are poor not simply because their income is low. The income of some families with children may seem to be quite generous, even close to average earnings. However, if they have only one income and extremely high housing costs-with house prices rising at the moment, it is common for such people to have to take on a large mortgage-or high rents because of deregulation, those have to be taken out of the equation. My hon. Friend is right to include that in the amendment.

<P>
My hon. Friend's amendment would focus attention on families with children, whose health we know is severely affected by living in cold homes. It would help to achieve the Government's objectives. I support it, and I hope that the Government will accept it.

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham South. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) referred to the difficulty of defining reasonableness, particularly in relation to the salaries of Members of Parliament. The amendment specifies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a cost not greater than 10 per cent. of the household's disposable income.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
How reasonable would we consider a fuel bill of 10 per cent. of our salary-something in the region of £5,000 a year? That would be a challenge for many families. Our income is many times that of some of our constituents, from which they have to meet their housing costs, so it is essential to define this further.

<P>
A document has come to my attention during my service on the Standing Committee considering the Utilities Bill, and I seek the guidance of the Minister as to its relevance to the amendment. It is difficult to know its status; it is the draft guidance that the Secretary of State will issue to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, as referred to in clauses 9 and 13 of the Utilities Bill. Paragraph 5(1) gives guidance on environmental and social objectives. This matter came to my attention only this morning, otherwise I would have given the Minister warning of it. If he cannot clarify the document's status immediately, perhaps he could do so between now and our next sitting.

<P>
The social objectives show how the Government are approaching groups in fuel poverty. The document says that the Government regard those on low incomes as those in receipt of income related benefits-income support, income based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit-and those in receipt of tax credits-working family tax credit and disabled person's tax credit. It goes on to say that, in addition, anyone needing to spend 10 per cent. or more of their household income to achieve a satisfactory heating standard is considered to suffer from fuel poverty.
<P>
It then explains the importance that the Government attach to this issue. That gives me some hope. The document is not precise, and it avoids the debate that we have had this morning about whether the definition should be the income before or after housing costs have been taken into account or whether it should be the definition in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. It avoids that distinction.

<P>
Will the Minister comment on the document's current status, bearing in mind that the Utilities Bill has not yet become law.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): I want to express my support for the principles underlying the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South, although I have a reservation about the precise definition of fuel poverty. I accept completely the argument that to talk in terms of reasonable cost is virtually meaningless and would cause tremendous difficulty and confusion.

<P>
I am also concerned about referring to 10 per cent. of income excluding housing costs. Although I support the principle of the amendment, I am concerned that we are transferring the ambiguity of the definition from ``reasonable cost'' to ``housing cost'', which may be calculated in many different ways and differs throughout the country. There may be a regional dimension. In some parts of the country-an obvious example is the south-east-housing costs are higher, but temperatures are also higher. Would someone in such an area be eligible for assistance under the programme? In other parts of the country-the north-west and the north-east-housing costs are lower, but temperatures are also lower, and families may be excluded from assistance. There is a fundamental weakness in our assumption that housing costs alone can be the key determinant of how we calculate the income on which the criteria will be decided. Will the Minister comment on the regional dimension? I declare an interest, representing as I do a constituency in the north-west, which, although it is not the coldest, being on the fringes of the Pennines it is one of the wettest in the country.

<P>
I should also point out that levels of home ownership vary greatly in different parts of the country. My constituency is midway along most of the socio-economic indicators, but there is a far higher level of home ownership than in some similar constituencies. We cannot assume that housing costs can be defined only as rental, or that-using whatever criteria-only households paying rental, either to private or social landlords, experience fuel poverty. In constituencies such as mine in the north-west, the high level of home ownership and the low level of wages means that many households that pay mortgages are in fuel poverty. That factor should be taken into account, given the nature of mortgages and the way in which mortgage costs can vary hugely, depending on the term of the mortgage, whether it has been extended since the starting date and other factors.

<P>
I support in principle a tighter definition of fuel poverty, but I have some reservations about housing costs being the means to achieve a tighter definition, because that begs the question of how to define housing costs.

<P>
If the Government think that existing eligibility for benefits is the key benchmark, is there not a problem with people who are just above the benefit level? We are all aware that, in terms of disposable income, people who are just above the benefit level because of their pensions or savings can have less disposable income than those who are eligible for benefits.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that it is difficult to find any criteria that will fit perfectly? Incomes also vary regionally and tend to reflect housing costs, so one is not looking at a standard income and enormous variations in housing costs, but at significant differences in incomes between say, London and the north-west.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I accept that incomes vary, but I do not accept that incomes vary in proportion to the variation in housing costs. If one compares the price of a two-bedroom terrace house in my constituency and that of a two-bedroom terrace house in central London, Greater London or anywhere in the south-east, the proportion is vastly in excess of the variation in income between people doing equivalent jobs in the north-west and the south-east. That is a phenomenon not just of the past two or three years, but of the past 20 years. House price inflation has been concentrated in the south-east. My worry is that many households in the north of the United Kingdom could be excluded from eligibility for assistance under the programme that we are hoping to see implemented simply because of the vast difference in housing costs.
 
<P>
I do not remember having switched on the heating during the winter months when I have been staying in my flat in London during the week. That is not the case when I go to my family home in the north-west at weekends. We have to consider the regional variations in temperature as a component of the issue as much as that of raw, net housing costs.

<P>
Does the Minister accept the argument that, if we simply use eligibility for benefits and eligibility for assistance under an anti-fuel poverty programme as the criteria, many hundreds of thousands of households that are just above the benefit threshold could lose out, yet they will be experiencing fuel poverty on any hon. Member's definition of it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): First, the phrase ``resonable costs'' is not even self-explanatory. It could refer to the reasonable cost of the heating system, standing as it does, or it could be a reasonable proportion of the expenditure of the individual. That ambiguity needs to be resolved.

<P>
There are two threads to the amendments before the Committee. I am happy to support both, but there is a slight distinction. Amendment No. 3, in the name of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South, refers to housing costs, and amendment No. 4, standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington, refers to disposable income. The distinction may be important in the context of the contribution of the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor). Clearly, ``housing costs'' is not a complete definition of the variations in net income, which is the point that my hon. Friend made. If one takes net income as the threshold value, about 5.4 million households are included. If one goes for gross income, about 4.3 million households are included. That is an important difference. More than 1 million households are excluded if one changes the definition in that simple way. I shall not comment on the Opposition's figure of 8 million, because, in opposition, we can all find large numbers to justify a speech on a given occasion. We are talking about real hardship for real households throughout the United Kingdom. We need to sort out the definitional point, to make clear in the Bill the standards that we expect to apply, not leave it to ad hoc decision making about ``reasonableness''.

<P>
Like the hon. Member for Bury, North, I, too, represent a north-west constituency, with its lower temperatures and lower house prices. But the hon. Gentleman has slightly missed the point. To take the first case, benefits are paid at a uniform and universal value throughout the United Kingdom. Those who are fortunate enough to live in the north-west-I do regard them as fortunate-rather than the south-east, have the benefit of lower housing costs. In certain circumstances, people on benefits may have more disposable income, depending on how council tax rebate and other rebates work for them.

<P>
The second group of people are home owners with mortgages, who are above the benefit level. If the capital cost of their house is, say, half that of a similar house in the south-east and their mortgage is half that of the south-east, their mortgage repayments will be half of the south-east and they will have more disposable income. It is also the case that, even if their house price is half that of the south-east, and cold though it can be in the north-west, the temperatures are not half what they are in the south-east. In other words, if the hon. Gentleman looks carefully at his sums, he will see that people in the north-west benefit more from lower housing costs than from lower temperatures or, more importantly, high wind speeds.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I am not sure that there needs to be a precise mathematical relationship between the differential in housing costs and temperature for my point to remain valid. Given that it is possible to have the same kind of household and broad occupation within it, like for like it is more probable that someone would hit the 10 per cent. threshold in the south-east, because of the lower disposable income as a result of higher housing costs, than in the north-west. Given that temperatures in the north-west are lower, arguably the need for assistance with insulation, energy conservation and fuel poverty in the south-east is lower. That would be an anomaly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but he is wrong. Over coffee afterwards, perhaps I can do some homework with him to show that the ratio of house prices to temperatures shows that he is not right. The hon. Gentleman is a keen supporter of the Bill and it would be a pity if we fell out over the right definition.

<P>
The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton made the key point that the Government acknowledge that there should be-as there is-a realistic figure. She quoted from the draft document that was circulated to those of us who serve on the Committee considering the Utilities Bill. It specified the figure of 10 per cent. Whatever the niceties of regional variations, they will be as nothing if the phrase ``reasonable cost'' remains in the Bill. That phrase defines nothing and constitutes a fundamental ambiguity at the heart of the Bill.

<P>
I hope that the amendments will find favour with the Committee. If the Government were to accept the amendments, or similar ones, the Bill would be more realistic. It would do what the Government and members of the Committee want it to do: it would protect those in fuel poverty, rather than simply producing a nice warm glow for those serving on the Committee without providing a remedy for those in need.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The debate shows that this is not a simple matter. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington invites me to play the numbers game, but I decline. It would be surprising if some of the measures that the Government have taken during our first three years in office-for example, the big increase in the winter fuel allowance-had not had an impact on the number of people living in fuel poverty.

<P>
My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton invites me to define the status of the document to which she refers. Its status is written on the cover-it is the draft guidance for the gas and electricity markets authority, but I understand the point that she makes.

<P>
My hon. Friend the member for Bury, North refers to the regional variations in costs and thereby opens Pandora's box. I am not sure how grateful members of the Committee would be if we were to travel down that road. I noted with interest what the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said about that.

<P>
If the definition of fuel poverty were loosened to include more people, the help that could be given to those in real need would be diminished. The thinner help is spread, the less it can be directed to those in greatest need. Under the amendments, fuel poverty would be defined in terms of the percentage of disposable income, or income after housing costs have been paid, that is spent on keeping the home warm. That is an interesting point. I would have more sympathy with those aims if there were a commonly agreed definition, but there is none.

<P>
The recent consultation carried out by the Department on the new home energy efficiency scheme identified two major differences of opinion on the definition of a fuel-poor household. First, some leading fuel poverty campaigners argued that 10 per cent. was not the appropriate figure. Secondly, a small majority of respondents supported a wide definition of income that implied that there were 4.3 million fuel-poor households in England in 1996. However, a sizeable number of respondents argued for a tighter definition of income that would have increased that number to 5.3 million. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said, there are other definitions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brake:</B> The Minister says that there are differences of opinion about the numbers of such households. Why have the Government decided to use the figure of 4.3 million?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The Government have taken no such decision. We recognise the importnce of the issues and that those who have taken a long-term interest in them, such as many members of the Committee, disagree about the figures. That is why we have set up the interministerial group on fuel poverty, which is chaired by my noble Friend Lord Whitty. To include such a definition in the Bill would bypass that group's work, without allowing the views expressed as part of the wide-ranging consultation to be considered properly. Therefore, I propose that the amendments should be resisted. They are not necessarily wrong or misplaced, but we simply do not want to prejudge the outcome of the wide-ranging consultations that the interministerial group is undertaking.

<P>
During the debate on the sittings motion, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton asked me when that group would reach its conclusions. I understand that it hopes to publish its strategy this autumn.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson:</B> I understand the difficulty that my hon. Friend the Minister is trying to address, but will be concede that the phrase ``at reasonable cost'' is not helpful? We had similar discussions in the debates on home energy efficiency standards during the consideration of the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995. Similar comments were made about regional variations and wind-chill factors. The then Government rightly devised the standard assessment of performance rating and said that it would be subject to review and improvement, so that Act included a requirement for a benchmark. However, the test of reasonableness will not provide a benchmark. Will my hon. Friend consider how to redraft the Bill so that it will allow the Government to make improvements while providing a sensible starting point so that all authorities, which, in effect, will be given a mandate under the Bill, know what to do and how to quantify whether they have hit their targets?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I acknowledge the point that my hon. Friend makes about the need for clarity and to provide a definition. I do not necessarily reject the definition that he suggests, but the interministerial group is working on that complex problem. The group will publish its strategy, or at least a draft of it, in the autumn, which will be the moment to reach some conclusions.

<P>
Under the Bill, the Secretary of State will be obliged to produce a strategy. That strategy, not the Bill, is the polace in which to define the different circumstances, the groups that should be targeted and how that should be done. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson:</B> I shall accept my hon. Friend's invitation to withdraw the amendment, but I hope that he will use the time before the next sitting to reconsider the wording in the amendments that he has tabled to replace clause 1. Given what he has said, as many gaps exist in the replacement as in clause 1 and the amendment. In the hope that something better will be tabled, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Further consideration adjourned.-[Mr. Amess.]
