preliminary announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their
jackets during Committee sittings, but they need to ensure that their
mobile phones and pagers are turned off or switched to silent mode. As
a general rule, I and my fellow Chair do not intend to call starred
amendments that have not been tabled with adequate notice. The required
notice period in Public Bill Committees is three working days, and
amendments should therefore be tabled by the rise of the House on a
Monday for consideration on a Thursday, and by the rise of the House on
a Thursday for consideration on a Tuesday. There is a money resolution
in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the
room.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000014">&#160;</a>

everyone is familiar with the process of Public Bill Committees, so I
will give a brief explanation of how we will proceed. The Committee
will first be asked to consider the programme motion on the amendment
paper, for which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then
proceed to a motion to report written evidence, and then to
line-by-line consideration of the Bill. I call the Minister to move the
programme

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill is important, as it puts the new independent Office for Budget
Responsibility on a statutory footing, and puts in place reforms to the
corporate governance of the National Audit Office. As members of the
Committee will be aware, the Bill has already been debated extensively
in the other place, and has also benefited from the inquiry undertaken
by the Treasury Committee. I am 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                           </div>pleased to say that the Bill is very much in line with the
recommendations in that Committee’s report, and it has also been
improved by Lords
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that all members of the Committee agree that the programme motion
is sensible and non-controversial, but they might have noticed that,
contrary to customary practice, the motion proposes that we deal with
schedule 1 after clause 9. That is because it makes most
sense to debate the functions and the remit of the Office for Budget
Responsibility before we consider its governance structure. Schedule 1
is first mentioned in clause 3 because we cannot discuss the remit of
the office before it is technically set up by an earlier clause. Clause
3 establishes the office, and the Bill then moves on, in clause 4 and
beyond, to consider the office’s duties and remit, with schedule
1 setting out the governance framework. Hopefully, that means that
members of the Committee have the chance to debate what the Office for
Budget Responsibility will be doing and, in the light of that, can look
at how it should be structured and what the governance arrangements
should be. The National Audit Office schedules will be debated in the
usual order. I look forward to the forthcoming
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000019">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister has said, there was a fair degree of debate on the Bill in
the other place, and in the Treasury Committee and on Second Reading in
this place, and we made it clear on Second Reading that we do not
oppose the general thrust of the Bill. We have, however, tabled a
significant number of amendments that challenge some of the detail. In
seeking to put on a statutory footing an institution such as the Office
for Budget Responsibility, which has been running for a while on a
non-statutory basis, it is important that we get the framework
absolutely right. Some of the amendments seek to get the office working
properly and, above all, to ensure that its workings are as transparent
as they can be, given the sometimes confidential nature of its work,
and that it is accountable to parliamentary institutions. We agree that
the six sittings that have been timetabled will probably give us enough
time thoroughly to debate the Bill and to give it the attention it
deserves.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
point was raised at the Programming Sub-Committee yesterday about
whether schedule 1 should be considered after clause 3, which is when
it is introduced in the Bill. Our view is that it would be more
appropriate to follow the normal practice and deal with schedule 1 at
that point. I do not accept the Minister’s argument that it is
better to look at what the Office for Budget Responsibility will be
doing before looking at its structure and how it is governed. That is a
point on which we disagreed yesterday, but we will go along with the
programme

                           </strong> As I mentioned during my remarks on the
programme motion, we think that clause 1 is the Bill’s most
important provision because it introduces the charter for budget
responsibility, which deals with the Treasury’s substantive work
over the coming
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
accept that something such as the charter for budget responsibility,
which is meant to be something of a movable feast—a document
that can be amended, modified and reviewed from time to
time—could not be prescribed in, say, a schedule to the Bill
without necessitating the complicated process of bringing it before the
House to be amended by statutory
instrument.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept the charter’s being a separate document. But in some ways
I think it is wrong that only a draft charter is in existence at the
moment and the Government have not felt able to present something
closer to a finalised version, so that we can consider it in the round
alongside the Bill. We think it is important that the charter receives
proper scrutiny, and that it receives the same level of scrutiny as the
Bill itself. The charter sets out the Treasury’s objectives in
fiscal policy and policy for the management of the national
debt. It also sets out the means by which the Treasury’s fiscal
policy objectives will be attained, the so-called fiscal mandate, and
it also addresses matters to be included in the financial statement and
budget report prepared under clause 2. Those are by no means
inconsequential
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
had hoped, given the level of debate in the Treasury Committee, in the
other place and on Second Reading, that the Government would update the
draft charter so that we could discuss something closer to the finished
article. It feels as though a substantial part of what we are
discussing today is
missing.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
efforts, if any, have been made to update the draft charter based on
the debate and proceedings in the Lords? If there will be no attempt to
present a revised charter before Report based on the debates in the
Bill Committee, in the Lords and in the Treasury Committee, why can it
not be done before the Bill goes through its final stages? Does the
Minister think it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 6<a class="bkMark" name="Column6">&#160;</a>
                           </div>would be better if it was done at that stage? We already have a
functioning non-statutory Office for Budget Responsibility, so would it
be wrong to delay Report so that an updated charter can be prepared,
laid before Parliament and then given the scrutiny it deserves before
Third Reading? That is where my first amendment comes
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ideally,
we would have liked to table an amendment providing that a revised
version of the charter should be fully debated and approved by the
Treasury Committee and by both Chambers of the House before the Bill
receives Royal Assent, but we were advised by the Clerks in the Public
Bill Office that it is not possible to put a binding provision in the
Bill that something must be done before the Bill becomes law.
Obviously, if the Bill has not received Royal Assent and become law,
nothing in it is binding, so we could not table an amendment for what
we really wanted, which would be more debate on the charter before the
Bill becomes law. We have tabled what we consider to be the next best
thing, which is that the charter should be laid before
Parliament<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“within

Assent.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is not ideal, but at least it means there will be prompt scrutiny of
what is in the charter while the debate on the Bill is still fresh in
people’s
minds.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have also tabled an amendment that requires the Treasury Committee to
approve the charter before the Bill receives Royal Assent. That
Committee should also have a role in scrutinising the modified charter.
I will come to that and a broader discussion of the role of the
Treasury Committee in relation to the Bill in a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
requirements for scrutiny by Parliament within four weeks of Royal
Assent and for approval by the Select Committee are separate
amendments. It would make sense for the Committee to look at the
charter first, so that Parliament has the benefit of the Treasury
Committee’s deliberations for its discussions. That is a matter
for debate. It would also avoid a situation in which the charter was
laid before Parliament and approved, but then went to the Treasury
Committee, which might express major reservations about it. Then there
is the issue of what happens to the Committee’s reservations:
where do they actually
go?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to press the Minister to explain how the provision regarding
laying the charter before Parliament, as set out in clause 1, would
work. Are we talking about a motion tabled by the Government for the
charter to be approved? How much time, if any, would be allowed for
debate? In the first instance, there could be major revisions to the
charter. It could be a significantly different document from the one
that is currently circulating in draft, but there could be minor
changes in future. Does the Minister envisage that the process for
laying the charter before Parliament would always be the
same?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Chairman is getting slightly nervous as to whether that question
relates to the amendment. My point is that our amendment proposes that
the Treasury Committee should have a role in considering any
modifications to the charter. I am simply trying to tease out from the
Minister whether she would envisage that role being the same. There may
need to be little tweaks to the charter, such as technical amendments.
If she accepts that the Treasury Committee should have a role, would it
play 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 7<a class="bkMark" name="Column7">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the same role in every instance? On laying the charter before
Parliament, would there be instances when it was simply something in
the remaining Orders of the Day, going through on the nod, or would
there always be a process for full and thorough debate? Who would
adjudicate on that matter?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
amendments would give additional responsibilities to the Treasury
Committee. The Bill already imposes extra responsibilities on the
Committee, and I appreciate that we are now adding to them, but it is
important that the Treasury Committee has a watchdog role overseeing
the legislation for the Office for Budget Responsibility. As a former
member of the Treasury Committee, I know that it has a wide remit. I
was a member during its quiet days between 2005 and 2007 when things
ticked along quite nicely. I came off the Committee weeks before
everything exploded; the banking crisis happened and things got a lot
more exciting. I am sure that its work became far more time-consuming
and, to an extent, onerous during those days. It is an important
Committee, and it has an awful lot to deal with at the moment. If we
are suggesting that it takes on additional responsibilities, which the
amendments do, we need to be sure that it is properly resourced and
that it has the right expert advice to be able to do its job properly.
Otherwise, it becomes something of a tick-box exercise, and the
Committee will not feel that it can do the proper job the Bill requires
of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
final amendment in this group is about public consultation. I
appreciate that that does not sit entirely well with the amendments
that require the draft charter to be laid before Parliament within four
weeks of Royal Assent, and the Treasury Committee to approve it. It is
important, however, that there is proper public discussion of not only
the existing draft charter, but the charter that will be in effect
under clause 1. We need public debate and widespread consultation. Can
the Minister suggest how that could happen? We can then ensure that
Parliament has a role in considering the results of that consultation
and whether the charter is adequate to fulfil the role that is
envisaged for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
underlying principle of the Bill should be that we are setting up an
independent Office for Budget Responsibility, but there need to be
parliamentary checks and balances on it, and, although independent in
the forecasts and decisions that it makes, it needs to be accountable
to Parliament in the way that it works. My concern is that, at the
moment, the Bill does not quite achieve that accountability. I am
interested in what the Minister has to say on how we can ensure that
that
happens.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000044">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Broadly, in response to the amendments, I can
assure the hon. Lady that there will be proper parliamentary
accountability. She is aware that the charter effectively replaces the
previous Government’s code for fiscal stability, which is out of
date and obviously needed significant reform. It breaks new ground in
transparently setting out for Parliament and the public not only the
Government’s fiscal policy objectives, but the fiscal mandate
for how we are going to get there.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the code
for fiscal stability, which ran from 1998, the previous Government
could set their fiscal policy objectives and rules from Budget to
Budget. There was no requirement to explain any changes to Parliament.
To provide the hon. Lady with some reassurance, clause 1 corrects that
lack of accountability by setting strict minimum requirements for the
contents of the charter. Clause 1 also establishes the mechanism
whereby the charter should be published by the Treasury, and that the
charter and any subsequent amendments, which she asked about, will not
come into force until they have been approved by a resolution of the
House. There is far more accountability than we had under the code for
fiscal
stability.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand what the hon. Lady is seeking to achieve with the
amendments. Obviously, amendments 2 and 3 would provide for
the charter to be laid before Parliament within four weeks of Royal
Assent and then to be consulted on for 12 weeks. The amendments are,
however, ultimately unnecessary, because we published the draft charter
for budget responsibility in November 2010, and, by the time the Bill
achieves Royal Assent, the draft charter will have had at least four
months for proper public and parliamentary consultation. The whole
point of this Committee is to provide further scrutiny and to debate
further changes, and, of course, we have also had a helpful debate in
the other
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>The
hon. Lady asked about the changes that we may make to the charter and I
draw her attention to the seventh fact sheet on the Bill, which she can
find in the Library. It provides Government comments on the charter and
draws attention to the particular areas that we have offered to take on
board and scrutinise, given the debate in the other place, given some
of the amendments that the Lords made, and given the points that they
made about the charter. As the hon. Lady will know, few amendments were
made to the Bill as a result of the debate in the other place, but she
is right to point out that questions were raised about the charter. The
Bill fact sheet sets out the Government’s approach, looking at
the particular issues that came out of the debate in the other
place.
<p class="tabbed">Taken in
turn, those steps mean that we will not need another public
consultation on the charter after Royal Assent. That would merely delay
our putting on a statutory footing the Office for Budget
Responsibility, which we all want to see happen as fast as possible. We
would not derive a lot of additional benefit from a consultation,
because the Bill will have been through the parliamentary process and
the public will have been able to scrutinise the draft charter. That
will allow us to create a charter that we think will work, taking on
board the comments that have been made during that time. The final
charter will contain some small alterations in response to comments
that have been made during the debate on the Bill, and they are set out
in the fact sheet.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
has recognised, in terms of the technicalities behind amendment 3, that
it is not possible to lay a document and subsequently consult on it. It
is probably a probing amendment, but we cannot act in that way. We have
taken a better approach, which is to publish the draft charter and have
it in place for people to respond to and, once we have been through the
Committee process, to lay it before Parliament swiftly after Royal
Assent.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000049">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 4
and 5 seek to impose a form of double lock that requires both the House
of Commons and the Treasury Committee to approve the charter for Budget
responsibility. Those amendments are ultimately unnecessary, because
the Treasury Committee is a Committee of the House of Commons. Members
are aware that Select Committees fall under the auspices of the House
of Commons, so anything that is approved by the whole House does not
need to be approved by the relevant departmental Select Committee. I
would argue that it is wrong for something to be approved by a subset
of Members, when we have stipulated that it must approved by all
Members in the House.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000050">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Bill gives a lot of duties to the Treasury
Committee regarding things such as the approval of appointments. One
could say that in terms of what we are doing today, the Committee is a
subset of the House of Commons that is approving things that will go to
the full Parliament to be debated. I do not know why the Minister says
that that is not appropriate. My point is that the Treasury Committee
has a clear remit and a specific role in relation to the Bill, and it
is being given onerous additional duties. Because the charter is such a
substantial element of the Bill, although it is not contained in its
wording, it is important that the Treasury Committee has a role in that
respect as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000051">&#160;</a>

                        </strong> I absolutely understand why the hon. Lady is
making those points, but we are trying to strike a balance. We are
ensuring that, for the first time, unlike with the code for fiscal
stability, the whole House gets to approve the charter and any
amendments to it. At the same time, I think it would be wrong to go
further in mandating what the Treasury Committee has to look into. I
have no doubt that in the same way that the Treasury Committee always
conducts an inquiry into the Budget, it will want to look at the
charter. It has already looked at the Office for Budget Responsibility,
and no doubt it will want to consider any proposed amendments to the
charter.
We are
trying to strike a balance between ensuring that there is parliamentary
accountability and not fettering the Treasury Committee in what it
deems important to inquire into. The hon. Lady is right to point out
that it now has a role in appointments. I think that that is right to
ensure that there is absolutely no question about the OBR’s
independence. In fact, when the Treasury Committee did its own inquiry
into the OBR, the OBR itself raised that point and the Government
responded to it positively. I can assure her that the way in which the
Bill is structured gives the right weight to parliamentary
accountability, but does not constrain what the Treasury Committee
should look into.
As the
hon. Lady points out, the charter is of key importance to economic
policy and critically sets it out, so I am absolutely sure that the
Treasury Committee will pay close attention to what is in it, whether
it works effectively and how it may change in
future.

                        <p class="tabbed">It is probably
fair to say that when the OBR was first established it found itself,
unfortunately, off to a bad start when it was perceived to have behaved
in a partisan manner. You will recall, Dr McCrea, the particular
incident involving the release of figures right before Prime
Minister’s Question Time. There was an understandable perception
on our side of the House that that was not the best way for the OBR to
begin its life. The Minister will recall that the Treasury Committee
undertook a short inquiry into the activities around that unfortunate
event and I think that the OBR benefited from the work of that
Committee. My hon. Friend’s amendments seek to ensure that we
never again have that unfortunate circumstance, but also that the
Treasury Committee has clear responsibility and a clear mandate to
scrutinise the work of the OBR on an ongoing basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000053">&#160;</a>

been in the House very long. I certainly do not have your many years of
wisdom and experience, Dr McCrea. I have noticed, however, that we hear
a lot about the new politics. I know that the hon. Members for Bristol
West and for Chippenham, in particular, tell us that we have a new
politics and that, “A new dawn has broken, has it not?”,
as a former Prime Minister once said. I look forward with some interest
to seeing how those colleagues, who clearly believe in the new
politics, the new public scrutiny and the new parliamentary scrutiny
process, speak in this debate, and, of course, how they vote. I am sure
that they, in particular, would welcome moves that enhance the role of
Parliament in holding both the Executive and the Executive’s
agencies to account for their actions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000054">&#160;</a>

Member for a few months, I have been deeply impressed by the Minister.
She has a fine technical mind and certainly puts me to shame whenever
we get on to the finer points of Treasury business. I have to say that
she did a handsome job of taking me apart during the passage of an
earlier Bill on the Floor of the House, when I was trying to construct
an argument. The only Members who might be her equal on the Back
Benches are colleagues from all parties who are members of the Treasury
Committee. I am sure that they will not mind my saying that they are
quite nerdy and have fine technical minds. I would feel much more
comfortable if there were a fine august body of Members who could make
a decent fist of the scrutiny of this process, rather than leaving it
to the whole House.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
In my
short period in the House, I have noticed—I am sure that it is a
very rare occurrence and not Government policy—that there has
been the rare occasion when the Leader of the House managed to slip
through orders and business without, perhaps, the House having had a
chance to provide due diligence. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol
East is today attempting to provide a safety valve. I am sure that the
Minister would never seek to slip anything by the House. She is
probably destined for greater and brighter things in the remaining four
years of this Government, and will move on. My hon. Friend seeks to
ensure that the Minister’s successors do not slip through
processes without the Select Committee having had a chance to consider
them.<h4 class="hs_Timeline">11

would not want to be here. However, that demonstrates that the Public
Bill Committee does not always provide a suitable public consultation
process. My hon. Friend is seeking to provide a
safety valve so that over a short period—three months—we
can receive some outside input. I have many local companies that would
take a close interest in the work of the OBR, as that is what they

                           </strong> In response to the hon. Member for Dunfermline
and West Fife, I think he was describing a different Treasury Minister.
I can assure him, having been on the Back Benches and in the Opposition
team, and now being a Minister, that the only way that the Government
can slip through an order at the end of the day is if the Opposition
are asleep on their feet. As a Back-Bench MP, I discovered that
Back-Bench MPs are more than capable of holding Government to account.
I have no doubt the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife will do
that over the coming years.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I go back to
my original comment: I would never try to slip through changes and I do
not think that my successors would. I do not think that the way in
which the House works enables that to happen. It is the responsibility
of us all, as Minister, shadow Front-Bench team and Members of
Parliament, to represent our constituents. I hope that, over the past
few months when the draft charter has been available, there has been
adequate time for not only the Treasury Committee but MPs,
constituents, companies and other institutions interested in ensuring
that the charter works well, to have the chance to scrutinise
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
can reassure the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife that the
Bill strikes the right balance, by going far further than the previous
code for fiscal stability and making sure that Parliament approves the
first charter and then any revised charter. He should bear in mind that
the previous Government introduced some golden rules and then
reinterpreted how they would work. Other than the normal debating
process and the provision of an Opposition day debate through the
ordinary channels, there was no way for the House to debate that
mandate. We are for the first time putting in place not just the OBR
but the charter, which will be debated and have a resolution of the
House of Commons. The debating question will happen through the normal
channels. We expect that it will be handled as a statutory instrument.
It will go through that process of scrutiny and debate in a way that
the previous code for fiscal stability did
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000060">&#160;</a>

experience in the House, but I have observed from time to time a
slightly injudicious use of programme motions. I accept that the
previous Government suffered from the tendency as well, on occasion.
However, does she not accept that, if we have a 90-minute debate on a
SI, or the injudicious use of a programme motion, the debate would be
curtailed? That, at least, would be avoided if the Treasury Committee,
which does not have such constraints, debated the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000061">&#160;</a>

our fiscal objective and mandate, the Treasury Committee will take a
close interest. I hope that its members would also
participate—as they already do, as I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman sees—in relevant debates on the Floor of the House.
Now we have the Backbench Business Committee, which can initiate its
own debates, as well as the existing Opposition day debates, to ensure
that such issues can be debated. I have no doubt that we have struck
the right balance between ensuring that Parliament gets to approve the

Minister said that it would be wrong to prescribe the role of the
Treasury Committee too closely or to dictate its inquiries. She also
said that that Committee not wanting to look at something as important
as the charter or its modifications was inconceivable. I accept that
that Committee is more than capable of deciding to look at the charter,
and it will almost certainly do so, trying to fit that inquiry into its
packed work programme. However, that is not entirely consistent with
other provisions in the Bill, which give additional responsibilities
to  the Treasury Committee—for example, in
relation  to appointments. We have tabled other amendments to
propose an enhanced role for that Committee, so it would be useful to
clear up the issue now, before we get on to the other amendments and
before deciding whether to press to a vote the amendments in this group
that call for additional responsibilities for the Treasury
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000065">&#160;</a>

the Minister or her officials had discussions with the Treasury
Committee—in particular, its Chair—about the new role for
the Select Committee under the Bill, how it would work and whether it
thinks that it would be appropriate to take on such new
responsibilities? I mean not the responsibilities set out in the
amendments but those laid out in the Bill. That is important. I have
already made the point that the Treasury Committee is busy—one
could almost say overstretched. Would it feel capable of fulfilling the
role? I am interested in what discussions the Minister has had with the
Chair of the Select Committee, the Clerks or the people responsible for
ensuring that it can carry out the role effectively. It is important to
establish that before deciding whether the Treasury Committee ought to
have an enhanced role. Can the Minister answer
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000066">&#160;</a>

appointments will include an intensive pre-appointment hearing, which I
hope will ensure that the Treasury Committee gets a
good chance to grill potential Budget Responsibility Committee members
and, indeed, future chairmen before agreeing whether they should be
appointed. Of course, as I have said, there is nothing to stop the
Treasury Committee looking at the provisions of the charter

reasonable point that the draft charter has been in circulation since

set up the OBR, there was significant comment from the media, as well
as from MPs. Organisations such as the International Monetary Fund have
warmly welcomed the establishment of the OBR. We have not received any
external comment per se as a result of the consultation—the
draft charter—being out in the public domain. However, there has
been an awful lot of debate about the OBR’s role and how it will
work. Of course, such debate comes on the back of the first part of the
process of the Bill passing through Parliament in the other place. That
resulted in some amendments to the Bill and to some areas of the
charter, to which I have drawn attention. We will now consider those
areas, and we have set them out in a factsheet that is available from

my introductory remarks to the amendments, I need to get a firm
assurance from the Minister about how that will work. Some hon.
Members—my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)
comes to mind—are absolute experts on parliamentary procedure
and can cite chapter and verse of Erskine May, what has happened in the
past and precedents. I am sure that Dr McCrea is also an expert on such
things, which is why he is chairing the Committee today.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000073">&#160;</a>

understanding of the phrase “laid before Parliament” is
that it could mean anything. I understand that written

			Column number: 14<a class="bkMark" name="Column14">&#160;</a>
                           </div>ministerial statements and the remaining Orders of the Day, which often
go though on the nod or unremarked upon, are laid before Parliament. In
addition, statutory instruments considered in Committee are laid before
Parliament. I am not necessarily concerned about future versions of the
charter, to which there might be technical modifications or small
tweaks, but about the first version of the charter that has been out in
draft form since November. As the Minister has said, there has been
considerable comment on and interest in that. Can she assure me that,
when that charter is laid before Parliament, it will be in the form of
a motion tabled by the Government that is then allocated time for
debate? Or will Opposition Whips have to keep an eye on what is in the
remaining Orders of the Day and shout “Object.”? As a
former Whip, my understanding is that the Government would eventually
table the charter for debate, to avoid a situation where it was always
objected to and to get it through Parliament. Usually, there would be a
90-minute debate, or
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000074">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. It
slightly rang alarm bells when the Minister referred to the Backbench
Business Committee. I welcome  the innovation of having the
Backbench Business Committee—it is an important avenue for
putting items on the agenda for debate that would not otherwise be
there—but it should not be a substitute for the Government doing
what is required of them under Government legislation. Surely, it is
the Government’s responsibility to ensure that the charter is
properly debated, and the idea that the Backbench Business Committee
would have to identify the fact that that was not being done by the
Government and that this issue had slipped through the net, when only a
certain amount of time is allocated to Backbench Business Committee
debates anyway, is wrong. The fact that the Backbench Business
Committee would have to use that time to do something that the
Government ought to do in Government time is wrong.
<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
suspect that that was not really what the Minister was suggesting and
that it was just something that she was throwing into the mix. However,
I would be very concerned if the Backbench Business Committee had some
sort of responsibility to lay the charter before Parliament and if that
was the only way that we could guarantee that it would be thoroughly
debated. I want to push her on this point, as it is crucial to our
decision about whether to press the amendment to a vote. What do the
Government mean when they say that the charter will be laid before
Parliament?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
said during her response that the charter will be laid before
Parliament very promptly after the Bill receives Royal Assent. Our
amendment proposes that it should be laid before Parliament within four
weeks of the Bill receiving Royal Assent. I would have thought that
“very promptly” and “four weeks” are within
the same ballpark at least and therefore that this is a reasonable
amendment for the Government to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 15<a class="bkMark" name="Column15">&#160;</a>
                           </div>accept, because we all know that timetables slip. Although there might
be the desire, the good will and the intention on the part of the
Government and the Treasury to lay the charter before Parliament very
quickly after Royal Assent, such timetables do slip. The
amendment would put in the Bill a requirement that
the charter be laid before Parliament within four weeks of the Bill
receiving Royal Assent. Given the projected timetable, we can therefore
assume that the charter would be discussed thoroughly and definitely
approved by Parliament before the summer recess. That is very
important, as all the mechanisms would be in place for the Office for
Budget Responsibility to run properly on a statutory basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think that
I am making the final remarks on this issue—I do not know
whether the Minister wants to put my mind at rest by intervening. What
is the crux of laying this charter before Parliament? What type of
debate would be allowed? I appreciate that that might partly be in the
hands of Government business managers and the Whips Office.
Nevertheless, can she give some assurances that there will be a proper
debate on the charter? Also, can she say why there is a problem with
the requirement that the charter should be laid before Parliament
within four weeks of Royal Assent, because she seems to suggest that
that will happen anyway?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000079">&#160;</a>

lay a final version of the charter before Parliament within four weeks
of the Bill receiving Royal Assent. I do not think that that
requirement needs to be in the Bill itself. However, just to give the
hon. Lady some reassurance, the charter will be approved in exactly the
same way as the previous code for fiscal responsibility, which was
established by the previous Government. Of course, as she has pointed
out, the procedure will be agreed by the usual channels, but we would
expect there to be a debate on the charter before a vote. I should also
point out to her that this process will work like an affirmative
resolution, not a negative one, so there will be ample time for
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000080">&#160;</a>

she understood the point I was making: between this Parliament and the

able to propose debates. The House is more able than ever to debate
what it believes is important. That is the overall approach. I hope
that that provides her with some reassurance. We will have a similar
process to that for statutory instruments—the same model that
her Government used for the code of fiscal responsibility—and no
doubt the usual channels, or Whips discussions, will ensure appropriate
timetabling.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000081">&#160;</a>

ensuring that the charter is approved. Given her response, we shall not

Clause 1 states that the

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will suggest through amendments certain things that it would be
appropriate for the OBR to do. In particular, we have tabled amendments
saying that its role should include looking at child poverty targets
and the local government finance settlement. We could have included
other issues, such as the 0.7% of gross domestic product target and
various other targets that the Government have set for themselves in
legislation. Perhaps, over time, the OBR’s role will expand to
include such things, but we shall reserve debate on that until we
actually get to those
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000087">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have already dealt with laying the charter before Parliament and
modifying it. I want to stress that it is important that the charter
receives scrutiny. We are concerned that there is no such parliamentary
mechanism. There is discussion about what will be in the charter, but
the very fact that it is not part of the Bill means that we cannot
treat it in the way that we would treat legislation and amend it
through formal processes. That is slightly of concern when it is such a
substantial part of what the Bill sets out. That is my main concern
with clause
1.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000088">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To sum up the debate on clause 1, it is fair to
say that we are introducing the Bill that sets up the OBR at a time
when fiscal policy is probably the single most important priority for
the coalition Government. Given the fiscal situation that we inherited,
the Government’s approach to fiscal policy should be presented
to the public in a transparent manner. The charter for budget
responsibility, which is established under the clause, is a key
statutory document for achieving and maintaining that transparency. As
we have discussed today, we have aided scrutiny during the
consideration of the Bill by publishing a draft charter for budget
responsibility on Monday 22 November
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000089">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Perhaps I should have brought up the matter
earlier, but I understand that the amendment that we drafted on the
12-week public consultation relates to a Cabinet Office requirement to
hold formal 12-week consultations. Does the Minister regard what seems
an informal consultation process since the draft charter was published
at the end of November as meeting the Cabinet Office
requirements?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000090">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Ultimately, the effective consultation process
that we have had will have run on for longer than three months. It will
probably be about four months by the time that the Bill receives Royal
Assent, so there has been ample time to scrutinise matters. As we have
already discussed today, the progress of the Bill through Parliament
began in the other place, where the debate not only on the Bill but the
charter went on for several days. There has been significant chance for
both the Bill and the charter to be debated.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Lady’s point about the importance of the charter is right. There
is a need to find a way for the Bill to place both the Office for
Budget Responsibility and the charter on a statutory footing, but with
the flexibility to respond to the desires of future Governments perhaps
to change their fiscal policy objectives and their fiscal mandate. In
drafting the Bill as we have, we will build in flexibility in the right
way, while giving some accountability by having the charter go through
an approval process in the House of
Commons.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the charter replaces the previous Government’s code for fiscal
stability, it makes a minimum provision for the Government’s
fiscal and debt management objectives and the targets for fiscal policy
that deliver the fiscal objectives. Moreover, the fact that it
establishes a mechanism by which the charter gets published by the
Treasury but then has to wait to come into force until it has been
approved by a resolution of the House of Commons will be a key
safeguard in accountability. It will become a vital part of the new
fiscal policy framework that we are putting in place. It will feature
not only transparency, but more accountability to Parliament over time.
I hope that I have dealt with many of the issues raised by the hon.
Lady and therefore that the clause will stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000093">&#160;</a>

morning. It is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Dr
McCrea. The amendment would tighten the process for ensuring that the
provisions under clause 2 make some logical sense. The Committee will
see an interesting single word in subsection (2) under which a budget
must “conform” to any provisions set out under the
charter for budget responsibility. Obviously, there has been a lot of
fanfare, pomp and circumstance around the creation of the Office for
Budget Responsibility. It is a relatively benign measure, not something

any great

the current Chancellor of the Exchequer made a commitment as a device
before the general election, and we now have the delivery of that
commitment in a Bill that is relatively long, given that the measure is
short. Sometimes, the civil service and those involved in drafting
legislation feel the need to pad out clauses and expand them with
extraneous measures that may not be wholly necessary. It is interesting
that we have a requirement that any Budget should conform to the
provision set out in the
charter.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000098">&#160;</a>

piece of legislative reform. It commits them to presenting that Budget

although it has always happened that way. It commits them to publishing
the Budget. What an amazing advance for democracy that is. I cannot
think of a single circumstance or reason why we would need to have in

                           </strong> Indeed. “Oh yes, I am supposed to be in
charge” is what I think the right hon. Gentleman said. Maybe it
is for their own benefit, as an aide memoire. “From Chancellor
to self: remember to go to Parliament and publish one’s
Budget.” That must be the logic.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What worries
me most is this concept of conformity. It is left undefined in the
Bill. Often, legislation has an “Interpretations” clause
at the end, which says, “In this section, conformity means
‘as referenced in another piece of legislation.’”
That, however, is not the case here, so we are left asking the Minister
to define what she means by “conform”. Does she mean
broadly conform with the charter for budget responsibility? Does she
mean conform to the spirit of that charter or the very letter of the
charter? Is conformity something that happens in the eye of the
beholder, in the eye of the Treasury alone, or in the eye of the Office
for Budget Responsibility?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I read the
duties of the OBR, it is not its role to test for conformity, but
merely to examine and report on the sustainability of the
Government’s plans, as long as it is something better than a 50%
chance of compliance, which is a little like flicking a coin in the air
and saying, “It is sort of about right.” The OBR has
certain responsibilities, but they are not to test for conformity with
the charter. If we have a charter and we go through all this effort to
establish the august document, and we put into statute law primary
legislation—the Minister has made several references to the fact
that certain things are not necessary in law—I want to hear from
her what she means by conformity. Can she shed any further light on
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
example, how will conformity be enforced? Can the Minister say what the
consequences will be if an individual made an allegation that the
Budget does not conform with the charter for budget responsibility?
What happens if someone feels that it does not conform with those
provisions? Is that a, “Well, too bad, nothing comes of
that”, or is there some particular device? In amendment 6, we
have suggested a device for testing 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 19<a class="bkMark" name="Column19">&#160;</a>
                           </div>conformity. If the Treasury Committee feels that it needs to take the
role of an arbiter of conformity, the amendment would allow it to
trigger a motion in the House of Commons, requiring the Chancellor to
account for the failure. I like the device of bringing people to the
Bar of the House of Commons to account for their failure. That might be
a bit excessive, but requiring the Chancellor to come to the Chamber at
least to account for failure to conform might be a useful addition to
the clause. Enforceability is important.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps a
more important question for the Minister to answer is whether the
provision is justiciable. In other words, would a court have the right
to test for conformity? Before which court would a case be brought?
Would a case for judicial review be allowable in such circumstances? By
establishing the test for conformity, are we allowing the judiciary a
say in our financial and economic policy? If that is her intention, I
would be interested to hear about it. By putting it in statute, we are
opening the door to a judicial review to test for conformity. Can she
say specifically what would happen in a case that involved testing the
justiciability of that point?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Also, what
are the consequences of any failure to conform? Putting the provision
into the clause implies that there will be consequences if, for
example, the charter is disregarded or cast to one side or the Budget
is not congruent with it. Will the Minister elaborate on that point? It
is curious and interesting that the word is in the Bill, but it would
be otiose if it were there to pad out a clause in order to make the
Bill appear grand. I am sure that that is not the case, and that there
must be a reason for having it there.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000106">&#160;</a>

                           </span> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Dr McCrea. I want to add a few words in
support of the amendment and about the natural tension between
economics and politics on this matter. The process that we are going
through brings to my mind some of the tensions and discussions that
arose when the independent Bank of England was created by the previous
Government. There is a natural conflict between accountability and
independence in bodies such as the Bank of England or the OBR as
created in the Bill, and some of the comments that my hon. Friend the
Member for Nottingham East made draw out that conflict. We as
parliamentarians and our constituents want a body that acts in the way
that it deems best for our economy, but is accountable to us in
Parliament. Getting the mechanics right through scrutiny of the Bill is
crucial. The amendment questions a method of accountability that it is
important to scrutinise.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
As well
as how we weigh independence and accountability and get the balance
right in setting up the process, there is a second, economic conflict
between the Government setting up rules to which they say they want to
stick, the broader forces in the economy believing those rules and the
Government having the ability to respond to crises. History and basic
common sense tell us that further economic crises will occur. The Bill
requires conformity, but it is important to ask what will happen if
that conformity does not occur. That might happen because a future
Chancellor cannot be bothered or does not read through his Budget
properly—<em>[</em>
                        <em>Interruption.</em>
                        <em>]</em> The hon. Member
for Scarborough and Whitby said, “Unlike 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 20<a class="bkMark" name="Column20">&#160;</a>
                        </div>the last one.” I shall ignore those remarks from a sedentary
position. I could talk for hours about the previous Government’s
economic policy, but I will not test your chairship in that way, Dr
McCrea.
<p class="tabbed">A future
Chancellor of the Exchequer might produce a Budget that does not
conform for some other reason, perhaps in response to some fact about
the economy or some economic shock. In my view, we should not rule that
out and say, “That would never happen because that would not be
sticking to the rules that the Government set for themselves.” I
think we should say, “If that happens, this is what would
happen”—perhaps the suggestion that the Chancellor
accounts to Parliament. Failure may mean dramatic personal failure, but
it may also mean that something has not happened for whatever reason.
That would provide extra accountability if some unexpected economic or
other shock affected what the Chancellor needs to put in the Budget.
That raises  the issue that although the Government have, of
course, the responsibility for setting up a Budget that sticks 
to the financial tests that they set themselves ahead of time, they
also need to respond, because, at the end  of the day economics
and politics is about the good of the people. They are not about
sticking to the rules merely for their own sake. They are no good as a
law unto themselves; they are good only in so far as they support
people’s well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000108">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Nottingham East suggested, and explained the
meaning of conformity, how that conformity will be accounted for, and
how, if for some reason there needs to be a lack of the conformity that
we all want and expect, we ensure that we set up the rules properly so
that its absence can be accounted for properly to

                           </strong> First, I should explain to hon. Members that the
previous Government put the same provisions in legislation in section
155 of the Finance Act 1998. Clause 10 repeals that section, so clause
2 reinstates those aspects and allows for further provisions in the
charter to aid transparency. Far from being some big deal on putting
things in law, it ensures that things stay in
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000110">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
had a flashback to the debate on the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, and I
am sure that many of the points that the hon. Member for Wirral South
made were raised by me when the previous Government sought to enshrine
in law specific targets that would have been breached by changes in
economic circumstances and left no flexibility. We have tried to move
on from that. The issue that she raises is flexibility, and ensuring a
broad course of where the Government are trying to reach in their
economic policy, but at the same time ensuring flexibility. That is
what we are trying to put in place, and we have the Bill, which
references and sets up the charter. In that charter there are fiscal
objectives and a
mandate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000111">&#160;</a>

their course and tackle that social
ill?

our fiscal mandate and objectives and we aim to achieve them. One
reason this country has avoided going down the route of countries such
as Ireland and Greece is because, for the first time in many years,
those objectives and that mandate have some credibility. Part of the
problem was that although we had a code for fiscal stability, the rules
and objectives were changed far too often and ended up with a lack of
credibility. The hon. Lady will be familiar with the so-called golden
rule. Once it became clear that the Government were having problems
keeping to it, they simply redefined when the economic cycle started
and might end. That is precisely what this Government want to avoid.
The charter provides some flexibility for the Government to put in
place their fiscal objectives and mandate. This Government are clear
about our fiscal objectives and mandate, and we intend to deliver
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000113">&#160;</a>

not agree with it. Hon. Members must be prepared to use the fact that

The clause does not exclude the courts, although the fact that the
Minister’s utterance is now on the record will no doubt give
members of the judiciary pause for thought when considering
applications for judicial review of a Budget, a financial statement or
a Budget report. However, despite the fact that the Minister has voiced
that opinion, I am not sure that passing the Bill in this form will
necessarily exclude the courts from a role in testing conformity. If
that is the Minister’s intention, I strongly suggest that she
consider tabling an amendment on Report to clarify that the matter is
outwith the consideration of the legal processes. If that is not her
intention, clearly it will leave some wiggle room for the court to take
a view on the Budget. It would be an interesting set of test cases. It
is far better to address the amendment, and ensure that we have a test
for conformity and for failure to conform that is clearly within the
parliamentary
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
further reflection, the Minister may wish to write to the Committee and
perhaps consider the amendment in more depth; Opposition amendments may
not be drafted perfectly, as she knows. If she feels that it would be
helpful, we, on this side of the Committee, are more than happy to help
improve legislation. That is, after all, our duty. We can go through
the usual channels to have that conversation. It would be a shame to
pass over the amendment without recognising that this is probably an
area where Treasury Ministers have not seen a potential
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000128">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have a couple of specific points. The Minister
said that the provisions were, in many ways, “cut and
paste” provisions from previous legislation. In the process of
cutting and pasting, did she cast her eye over the necessity for the
provisions in law? I am sure that she would not simply scan her
computer cursor over a previous piece of legislation and paste it into
the Bill without considering whether the provisions were
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000133">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I was not
party to the debate in Parliament when it was felt
necessary—that is what the Minister said—to put in
statute that the Treasury should publish a Budget. If that is the case,
can she say, for example on the first of the subsections, on publishing
a Budget for each financial year, why she has not taken the opportunity
to say that a Budget should take place before each financial year? We
will have two Budgets in this financial year: one took place in June
and one is due on 25 March. I think we had one at 7.22 am on the day of
the most recent Treasury questions, when the Chancellor changed the
banking levy arrangements, but that may not count as a Budget
report.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Presumably,
if we have a Budget report for each financial year, it would be ideal
to have the Budget set out ahead of the financial year, so that the
wider economy—the wider world—could prepare and plan for
the year. Given the move towards fixed-term Parliaments and a more
rigid calendar, why not say that the Budget should take place before
each financial
year?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
only other point I want to raise with the Minister on the clause is
about the publication of the financial statement and Budget report. I
notice that under later provisions in the Bill the Office for Budget
Responsibility will have sight of the methodology and costing models
for various elements of financial policy decisions. Will the Minister
take this opportunity to say that the Budget report will include the
publication or, at the very least, the lodging in the House of Commons
Library of the methodologies and costing models that the Treasury
obviously has and is providing to the OBR for modelling any fiscal
policy changes? That level of transparency would certainly be welcome.
I imagine that now we know that those methodologies are real and
portable to the OBR, they are in a form in which they could be
published or made available. Will the Minister take this opportunity to
ensure that that level of detail is part of the publication scheme that
she
envisages?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000136">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 2 creates a statutory requirement for the
Government to have an annual Budget and to report on that Budget to
Parliament. I do not think that this is a controversial clause,
although as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, in recent years we have
seen more than one annual Budget. That is probably symptomatic of the
awful financial situation that the previous Government created. As he
pointed out, we had reached a position in which the pre-Budget report
had become almost a mini-Budget. Conservative Members felt that those
constant reforms of fiscal policy were not helpful, so I can tell the
hon. Gentleman that we want to move towards having a single Budget and
removing the pre-Budget report. The hope is that that will help the
Government to deliver a more stable and simpler tax and benefits
system. It will also mean less frequent adjustments to public spending
totals. In many respects, clause 2 takes us back to the sort of fiscal
and financial calendar framework that we need—one that has more
certainty around
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000137">&#160;</a>

was interested in the hon. Gentleman’s comments about the timing
of the Budget. Obviously, the Government do retain some flexibility
over the timing of the Budget. As he will be aware, we have said that
this year’s Budget will take place in just a few weeks’
time, on 23 March. I would be interested to know whether he is
announcing

                           </strong> My understanding is that 23 or 25 March
is before the financial year to which the Budget applies. Presumably,
most of the provisions in the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
Budget in a few weeks’ time will relate to the period from April
2011 onwards. That was the point that I was making. Presumably, the
Minister intends to normalise the arrangement so that a Budget would
not take place once a financial year to which it substantively applied
had already commenced, because obviously that would be helpful for
wider planning
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000139">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman sets out one reason why we
want to move to an annual Budget event. Obviously, Governments have
flexibility about when they timetable such events. As an incoming
Government, we had an emergency Budget in June. That was very much in
response to the exceptional circumstances that we took over. I am
talking about the economic situation that had been bequeathed to
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the hon. Gentleman’s point about publication of methodologies
and costing models, one benefit of having the OBR in place is that it
will publish its independent assessment of economic forecasts. As a
result of that, as hon. Members will see in relation to later clauses
of the Bill, it will also need to set out the key risks that it
perceives to those forecasts and the assumptions that lie behind them.
That will provide a level of transparency that certainly under previous
Governments we never
had.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000141">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister implies that now that the OBR will be
privy to the methodologies and costing models that the Treasury has
historically kept to itself, the rest of the world should automatically
trust that and be content with it. I suspect that in this era of
openness and freedom of information, many people will not feel that
that goes far enough. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm
that, with the methodologies being in a form that is transferable to
the OBR, they would presumably also be subject to freedom of
information legislation. Would it not be preferable if the Treasury
voluntarily made available to specific economists, the Institute for
Fiscal Studies, the House of Commons Library and any member of the
public who is interested in seeing the basis on which the Government
calculate their costings on, for example, fuel duty or income tax,
whatever changes may be available to the Chancellor to make? Surely
those methodologies and costing models ought to be appropriately in the
public domain, otherwise people may suspect a bit of jiggery-pokery. I
am sure that that would be incorrect, but it would be better for the
Minister to take a stand, to put her best foot forward and to say
absolutely clearly that those will be
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000142">&#160;</a>

Bill is to have that work done independently of the Treasury and then
to have it published. The hon. Gentleman talks about the Treasury being
transparent. Of course, both the Treasury and the OBR will be subject

entertaining if the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) were on the

the Office for Budget Responsibility. It would be difficult to have a
clause stand part debate on this clause because everything that relates
to the day-to-day functioning and governance of the office is contained
in schedule 1. We will probably reach that schedule later this week.
The substance of what we have to say will probably end up being debated
then. The role of the Treasury is significantly changed by the
establishment of the OBR. Certain functions are removed from the
Treasury and, rather than simply being put at arm’s length, they
are put on an independent footing.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000148">&#160;</a>

repeals the fiscal framework that was set up by the previous Labour
Administration, so it repeals the 1998 provisions and the code for
fiscal stability. It repeals the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2010, which
set out the previous Chancellor’s mandate to halve the public
sector net borrowing requirement as a proportion of GDP by 2013-14. It
also repeals the Industry Act 1975, which put a requirement
on the Treasury to provide biannual economic forecasts. The OBR will
now have the primary role of making such forecasts.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000149">&#160;</a>

have already been asked about the overlap between OBR forecasts and
Government announcements and whether it is happy coincidence that
certain forecasts are made at certain times. It is important that there
is some way of documenting or formalising the relationship between the
Treasury and the OBR. We have included the Bank of England in the
amendment as well because the Bank has a similar role to the OBR in

                           </div>policy. Some of the structures, as we will come on
to discuss, will also be quite similar to the role of the independent
Monetary Policy Committee and its relationship with the Treasury
Committee. It is the similar concept of having that
arm’s-length, independent role of forecasting, advising and
making
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that there is understanding of how the relationship
between the OBR and Treasury will operate. The underlying concern is
that the Treasury should not interfere in the work of the OBR. When we
get to the amendments tabled to schedule 1, we will debate the
provisions in more detail. For the OBR to do its job properly, it has
to be adequately resourced and have a budget of its own. We have seen
in countries such as Canada and Sweden that when their equivalent of
the OBR said things that were not entirely palatable to the
politicians, their budgets were cut, so they were not able to do their
job properly. I am sure that we will come on to that and debate it at
the appropriate
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
there are echoes of the tripartite agreement between the Financial
Services Authority, the Bank of England and the
Treasury—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> The Minister says
from a sedentary position, “That didn’t work very
well.” I would not accept all her criticisms of the way it
worked. The concept it established was that if there are three
different organisations—in that case, the Bank of England, the
Treasury and the FSA—that all have a role in financial
regulation and in looking at the broader forces at work in the economy,
that relationship needs somehow to be put on a formal footing. We are
suggesting through the amendment that there should be something
similar.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are also suggesting that there should be a role for Parliament in
scrutinising that relationship, and that a memorandum of understanding
should be laid before Parliament within three months of the Bill
becoming law. If the Minister does not think that there should be a
formal arrangement such as that, will she elaborate on exactly how the
relationship will work and be monitored? How does she think Parliament
will be able to challenge the relationship if it is seen to be out of
kilter; for example, if the Treasury is seen not to be allowing the OBR
to do the job that it has been set up to do, or if there is not
sufficient co-operation between the Bank of England and the OBR, which,
given its economic forecasting role, I imagine would be quite
important? Does she think that there should be a formal memorandum? If
not, what else would she put in
place?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000153">&#160;</a>

made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East. Of course, the
roles of the bodies that are working on economic stability in the
Government’s fiscal position are interconnected, so the
amendment is important. Again, if there were a crash, a lack of
appropriate regulation, or a need for cross-working between the OBR and
the Treasury, it would be incredibly helpful for Parliament to
understand, ahead of time, how that might happen or what the rules of
the game might be. We can only try in Committee to set up institutions
and bodies that are fit for purpose in advance of knowledge of such
events. In doing so, it is important to accept that their roles are
necessarily interconnected.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000154">&#160;</a>

the Bank of England are independent bodies that have different
functions and will make their own judgments. Obviously, the Bank of
England has a monetary policy and financial stability role, whereas the
OBR’s role is to examine and report on the sustainability of the
public finances. Interestingly, the chair of the OBR has said that he
expects the OBR and the Bank of England to have common interests, and
that they may regularly exchange views. Ultimately, however, whether
working relations are formalised in a memorandum of understanding is
rightly a matter for the independent OBR; it is not a matter for
primary legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000157">&#160;</a>

have mentioned the tripartite agreement, which, as we saw,
spectacularly failed. There was, however, a memorandum of understanding
between the Bank of England, the Treasury and the FSA. We think that in

work with the Bank of England.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000158">&#160;</a>

points, will she clarify what she means by its being a matter for the
OBR to decide how it wants to work with the Bank of England and,
presumably, the Treasury? What would happen if those bodies had
different ideas about the Bank of England’s role? They might
have different ideas about providing information, about meeting and so
on, and those are the kinds of matters that a memorandum of
understanding would contain. What if the OBR meets resistance from the
Treasury and the Bank of England in relation to what it thinks is
necessary for it to do its job?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000160">&#160;</a>

would put that matter in the public domain, because a formal memorandum

ensuring that the relationship between it, the Treasury and the Bank of
England—that three-party working—is set up in a way that
best benefits the office.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000163">&#160;</a>

memorandum of understanding between the OBR and the
Treasury—with which I agree—and whether the Bill should
tell the OBR how it should work with another independent body, the Bank
of England. I do not think it is for us to dictate to the OBR how it
should work with the Bank of England. That is rightly for it to decide.
I do agree that we need a detailed memorandum of understanding between
the OBR and the Treasury, which is in preparation. We are also
preparing detailed memorandums of understanding between the OBR and Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and
Pensions. That is line with recommendations from the Treasury
Committee, when it looked at the issue last year. Those memorandums of
understanding will set out roles and responsibilities for each body,
and will hopefully ensure that working relations are accountable and
transparent. In doing so, they will support the independence of the
OBR.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000164">&#160;</a>

the detailed memorandums. To the extent that the OBR is going to
be—and should be—independent, we will need to talk to it
about how to tackle publishing the memorandums of understanding. They
will be in the public domain and ultimately there will be a shared
document, because they will set out a working relationship between the
various parties that they concern. We agree that something needs to be
in place, and the charter establishes that that will happen. We think
that the independent OBR needs to work out how it is going to work with
the independent Bank of England. I hope I have now addressed the

                           </strong> I am not sure that the Minister has, although it
is something that is difficult to tease out until we get to more detail
on how the OBR will be governed, funded and all those other issues. The
obvious concern is, given what has happened in other countries, that an
office of budget responsibility can seem like a good idea at the time.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East said on clause 2, the
idea of the OBR was announced to an extent as a political mechanism. It
made the point that we needed arm’s-length economic forecasts;
that we needed to divorce economic forecasting and some of the
OBR’s other responsibilities from Government; and that we needed
less political interpretation and more reliable empirical evidence and
interpretation of economic data. It is widely accepted that it was
announced by the Chancellor as much for political reasons as for
economic management ones.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The OBR is
finding its feet and is already functioning on a non-statutory footing.
As we reach a situation where it starts to function on a statutory
footing, it may not seem to the Chancellor such a good idea to have set
up such a body. As the forecasts are announced, with some criticism of
the Government, and as some conflicts arise, one can imagine the
Chancellor thinking, “I have created a rod for my own
back.” That is why we are concerned that we do not have the
situation that arose in Sweden and, I think, Canada. When Ministers
there 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 30<a class="bkMark" name="Column30">&#160;</a>
                           </div>were unhappy with what their equivalent of the OBR had done, they said,
“If you carry on like this, we will cut your budget, so you
can’t do your job properly.” If the relationship broke
down here, I cannot imagine that the Chancellor would be so indiscreet
as to say something like that publicly about the OBR. None the less,
one can imagine that behind the scenes there might be efforts to curb
its activities, to rein it in and to try to make it a little more
helpful to the Government of the day. That is why we think that the
measures should be a little more detailed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000168">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am glad
that the Minister has confirmed that there is a memorandum of
understanding between the Treasury and the OBR. I did not quite catch
the Minister’s answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral
South about the efforts that would be made to put the memorandums of
understanding with the DWP and HMRC in the public domain. Perhaps the
Minister will update me on that and say not just whether these
memorandums of understanding will be put in the public domain but
whether there will be an opportunity to challenge them. It is not so
important to challenge what is in the memorandums, but we should have
the opportunity to scrutinise them. If the OBR felt that the
DWP, the Treasury or HMRC were not adhering to the spirit and the
letter of the memorandums, Parliament should be made aware of it and
either the Treasury Committee or Parliament should have a role in
sorting it out, rather than the squabble being conducted on the
financial pages of the newspapers. Will the Minister say to what extent
the detail of the memorandums will be made public and whether we as

I explained earlier, will be published as joint documents. The
independence of the OBR is what this Bill puts in place—in terms
of the people who run it, how it is set up, the governance structure
and the OBR’s relationship to the Treasury and Parliament. The
hon. Lady specifically mentioned the budget. She will be aware that the
spending review gave the OBR a

ought to include. I do not wish to disparage the accountancy profession
in any way, shape or form, but there is more to life than simply

                           </strong> No The Minister heard the word
“deficit,” but she forgot that the point I was making was
about her fetishism about the deficit. There is a sense of obsession
about one aspect—an important aspect—of our public
finances. As we know, the Minister and her Treasury colleagues are
completely blinkered and blind to the impact on the rest of the economy
of some of her policy decisions when it comes to her painful and swift
approach to closing the
deficit.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000190">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
policy area that we should consider, and which we felt ought to be
within the remit of the OBR, is whether Treasury policies have a
positive or an adverse impact on levels of child poverty. After all,
what could be more important than ensuring that the children of future
generations have a decent education, decent living standards and more
opportunities open to them than was the case in preceding generations?
No doubt, the Minister will say that that is just one area of public
policy, and it is not necessary to put it in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000191">&#160;</a>

we have an Office for Budget Responsibility, we are essentially testing
whether Budgets are responsible. The only way of knowing that is by
looking at their impact on society as a whole. Therefore, it is
entirely relevant—in fact, necessary—to flesh out the
duties that fall to the OBR by having it look at the rather regressive
steps that the Treasury sometimes takes, as it unfortunately has in
Budgets under this Conservative-led
Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Child
poverty is obviously significant and, unfortunately, persistent in many
parts of the country. The Child Poverty Action Group reported last week
that an estimated 12,000 children in my constituency in
Nottingham—about 23% of all children in the
constituency—are living under its definition of severe poverty.
That is unacceptable and more steps need to be taken to eradicate
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000193">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is good that we have the Child Poverty Act 2010, but there are
increasing signs that the Treasury is affecting what happens, front and
centre in public policy terms, in relation to child poverty. The
Government are responsible for changes to tax credits, the appalling
abolition of the health in pregnancy grant, housing benefit changes,
the wider ramifications of pay freezes across the economy,

			Column number: 33<a class="bkMark" name="Column33">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the increase in value added tax to 20%, child benefit cuts, scrapping
education maintenance allowance, and welfare changes. All those issues
have an adverse impact on child poverty. If we are testing the
responsibility of the Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility
ought to be able, within its legal remit, to make a judgment about the
Treasury’s measures and whether they are, in the true meaning of
the word,
responsible.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
is not to say that there are no wider economic ramifications that
impact on child poverty, such as the rates of employment and of growth.
The Government’s obsession with deficit reduction at the cost of
everything else leaves all aspects of economic policy almost untouched.
I hope that this is not the case, but growth looks as though it is
going into reverse; there was a 0.6% reduction in growth in quarter 4
of 2010. Rather than a clinically narrow view of what responsibility
ought to be, our amendment suggests that it should be judged not in
isolation, but on the wider impact on
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000195">&#160;</a>

imposed a responsibility on the Government of the day to publish a
child poverty strategy and set up a child poverty commission. The new

had announcements on that front. A number of parliamentary questions
have pushed the Government to say when they will make a move and take
meeting the child poverty targets seriously. Given the

strong record on speaking out on matters of child poverty. She is in
many ways more knowledgeable than me on some of the details,
particularly on the legislation passed during the previous Parliament.
If we are to have a body called the Office for Budget Responsibility,
the ordinary man or woman on the street may well expect it to test
whether policy decisions will be reckless or prudent, and whether they
will have a positive or negative impact on their lives, work, society,
families and children. We think that the amendment is necessary for
that purpose, and to put some colour into what could otherwise be a dry
and narrow definition of the OBR’s
duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Joseph Rowntree Foundation has published a number of interesting
documents, one of which looks at the estimated costs of child poverty
to the economy and to the Treasury. One of the Chancellor’s
difficulties in grappling with the issue is that he sees the business
of tackling child poverty as merely a cost and a line item that will
crop up in a future Budget. The work of the JRF shows very much that
child poverty is actually a drain on the Exchequer in terms of the
income that might otherwise have come to the Treasury. The foundation
suggests that £17 billion is lost to the Exchequer in public
spending demand and lost revenues because of the economic multipliers;
low-income families obviously have higher marginal consumption rates
and the income transfers associated with those strong economic
multiplier effects are evident, but sometimes ignored under public
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
example, we know that Ministers’ rather depressing defence of
the increase in VAT was that somehow it was not a regressive step. That
they tried to paint it as a

			Column number: 34<a class="bkMark" name="Column34">&#160;</a>
                           </div>progressive step was evidence that they do not really grasp and
understand the impact that their policies might have on the responsible
conduct of social policy. It would be useful to have an OBR that took a
stance on that issue and was able to look at how the economic impact
and costs of child poverty, such as the psychological and emotional
costs, the educational costs, the employment costs, the costs in crime
and negative behaviour and the costs to family and community
well-being, apply across the board. It would be
useful if the OBR had that
capability.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is grouped with several others, and I draw to the
Committee’s attention amendment 13 to supplement the points made
about the narrow nature of the duties of the OBR as they are currently
defined. It would allow the Office for Budget Responsibility to examine
and report on the impartiality of the local government finance
settlement across England. Many members of the public are aware that
councils throughout the country are currently setting their budgets.
When they hear that there is an Office for Budget Responsibility, they
might not necessarily see it purely as a national policy body, but
might think that their local budget situations in respect of public
finance could also be subject to its work. It would seem rather odd to
exclude the OBR from testing whether there was budgetary responsibility
at sub-national level, and merely to test it at the macro-economic or
national
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000200">&#160;</a>

there is great anxiety in my constituency about the damage to our
public finances and the current approach to local authority spending.
Constituents constantly raise with me the false economy of such a high
level of cuts, with cuts passed on to the Jobcentre as people are put
on the dole. People frequently raise that connection and the influence
that local authorities have on responsible public finances. Is my hon.

                           </strong> Absolutely. There are good, sound reasons in and
of themselves for seeking the right for the Office for Budget
Responsibility to test the impartiality of local government grant
settlements, precisely because many of the decisions made by the
Government on local budgets seem highly arbitrary, very regressive and
very harmful for the economy and society more
widely.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000202">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not just Labour Members who advocate a level of audit and support
for testing the impartiality of the grant settlement. No doubt the
Minister will recall that in February 2009, her party published a
rather interesting policy Green Paper, “Control Shift: Returning
Power to Local Communities.” It is relevant because early in
that document, the current Prime Minister and other Ministers made a
number of promises, one of which was about the transparent local
government financial system that they wanted to see.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000203">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Because
the details of the current local government finance system are
determined behind closed doors in Whitehall, it is hard for councils to
be able to estimate with any degree of confidence how much they will be
awarded. The system can be adjusted in many subtle ways that shift
relative resources between different categories of councils. This
element of qualitative input leads to suspicions that the outcomes of
the allocation process are subject to covert party-political
interference…We need a more transparent system for allocating
local government funding. Therefore, a Conservative government will
give the independent Audit Commission a new duty to report to
Parliament on the draft

policy document continues in that vein, so the idea was not simply
dreamt up by the Opposition when tabling our amendment. We wanted to
test for that impartiality, and whether Ministers stand by their
commitment that the local government financial settlement should have
independent audit; or they do not, and have backtracked, adding to the
long list of U-turns happily made by the Government in their shambolic
progress. It would be good if the Minister could address that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000205">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have now abolished the Audit Commission but, in its lieu,
the OBR would be the natural, best body to test for the independence of
the local government financial settlement. For a number of pressing
reasons, we need to have such a test by the
OBR.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000206">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
presentation of the recent local government grant settlement was highly
partial and suspect in a number of ways. A new method for articulating
the grant to local authorities was devised by the current Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government. Never before in the history
of local government finance has the term “spending power”
been used, but that was the measure when talking about the amount of
money councils received, because the Secretary of State wanted to say
that no council would be getting a cut of more than 8.5%. In fact, he
was rolling within the grant settlement the amount of money that
councils themselves would be raising through council tax, which of
course has been completely
separate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ministers’
spin has given rise to the sense of a partial approach to the
presentation of the local government grant settlement. We know that a
massive mismatch exists between the deprivation in many authorities and
the resources they are receiving. Nottingham, where my constituency is,
is ranked the 13th most deprived authority on the index of multiple
deprivation, but it will receive the 21st largest fall in spending
power for upper tier authorities. The fire authority in Nottinghamshire
is getting the second worst settlement in the country, whereas it
ranked ninth out of 45 fire and rescue services by total numbers of
fires.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
local government finance settlement is arbitrary and has a sense of
disproportionality. The OBR ought to have a responsibility to check and
test that settlement, because local budgets are just as important in
many ways and to many people as national Budgets. The
Government’s approach of removing ring-fencing and ending a
number of grants meant that the quantum of reduction in other,
un-ring-fenced grant arrangements caused problems for many authorities,
in particular with the supporting people budget, which is used for the
most needy in society—tackling homelessness and so forth.
Despite many exchanges of correspondence with the Secretary of State
councils throughout the country have simply been unable to get clarity
on the truth about the settlement. Many Members know from their own
local authorities that there is a sense of obfuscation,

			Column number: 36<a class="bkMark" name="Column36">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and that the clouds that have descended over the local government
financial settlement have brought into disrepute the process
of allocating grant fairly from central Government
to local authorities. One can add into that the double-counting effects
that different Departments are pursuing; for example, there is the
health and social care budget, which appears in PCT budgets at the same
time as it appears in local authority budgets. This is clearly a
settlement and a grant-giving process that is prone to partisan
interference.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000209">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s new-found friends to account, to see whether the

Liberal Democrats, because perhaps they take a different view, but the
Conservative party has stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000211">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The hon. Member for
Chippenham may disagree that that is necessary, but it is essentially
the amendment that we are looking to pursue today. If the Minister has
forgotten that that was a recent commitment made by her colleagues, I
will happily withdraw the amendment, and, if she then wants to come
back with a slightly finessed version, that is fine. To simply ditch
it, however, and say that “We’re now in control, so we
will pull the strings and play with the levers to our political
hearts’ content,” would be wrong, especially given the
Conservatives’ apparent discontent with the arrangements under
previous Governments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would not
go as far as to say that, when it comes to the local government grant
settlement, everything has always been perfect in all preceding
Administrations. There is a reasonable case for greater transparency,
which is precisely why we have tabled the amendment. I hope that the
proposal will not be rebutted, but I know that Ministers often have the
word “RESIST” written in big, black letters on their
brief. On the brief that is before the Minister today, however, that
would not be good, so I hope that we will see some progress from her on
that particular point.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 8
seeks to define the term “sustainability” more
appropriately and to allow the OBR greater latitude there, so that it
might include public sector net borrowing, as well as debt, growth,
employment and wider risks to the UK finances. As with my comments on
amendment 12, the amendment recognises that there are
positive elements of the draft charter for fiscal responsibility.
Confidence in the economy is one such objective. Intergenerational
fairness should be looked at, as should the effectiveness of monetary
policy and so on. There is, however, too little focus in the draft
charter on growth and jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the
Minister knows, one of the primary anxieties that we have about the
Government’s policies is that there is no strategy for growth.
Even though unemployment is rising, they seem to care very little about
that and they are taking few steps to stem rising unemployment.
Similarly, the economy appears to be shrinking and not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 37<a class="bkMark" name="Column37">&#160;</a>
                           </div>enough is being done to stop that. For the OBR, defining
“sustainability” in that wider macro-economic sense would
give it an ability to conduct its analysis and assessments as they
apply to other important areas of public policy. Clearly, that would be
a sensible step, and I hope that the Minister will
view the amendment positively.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 9
proposes that the OBR publish its analysis and assessments twice each
year rather than simply once. If the OBR is so significant an
organisation, a twice-yearly publication of its analyses does not seem
particularly unreasonable to me. Historically, as we have noted in
previous debates, the Treasury typically has autumn statements,
pre-Budget reports and so forth that can take place on a number of
occasions within a financial year. We should, therefore, have an
analytical cycle that matches the Treasury cycle. To have an aligned
arrangement where the OBR has an obligation to make its analysis only
once a year seems slightly
odd.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know, of course, that Government policies can change quite rapidly, as
can the economy. A week is a long time in politics, as it is for the
economy. To have only one analysis within a calendar year seems out of
kilter with economic realities. Obviously, growth can take a turn for
the worse, and therefore an OBR set of assessments and analysis on a
six-monthly basis would seem more appropriate to
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000218">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Before my hon. Friend moves on to the next
amendment, I point out that the other important thing addressed by
amendment 9 is the fact that, in clause 4, the OBR is required twice a
year to prepare fiscal and economic forecasts, and an assessment of the
extent to which the fiscal mandate has been achieved or is likely to be
achieved. But only once a year is it obliged to prepare an assessment
of the accuracy of the fiscal and economic forecast previously prepared
by it. It seems slightly strange—if it is producing forecasts
twice a year, why does it have to look at the accuracy of those
forecasts only once a
year?<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000219">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 10
is short and simple. It seeks to ensure that the sustainability of
public finances is measured over a five-year period. That seems to be
the suggestion made in the charter for budget responsibility, but we
felt that there was logic in extending that provision in the Bill as
well. Amendment 11 seeks to ensure that the OBR positively promotes

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have a history, sad to say, of showing perhaps a little too
much partisan bias when it comes to definitions of sustainability. In
their eyes, sustainability is a pretty cold and calculated thing. I
have mentioned that they are obsessive about the deficit to the point
of ignoring issues that are quite critical in the broader economy, and
their elevation of deficit closure issues, which many suspect is a
device to shrink vital public investment. Many in the Conservative
party may have come into politics with the intention of doing that all
along. It is often felt that there is insufficient evidential basis for
many of the claims that they make about the sustainability of public
finances. The Chancellor of the Exchequer famously claimed that we were
on the brink of bankruptcy, even though our triple A rating by the
credit rating agencies never
changed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030178000222">&#160;</a>
