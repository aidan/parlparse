<P>
<H5>6.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On behalf of the Committee, I wish you good morning, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
In the short debate that we had, several questions were asked--some about principle, some about technical detail and some relating to both. I hope to deal with them, although perhaps not to the satisfaction of all hon. Members.
<P>
I was asked about the roles of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. The Bill's arrangement follows the precedent that was set by the teacher pay review board, which was set up by the previous Administration. The Prime Minister appoints the members of that board and he was similarly involved in appointing the members of the Low Pay Commission. Although I do not always agree with Opposition Members, at least there was some agreement between us on the principle of appointments. I hope that that satisfies hon. Members.
<P>
The Bill requires the Low Pay Commission to report to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. As is usual when taking decisions on matters of importance, there will obviously be collective discussion within the Government before any decision is taken on the report. All Ministers with an input into the issue, including my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will participate in the Government's collective decision making.
<P>
The regulations that will flow from the Government's decisions on the Low Pay Commission's recommendations will be made by the Secretary of State alone, as provided for in clauses 1(3), 3(2) and 4(1). The Government's view is that the commission should have a continuing role and that it could reconvene as required to consider any issues relating to the minimum wage. Clause 8, which I hope we shall debate later this morning, gives Ministers that power. It enables us to consult the commission before using the main regulation-making powers in clauses 1 to 4--for example, before changing the rate itself. The clause is crucial in giving us the flexibility to consult the commission, but it does not require us to do so .
<P>
We have never before had a single statutory minimum rate in the United Kingdom and we may need to do some fine tuning once the Bill has been implemented. When drafting the Bill, we cannot possibly know how matters will develop in the future--hence the need for flexibility and the wide range of matters that can be referred to the commission at the appropriate time.
<P>
The clause gives us the flexibility to consult the commission on any matters relating to the minimum wage, as well as any changes to the rate, the calculation or the modifications under clauses 3 and 4. That could, for example, include studies on the impact of the minimum wage and advice on enforcement. The Commission could also be asked to consider more specific matters such as the effect of the minimum wage on any of the special classes of people described in clauses 31 to 37, or the need to extend the minimum wage to others using the powers in clause 38. For the convenience of the Committee, those clauses relate to agency workers, home workers, the Crown armed forces, mariners, and House of Commons and House of Lords staff, while clause 38 contains powers to prevent avoidance by applying the provisions to those who may not be defined as workers.
<P>
There is no requirement for the Secretary of State to hold further consultations--she is required only to consult before setting an initial rate under clause 5. It is not necessary to compel future consultation with the Commission; the Secretary of State is free, if she chooses, to proceed directly with any regulations once the initial rate has been set. If, however, she thinks that it is sensible for the Commission to consider an issue relating to the national minimum wage, the clause enables her to consult.
<P>
Opposition Members asked why we have included a non-consultation option in clause 6 and wanted to know under what circumstances it might be used. The provision gives us an alternative route to make changes to the national minimum wage when reference to the Low Pay Commission may not be considered appropriate. For example--[Interruption.] I will give a clear example. If hon. Members wait, they will see what I mean.
<P>
The regulations might require amendment because they do not cover particular wage circumstances, whether through an oversight or otherwise. For example, a component of pay might not have been considered fully or appropriately, but there may be an opportunity for the Secretary of State to examine such a case. Problems of technical drafting might also arise.
<P>
Such problems in regulation arise under every Administration, especially in relation to new legislation, when regulations are introduced. I remember that such problems arose from the Jobseekers Act 1995. The previous Government returned to the House on many occasions, over several months. The then Secretary of State did not ask the commission that examined social security issues, the relevant Committee, or the House to draft amendments to the regulations.
<P>
I hope that the Government will avoid having to table such amendments, but procedures must exist in case they cannot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I grateful to the Minister for at least partially clarifying the issues raised by the Opposition. Even if he started with the language of Sir Humphrey, he got on to firmer ground.
<P>
Will he assure the Opposition that if he seeks to solve the problems in question, he will not adopt an all too frequent practice of the Inland Revenue? In cases in which somebody has profited by a failure in the regulations, or has benefited by a constructive interpretation of them, the Revenue imposes the regulations retrospectively. I hope that he will not adhere to that practice without giving the clearest of reasons for doing so, or without explaining them to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I do not yet have responsibility for the Inland Revenue. I have never been described as Sir Humphrey. That is a new one for me.
<P>
It is obvious that attempts to ensure that a person entitled to the minimum wage does not receive it--using, for example, bogus self employment--must be dealt with. Off the top of my head, I think that clause 38 contains the means for doing that. There is no point in providing a national minimum wage while allowing companies to drive a coach and horses through the ability of workers--individually or collectively--to secure their rights. The Bill contains powers to ensure that if such problems arise, the Secretary of State can deal with them. That is fair and reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister's example showed circumstances in which the non-consultation option would be used. Will he assure the Committee that if matters that relate to the five paragraphs of clause 5(2) were subject to regulation, it would be the Government's invariable practice to proceed by consultation before having recourse to that regulation?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I have made it clear that the Secretary of State will submit matters to the Low Pay Commission, under the terms of its brief, and under those of any potential brief. The Government have also said that, under the commision's current brief, if the Secretary of State decides not to implement a recommendation or to amend it, she will have to give Parliament her reasons for doing so.
<P>
That is true with regard to other issues that are submitted to the Low Pay Commission. The Secretary of State will consult, and then report to Parliament. That is a reasonable way to proceed, especially if the Government deviate from the recommendations. I hope that hon. Members can see that no attempt is being made to connive so as to avoid scrutiny of the Low Pay Commission or of the Secretary of State's relationship with it. I hope that hon. Members will agree to the clause on that basis.

Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Referrals to, and reports of, the Low Pay Commission: supplementary</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 5, line 3, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and the Commission may request such an extension'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This innocuous amendment would achieve balance between the Secretary of State and the Low Pay Commission by enabling the commission to request an extension of time from the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State can require the commission to take further time for its deliberations, so it is reasonable that the commission should be able to ask for more time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I recognise that the hon. Member for Eastleigh wants to ensure, like me, that the Low Pay Commission follows sound procedures when making reports. I view the amendment in that spirit and take it as probing, but I shall endeavour to give him the assurances he needs to decide not to press it to a vote.
<P>
Clause 7(3) provides flexibility. When bodies such as the commission are tasked with reporting to Ministers, it is usual to provide a power to extend the reporting deadline, which is sensible; indeed, it would be unrealistic not to do so. We of course recognise that unforseen circumstances may mean that a deadline must be extended. Without such a power, a report could be invalidated if the commission missed a deadline of five minutes or so, which would be absurd. However, the amendment is unnecessary because the Bill does not prevent the commission from requesting an extension. There is therefore no need to enable the commission to make such a request.
<P>
It is a general legal principle in this country that things can be done unless the law prevents them. That is the case here. If the commission wanted to extend the time allowed for making a report, it could simply ask for an extension. There is no need to make express provision in the Bill. It is up to the Secretary of State to decide whether to extend the deadline. I hope that the Committee agrees that that is right, as the Secretary of State requested the report and set the deadline in the first place.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt with the unease of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. I understand that he tabled the amendment to get more information. That is perfectly proper for a member of the Committee, but I hope that he will not press the amendment to a Division.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> These amendments resemble the previous probing amendment. I seek reassurance that there will be a balance between the Secretary of State and the Low Pay Commission. I assure her that amendment No. 89 is not intended to extend the commission's powers beyond what is set out in earlier clauses. In suggesting that the commission should be allowed to take account of any additional factors that they think fit, I do not intend to broaden the scope of its powers. I seek only clarification of the balance between the Secretary of State and the commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman must make do with me on this amendment. I hope that I can be as charming as my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary--if I can stay awake. She is a hard act to follow, and my finishing school closed earlier than my parents expected.
<P>
It is right that the procedures for the Low Pay Commission should ensure that it provides sound and effective reports. The amendments in part focus on the commission's independence in reaching conclusions and producing reports. I agree with that. In opposition, I was responsible for establishing the concept and principle of the commission, and I went to great lengths to ensure that it would be an independent body. I wanted people to feel that they could, with certainty, join it or participate in its work by submitting written or verbal evidence. The commission's real independence is of crucial importance to the Government.
<P>
Amendment No. 88 is unnecessary. It could impose extra burdens on the commission and constrain its editorial discretion. Clause 7(4) already requires the commission, before it arrives at its conclusions, to consult any organisations representing employers or workers--and other organisations or persons--that it thinks fit.
<P>
The commission appears to have carried out that part of its task outstandingly well. It has consulted extensively with hundreds of bodies. It has travelled to the regions and to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to enable people to make submissions without having to come to London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Does the Minister accept that the amendment would enable organisations representing employers and employees to make presentations to the Low Pay Commission without having to be called upon to do so? The clause gives the impression that the commission can decide whom to consult. Will bodies that represent employers or employees have the right to make a presentation to the Low Pay Commission of their own volition? Clearly, it is for the commission to decide what it then does with such presentations.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is what happens now. That is why the commission has had more than 600 submissions. Its practical work load, the time scale within which it will operate and the potential effectiveness of its members will determine with which organisations or individuals it wishes to have a verbal hearing on the basis of the submissions. That principle was extended in the regional visits to secure an opportunity for a range of individuals and organisations--particularly small organisations and small companies which cannot usually find the time or the resources to do so--to make an effective contribution. The clause explicitly and precisely meets the hon. Gentleman's point. There would be no point in the commission not taking into account the views of organisations that had made representations to it in the first place--it would be inconceivable that it would act in that way. It is intended that the commission should reach a decision after it has taken as much evidence as it can from a range of individuals and organisations with a direct--or even indirect--interest in the setting of the rate and associated issues.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 89 and 90 are likewise unnecessary. They require the commission to take account of any factors that it thinks fit, over and above those which it must consider under the Bill or as specified by the Secretary of State. It must then set those factors out in its reports.
<P>
I have already clarified the commission's terms of reference and the factors that it has to take into consideration before making its first recommendations. Broadly speaking, those factors are employment, inflation, competitiveness, small firms, and costs to industry and the Exchequer. The list is deliberately designed to be as comprehensive as possible so that the minimum wage can be set in a balanced way. The Bill also contains core criteria, which the commission must take into account in every report. Those criteria are the economy of the United Kingdom and its competitiveness. There is, however, no need to require the commission to take into account any other factor, as the amendments aim to do. I have no difficulty with the fact that it is open to the commission to take account of whatever it likes, but it is not necessary to state that it can do so in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 produces a further difficulty by requiring the commission to state all relevant factors in its reports. That seems over-bureaucratic and burdensome. The commission already has to state the reasons for its recommendations. Surely, we should not require it to set out every detailed discussion that takes place between its members when they come to their conclusions. There is no point asking the commission to include the kitchen sink as well as the reasons behind its conclusions. The purpose of the commission making recommendations is that it should set out the principal reasons behind its conclusions and establish their reasonableness.
<P>
I hope that I have convinced the hon. Member for Eastleigh with the considerable charm and wit that I have shown for this time in the morning. I hope that he will be convinced not only of my sincerity, but of the great effort that the Government have made to ensure that the points that he has raised are met through the Bill's structure and in the remit that we have given to the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> It would be invidious of me to make comparisons between the levels of charm exuded by the Minister and his colleague. I have carefully followed the thrust of his argument and I am reassured that he has considered the points that I raised in my probing amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is a largely technical implementing clause. I have one comment to make and one question, which may have a greater impact, to ask.
<P>
I must point out a slight asymmetry, which was rehearsed in an earlier amendment, between the obligation on the Low Pay Commission to report and extending the deadline--the Minister's response to that was entirely reasonable--and the absence of tests in relation to the report which the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament. I do not think that wilful delay is intended, but I should like the Minister's assurance that reports will be tendered to Parliament as soon as is reasonably practicable to inform Members and to provide the basis for a debate, perhaps before regulations are made. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has rehearsed that argument.
<P>
It is never too late to smell a rat when one sees a minor change or wording. During a previous exchange, the Minister of State clearly thought that we had likened him to Sir Humphrey. That was not quite the case; we thought that Sir Humphrey was speaking through him and that his admirable officials had briefed him to produce a sound, unmemorable and reasonable answer.
<P>
I shall not rib the Minister on that point, but I want to discuss the slight asymmetry between the Bill and the terms of reference for the Low Pay Commission. The Committee will remember almost by heart the text of the letter from the President of the Board of Trade to the chairman of the commission. It enjoined the commission to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have regard to the wider economic and social implications; the likely effect on the level of employment and inflation; the impact on the competitiveness of business, particularly the small firms sector; and the potential impact on the costs to industry and the Exchequer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But clause 7(5) states that, in considering its recommendations the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Low Pay Commission--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) shall have regard to the effect of this Act on the economy of the United Kingdom as a whole and on competitiveness''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>To my beady and slightly cynical eye, a few lines of text appear to have dropped out of the Bill. I know that new Labour no longer believes in socialism. [Laughter.] I do not know why the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) is laughing. Such temples falling and crumbling into the dust is a serious matter.
<P>
There is no reference in the Bill to the consideration which the President--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On a point of clarification, in my role as a constituency Member, my correspondence masthead states that I am the socialist Member of Parliament for Makerfield. That will remain so.
<P>
<H5>7 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am much obliged. The Minister labours under a double persona. In the House of Commons, he vies with his colleagues in the charm offensive, but in Makerfield he tells the truth about his inner feelings.
<P>
Somewhere, the social element has dropped out of the text. There is no specific reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the level of employment and inflation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a survivor--a reference to the impact on competitiveness--but there is no reference to the small firms sector or the Exchequer. That is another one in the eye for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It may be that draftsmen have not operated to the President of the Board of Trade's text. There is a slight dissonance between the Bill and the terms-of-reference letter. Why should that be so? Having been slightly trained in the ways of Whitehall, I know that it is necessary to look for an explanation for the small differences. As Disraeli is reputed to have said when somebody's ambassador died in the night, ``I wonder why they did that.''

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thought it was Talleyrand who said that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I stand corrected by my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> You will be pleased to hear, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I want to make only one, brief point. Will the Minister explain why subsection 5(a) specifically enjoins the Low Pay Commission to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have regard to the effect of this Act on the economy of the United Kingdom as a whole and on competitiveness''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman argued earlier, most passionately, that a similar formulation in an amendment tabled to clause 3 by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry should not apply to the Secretary of State.
<P>
It seems slightly perverse for the Government to go to the trouble of prescribing that sensible injunction for the Low Pay Commission but to argue that the Secretary of State should not be able, in any circumstances, to take account of the wider economy--my hon. Friend's amendment disaggregated that into interest rates and inflation--and competitiveness. I am genuinely puzzled. If the Government think that it is useful to apply that provision to the commission, I cannot see why the Secretary of State should not also take it into account, particularly as the purpose of the clause is to give the Secretary of State the freedom to accept or reject what the commission recommends. An individual Secretary of State could well decide that the commission had taken insufficient account of the wider economy or of competitiveness, or he or she could have a different interpretation of the wider economy's needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. John P. Taylor:</B> To make a nexus between the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Ashford, would they care to comment on the fact that social policy seems to have been dropped not only from that provision but from the Department of Trade and Industry's competition policy as well, when compared with the Labour party's manifesto?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We are aware of the constantly shifting sands on which Government policy moves.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The sands are not shifting that far. If the hon. Gentleman would address clause 7, he would not be in any trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am more than happy to accede to that, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Lansley--whom I hope is not on shifting sand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Not on shifting sand at all, Mrs. Dunwoody. Subsection (5)(a) specifies a regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the economy of the United Kingdom as a whole''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why does my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford think that the Government include the words ``as a whole''? Might it be that they do not want the implications for particular regions of the United Kingdom to be isolated and identified?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is extremely likely. It has already been said that the Bill makes insufficient provision for the territorial Secies of State to be consulted, let alone the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Clearly the Government are trying to confine the Low Pay Commission to a widely aggregated measure of assessing the effect of a minimum wage on the United Kingdom as a whole.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire is right--it is highly likely that any individual level of the minimum wage recommended by the Low Pay Commission would have different effects on different regions. Given the wording of the clause, therefore, it would be difficult for the commission to make a sensible assessment. It is not clear whether it would be allowed or encouraged to say that the effect on the UK economy would be mixed and that a particular rate would have beneficial effects on London and the south-east, but damaging effects on Scotland or the north-east. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify how much freedom the commission will have to disaggregate its thoughts on the effect on the economy. Could the commission suggest that its proposed rate might have specific effects on the competitiveness of individual industries, which it might feel could be damaged?
<P>
I hope that I have shown that what looks like a relatively innocuous part of a relatively technical clause has established some incoherence in the Government's position. The Government want the commission, but not the Secretary of State, to take account of potential effects. The wording of the clause leaves many questions open as to the effectiveness of the commission's response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mrs.--Roche.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I think that it is Roche, Mrs. Dunwoody, but even I am having difficulty remembering at this time in the morning. To digress slightly, that reminds me of a philosophy interview that I had when I went to university. I was asked whether I was Miss Margolis, and I said, ``Yes.'' The interviewers said, ``Are you sure you are Miss Margolis? We have had difficulties with this before.'', and I said, ``Yes.'' They said, ``Thank you very much, Miss Margolis.'' I was later offered a place, so I clearly got it right. My digression is simply intended to show that the failure to remember a name once stood me in good stead.
<P>
Clause 7 is essentially a procedural clause. It sets out what the Low Pay Commission must do when it prepares its report and requires the Government to lay the report before Parliament. It is all about transparency and consultation.
<P>
Conservative Members are tempting me to range far and wide, but I aim to get into your good books by not doing so, Mrs. Dunwoody. This is a procedural clause, but it has been accredited with sinister motives, which are not actually there. I shall do my best to dispel that cloud of suspicion.
<P>
We have already had a constructive discussion about the power of clause 7 to set and extend the deadline for the commission's report. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Eastleigh for mentioning why it is important to have the provision, and I shall not labour the point at this time in the morning.
<P>
Of course, the commission is required to consult before reporting. That requirement is broadly framed so that all those with an interest in the matter--including industry, trade unions and other interested bodies--can be involved. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are pleased at how widely the commission has consulted and by the fact that it has made approaches to 500 organisations. We can congratulate it on the high standard of work that is has already achieved.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry quoted the letter that the Secretary of State sent to Professor Bain. I think that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it has been much quoted in the past few hours. I shall not repeat the quotation because the hon. Gentleman set out what should be taken into consideration. He then almost suggested that a difference or conflict existed between the clause and the letter. The hon. Members for Ashford and for South Cambridgeshire did likewise. However, I remind the Committee that clause 7(5)(b) states that the Low Pay Commission
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall take into account any additional factors which the Secretary of State specifies in referring the matters to them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So while clause 7(5)(a) rightly establishes the cornerstone of the United Kingdom's economic competitiveness, subsection (5)(b) permits the Low Pay Commission to take in additional factors. The clause does not have to spell out all the details, but I assure the Committee that there is no contradiction.
<P>
The clause provides flexibility for the Secretary of State to specify the additional criteria for the commission to consider. It also provides that Low Pay Commission reports must contain certain basic information. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 6, line 19, leave out `otherwise determines' and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, whether before or after the making of the report, makes a determination under subsection (3) or (4) above in relation to the referral'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: Government amendment No. 35.
<P>
No. 92, in page 7, line 3, after `a' insert `statutory'.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 36 to 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise to the Committee but I have a meeting at 8.30 am about another matter, so I hope that it will be acceptable if my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary responds to the debate that the amendments will provoke.
<P>
The Government amendments are technical changes to the Bill's fine detail, designed to simplify the clause and clarify procedures. They do not change the policy behind the clause.
<P>
The general effect of clause 8 is to give the existing, non-statutory Low Pay Commission automatic statutory status unless the Secretary of State decides otherwise. The Government amendments essentially are transitional provisions to cover the way in which the existing Low Pay Commission fits into the legislative framework.
<P>
Subsections (3) and (4) give the Secretary of State power to decide that references to the existing, non-statutory Low Pay Commission are not to be treated as though they were references to a statutory Low Pay Commission. Subsection (5) also allows the Secretary of State not to recognise reports by the non-statutory Low Pay Commission.
<P>
I shall explain the purposes of the provisions. The powers of derecognition act as a safety net. They give the Secretary of State a second option: for example, to make it clear that the existing commission was not functioning properly or that the report was seriously defective. The Secretary of State already has the option of overriding a defective report. The derecognition power provides a further option for her to make a new referral instead to a new statutory commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister clarify how a report can be defective? Does that mean defective in procedural terms? Of course, I intend no criticism of the present, non-statutory commission, but in theory it is possible that such a body could have been slipshod, incompetent and neglectful of the relevant interests. A commission could also have the defect of being politically embarrassing.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is this an intervention? If so, it is rather lengthy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is, but I have concluded it.
<P>
<H5>7.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is unlikely that those circumstances would arise. I have faith that the commission will provide us with a well-researched and focused report. However, if the commission was trying to agree a rate, for example, and, for whatever reason, it decided not to make a recommendation, the Secretary of State would have to have the capacity to deal with the matter. There is no indication that the power would be utilised per se, but we need it in the Bill to cater for such an eventuality.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 36 provide the Secretary of State with the power to decide not to recognise referrals to and reports of the non-statutory Low Pay Commission. It is clear, however, that for the derecognition power to work, it does not have to apply both to reports and to referrals. It is sufficient simply to derecognise a referral as that will automatically invalidate any subsequent reports. Amendment No. 34 removes a derecognition power in respect of reports, and amendments Nos. 35 and 36 are consequential deletions of subsequent references to that power.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 simplifies matters by removing a piece of drafting that is not necessary. It relates to a case in which the Secretary of State had made two referrals to the Low Pay Commission and derecognised one, but not the other. On such occasions, derecognition of the first referral will include, under the Bill, derecognition of the second. We have considered this further and come to the conclusion that there is no need to provide for this in the Bill. We simply need to ensure that in such a case both derecognition decisions are made. We have every confidence in our administrative ability to do this.
<P>
In the Bill, the Secretary of State decided not to recognise a referral to the non-statutory Low Pay Commission but there is no formal mechanism specifying how or by when the power should be exercised. Even though I do not imagine that this power is likely to be used, it seems important to make good this omission for the sake of good order and completeness. Amendment No. 38 therefore provides such a mechanism in new subsection (13). The Secretary of State will be required to give notice of a derecognition decision to the non-statutory Low Pay Commission and to lay a copy of that notice before both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
The amendment also requires the Secretary of State to make such a decision within 12 months of the Bill's enactment. That is desirable from a point of view of reducing uncertainty as to the status of the report by the commission.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will note our commitment to achieving transparency and proper procedures through the amendments, even though the eventualities they cover are marginal. I urge the Committee to accept these proposals.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 is in the names of the hon. Members for Eastleigh and for Weston-super-Mare. I fear that the amendment may be based on a misunderstanding of how the clause works. Clause 8(9) provides the Secretary of State with the power to appoint a Low Pay Commission. Any such body, because it has been created under the Act, would necessarily be a statutory body. There is no need in such cases to express and describe a body created by an Act as statutory. We will no doubt discuss further the role and status of the Low Pay Commission under the next group of amendments or in the stand part debate. I think that some members of the Committee will be interested in such a debate.
<P>
I do not intend to dwell on these issues in detail under this group of amendments. It is enough to say that the Secretary of State appoints a Low Pay Commission under clause 8(9) and it will automatically be a statutory body. Therefore, amendment No. 92 is unnecessary, and I ask the hon. Member for Eastleigh not to press it. If he does, I ask my hon. Friends to resist it and to support the Government amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification. On that basis I am happy not to press my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister's proposals cause me comparatively little difficulty. I was initially concerned about any changes. I am occasionally slightly concerned about some of the wording still in the text. However, in view of my earlier exchanges and the suspicion I was nurturing that there might be a means for the Secretary of State to sit on the report by derecognising it, if the decision has to be communicated to Parliament, as provided in Government amendment No. 38, that secures the element of transparency. I am therefore be prepared to give the amendment a fair wind.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 35, in page 6, line 45, leave out from ``above'' to end of line 2 on page 7.--[Mr. McCartney.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 7, line 3, leave out ``may at any time'' and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall within 12 months of this Act coming into force'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment, the meaning of which is crystal clear, draws attention to the open-ended nature of the Secretary of State's duty to make appointments to what I now know will be a statutory body--the Low Pay Commission. The amendment is probing. We cannot be sure that the Secretary of State will make appointments speedily enough to implement the national minimum wage programme or that the commission will have the powers to take it forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have some sympathy with the amendment. We are all interested in transparency and a degree of expedition in whatever body is to be permanently established. What will be the time scale? The non-statutory commission is obliged to report by the end of May--that appears to be on schedule--but when will Cinderella's pumpkin turn into a coach? When will the commission become statutory? That issue meshes in with the important decisions about when the first regulations will be laid following consideration of the conclusions by Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I hope to be able to reassure the hon. Members for Eastleigh and for Daventry. In the previous debate, I said that I appreciated the work of the Low Pay Commission--the extent to which it consulted, its enthusiasm and the fact that different interests worked in partnership. Because of that, I have sympathy with the motives underlying the amendment, as does the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
However, I must ask the hon. Member for Eastleigh to withdraw the amendment. It adds nothing to what the Secretary of State will be allowed to do. The Secretary of State will be able to set up a statutory Low Pay Commission at any time. The current commission was appointed in accordance with our twin-track approach to carry out a particular task--advising on the setting of the initial rate of the national minimum wage and connected issues.
<P>
The commission should have a continuing role and, indeed, may be reconvened to consider issues relating to the national minimum wage as required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I seek clarification. The key words are ``a continuing role''. If a statutory commission is to follow on from the original body, the key question of when we flip over to a permanent body remains. The Bill tempts us at every page, but I understand the Minister's reticence. With best intentions, we seek reassurance that the commission will become a permanent statutory body within a reasonable period. Will the Minister comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I reiterate our view that the commission should have a continuing role. It may be reconvened as required to consider any issues relating to the minimum wage--we can probably all think of situations in which that might happen. That is why, as I hope the hon. Member for Eastleigh understands, clause 8(9) gives the Secretary of State that specific power. The commission might be reconvened to consider, for example, the impact of the national minimum wage after it has been set or to advise on possible future adjustments. It could also be asked to carry out other tasks, such as research or monitoring.
<P>
I assure hon. Members that none of those instances is precluded by the Bill. Its approach depends on there being an identified need for the commission to advise or specific matters for it to deal with. The Bill does not take the prescriptive approach of requiring a statutory commission to be appointed willy-nilly. I hope that I have been able to give the hon. Member for Eastleigh the assurances that he seeks and that he will, on reflection, agree that the amendment is unnecessary. If, however, he forces it to a vote, I ask hon. Members to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's reply. I still have reservations but I believe that the Minister has responded in good faith. I know that there will be other opportunities to debate this matter, and I am therefore prepared to withdraw the amendment now. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 36, in page 7, line 15, leave out from `above,' to end of line 19.

No. 37, in page 7, line 22, leave out from `above' to end of line 23.

<P>
(b) a copy of the notice shall be laid before each House of Parliament.
<P>
 (14) No determination shall be made under subsection (3) or (4) above more than twelve months after the passing of this Act.'.--[Mrs. Roche.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall make just one comment, because we have had an interesting debate on the amendments. I have said before that I find it strange that the action clause for the statutory commission appears in the ninth subsection of the last of a clutch of four clauses. All other Bills that I have seen begin with what one proposes to do and then advert to the transitional procedures by which to get where one intends to go.
<P>
I am not trying to caricature the Minister's position, but I understand that there is a particular job for the non-statutory commission to do before it folds--I hope her drafting means that that will be painless--into whatever statutory commission she decides on, with all its decisions validated unless the Secretary of State decides otherwise and reports the matter to Parliament. That is a worthy aim, but the Minister was not precise in earlier exchanges--in fact, she was a touch coy--on the actual timetable.
<P>
Someone new to this Committee could be forgiven for assuming that there was not to be a statutory commission, because it would never be set up. I suspect that might be especially likely if the report of the non-statutory commission is not to the liking of those who influence the Government's decision making.
<P>
I should not like anyone to misinterpret the view of Conservative Members. We do not like the concept of a continuing statutory commission and we have not had a clear definition of its continuing role. It might be useful in a particular circumstance, and the Minister may want to bring it back for that, but the argument is not convincing. Although I shall not divide the Committee on the clause, as we have voted on earlier implementing clauses, the Opposition retain considerable reservations about the commission's future role.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have some reservations about the clause, which deals with records. Of course it is right that an employer should have a duty to keep records: it would be pretty difficult to enforce any legislation without that duty. However, the Engineering Employers Federation has expressed anxiety about that obligation.
<P>
The federation's unease does not stem from any partisan spirit, as in certain respects it has been positive about the Bill--it does not like it much, but it wants it to work and is willing to co-operate with the Government to that end. The federation has stated that the Bill gives unlimited powers for the Government, by regulation, to require employers to keep more records.
<P>
I am delighted that the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry is answering the debate. I hope that she is aware of the administrative and practical difficulties that the clause will cause employers. Employers already are obliged by law to keep a pay register to account for national insurance contributions and pay-as-you-earn, so will those records be sufficient for the purposes of the clause?
<P>
I realise that there might be some exceptional cases arising from unusual patterns of remuneration outside an hourly cash basis, but under normal circumstances will not employers' pay records by adequate to provide the necessary audit trail to ensure that the national minimum wage has been paid in the appropriate pay reference period to the appropriate employees?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In one sense, the clause gives the game away. It requires employers to keep records, for the purposes of the Bill, before the Low Pay Commission has completed its deliberations and made recommendations and before the Secretary of State has decided on what regulations are needed. However, it places no equivalent requirement on employees to keep records.
<P>
That may seem a silly point. I agree that, in the normal run of things, an ordinary worker who clocks on does not need to keep records. However, the Committee has discussed extensively the circumstances of piece workers and home workers. Employers will have a legal obligation to ensure compliance with minimum wage regulations. To do that, they will need access to records that show, in a precise and acceptable form, hours worked, work done and remuneration received. To be neutral and even-handed, the legislation should also give the Secretary of State powers to make regulations that require employees to keep records. Such records might include hours worked, in the case of home work, or gratuities received, should the Low Pay Commission recommend that gratuities are to be involved in the computation that will decide whether the minimum wage has been paid, and should the Secretary of State regulate accordingly.
<P>
As I said, the direction of the clause solely at employers gives the game away about the Government's thinking. I hope that the Minister will respond to the points that I have made.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall respond as gently as possible. I am never quite at my best at this time of the morning.
<P>
I noted a little difference of opinion between the hon. Member for Daventry and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. The latter appeared to think that a sinister plot was causing difficulty, whereas the hon. Member for Daventry quite rightly addressed practical issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I will not. I shall make progress.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations that require employers to keep records to enable the enforcement of the national minimum wage. I am sure that the Committee agrees that keeping records is vital to effective enforcement. That is why clause 28 makes an employer's failure to keep records if he or she is required to do so a criminal offence.
<P>
The clause is an enabling one. The House will be able to debate the regulations, which will set out detailed requirements, when they are laid before Parliament. The power involved is flexible. Clause 48(1)(a) states that regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``may make different provision for different cases''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means, for example, that the regulations could specify different record keeping requirements for different employers. Such records will, of course, include wages paid and hours worked. Their exact format will depend on the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission in relation to clause 2.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry rightly addressed the issue of what that will mean for business. I say to him and to the Committee that the matter is dealt with by the regulatory appraisal. Clearly, a balance should be struck between the need for full records and the need to minimise any burden on business. I am confident that that balance will be struck sensibly.
<P>
Most information that will be required for enforcement of the minimum wage already has to be collected by the vast majority of employers, as the hon. Member for Daventry reasonably acknowledged. Such records usually contain basic details of wages paid and hours worked.
<P>
Small and large businesses already hold the information that is likely to be required for the pay inspections of the Contributions Agency and of the Inland Revenue. With regard to records of hours worked, the regulatory appraisal sets out the findings of a multi-purpose survey of employers carried out in 1997. The majority of businesses do not expect any cost increase to be caused by regulation that requires them to keep records of hours worked. That is a helpful contribution. Only 12 per cent. of companies thought that the costs would be large. It will interest the Committee to know that those tended to be large, rather than small businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It is clearly in everyone's interest to reduce record-keeping burdens to a minimum. Will the Minister consider the case of many salaried employees whose annual salary is paid at a rate in excess of the hourly rate of the national minimum wage and would be even if they worked 24 hours a day? Under those circumstances, does the Minister anticipate that there will be a requirement to keep hourly weekly records or will records of an annual or monthly salary be sufficient?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries hard, and I must congratulate him. Even at 7.40 am he is still raising issues that I must resist. The hon. Gentleman has a small business background and will know that it is important to strike a sensible balance between keeping records for enforcement purposes and recognising and dealing with burdens on business. That is what sensible employers want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> By and large, it seems that the Government's position is reasonable, and I am not anxious to quibble with it. However, I insert one modest caveat. Given that in many cases a right is the converse of an obligation and vice versa, can the Minister envisage circumstances in which an employee might be required to keep records or perform a duty to make sure that the whole operation went smoothly?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That point is not relevant to our discussion. There may be circumstances in which employees wish to keep records for their own purposes. One could think of areas in which that is currently the case. I am a little perplexed to understand the relevance of the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have a specifically technical point, which arises from what the Minister has just said. If employees kept records and it was possible to show that they were independently verifiable, could a tribunal take them into account as evidence to determine whether the minimum wage had been paid?
<P>
<B>Mr. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point is interesting, but we are dealing with a point of evidence. Clearly, it is open to any party to a dispute to introduce such evidence as it thinks fit. Those who are adjudicating will examine it and come to the appropriate conclusion.
<P>
As a matter of good administrative practice, the Government will speak to businesses and consult with employees. The Low Pay Commission is already carrying out a comprehensive consultation exercise. Record keeping is not a matter on which the Government are required to consult the commission, but we will be happy to receive any comments that it might wish to make on the subject. I hope that the Committee will agree that that is sensible and shows that the Government are anxious to get their approach right. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
<H5>7.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> From the same stable of briefing from the Engineering Employers Federation, I have some slightly more substantive points to raise on the clause. May I say to the Under-Secretary, by way of shorthand, because I am quite sure that no one wants me to refer to the proceedings of another Committee, that it might be worth the hon. Lady taking a modest look at a similar discussion that took place in the Committee stage of the Bank of England Bill about what I then described, using a lawyerly phrase, as fishing expeditions?
<P>
I do not cavil with the provision that a worker should have right of access to records. If that right were denied, it would be difficult for a worker to establish his rights or receive a fair consideration of his case under the national minimum wage provisions. I am concerned, after the representations that have been made to me, whether that right needs some safeguard in its implementation. At a later point in the clause, I am also slightly concerned about any possible disproportion with the penalties.
<P>
Clearly, the worker should have a right of access. It is understandable, and entirely consistent with what goes on in tribunals, that the worker should have an opportunity to associate with or be supported by someone who is more sophisticated and familiar with the system and who knows what to look for. I do not regard that as unreasonable. But it would be unfortunate if the right to bring in someone was entirely unrestrained and unlimited.
<P>
I put forward a proposal from the Engineering Employers Federation for the Minister's consideration. I am not sure that the formulation is right--that is one reason for the amendments on the matter. The federation proposes that the person accompanying the worker should be a fellow worker. I presume that that would be likely to include a shop steward at the place of work. It might be more difficult to involve a trade union representative who was not a fellow worker. I am not exactly sure how that system should work, but I think that there is a wish not to broaden that right and not to poke into what were originally conceived as rather confidential records on an unlimited basis.
<P>
That brings me to the second point which is, if anything, more compelling. We had a very similar discussion when considering the Bank of England Bill in Committee. Being a lawyer, the Under-Secretary will know that there are, or should be, certain obligations of confidentiality. That applies to the worker, except in the conduct of legal proceedings. Obviously, if he or she needs documentation for a tribunal, he or she must table it in evidence. There is no problem about that. However, here should be a general duty of confidentiality on the friend of the worker who is involved. A particular employment case should not be leaked to pressure groups, for example, on a large basis, without the express consent of all the parties involved.
<P>
It is possible that some of these concerns might be addressed by the normal rules of confidentiality. Equally, it is possible that unless the matter is tied up rather tightly, employers supplying information could be at risk. The risk would not come from the worker--I am referring to the confidentiality element, not the national minimum wage element. In supplying information, it might be difficult to avoid giving other information that might be on the same piece of paper about the remuneration of third parties, who might be less than pleased if such information were given to another person. Both the employer and the worker could be involved in awkward issues about disclosures of confidence which ought to be secured.
<P>
The amendments that the Engineering Employers Federation canvassed with us are not wrecking. They are designed not to deny workers access to records or to prevent them from being accompanied by persons who may be able to help them, but to ensure that those things are done properly and not as part of a fishing expedition during which confidential information is spread to pressure groups or the newspapers.
<P>
Revelant records have to be produced within 14 days. It should be possible in normal circumstances, particularly for large and sophisticated employers with computerised payrolls, to do that. The Bill helpfully provides for extending the 14-day period, but the Minister will realise that employer-employee relations are unlikely to be good where there is potential for a spat about the minimum wage. It might be difficult to secure agreement. I have sympathy with the Engineering Employers Federation case for a maximum of 28 days, which would not make a fair hearing in an appropriate time impossible.
<P>
To foreshorten comments on clause 11, I am concerned about the penalty for failure to produce records within the given period. The sum equal to 80 times the hourly amount of the national minimum wage--in shorthand, two weeks' pay--is harsh, particularly, for example, for a small business without sophisticated records where the proprietor is ill. The matter should be for the discretion of the tribunal. I used to serve on a different sort of tribunal and we had interesting discussions about where costs were to go. A more appropriate penalty would be up to 80 hours, but the tribunal should decide after considering the circumstances of the case.
<P>
These are not wrecking amendments. They would have a softening effect and make the Bill fairer.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Roch:</B> I understand why the hon. Gentleman has raised those issues. Any worker who suspects that he or she is not being paid the national minimum wage can demand to see the relevant records. The employee must have reasonable grounds for the suspicion and give the employer written notice of the request. Procedures must be gone through.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has used the phrase ``reasonable grounds''. It will be difficult to establish whether the grounds for suspicion are reasonable without applying to a tribunal. It will be difficult for the employer to decide whether to comply--go quietly, as it were--or fight the case on the ground that the request is unreasonable in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the term ``reasonable'' has exercised the courts more than any other, but it has a precise legal meaning and has been included for a purpose. I hope that that provides the hon. Gentleman with some assurance. It cannot be for anything that is frivolous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is the hon. Lady saying, in simple English, that if the case were to go to an industrial tribunal, and the tribunal were to take the view that the employee did not have reasonable grounds for making that request, the case would be struck out? I think that that is what the hon. Lady is arguing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> If the case reaches the tribunal, and the tribunal decides that the employee's case is not reasonable, that case will clearly not succeed. A great body of industrial tribunal law exists to provide the basis for what is reasonable, and common law can be used as well.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spent some time--I do not criticise him for that as I understand the point that he was making--on the clause's provision that the employee may be accompanied by another person when inspecting the records. It is not unknown, in an employment situation, for another person to be present. The hon. Gentleman suggested that there should be restrictions on who that additional person should be--he said it should be another employee, perhaps a shop steward. Hon. Members know that there are many employment situations in which there is no trade union representation, and employees in such circumstances often consult law centres--
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> And citizens advice bureaux.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Indeed, they might consult citizens advice bureaux--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> They might also consult their Members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that. A number of constituents have consulted me about such cases, and in such circumstances they want to be able to take a friend with them who might not be a fellow employee. It is not unknown in grievance cases or disciplinary hearings for the employee to bring a friend. The internal grievance and disciplinary procedures of many companies often provide for the employee to be accompanied, so it is not an unknown practice in industry.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the 14-day period. A decision must be made about what the appropriate period should be. I believe that the 14-day period is reasonable, especially bearing in mind our earlier debate. In the great majority of cases, the records that the worker will have access to after the Bill is enacted are already easily gathered by an employee. It is important that any worker is able to check the records to see whether he or she is receiving the legal minimum wage. That might prevent cases coming before the courts unnecessarily, which can only help industrial relations and also ensure that valuable time is not wasted. It will also act as a deterrent for any employer contemplating paying his employees below the national minimum wage rate.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will agree that the clause is reasonable. I understand the issues that he has quite properly raised and I hope that I have been able to answer them. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> By way of ``explication de vote'', I shall say briefly that I am grateful to the hon. Lady for the points that she has made. We are not satisfied that the balance has yet been secured, and would like to spur her efforts further to see whether it can be. We want her to consider again the question of confidentiality--which she did not address to any great extent--and the potential risk to the employer. I intend to vote against the unamended clause.

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 99, in page 8, line 33, leave out `industrial' and insert `employment'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following Government amendments Nos. 100 to 120, 122 to 133, 136 and 150 to 152.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The amendment and those grouped with it will replace references to industrial tribunals in the Bill with references to employment tribunals. The amendments will have identical effects, and have therefore been grouped together.
<P>
The amendments are consequential on the changes that will be made by the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill, which was introduced in another place last July. That Bill will change the name of industrial tribunals to employment tribunals, except in Northern Ireland, where they will continue to be called industrial tribunals. That is to avoid confusion with fair employment tribunals, which operate there. The reform is eminently sensible and I am sure that it will be accepted by both sides of the Committee.
<P>
During our consultations on the Bill, it was almost universally agreed that such a change of name was desirable to reflect the changed role of industrial tribunals. The change was also accepted in another place. The amendments are purely consequential on the change that will be introduced by the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill. The amendments are purely technical, and the reform is essential to ensure consistency in our legislation. I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendments, though numerous, were charmingly and reasonably explained by the Minister, and we have no difficulty with them. However, I should give notice of the fact that we have some difficulty with the penalties in the clause, which may cause us to take a rather more jaundiced view of the clause as a whole.

Clause 11, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Employer to provide worker with national minimum wage statement</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 155, in page 9, line 14, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who is not an employee'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 156 and 157.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The amendment will put right a discrepancy between clause 12 of the Bill and section 8 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, both of which concern pay statements. Clause 12 gives the Secretary of State the power to require employers to provide workers who are not employees with a national minimum wage statement.
<P>
The Employment Rights Act and its Northern Ireland equivalent already enable the Secretary of State to require such statements to be given to employees. The Secretary of State can, by order, add to the information that must be shown on the itemised pay statement that employees are entitled to receive under section 8 of that Act.
<P>
There is a vital difference between the two powers. The power under the Bill allows the regulations to apply differently to different cases or for different descriptions of persons, whereas the existing power under the Employment Rights Act does not. That flexibility is important. Although we have not yet taken detailed decisions over national minimum wage statements on pay slips, we want to leave our options open. The Government may, for example, want to apply the regulations differently to different sorts of firms. That would not be possible without the amendment, as the earlier Act does not allow for such flexibility.
<P>
The amendments achieve that result by extending the regulation-making powers under the Bill to cover employees as well as workers who are not employees. Employers will be required to give the national minimum wage statement to their employees by regulations made under the clause, rather than by an addition to the particulars that must be included in their employees' itemised pay statement.
<P>
I assure the Committee that the burden of the requirement is kept to a minimum by amendment No. 157, which will ensure that the employer can include the national minimum wage statement in the employer's itemised pay statements. That is a helpful and common-sense way in which to deal with the matter, so I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The time is coming for plain English, and I simply want to make sure, by testing it across the Committee with the Minister, that I have understood what is happening.
<P>
As I understand it, the clause is not difficult or contentious, or one on which I have received representations. It simply says that an employee, or somebody who is equivalent to an employee but is not an employee--that is the substance of the Minister's amendment--would normally expect to receive a pay slip and has a right to receive one, on whatever basis he is paid--and when he is paid he receives a payslip, which may include a cross-reference to the national minimum wage, from which he can work out whether he is being paid at that rate. Clearly, if the employer or, for some reason, the employee does not require the information, there is no obligation to supply it. If the hon. Lady can confirm that that is all that is going on, I have no difficulty with either the clause or the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he seeks. The essential aim of the amendment is to put right a discrepancy between the Bill and earlier legislation. It also aims to provide flexibility, which is in the employer's interest as much as in the employee's. It gives a flexibility which allows different regulations to deal with different situations and different descriptions of people. I believe that it will enhance the Bill and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends can support it.

Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appointment of Officers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 9, line 41, leave out `if so required'.
<P>
As will be apparent, the amendment is intended to bring the clause into line with current practice. Many hon. Members will be familiar with the fact that most officers or officials representing councils, utility companies and a range of organisations with which the public have day-to-day contact invariably wear, at the very least, a name badge saying who they are and what role they fulfil. I do not believe that it is sufficient for the clause to revert to a Whitehall, civil service caricature of ``Let's not make it clear that we want to disclose who we are unless we have to''.
<P>
Given the sensitivity of the officers' tasks, I should have thought that it would be right and proper to place an automatic obligation on them to display their role and position. That is why I ask the Minister to consider more carefully the indication that the clause would give and to think seriously about incorporating my amendment.
<P>
<H5>8.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The clause provides for the Secretary of State to be able to appoint officers to ensure that the objectives of the Bill are secured and to carry out investigations. It is not self-evidently absurd to say that the Secretary of State clearly should not appoint more persons than strictly necessary, at greater cost than necessary.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will have read the reference in the financial memorandum to expenditure on enforcement. I am delighted to read, on the plus side, that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government will seek the most cost-effective means of enforcement consistent with effective implementation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not have put it better myself. On the other hand, it is conspicuous, and not for the first time in the Bill, that the memorandum also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Operational details as to who enforces the National Minimum Wage have yet to be decided.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that is important. Perhaps the Under-Secretary might give us a little more of a steer on that than she has offered on other clauses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh made a good point about how officers should conduct and identify themselves. They will have sensitive tasks, but it is not unusual to be in that position. Others carry out similar demanding under-cover tasks for, say, Customs and Excise or the Revenue. As far as is humanly possible, those people should be able to identify themselves when challenged and there should be a good reason if they are unable to produce or sport an ID of some sort. That is not to say that we want them all to have a red rosette saying, ``Look out for me, I'm the man who makes you pay the minimum wage.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Or a red rose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Anyone who goes back as far as my mother--who has not previously featured in this Committee--will know that the red rosette was a Tory colour in her native county of Worcestershire.
<P>
We need a sensible, cost-effective enforcement structure and an accountable enforcement team. We want to use existing officers and personnel where it is sensible to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I will give way in a moment. First, I have one example of what I think is appropriate. Given that an agricultural wages board exists and that the number of people available to do that sort of work is necessarily and properly limited, it would be daft if the inspectorate of that board could not also carry out national minimum wage appraisals in agriculture. I do not suggest that people should not be trained to a common standard, and there is a question of which Department they should come under, but it would be absurd to have two sets of people doing the same work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> In the name of saving public money, might it be necessary to undertake a market test or competitive tender to secure the best possible value for money?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Consistent with the quality and security of the service, that would be entirely appropriate. Perhaps the Under-Secretary would comment on that point.
<P>
I need say little more. The Under-Secretary has made the reasonable point that regulations need to be enforced sensibly and sensitively. I look forward to her response to my points.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I seek your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody, as it seems to me that our exchanges have gone somewhat wider than the amendment and almost into clause stand part. Perhaps we can conflate the two.
<P>
I understand the concern that prompted the hon. Member for Eastleigh to table his amendment. However, I believe that it would put the enforcement officer in an unnecessarily awkward position. In practice, if an officer failed on any occasion to produce an identity card, an employer could subsequently claim that he did not know that that officer was an enforcement officer. All sorts of unhelpful situations in which that excuse might be used can be envisaged. Unfair treatment could be claimed when that claim is not warranted.
<P>
It is unnecessary to be so prescriptive. The provision as it stands makes it perfectly clear that the officer must produce identification if requested. It has now become common practice in such situations for people in authority to produce identification or authentication to identify themselves. We are all familiar with that from experience in our everyday and working lives. I am not aware of anyone presenting any difficulties about that. Although I understand why he has raised the matter, if the hon. Member for Eastleigh does not withdraw his amendment I shall invite the Committee to reject it. A substantial case for the amendment has not been made; it leads to bad law if we gold plate legislation when that is not required.
<P>
The clause is about the appointment and engagement of services of officers from another department or agency to act as enforcement officers for the national minimum wage. The hon. Member for Daventry rightly said that there must be enforcement, and that therefore proper procedures are necessary.
<P>
Our aim is to ensure that we have the pieces available to put together an effective enforcement mechanism. We shall put in place a balance of mechanisms covering self-enforcement, individual enforcement and enforcement by an agency. I emphasise that we do not see the need for a vast new inspectorate. The Bill gives the power to ask existing inspectors to enforce the national minimum wage. The clause is clear and precise and enables the implementation of the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has said that the inspectorate will be made up from a number of sources using, wherever possible, existing officials. Will she give the assurance that careful attention will be paid to initial training and to the exchange of information? Will careful attention also be paid to the collegiate nature of the inspectorate and its officials' links with other activities, so that no clashes of interest arise and so that matters are dealt with not only cost-effectively, but as sensitively and in as reasonably even a manner as is humanly possible? I think that she would accept that there are potential dangers in what she is setting out to do, even if it is the right thing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's last point about potential dangers. Of course we will ensure that matters are handled sensitively. As he is reasonable, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we want to get this right. We want to ensure that it works, and that it does so as effectively as possible. I hope that I have given him the assurance that he seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I should like to draw the hon. Lady back to the amendment under discussion. Will she clarify the meaning behind the words that I believe she used a few moments ago, which worried me? I might even go as far as to say that they alarmed me. I believe that she said that there could be cases in which inspectors would be embarrassed to reveal their identity. Perhaps I misunderstood her, and I seek clarification. I want to be clear that there is no intention of inspectors operating in a covert way. Transparency should be the order of the day.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman an asbolute assurance on that. The expression I used related to an enforcement officer put in an awkward situation. There is no suggestion of anything under-cover. However, if the amendment was passed, it would add an unhelpful prescriptive element to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the same vein, will the hon. Lady assure me that information obtained in one capacity by an inspector--say in the inspection of records for national minimum wage purposes--could not be misapplied by that inspector or transferred to the enforcement of his other duties, whatever they might be? For example, if an inspector has the power to inspect records, he should not be able to use that power to incriminate someone on another matter, such as tax.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is precedent in that area. We will produce detailed regulations and the House will then have an opportunity to debate such points more thoroughly.
<P>
I hope that I have convinced the hon. Member for Eastleigh to withdraw his amendment. If not, I ask the Committee to reject it and I commend the clause.

<H4><center>Powers of Officers</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In a sense, we have had the head of this discussion on the previous clause. We have already had some flurries on the powers of officers. I merely seek assurances that those powers will be used reasonably and where relevant and not as part of a general search for criminality without specific purpose. Will the officers be ready, if challenged, to produce evidence of identity to justify their reasons for seeking records? The word ``reasonable'' is in the Bill, which encourages me as it suggests that the powers are not disproportionate. There are also proper safeguards relating to self-incrimination or incrimination of a spouse. People may live close to the wind in several ways, but that is no reason to deny them justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> By intervening, I can perhaps avoid having to seek clarification directly from the Under-Secretary. Does my hon. Friend know whether the definition of a person's spouse in subsection (2) is the definition in everyday use, or the definition in the revised code of ministerial conduct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is perhaps a point for a member of the Government. In matters of ministerial procedure, the word spouse appears to have a meaning somewhat wider than its previous connotation. It may--who knows?--even come to embrace a diary secretary.
<P>
<H5>8.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
From my perusal of the clause, I think that the Government seek to introduce these powers in a sensible way with safeguards. The Minister may like to comment, however, on one point. I am not absolutely sure that there is an adequate delay mechanism in respect of some of the powers. This point ties back to clause 9, as people may have up to two weeks to furnish records.
<P>
Let us consider the case in which someone turns up on the doorstep of a not particularly sophisticated employer who does not spend his life having run-ins with the law and does not know much about the national minimum wage, but thinks in good faith that he is complying with it. It is important that such a person should be able to have quick access to advice rather than being caught in a smash-and-grab raid or, as it were, pinned against the wall.
<P>
There may be cases in which gross criminality is involved for other reasons. There may be reasons for more direct executive action. However, to be consistent with what the Minister has said previously, we need real sensitivity in enforcement of the legislation. Clearly, this is a matter of the rights of the individual as even those suspected of acting outside the law have rights. However, it is also to do with the credibility of the Bill. If under such complex and difficult legislation as this, an unsophisticated employer comes up against an insensitive inspector, such a case could do more damage to the law's credibility in the Dog and Duck--or wherever small employers gather--than almost anything else. I know that the Under-Secretary cannot assure me that this will never go wrong, but she could indicate her sensitivity to these concerns. That would be consistent with what she has sought to do in relation to compliance costs for small businesses, and it would be helpful.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be convenient to suspend the Committee at this moment and to reassemble at 9.15 am.
