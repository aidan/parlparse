<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I wish to inform the Committee that the selection list that sets out the amendments to schedules 4 and 5 is the correct list. It is available in the Room and I hope that right hon. and hon. Members all have a copy.
<H4><center>Clause 87</center></H4>
<H4><center>Housing benefit</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> Last week, we began to discuss the implications of the changes from housing benefit to supportive housing grant. The clause facilitates the introduction of the supporting people policy in April 2003. As I have explained, clause 86 introduces a new grant that will be dedicated to funding low-intensity support services for vulnerable people in the community. There will no longer be a jumble of overlapping and confused funding streams. Clause 87 sets out what housing benefit will fund and what services the supporting people grant will fund.
<P>
We are aware of people's worries about change, particularly about adjustments to benefits. In the lead-up to the new grant, the transitional housing benefit scheme, which came into effect on 1 April this year, will enable us to establish the amount of housing benefit spent on support charges. It will help to inform the amount to be transferred to the new grant. It will also give us information on the different types of support that are eligible for housing benefit at present and the extent to which housing benefit is funding that support. That will enable us to make adjustments at the margins.
<P>
When the Government were faced with the change following a court ruling in July 1997, which had been rumbling along for some considerable time, we were aware of the vulnerability of many of the people to whom the grant and policy relate. They are some of the most vulnerable in our community and that is precisely why we decided that there should be a long period of transition, so that the new grant is introduced in a way and at a level that does not put them at risk. The clause provides the flexibility to enable housing benefit to continue to meet some support charges if, on balance, that is considered appropriate. For example, it could continue to cover service charges for help with cleaning but, more importantly, it provides the flexibility for how the supporting people policy will be implemented by allowing for phased implementation, should that be considered appropriate. Phased implementation is the subject of a consultation paper that has been distributed to local authorities and housing and support providers, whether in the voluntary, the public or the private sector.
<P>
For completeness, the calculation of housing costs in income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance and child support is based on the housing benefit service charge provisions. Any changes to the housing benefit rules under clause 87 will affect those provisions, too. Expenditure on support service charges in income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance will therefore similarly transfer to the supporting people grant from April 2003. We will continue to work closely with local authorities and service providers to develop an effective strategy to facilitate the smooth implementation of the policy of supporting people. I therefore propose that clause 87 stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I shall try to keep my remarks fairly brief. The Minister has helpfully set out some of the background to the provision. Indeed, some points overlap with those made by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), among others, at the previous sitting. I endorse a great deal of what he said in the context of clause 86.
<P>
As we have heard, clause 87 provides for housing benefit payments to be made solely in respect of so-called bricks and mortar costs, with support services funded out of a separate pot, to be distributed as a grant to local authorities. The notion is that that will give local authorities a measure of discretion over the way in which such services are provided.
<P>
It is fair to say that local authorities have generally welcomed the plan, although not everyone has. Some concern has been expressed—I think that the Minister touched on this—that the level of funding supplied under the new arrangements is not guaranteed in the same way as housing benefit payments. When the Bill was first published, the Local Government Association's briefing stated that it had ``reservations'' about the replacement of support via housing benefit with a new cash-limited grant. It is important to ensure that the new arrangements do not result in an overall drop in the level of service provision.
<P>
It is right to record the concerns expressed by various organisations. For example, the briefing on the Bill by MIND—the National Association for Mental Health—and Mencap says that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recognise housing support as one of the fundamental building blocks of community care.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They go on to express their concerns about the provision:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no requirement in the Bill for the Secretary of State to consult with any interested parties before making changes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that the Minister mentioned at least an intention of continuing to consult such organisations. MIND and Mencap also say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is vitally important that the relevant voluntary sector agencies are able to contribute their expertise so that future grants are set at a realistic funding level.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be interesting to hear the Minister's comments on that.
<P>
The briefing also talks about the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the statutory requirement in that legislation—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to consult on the preparation of draft codes of practice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
MIND and Mencap would have liked a similar provision to be included in this Bill.
<P>
Mencap in particular believes that there is a case for expanding funding generally and,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would not wish to see a Government shift from means testing to charging as a means of cost sharing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, an undertaking from the Minister would be helpful. Mencap also says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Government needs to make clear how individuals will be assessed for the support they need . . . Mencap is pleased that decisions will be made on a local level in response to local need, but care needs to be taken to ensure that this will not result in wide variations in terms of scale and quality of provision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It repeats the request for a commitment from the Government that existing provision will be maintained. It also asks them to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>clarify the link between support services and direct payments for community care service users.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are legitimate concerns. The Minister has touched on one or two of them, but others need to be allayed.
<P>
I will not detain the Committee by referring to the concerns expressed by organisations such as the Chartered Institute of Housing, Age Concern and others, which are set out conveniently in the Library brief on this part of the Bill. I will not seek to divide the Committee on the provision, but some issues require clarification by Ministers.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman ask those questions, because they are all questions that I have asked about the housing benefit system. That has been one of our problems. The system was ruled unlawful by the courts, because it produced wide variations in the interpretation of the housing benefit rules. It has been impossible to identify the amount currently spent on supporting people through housing benefit.
<P>
We took more than 18 months simply to introduce the long transitional period of three years in which we will sort out the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised. We consulted widely and took into account the responses to the consultation before introducing the transitional scheme, because Ministers are aware that the most vulnerable people in our society are affected. We must meet their needs with actions that do not add to their vulnerability.
<P>
Last week, I said that supporting people would not mean cutting costs. However, we do not know how much is spent and the link between expenditure and quality has never been assessed or monitored. I cannot give the Committee a precise commitment for growth in the period covered by the next spending review, but I can guarantee that the total budget for supporting people will at least equal the amount allocated in the year before the scheme was introduced to the budgets that are being replaced.
<P>
Local authorities will decide how to allocate funding, but the Government will encourage them to maintain the continuity of funding for services while the new scheme beds down. In England, we intend to attach conditions to the grant to ensure that moneys are targeted at support services for vulnerable people and that supporting people money does not seep into other local authority spending priorities. The budget will be ring-fenced to provide support to individuals who need it.
<P>
Means testing and charging plans will be part of a consultation paper to be published in July. We will consider them as ways of targeting resources. Last week, I said that I would table an amendment on Report to build consultation into the Bill and continue the extensive consultation that is taking place. I am convinced that the input of practitioners in the sector is vital to the policy's success.
<P>
We adopt such an approach because we know that the subject is not clear-cut and that it involves special vulnerabilities. I cannot guarantee that, in the long term, all services will be funded in the same way as now. Provision may change in some areas to match the best practice in other areas, when that becomes clear. I am sure that hon. Members support such a process of continually identifying, supporting and expecting best practice.
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: Government amendments Nos. 330, 331, 590 and 329.
<P>
Government new clause 17—Repeal of prohibition of promotion of homosexuality.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Again, it will not surprise members of the Committee that we oppose clause 91. The Government are committed to repealing section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986 and we will not be diverted from that by a half-hearted attempt to address just one of that section's many deficiencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Could the Minister confirm that that commitment did not appear in the Labour manifesto before the general election?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It appeared in our 1992 manifesto. The Labour party made clear that it had not changed its position and we included in our previous manifesto a general commitment to pursuing equality across the board, which includes equality for people with different sexual orientations,
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): Will the Minister give way? She used expression ``equality across the board''. I am anxious to know what she means by that. Does she believe in gay marriage, for example? Would that be part of such equality? If she uses such an expression, she must expect to be challenged to define it.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am talking about equality of opportunity. In a tolerant society, we should uphold the rights of all people, wherever they come from and whatever their gender, the colour of their skin, their level of ability or disability and their sexual orientation. I am surprised by the right hon. Gentleman; I held him in higher esteem. I did not think that he would try to make mischief, as he has done this morning, We are trying to ensure that we do not raise the temperature in the way that he is doing. We consider section 2A in the same way that he considered it when it was first introduced; he was very uncomfortable with it. He knows that it has led to far too many young people feeling that they cannot talk about the subjects that they need to talk about to sort out who they are, what they are about and what is happening to them in the world. I have no view about what is right or wrong in terms of how we behave. I have a view about young people being able to sort out their own ideas in a supported environment in which they are not subject or vulnerable to bullying because they are unsure about themselves. This is what the measure is about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am sorry to intervene again, but I object to what the right hon. Lady said. As she said, I have a liberal record on such issues, but she cannot make a statement of moral purpose and assume that that precludes debate. That is simply not reasonable. When she uses an expression such as ``equality across the board'' and is asked what that means, one deserves an answer—no matter whether one is liberal or illiberal on the matter. I have not made up my mind about how I will vote on the measure. I hope that the Minister will not influence me in an opposite direction to my inclinations.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was not making a statement of moral purpose when I was talking about equality. I was talking about equality of opportunity for everyone in our society so that, whoever they are, they are given respect and develop respect for themselves as they grow up. We talk in the manifesto about seeking equality of opportunity for everyone; we are talking not about morals, but respect for individual rights and opportunities.
<P>
I am sorry if I upset the right hon. Gentleman. He knows well that nothing of which he was talking was—or ever has been—in our manifesto. We are seeking a society that possesses sufficient levels of tolerance to enable young people to grow up respectful one of another. This week, in particular, we should want to encourage behaviour that respects other people, whatever their background.
<P>
Amendment No. 328 removes clause 91. New clause 17, and the related consequential amendments Nos. 329, 330, 331 and 590, make good our commitment and repeal section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986, more infamously known as section 28. The repeal is part of a package of measures, including new guidance from the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to schools on sex and relationships, education and related amendments to the Learning and Skills Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Will the Minister confirm that her right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment said that schools will be statutorily required to have regard to the guidance to which she has referred.
<P>
<B>Ms. Armstrong:</B> I am not sure to which words of my right hon. Friend the hon. Gentleman is referring, but he should know that the Learning and Skills Bill has been amended. I hope that it will help if I go through those amendments and confirm what my right hon. Friend was saying.
<P>
Together, the measures place the responsibility for sex and relationships education firmly on teachers and school governors and make clear that local education authorities have no power to determine sex education in schools. The amendments put in place a requirement that schools should be statutorily obliged to have regard to the guidance, and require that pupils should be taught about the nature and importance of marriage for family life and the bringing up of children. They protect children from inappropriate teaching and materials, including that produced by NHS bodies, who in future will be required to have regard to the Secretary of State's guidance on the material that they produce for schools' sex education lessons and reaffirm the rights of parents to withdraw their children from sex education.
<P>
These measures directly address the concerns that have been expressed about sex education in schools. With those safeguards in place, the repeal of section 2A can have no effect on what is taught in schools and I do not believe that a rational argument can now be made for its retention. The repeal will remove discriminatory and confusing legislation from the statute book.
<P>
Much more could be said about the matter, but if we are rational and straightforward, we shall simply repeal that legislation quickly and quietly. People have suffered far too much fear and intimidation, for which the House cannot easily be forgiven. We have raised the temperature in respect of what the measure means in ways that are disgraceful, because it is not and cannot be true that what has been envisaged would be possible following the repeal. The repeal should be straightforward. I hope that the Committee will deal with it with a little more dignity and respect for human beings than has so far been evident in too many debates on the matter in the House.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 328 was not selected, so we are debating clause 91 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister has many endearing qualities, but one of her less endearing qualities is her habit of trying to patronise her way out of difficult circumstances, If anyone is trying to raise the temperature today, it is the right hon. Lady. Her remarks about what she thought that my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) might think were nothing short of disgraceful. The provision and our attitude towards it have nothing to do with and have never had anything to do with intolerance, bigotry or prejudice. It was this Government who, in that superficial new Labour way, thought that it would be clever to tack the provision on to the end of an extremely important Bill, that would affect local government, much of it for the worse. It is perhaps a comment on the partial success of the Government in achieving that aim that the Strangers Gallery, if not full to overflowing today, certainly has a much higher attendance than it has been used to during the rest of the Committee stage of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> They are officials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I shall not ask those who are officials to raise their hands, but perhaps it is even more depressing if even more officials are present today. However, I shall abandon that—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Comments about the Strangers Gallery should not continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Yet again, the Government have fallen flat on their face. They thought that this would be an all-win provision that would detract public and press attention from the important provisions of the Bill and win them points with the gay and lesbian community, whereas I know that many members of that community feel patronised by the proposal. It has upset almost everyone involved, including parents and religious leaders. One only has to look at the furore in Scotland to see that, yet again, the Government and the Minister are the masters of the law of unintended consequences. Yet again, a Bill with some good bits and some not so good bits has the Government heading for a confrontation with the Lords, who are likely to remove the new clause again if, as I fear today, the Government manage to put it back in. As we all know, the Bill was introduced in the Lords, so the Government cannot use the Parliament Act to force their will on Parliament.
<P>
The Conservative stance on section 28 has never altered during the controversy and is supported by the majority of people. [Interruption.] I will not be barracked by the Minister from a sedentary position. If she wants to intervene or answer my points for once in her reply, she is welcome to do so.
<P>
The majority of people support our stance on the provision. In a recent poll, 71 per cent. of the Prime Minister's constituents said that they wanted to keep section 28, of which 63 per cent. were Labour voters. Religious leaders across the board, including Christian leaders and others, such as the Chief Rabbi, have all lined up to oppose the policy. It is the Conservative party in Parliament that is providing the leadership for a large coalition of majority opinion in the country.
<P>
Of course, we are prepared to listen to Government suggestions to improve section 28 to make it more effective, but those have never been forthcoming because it has a totemic significance for Ministers. Section 28 is a commonsense approach, which prevents the abuse of taxpayers' money and provides parents with the guarantees that they want for what is and is not taught in the classroom. It is interesting that we have heard about guidelines only since such a mass of opposition welled up against the Government's original proposals. A new urgency has taken hold of Ministers over the question of guidelines.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman remember that his Government put out guidance and made it absolutely clear that section 28 did not apply to schools?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We can swap stories about guidance until we are blue in the face, but the reality is that the Government's media thrust on the issue has changed by 180 degrees since they realised that they were well out of step with public opinion, both north and south of the border. Now all that we hear about is new guidance.
<P>
The plain fact is that parents and religious leaders do not want children to be taught homosexuality in schools. If the Government overturn the Lords amendments today, we will table further amendments on Report. Conservatives will stand up for Britain's mainstream majority in the face of Labour's politically correct, liberal elite attitudes.
<P>
I will sketch in some of the history because the issue is one that sometimes—on both sides, I concede—gets lost in the mists of time and people's recollections, which are occasionally entirely erroneous. I recommend that members of the Committee read the debates of 1987. The measure began as a Back-Bench amendment that was later taken up by the Government. When the hapless members of the Standing Committee debated the matter 13 years ago, there was not even a vote on it. Opposition Members in the Labour party felt so strongly that they did not even press the matter to a Division. Attitudes have changed, have they not? Much of the controversy over the section is really ex post facto. For example, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) commended the first part of section 28, and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that is a proper statement on what should be the role of local authorities.—[Official Report, 15 December 1987; Vol. 124, c. 990.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The same hon. Gentleman, not known for his illiberal attitudes in such matters, proposed ``commend'' as an alternative to ``promote''—a word that has caused great argument. It would be interesting to know how the legislation would have worked with that amendment.
<P>
The Minister at the time, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), made the intention behind the provision clear when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I recognise that there may be a need for teachers to touch on the subject of homosexuality in the classroom<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>objective discussion of homosexuality in the classroom . . . would be perfectly proper, because it is not promotion of homosexuality.—[Official Report, 15 December 1987; Vol. 124, c. 1019.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have established—despite the Minister answering a different question from the one that I put to her—that the provision did not feature in the Labour manifesto for the previous election. The Government did not get itself elected in part on a commitment to abolish section 28.
<P>
The Minister has talked about individual rights but, as she must know and as my right hon. and learned Friend said in 1987, the measure has nothing, and has never had anything, to do with the behaviour of individuals. It would be absurd to paint it in that light.
<P>
Bullying seems to have slipped down the list of reasons given for the Government's policy, which is hardly surprising. We have heard from the chief inspector of schools and the Department for Education and Employment that there is no evidence that that problem is linked to the measure. I wrote to secondary school heads in my constituency. I can quote from a letter from Mr. Peter Barton, who, as well as being head teacher of the Causeway school in Eastbourne, is chair of the Eastbourne area education partnership. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jointly, we can say to you that bullying goes on in every school and, whatever its causes, Eastbourne Schools, in common with other institutions, are not prepared to accept it . . . however, we do work hard through social and moral education to eradicate prejudice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Two points come through from that letter and other representations that I have received. One is that bullying exists, has many causes and is wrong, whatever its cause. Any teacher who does not take steps to stamp it out does not deserve to be in the profession. Any lingering concerns about a bully would be tackled by their Lordships' amendment, which is incorporated into the clause. The second point is that schools have no problem in seeking ``to eradicate prejudice'' within the current legislation. There is no proven case to suggest that teachers are caused difficulties by section 28 in talking about homosexuality and prejudice.
<P>
We have not heard much about the legal arguments today. I shall touch on them briefly, but we shall inevitably do so again in a substantial debate on the Floor of the House in due course. We do not accept the notion that schools are simply not covered. That is a relatively late argument—a tidying-up exercise by the Government.
<P>
We have not heard whether the provisions are contrary to the terms of the European convention on human right. I make no criticism as it is clearly a complex issue and we touched on it on Second Reading. I have seen various legal opinions on the subject. Ministers have said in a written answer and, I think, on Second Reading, that the Government have taken legal advice, and that it is not available to the Committee, as is the usual practice. To be charitable, legal opinion is divided—when was it ever not? However, there is at least a case to be made the other way. Parents might have a case to make under the convention if the Government have their way.
<P>
The provision has managed to upset almost everyone, for the sake of gesture politics. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that there can be no rational argument against what the Government propose, That is the last refuge of a Minister who is running out of either arguments or briefings.
<P>
Another issue raised from time to time is that section 28, or 2A, is a dead letter because there have never been any prosecutions. Different arguments have been made. Mr. Peter Tatchell assures us that there are at least 35 documented instances in which people have not been able to do things that they intended to do due to the law. One could say that it has been an effective provision and that is why there have been no prosecutions. One could make the opposite case; the argument is double edged.
<P>
In the practical world, many teachers and governors feel that they are in some way governed by the provisions. As the Prime Minister famously conceded in the House of Commons, he seemed to be under the impression that the provision affected teaching in schools in a certain way, but the Minister has suggested that it is not affected in that way.
<P>
We have all followed the controversy over the border in Scotland. [Interruption.] I am sorry that Ministers are discouraged, but the issue is the same,
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was simply saying that it is a devolved matter and normally the House leaves devolved matters to the relevant bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Perhaps the right hon. Lady will then explain, without pursuing the matter too far, why Scottish Members of Parliament will vote on whether hunting with dogs should continue in England and Wales? The Government are hopelessly confused on devolution. [Interruption.] That intervention was a textbook example of the Government's approach. They think, ``That is a good idea; it is an eye-catching notion that will get us a few votes and some points in the opinion polls. Let's shove it in the legislation.'' The hapless civil servants do their best to talk Ministers out of it, but the result is an enormous mess, north and south of the border. The same applies to the broader devolution issues; it is monstrous that on this issue, and on roads, hospitals, schools and almost everything else, Scottish Members of this House can vote on issues that affect my constituents, but I have no say in what happens north of the border.
<P>
I do not suggest how business should be conducted north of the border. There was a ``Keep the Clause'' campaign; enormous numbers of Scots people voted in a referendum, and we know the attitude of Church leaders, both north and south of the border. If the Minister can think of a Church leader either side of the border who is in favour of the Government's proposals, I should be happy for her to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I believe that the Bishop of Bath and Wells would meet the hon. Gentleman's requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that suggestion. A further compromise on the guidance has emerged in Scotland, although for certain purposes all such matters are devolved. Will the Government replicate that guidance in England and Wales?
<P>
We cannot just wish Scotland away as if it did not exist. People in Scotland are British, as well as being our closest neighbours. Ministers have the bizarre notion that people's attitudes are different across the border. I wonder if the Minister will disavow the quotes from a senior Labour adviser in The Times on 31 May who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are facing what are essentially different problems north and south of the border. In Scotland it is much more to do with public opinion, while in England this would have been law long ago if it hadn't been for Tory peers kicking up.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that really the attitude of Ministers and their advisers? If so, it shows more graphically than any recent incident how wholly out of touch they are with the British people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): Does my hon. Friend agree that that is precisely the reason why the Prime Minister was slow handclapped when he met the Women's Institute?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> There is some force in what my hon. Friend says. If the quotation in The Times really represents Government thinking, they are in serious trouble. They are run by a liberal elite who are out of touch with the British people and with a substantial number of Labour Back Benchers. Have the Government finally decided, in their flip-flopping backwards and forwards, whether they will whip their Members to vote for the proposal or give them a free vote?

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Given the hon. Gentleman's anxiety about a liberal e´lite, would he prefer the country to be run by an illiberal e´lite?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That sounds like an A-level examination question. As a good, meritocratic grammar-school boy, I do not believe in e´lites, even though I went to what the Chancellor thinks of as an e´litist university.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Why did the hon. Gentleman join the Tory party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> In a wonderful own goal of which she is mistress, the right hon. Lady asks me why I joined the Tory party. It was precisely because the Tory party these days speaks up for the concerns of—[Interruption.] No, it was the Minister who, in a different context, went on about the squirearchy and other nonsense. She has a fairy tale notion of the real world. The fact remains that the Tory party represents the views of middle Britain and ordinary folk up and down the country who simply cannot understand the Government's priorities. We already have spent and will continue to spend ages debating section 28 and we are going to spend ages debating foxhunting, but ordinary people want us to debate education, the NHS, pensions and so forth.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Their Lordships are much more in tune with the Women's Institute, and indeed with the great majority of public opinion out in the country. The changes to the Bill were made not just by Tory Peers, but by Cross-Benchers and even some Labour Peers. We will vote against the proposals today. If, as seems likely, we are defeated, we shall return to the issue on Report and, if we are defeated again, we hope that their Lordships will hold the line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) says that we are going to debate section 28—he means section 2A—for ages, when we could be debating other issues. There is no need for a lengthy debate on this matter. The Liberal Democrat position is clear. Our manifesto at the election said that we were opposed to section 28 and we have explained why on many occasions.
<P>
We oppose section 28 for three reasons. First, it is irrelevant because the world has moved on; the role of the LEA has changed; and regulations already give the power to individual schools to take decisions about sex education in consultation with governors and parents. Secondly, despite what the hon. Gentleman said, there is sufficient evidence to cause concern that, if section 28 were not repealed, it would make it difficult for teachers to cope with homophobic bullying. The hon. Gentleman said that there was no evidence that that was a problem, but my noble Friend the Lord Tope undertook research on the subject, which convincingly showed that the problem was real. Evidence from my own experience also confirms the point. Thirdly, the continued existence of section 28 has led some people in our community to feel discriminated against. My party is fundamentally opposed to discrimination. Those are the three clear reasons why we want the repeal of section 28.
<P>
Many people have misunderstood the nature of the problem. A good example comes straight from the speech of the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Hansard will show whether I am correct, but I believe that he said that many people object to children being taught homosexuality. Homosexuality cannot be taught; it is simply impossible to do so. Talking about ``promoting homosexuality'' as if people systematically set out to persuade others to become homosexual is misleading; it is simply impossible to do so.
<P>
It is important to debate what replaces section 28; to ensure that clear guidelines are issued to schools; and to debate what should be included in that guidance. All sections of the community support the draft guidance that the Secretary of State for Education and Employment produced. I asked the Minister to confirm that individual schools must have regard to that guidance and she made it clear that it will be statutory.
<P>
For the three reasons that I gave, it is right and proper to remove section 28 and to produce an effective replacement. The amendments would achieve that. As I said, the Liberal Democrats gave a clear manifesto commitment to repeal section 28 and we shall support the Government on that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Liberal Democrat manifesto, unlike the Labour manifesto, was perfectly clear about section 28, which should be acknowledged. The hon. Member for Bath spoke about the need for guidance to replace section 28, yet earlier argued that there was no problem for it to address. With what ``problem'' will the guidance that replaces section 28 deal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> In the past three months, there has been a detailed debate throughout the country about the nature of sex education guidance in schools, involving church groups, people responsible for the delivery of sex education in schools, parents, governors, head teachers and many others. The hon. Member for Eastbourne, who clearly feels passionately about the issue, will have read that guidance, so there is no need for me to go through it all. Surely he agrees that sex education in schools is an important and legitimate matter for debate and that, despite the valiant efforts of many people, the availability of sex education remains a problem. The debate over section 28 has provided an opportunity for a wider review of sex education in schools.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne referred to what happened in Scotland. We can argue about opinion polls, referendums, the £1 million that Brian Souter contributed, problems with ballot papers and so forth. We all know the result—effectively 75 per cent. of the people of Scotland either did not bother to vote or voted in favour of repealing the Scottish equivalent to section 28. Other ways of interpreting it are possible. The important point, however, is that it is not the job of politicians merely to follow their perception of public opinion. Rather, and particularly on important matters, they should enunciate their principles, assess what follows on from them and, subsequently, take the lead and try to gain public support for them. I do not know whether my support of the Government's proposals will be uniformly popular throughout the country, but my colleagues and I regard it as a matter of principle, which is why we take our stand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall give way once more, but, as I said earlier, we do not need a lengthy debate and I do not want to be responsible for prolonging it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Unless he is unusually provocative, this will be the last time. He makes the point about principles. It is probably my fault for the way I put it, but my argument was about the Government's lack of principles here. They were trying to do something that they perceived as popular and it has turned out to be the opposite. We argue from the point of principle; they do not. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman also argues from a point of principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful. I do not want to attack anyone's motives. I merely state my position and that of my party. Our decision on how we will vote today is founded on a clear principle of not wishing to be involved in things that are discriminatory. There is also no point in having on the statute book legislation that does not work and is irrelevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I must recognise as I get older, and I have just had my 56th birthday, that the little segment of the world in which I exist differs greatly from many others. MPs are particularly prone to generalise from their little bit of humanity and to draw universal truths about how the rest of humanity ought to behave. If I take a cross section of my constituency and then my three children, who are all in their late 20s and living and working in Putney, those chunks of world do not touch at any point. If I took a slice from the constituency of the Minister, North-West Durham, and compared it with a cross section in London, those worlds would have no point of contact either. I can judge which of those two worlds I prefer, but I try not to make a qualitative judgment about them.
<P>
My children live in a cosmopolitan world and have a liberal attitude to it. They do not ask questions and they do not identify things as we automatically did a generation ago when we saw that people were different. They are more relaxed and the frontiers are much less clear and defined. Some things have got harder. My children and their contemporaries work harder than I was ever required to work in my 20s. They get far greater rewards, but they work colossally hard. They are consequently intolerant of those who they think are slacking and not pulling their weight and who are dependent when they do not need to be. They are much more competitive in that sense and I salute them as there is great merit in that.
<P>
When I approach these issues of sexuality, I try to recognise that I am dealing with a world that is outside my experience. I do not wish to make judgments. If it has consequences that I do not like, I can draw a judgment and say that it affects people. I have a role as a Member of Parliament to legislate on what happens in society, but I do not want to say that certain people, by definition, start with a different moral status to anyone else. That will sound as if I am talking as part of the liberal e´lite, but having been educated at both Oxford and Harvard, I suppose that I must own up to that. By and large, I am strongly in favour of the e´lite as long as it draws from the widest possible source so that the nation can have the largest number of qualified people. It is not e´litism that is the problem, but e´litism based on one's origin.
<P>
I agree with much of what my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne said. I spend a lot of time in the schools in my constituency. I come from a background that is almost entirely educational. In all the time that I have represented my constituency, not one teacher has raised this issue in any shape or form. I do not think that I have had any correspondence on it either. No one has come to my surgeries about it. This legislation falls into the category of having to go to the churchyard to practise archery on a Sunday afternoon. I wonder to what extent it will be an active measure. I regret that it is on the statute book, but as it is there I am not sure that it is worth the trouble of taking it out. If we do take it out, I will have to be persuaded quite hard to put it back in again.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The guidance is the key. To remove from legislation words that say that one must not promote homosexual relations is, by definition, to say that it is okay to do so. We know that that is not the case. My hon. Friend was right about this. The Government have been pushed towards firming up on this matter from their original intentions. That is the key. The other factors are those outlined by the hon. Member for Bath. We are dealing with an educational world that is entirely different from when the legislation was passed. Local education authorities are not long for this life. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment clearly has intentions towards the LEAs that are unlikely to prolong their active life. My party has proposals for schools, which marginalise the LEAs. We are moving into a different world, whoever wins the general election.
<P>
Schools are increasingly being asked to act in locus parentis. We constantly heap upon them new things that they must do: sex education, civics and so on. Is there any time left for them to teach children the basic mechanics of earning a living—the good old three Rs? Think of the problems of dysfunctional families in inner cities and head teachers who are desperate to attract two or three middle class parents to improve their SATs results and thus attract a few more middle class parents. That may sound epigrammatic, but that happens in inner city schools. There is also the problem of minorities and those who do not speak English as their first language, as well as that caused by unemployment and dislocation. After dealing with violent parents and acting as social worker, head teachers have precious little time to teach in many of these schools.
<P>
We should focus on getting schools to create competent kids. Whether we like it or not, the world is much more competitive. We must focus on that and spend less time demanding that schools should produce a moral view of citizenry. Having a job and being successful at it is much more likely to induce in someone a willingness to behave in a social way than all the moral paraphernalia that we tend to chuck at teachers in an increasing amount of guidance.
<P>
I shall cast a No vote on this. The Minister was perhaps speaking a little hastily earlier. I have, as she said, a solidly liberal record on these matters. I do not think that what we are doing today will make the earth move by even the slightest tremor. It is probably largely irrelevant, but that is the right course of action for me. As the provision is likely to come out of the Bill, I am not sure that it will be worth a great deal of effort to put it back again. I come back to being a low Methodist now; the pronouncements of the Church of England bishops and the banalities of ``Thought for the Day'' have never struck me as contributing greatly to this sort of debate. I am unlikely to be convinced to the contrary in the future.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I ought to reply even though the hon. Member for Eastbourne made it clear that he will not be persuaded today. It has been an interesting debate. I agreed with everything that the hon. Member for Bath said; his arguments are in line with mine. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is having a conversation, so I will come back to his point later. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I beg the Minister's pardon. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) and I were having a learned discussion about what the expression ``no vote'' meant.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was interested to hear the right hon. Gentleman say that he was not convinced anything could be done that would make a difference. For him and me that is probably true. I spoke about individual rights and opportunities because I am concerned about the impact on vulnerable young people.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath said that research done by Lord Tope and by the Institute of Education, University of London, demonstrates that there are teachers who think that the legislation means that they cannot mention homosexuality or respond to questions about it. We know that they are wrong; the reality is what the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe said in 1997. Teachers should not have let this legislation affect the way that they relate to children and young people in their care. However, we have to face the fact that some have and, as parliamentarians, ask ourselves whether we are content with that. The legislation is virtually meaningless because, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, it has never been used. Vulnerable young people are suffering and have suffered because legislation that was passed for rhetorical reasons has affected teachers' relationships with the young.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> On that point, why then, when a few months ago I asked the Minister—or the DFEE—whether the Government had commissioned any research into the effect on teaching habits of section 28, was the answer ``no''? Is that a cost-saving exercise, or is it simply that Ministers prefer argument by assertion rather than that based on evidence?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> There already is research evidence, published by the Institute of Education at the University of London. I do not know whether we could do research that was better than that or Lord Tope's. The research by the Institute in 1997 found that 28 per cent. of teachers were not sure whether they could even discuss homosexuality as a result of section 28 and 44 per cent. had experienced difficulty in dealing with the needs of gay and lesbian pupils as a result. Why should the Government have to commission more money to do research when a venerable educational research institution has already done it?
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Eastbourne is in Committee and has to tread the party line, but a Government that was seeking simply to get votes would not have started this. We have done so because we know that it is the right thing to do. I worked for two years with John Smith, the previous leader of the Labour party, as his PPS. When we considered these issues and the age of consent and so on, he used to say to me frequently, ``It will never make us popular, but it is the right thing to do, so we have to do it.'' Sometimes one simply has to do the right thing, whether it is popular or not. I have heard these young people explain what it has meant to them and I ask the Committee to consider their plight. In the light of that, we have to put our opportunities for getting one over our political opponents aside and think about the needs of the young by supporting what the Government seek to do in these amendments.

``2A. Information falling within paragraph 7 of Part I above is not exempt information by virtue of that paragraph unless its disclosure would prejudice to an unreasonable degree the commercial interests of the person to whom the information relates.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We return briefly to the openness or otherwise of executives, the provision of information to members of the press, public and other councillors prior to meetings and the availability of information and reports after them, all of which the Committee has discussed at greater length. You will be delighted to know, Mrs. Michie that I shall not rehearse arguments made before about why I continue to be concerned over the Government's proposals.
<P>
As the Committee will be aware, the Government's plans for a wide range of freedom of information matters are contained in clause 21. Hon. Members will see from clause 92 that proposals for open access to meetings and so on are to be covered by the negative resolution procedure. Such issues are important and both Houses should have the opportunity to debate them and to press them to a Division. Amendment No. 585 would add decisions on clause 21 to the list of those that will be covered by the affirmative resolution process.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second amendment, No. 586, would make it a requirement that a list of all the background papers is attached to any report that is provided by a council. Many councils already carry out such a procedure; it is an example of good practice. It means that the media and members of the public who receive the report will be aware of what other documents may be of benefit to them, if they have a particular interest in certain matters. Appending a list of background papers to the main document would help to ensure that they have access to all the information to help them form a view about a particular issue and determine what action to take, such as lobbying.
<P>
Amendment No. 587 is different. It would tighten up the provisions in respect of exempt information. Even when a meeting of a committee, a sub-committee, the full council or, in future, the executive is to take place in open session, from time to time there will be issues that should not be discussed under the public gaze. I am sure that all members of the Committee will accept that that is right and proper. We are all familiar with the concept of exempt business. However, far too often, items are moved into the exempt business session on the grounds that they cover commercial and confidential matter, when there is no evidence that the revealing of that information could in any way, shape or form be harmful to the commercial organisation concerned. Indeed, there have been examples of evidence having been justified as going into exempt session, when the information is already publicly available elsewhere. The amendment would tighten up the exempt regulations to demonstrate that there would be prejudicial effects on the organisation concerned if the business were not carried out in exempt session.
<P>
The amendments are supported by many organisations, including the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Local Government Information Unit and the Campaign for Freedom of Information. I am well aware that Committee members will have received briefing notes from those organisations, which, is why I shall not go through their comments in detail. Their arguments are persuasive and I hope that the amendments will receive a positive response from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We broadly support the amendments. I endorse much of what the hon. Member for Bath said. As far as they go, they are helpful and practical ideas and I hope that the Government will look upon them favourably. The amendments are less significant in the context of our earlier debate, but they are useful. They support the openness and transparency of access to information established under successive Conservative Governments, which the Government are trampling all over. The Minister is pulling on her jackboots as I speak.
<P>
As the Campaign for Freedom of Information and the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, the rights of the public to attend meetings, which are enshrined in primary legislation introduced by a Conservative Government, are to be circumscribed by secondary legislation. That is wrong, but if it is to happen anyway, the amendment should be in the Bill.
<P>
We support the amendments and so do organisations such as the LGIU and the Society of Editors.

<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I understand what the hon. Member for Bath wants to achieve. He and his hon. Friends have pursued the issues with great consistency throughout our debates and I commend them for doing so. I have some sympathy with the amendments, but I cannot agree to everything that they propose. Taking the hon. Gentleman's lead, I shall not repeat our earlier debates on the substantive issues, but will restrict my remarks to the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 585 would make clause 21 subject to the draft affirmative procedure. The regulations under clause 21 will be largely technical and more appropriate to negative resolution. We want to retain the flexibility to revise them in the light of councils' experience of operating executive arrangements. The amendment, which would subject them to the affirmative procedure, is not appropriate, as it would make their revision more cumbersome, and we cannot accept it.
<P>
I agree with the substance of amendment No. 586; it should be easier for the public to know what papers are available to the executive before they take decisions. That is in tune with our aim of giving local people greater input into the decisions that will affect them. However, although the amendment would help to achieve that, we cannot accept it as drafted; it needs to be considered by counsel and checked in relation to other parts of the Bill. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall consider tabling an amendment with the same intentions on Report. I also undertake to ensure that the regulations under clause 21 include a requirement that reports to the executive should list background papers.
<P>
I have some sympathy with amendment No. 587, but it is unnecessary because the Secretary of State already has the power to vary the orders in respect of the definitions of exempt information in the Local Government Act 1972. There are sometimes abuses of the definition of exempt information to keep information away from the public and from officials. I am happy to undertake to look closely at the description of exempt information in the coming months when we draft the regulations. We want to take a more thorough approach and to consult more widely on varying the definition, which we could not do if we accepted the amendment. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will undertake that review within a reasonable time scale while the regulations are being drafted and amend the definition of exempt information on the basis of that consultation and review. In the light of my undertakings, I hope that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am extremely grateful for the Under-Secretary's response, which will be no surprise to her. I hope that she will not think me churlish, but the only reason that I could glean for her opposition to amendment No. 585 was that the Government wanted the flexibility, at a future date, to change the regulations from time to time. Why then is there a long list in clause 92(5) of other regulations that will be dealt with by the affirmative order procedure? The Minister will have to convince me that she has no intention of amending them either. Is there not one that she would not want to change? I ask her to reconsider amendment No. 585; she may be able to persuade me with a more convincing argument if I raise the matter on another occasion.
<P>
I am delighted that the hon. Lady accepts the principle of amendments Nos. 586 and 587 and that she will introduce amendments on Report. However, I am surprised—again, I do not intend to be churlish—that she has to reconsider amendment No. 586, as it has been on the notice paper for several days and it could have been checked before. Never mind, however, we understand the way that this place works and I look forward to supporting her version.
<P>
I am grateful for the hon. Lady's response to amendment No. 587. When taking wider consultation, she should look at her Government's freedom of information measures, which refer to the prejudice test and to the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which has some helpful words that she may wish to use in her amendments. Given the positive and welcome response from the Under-Secretary, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(Disclosure of information), (Unauthorised disclosure of information)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 589.
<P>
Government new clause 24—Disclosure of information.
<P>
Government new clause 25—Unauthorised disclosure of information.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> New clause 24 facilitates the implementation of supporting people by allowing for a one-off transfer of information at the point of transition to the new programme. It is effectively a technical amendment.
<P>
We want to protect people who receive support services, such as older people in sheltered housing. As hon. Members are aware, clause 87 provides that housing benefit—and consequently, although to a lesser extent, income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance—will cease to pay for the vast majority of support services when supporting people has been implemented. To ensure that those who are in receipt of support continue to receive the vital services that they need, we intend to make support service payments by way of block grant to the provider, not the tenant.
<P>
Also, to ensure that there is no immediate change in service provision, the new grant-making authority and service providers need to be provided with information concerning support charges included in the relevant benefit awards so that funding can be maintained. We want to ensure that payments that providers are receiving at the point of transition continue at least until the scheme is reviewed. It is therefore vital that the grant-making body responsible for distributing money knows which providers in a given area should receive a support service grant. In turn, the providers will need to know the amount included in that grant in respect of each tenant's support services. The disclosure of this information is in the best interests of claimants, so that the provider does not start to charge them for services that are being funded by the grant, and to aid a seamless transition to the new scheme.
<P>
To protect the rights of benefit claimants, new clause 25 provides that unlawful disclosure of information relating to a specific individual, provided under the new power, should be an offence. This new provision will apply to those to whom benefit information has been supplied in accordance with new clause 24, both to those administering the new grant and to service providers to whom benefit information has been disclosed, including individual employees. A person will be guilty of an offence if they disclose without lawful authority any information acquired in the course of their employment that relates to a specific person, unless they can prove that they believed that the disclosure was being made, or had previously been disclosed to the public, with lawful authority and had no reason to believe otherwise. If found guilty, a person may be sentenced to imprisonment for a maximum of two years, or a fine, or both.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 588 and 589 are consequential drafting amendments that are necessary to reflect the new clauses in the provisions on commencement and on territorial extent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): I have some questions on new clause 25, with which the Minister may be able to help me.
<P>
The information whose disclosure may be an offence includes information about various benefits—income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit—that is held by various persons, including the Secretary of State and local authorities. There is no suggestion that the offence is restricted to information about identifiable recipients of such benefits; it appears to cover a much wider range of information.
<P>
The offence is committed by disclosing without lawful authority information that has been supplied under new clause 24 and relates to a specific, identifiable person. The term ``person'' normally includes individuals and legal entities and would therefore include information about an identifiable hostel, address or hotel. Under the clause, no harm has to be shown for an offence to be made. It is not necessary to show that the disclosure would prejudice the business or financial interests of the body concerned. Since the publication in 1993 of the White Paper, ``Open Government'', it has been Government policy to include, wherever possible, harm tests in new offences relating to disclosure of information. In other words, an offence is committed only if disclosure is shown to harm particular specified purposes, such as commercial interests, national security or personal privacy.
<P>
I have three questions for the Minister. First, what information, other than about identifiable individuals, might be caught by the new offence? Would it, for example, be an offence to disclose that several people receiving benefits lived in a particular hostel or address? Secondly, why is it necessary to create an offence relating to the disclosure of information about identifiable persons rather than one limited to identifiable individuals? Thirdly, why does the proposed offence not involve any test of harm?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We seek to ensure that the necessary information about what benefits a person is receiving is transmitted to the people who will administer the grant. By doing so, people will know whether the claimant is in receipt of housing benefit, jobseeker's allowance, income support and so on. Different benefits have different boundaries; jobseeker's allowance is different from housing benefit. We are considering whether housing benefit should include a cleaning allowance under the new scheme, for example. It is important that we have a system that allows a claimant to have the grant set alongside the benefit. That is personal information about the claimant and it is important that it is not used in unauthorised ways or made available to anyone not involved with the grant. If anyone administering the grant disclosed it to anyone else, for example, that would be an offence. It is also made clear that nobody can disclose information from which an individual's circumstances could be deduced, including an identifying address.
<P>
I am not sure that I have answered the question in the way that the hon. Gentleman wanted, but I assure him that the amendment is necessary to ensure that the grant is used as it should be and that the benefits that people receive are taken into account. It is very much about the person in an individual rather than a collective sense.

<P>

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 562.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We move on to another subject, which is why we have a different set of officials, as I was trying to explain to the hon. Member for Eastbourne. I think that he thought that they were members of Stonewall.
<P>
The changes to the Bill relate to charging for local authority child care. Parents in receipt of benefits—income support, jobseeker's allowance and previously the disability working allowance and family credit—can benefit from free local authority child care. The Tax Credits Act 1999 replaced family credit with the working families tax credit, and replaced disability working allowance with the disabled persons tax credit. One effect of that was to allow recipients of those tax credits to receive free local authority child care.
<P>
The changes will allow, but not require, local authorities to charge parents in receipt of working families tax credit and disabled persons tax credit for the child care that they provide. That will not apply to parents of children in need, who will continue to receive that child care free. People on benefits will also continue to receive local authority child care free.
<P>
There are several reasons why the change is necessary and important. Working families tax credit provides income to parents to enable them to purchase child care; parents can receive up to £100 of their weekly costs for one child and £150 for two. Therefore, it is logical to offer child care free to those in receipt of that tax credit.
<P>
Tax credits are much more generous and widespread than the benefits that they replace. For example, in the first six months since the working families tax credit was introduced, more than 1 million families have taken it up whereas, even at its peak, the longer-established family credit was taken up by only 820,000 families. Those in receipt of that tax credit could include parents earning up to £42,000 a year; surely they should be able to, and expected to, contribute to the costs of child care.
<P>
Making that change will allow local authorities to make better use of their resources. Many authorities have lost income as a result of the present situation and they have pressed us hard to make the change as quickly as possible. Unless we do so, reduced income for those councils could lead to fewer local authority child care places being available when, under the national child care strategy, the opposite is our intention. Our key aim is to increase the availability of child care and the measure may enable authorities to do that. Free local authority child care creates an uneven playing field for other child care providers and parents who cannot claim it.
<P>
We will continue to ensure that local child care is provided free to parents of children in need who receive tax credits. The Government recognise that such children require particular support. I am aware that, however necessary and welcome the change is, local authorities will need support to understand and implement it. Therefore, the Local Government Association, the Inland Revenue and the Department for Education and Employment will jointly issue guidance to local authorities. The new provisions will take effect as soon as possible. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I wish simply to observe that no local Government Bill is complete without the Department of Social Security getting its share of it. The Minister does not have the faintest idea what the proposal is about and neither do I. We will examine the measure to discover whether there is anything dodgy in it. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne will not want to intervene now, but we want to reserve our right to do so on Report, in case closer inspection proves that that devious Department is trying to smuggle something nasty into a local government Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I hate to disappoint the right hon. Gentleman but the amendment comes from the Department for Education and Employment, which is in charge of child care policy. I assure him that I know exactly what the proposal is about. He may remember that in the old days in the Labour party I had responsibility for early-years child care. It was always our intention to provide a system that would enable people to use the private, voluntary or public sector and to receive sufficient support. As I am sure that he knows, the working families tax credit will provide up to 70 per cent. of funding for child care, which can amount to £100 for one child and £150 for two.
<P>
The measure is an important one and, although it is a small part of the Bill, I am sure that on examination the right hon. Gentleman will fully support the detail as well as the general principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister should ham it a bit more often. If she knows what the proposal is designed to do, why did she read out a brief from the Department for Education and Employment, from which almost everything is largely illiterate? Why did she not tell us in her own words? She would sound so much more convincing. She should have faith in herself.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss new clause 11—Payments in maladministration cases—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( )(1) The Local Government Act 1974 is amended as follows.
<P>
(2) In section 31(3)(a), the words from ``a report is laid'' to ``the report'' where those words appear for the first time in paragraph (b) are omitted.

<P>
(3) The power to incur expenditure under this section is in addition to the power to incur expenditure under section 31A above.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The Government have tabled new clause 22, which, as I hope Opposition Members will appreciate, takes the idea behind new clause 11 but has substantially improved it and removed its flaws. Under new clause 11, a power would be introduced to enable local authorities to pay compensation to a person who seems to have suffered injustice as a result of maladministration. The flaw in new clause 11 is that it would require an ombudsman's investigation and report before compensation could be paid. In fact, most of the problems and the lack of clarity about powers in dealing with the issue occur in cases in which a report has not been issued by the ombudsman but the local authority nevertheless feels that compensation is due as someone has suffered injustice.
<P>
To prevent the issue from unnecessarily going to a higher level, new clause 22 provides a new power to enable local authorities to pay compensation in such circumstances regardless of whether an ombudsman's report has been issued. That will help to overcome any uncertainty about whether such powers exist. Given that Opposition Members have made representations about the issue, I hope that they will support new clause 22 and will not press new clause 11.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I shall be as brief as possible. Both the Local Government Association and the Association of London Government have pressed for the inclusion in the Bill of a duty to have regard to equality of opportunity when using the well-being powers. The new clause was proposed in the other place by Baroness Hamwee and Lord Harris of Haringey. On Report in the other place, the Government seemed to leave open the possibility of tabling amendments that would place such a duty on local authorities. The Government said at the time that such amendments could not be made until the promised Government amendments had been made to the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill, which would change the legislation applying to local authorities in regard to race relations; that Bill has duly been amended in Committee. The Government plan to carry out a consultation process on the regulations, implementing the new duty to promote racial equality, but no indication has yet been given about when it will be introduced. We would welcome a statement from the Minister on whether the Government still plan to table amendments to the Bill to introduce a general equality-of-opportunity duty, now that the race relations Bill has been similarly amended.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> As the hon. Gentleman would expect, we are entirely sympathetic to the principle that local authorities and public bodies generally should have regard to equality of opportunity for all people, regardless of race, gender, age, religion, disability or sexual orientation. We hold that position ourselves, as my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions powerfully made clear earlier. The difficulty with the new clause is that the Government have already started on a different course, by which we seek to ensure that where possible—and where enforceable as that is the key issue—we will require not just local authorities but all public bodies to have regard to equality of opportunity. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill, which has just completed its Committee stage, will place all public bodies, not just local authorities, under an enforceable duty to promote equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless of race. As far as race is concerned, new clause 7 does nothing that that Bill, as amended, will not do.
<P>
We have already made a commitment to impose an enforceable duty on all public bodies to promote equality of opportunity in terms of gender and disability. We will consult on the approach to be adopted in legislation later this year. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, who takes the lead in such matters across Government, is conducting research into religious discrimination and we want to consider the results of that before deciding how best to proceed. The question of enforceability is important for issues such as age and sex discrimination. It would not be effective simply to place on a public body, a declaratory duty, as the new clause would, without the means to enforce the true objectives of the amendment. We do not at the moment have the mechanisms to enforce legislation on age and sexual orientation. We are pursuing a non-legislative code of practice on age discrimination and will take a similar approach to sexual orientation.
<P>
The Government have introduced their own method of ensuring some of the objectives that the hon. Gentleman advocates; it is vital to ensure enforceability before proceeding to legislation. For that reason and because the new clause would apply only to local authorities and not all public bodies, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the motion and accept that the Government are serious about the issues. We are proceeding in the way that we think best.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The amendments hark back to a much earlier debate, so I will deal with the issues fairly quickly. Local authorities cannot charge for services that they are not obliged to provide, unless they have an express power or duty to charge. We and many local councils think that it is fair that they should have the power to set charges for discretionary services at levels that support their strategic priorities That would support the promotion of the economic, social and environmental well-being of an area, not least because the Government have made it clear that they will not provide any extra money or allow councils to raise more money from council tax. In the Minister's immortal phrase, that power is a paper tiger.
<P>
The extended powers make sense. If new clause 9 were accepted, the miscellaneous charging provisions in new schedule 1 would not be needed. I hope that the Minister will accept at least one of our alternatives, but I fear that she will not. New schedule 1 concerns a range of discretionary services for which no power to charge is available. All the categories are self-explanatory and have been suggested on behalf of local councils, which have the experience of providing services for which they can recover no payment.
<P>
The suggestions are not frivolous. For example, paragraph 8 deals with charges for assisting film makers. I understand that Westminster city council receives more than 1,000 requests a year to film on its highways. It collects income to cover the cost of closing roads, the loss of earnings from parking meters and other matters.
<P>
The proposals are practical and local government would welcome them, so I hope that the Minister will accept them in some form.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, we had a detailed debate on 9 May on charging for providing services under the new well-being power. I said that there were good reasons for allowing authorities to charge for such services and that we were considering local authorities' powers to charge more generally in preparing the forthcoming Green Paper on local government finance.
<P>
When considering local authorities' powers to charge, we must keep in mind the interests of those paying the charges, particularly if the authority has a monopoly in providing a service. If such a monopoly does not exist, the interests of the private sector and the impact of competition from the authority must be considered. I urge the hon. Gentleman to await the Green Paper. Then we can consider greater use of section 150 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to confer new charging powers on authorities.
<P>
On 9 May, some scepticism about the usefulness of section 150 was expressed It was said that only two sets of regulations had been made so far. In fact, five sets of regulations have been made, including most recently the Local Authorities (Transport Charges) Regulations 1998. Tomorrow, the Fourth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation will consider the London Local Authorities (Charges for Stopping Up Orders) Regulations 2000 made under section 150. They will allow London local authorities to charge for making orders to stop up highways. Authorities acquire that function from the Secretary of State on 3 July. Without the regulations, the cost of issuing stopping-up orders would fall on the authorities and their council tax payers.
<P>
Section 150 is therefore far from moribund. However, the lack of general principles for charging has impeded its use, because each case has had to be considered in isolation. Our proposals for remedying that defect will be set out in the Green Paper. Therefore, I apologise to the hon. Member for Eastbourne, but we cannot accept new clause 9, new clause 10 or new schedule 1.
<P>
However, I hope that I have made it clear that there are other ways forward. Section 150 of the 1989 Act has clear advantages over new clause 9 in a number of ways, First, under the new clause, charging would be allowed for services provided ``under discretionary statutory powers.'' Precisely what that means is unclear. Accordingly, there would be doubt about exactly which services an authority could charge for. With section 150 regulations, the matters for which charging was allowed would be spelt out clearly.
<P>
Secondly, the new clause would allow for charging only for ``services'', but section 150 is more flexible. It allows charges to be levied not only for services, but for ``anything'' prescribed. It could therefore be used to allow charging for the provision of goods.
<P>
I see that new schedule 1 has the word ``miscellaneous'' in its title. Perhaps that is appropriate, given its range. I thought that it might be called the new Westminster stealth tax, because it clearly coincides with a list for which Westminster council frequently presses. Opposition Members are having some difficulty in dealing with their tax promise, but that is too controversial for this hour of the morning.
<P>
The schedule would also amend the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 by replacing section 74 with new provisions. That would broaden highway authorities' powers to charge utilities for working on highways and would remove the power of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to make regulations setting the level of charges.
<P>
We are in the process of implementing the existing section 74 to enable highway authorities to charge utilities when works on highways are unreasonably prolonged. As a matter of priority, we are working with utilities and highway authorities to develop a workable scheme. We expect to have it ready by the end of July. We aim to go out to consultation on the enabling regulations in the summer and lay them before Parliament for affirmative resolution in the autumn. The scheme will start as soon as possible after Parliament has approved the regulations.
<P>
I am not, of course, dismissing the possibility of new charging powers for various services, whether through section 150 of the 1989 Act or, if necessary, new primary legislation. However, it would be inappropriate to legislate in advance of the Green Paper to confer—as new clause 10 would—a random selection of new or enhanced charging powers, without any consultation with the users of the services.
<P>
In light of that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw new clause 9 and not press new clause 10 or new schedule 1.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It is reassuring to hear that the Government's finest minds are working on the problem. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Damages, costs or expenses</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) A local authority may indemnify its members and officers against any damages, costs or expenses which any such member or officer may be liable to pay or may reasonably have incurred in connection with his membership of or employment by the local authority provided the conditions set out in subsection (3) are satisfied.
<P>
(2) Subject to the provisions of this section, the terms of any indemnity granted under subsection (1) above shall be determined by the local authority, but where a local authority by resolution undertakes to provide an indemnity to its members and officers under this section, any sum due to a member or officer under the terms of the indemnity shall be enforceable against the local authority as if it were a simple contract debt.
<P>
(3) The conditions referred to in subsection (1) above are as follows:
<P>
(a) the member or officer concerned acted in good faith and honestly believed that the act or omission complained of was within the scope of his authority and that his duty or power as a member or officer required or entitled him to do or omit to do it;
<P>
(b) the damages, costs or expenses do not arise from fraud, dishonesty or any criminal offence (except that the costs of defending criminal proceedings may be indemnified) on the part of the member or officer concerned; and
<P>
(c) the damages, costs or expenses do not arise from activities which are beyond the powers of the local authority concerned, save to the extent that at the time of the activity in question the officer or member bona fide and reasonably believed that the activity was within the powers of the local authority.
<P>
(4) An indemnity under subsection (1) above may, if the local authority so provide:
<P>
(a) extend to a commitment (which shall be binding on the local authority) not to itself pursue any claim against its members and officers in respect of any loss or damage suffered by the local authority as a result of the neglect, act, error or omission of the member or officer concerned;
<P>
(b) apply to former members and officers in respect of acts and omissions occurring whilst they were members and officers of the local authority concerned;
<P>
(c) apply to acts and omissions occurring prior to the date on which the indemnity was granted or any resolution conferring the indemnity was approved;
<P>
(d) apply to liability incurred by any member or officer as the local authority's nominated appointee on an outside body or in respect of any advice given or service provided to any such outside body.
<P>
(5) An indemnity under subsection (1) above may apply in the circumstances set out in subsection (4)(d) above notwithstanding that the member or officer concerned is appointed as a Director, Trustee or member of the Management Committee of the outside body in question and notwithstanding that a conflict of interest may arise between the member or officer's duties to the local authority and his duties to the outside body.
<P>
(6) A local authority may arrange such insurance in connection with any indemnity granted under this section, or in respect of any personal liability of its members and officers arising in connection with their membership of or employment by the authority, as it thinks fit.
<P>
(7) For the purposes of section 94 of the Local Government Act 1972, a member of a local authority shall not be treated as having a pecuniary interest in any decision of the authority as to whether an indemnity should be granted or insurance effected under this section (or the terms thereof), provided that this dispensation shall not apply to any decision by the authority relating to that member's particular circumstances or if the decision would affect him in a materially different way to members of the local authority generally.'.—[Mr. Don Foster.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause would provide authorities with a clear and express power to indemnify members and officers against damages, costs or expenses for which they may be liable, or which they may reasonably incur in connection with the bona fide discharge of their activities as members or officers. It would also give authorities the power to provide insurance for members and officers.
<P>
At the moment, officers can certainly be protected from personal liability, but some recent cases have tended to limit the scope of that. It is clear that there is no express power to grant indemnities to individual councillors. Some legal opinion suggests that section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972 could provide such support, but other legal opinion suggests otherwise. The new clause provides the requisite support, not least because councillors are increasingly being asked to serve on outside bodies to represent the council. We need to consider their indemnity in respect of those activities.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The various subsections provide the mechanisms to achieve the new clause's objectives. Subsection (1) provides a broad power to a local authority to grant an indemnity, but it would be at the authority's discretion whether to do so. Subsection (3) lays down conditions and ensures that the indemnity will apply only when the officer or member is acting in good faith. It excludes indemnification in respect of fraud, dishonesty and most criminal offences.
<P>
Subsection (2) makes it clear that any indemnity granted by the council is enforceable through a contract mechanism. Such a mechanism already applies to officers and could, subject to the exclusions in subsection (3), be extended to members. Subsection (4) goes a step further. A case against an individual officer or member is usually mounted against the authority as a body corporate. Subsection (4) allows the authority, again subject to the exclusions, to decide not to draw in the individual member.
<P>
Subsection (5) deals with appointments to outside bodies as a director, trustee or member of the management committee, notwithstanding any conflicts of interest that may arise. In view of the promotion of well-being powers in part I, officers and members are increasingly likely to be asked to join outside bodies. Although section 112 of the 1972 Act provides a limited possibility, there is no express power to provide insurance cover for officers and members. The new clause provides for such a power. Finally, subsection (7) will ensure that a member does not have to declare a pecuniary interest in any debate covered by the new clause.
<P>
In another Committee considering a recent schools Bill, concern was expressed about people serving as governors on school bodies. The Government accepted that councillors require greater protection when they serve as governors. The new clause deals with those and all other circumstances in which officers and councillors are unprotected in carrying out their local authority duties.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> The new clause is helpful in dealing with an ambiguity in statute and we have considerable sympathy with the intention behind it. It is clear from what the hon. Member for Bath said that this is an extremely complex issue. Officials have begun to consider it. The more we look at it, the more evident it is that we must look at it more closely. The amendment is detailed and a lot of work has gone into it, but it does not cover all the eventualities. In particular, the use of any indemnity power should be limited by some suitably framed conditions.
<P>
Local government would certainly want to be consulted on the framing of such a new clause and the power that we would be giving them to extend the indemnification provision. We see considerable merit in consulting local government and other bodies to find out whether we can frame an enabling power that also contains suitable constraining conditions. We will see whether such a power can be brought back in time for Report. That is quite a difficult task. Given that we have not started the consultation and we do not know what responses we will get, I am not sure that we can get consensus in time for Report, but I shall certainly try.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Would it help the Under-Secretary to know that there has already been quite considerable consultation within the LGA about the details? I hope that that can give us some confidence about getting some agreement by Report. The Bill is likely to go back to the House of Lords because of the debate on section 28; if it is not possible to do this on Report, it might be possible to do it before it goes to the other place. Will all efforts be made to do that?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The spirit of what I was saying makes that clear. We will make all efforts to come back at any appropriate time. I am aware of the consultation so far. It has revealed that there are matters that need to be discussed to ensure that we get this right as far as possible to everyone's satisfaction. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I accept the assurance. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 23</center></H4>
<H4><center>Proportional representation</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`The Secretary of State may by regulation introduce a form of proportional representation for elections to local authorities in England and Wales.'.—[Mr. Don Foster.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The Committee would be amazed if a discussion on local government did not provide an opportunity for a Liberal Democrat spokesman to mention proportional representation for local government. Given that time is pressing, I hope that the Committee will not mind if I give an abbreviated version of what I would like to say. If members of the Committee would like a more expansive version, I am more than happy to help. I have many pages of notes that I could pass to them.
<P>
The arguments for and against PR for local government have been well rehearsed. As the Committee is well aware, in more than 90 authorities one political party holds more than 80 per cent. of the seats, despite not having achieved 80 per cent. of the vote and 55 local authorities have remained in the same political control for over 20 years. There is a real concern that there is unfair representation at local government level. That is true of all political parties. In some councils, Liberal Democrats are in control but have not received the number of votes to justify their large proportion of seats. In a large swathe of local authorities, mainly in the south and south-west, the Labour party has no representation at all. There are some councils, however, where it has almost all the seats, despite not having had the appropriate proportion of the popular vote. The most recent research that I have seen demonstrates that, given what has been happening in local council elections in the past few years, the decimation of the Labour party is more likely under first past the post than under proportional representation—a thought that the Government may wish to bear in mind. The arguments for PR have been well rehearsed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Is it not bad for democracy that there a number of major cities with no representation on their council of members of the major Opposition party at Westminster?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Indeed, that is the case and I am sure that that will persuade those on the Conservative Benches to support the amendment. After all, the amendment does not say that we must introduce PR or what form it should take. It merely gives the Secretary of State the opportunity to produce a mechanism by which we might in due course introduce PR. It is merely enabling legislation.
<P>
I have before me many quotations about the importance of PR in local government from various distinguished members of the Labour party, the Conservative party, every conceivable local government association, the vast majority of editors of newspapers, academics and others from the world of business and commerce. I could read them all out—they are very persuasive, as I hope I have been by the brevity of my speech. I shall look forward with interest to the Minister's response. If she intends to be negative, I would simply ask her to explain why this Labour Government have seen fit to introduce PR—or a form of it—for nearly every other election that is taking place and why in Scotland they have supported the introduction of PR for local government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We debated this matter at length when we discussed the arrangements for directly elected mayors. It was teasing of the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) to try to dress this up as in some way helping my party out. We remain implacably opposed to PR in any shape or form. As I said in previous debates, there is no evidence that it increases turnout—quite the opposite, as we have seen in recent times. We believe in the British system of voting, where those who get the most votes on first preferences actually win elections. That strikes us as sensible and practicable. I am sure that the clamour for PR will grow as the hon. Gentleman's and the Labour party continue to lose ground in local government in the coming years.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Government's position on proportional representation for local government elections was set out in the local government White Paper, ``Modern Local Government—in Touch with the People''. The Government do not propose to change the voting system for local government, other than through the introduction of the supplementary vote system for the next election of directly elected mayors, which the Committee discussed earlier.
<P>
The Government do not view changes to the voting system as a panacea for settling all the problems in local government. Local government modernisation is far more fundamental than simply changing how people cast their vote. The Government do not therefore believe that there is any point in including an enabling provision for proportional representation in the Bill. Furthermore, I am not at all sure that an enabling provision is the right way to introduce such an important constitutional change. It is one the House would want to debate at length to consider all the options and there ought to be a much wider consultation with the public before such a big change in local government was considered. Therefore, the Bill is not the right place for the debate that the hon. Gentleman seeks. I am sure that he and others in the Liberal Democrat party will ensure that the House returns to the matter, but I am not persuaded that this is the place for such a debate, so I hope that he will withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<H5>1 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As I believe that we shall be able to conclude proceedings on the Bill by 1.15 pm, I intend to defer adjourning the Committee until that time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you for that helpful information, Mrs. Michie. I am sure that you will want us to get on with the remaining business as quickly as possible.
<P>
The Minister told us that proportional representation was not a panacea for all the problems in local government. I could not agree more. However, it would certainly be a solution to some of the problems, not least that of unfair representation. According to recent research, it would also be likely to improve voter turn-out by on average 7 per cent. The Minister is keen to achieve such an improvement.
<P>
The right hon. Lady said that she did not believe that this was the right place to discuss the matter. I cannot understand that argument. I cannot think of a better place to discuss the way in which the elections will take place than a local government Bill. Given that we have discussed when elections are to take place at great length on other clauses in this Bill, how they should take place would also seem to be relevant.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was pointing out that the clause would not enable the House fully to debate the different options and come to a view; it would leave that to the Secretary of State. The present Secretary of State has rather strong views on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If that was a subtle hint, I have taken it. I remind the Minister that the Representation of the People Act 2000, which I suspect that she supported, enables the trialling of other forms of election. Perhaps, that is a secret way in which we might solve the problem.
<P>
The right hon. Lady says that she is not persuaded. A growing band of her right hon. and hon. Friends are being persuaded. I am fairly confident that, before long, we shall debate the matter again and we will succeed, as we already have in Scotland. Meanwhile, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> First, I thank you for your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie. The Committee has been very genial, overall. We have dealt with much business and we have done so in a spirit of co-operation. We have scrutinised the legislation, but we have got on with dealing with the important aspects. Your chairmanship and that of my hon. Friend Mr. O'Brien have played no small part in ensuring that we have proceeded in such a fashion.
<P>
I also thank my hon. Friends, who have all performed their duty as we are coming to expect. They have continued to show great interest in the Bill and to question my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes) and I to ensure that the Government's business has been explained. They have not always done so in the full face of the Committee, but they have continued to do it.
<P>
I also thank Opposition Members. Their contribution has enabled us to think through matters and even to make or propose changes to the Bill, which is, of course, what scrutiny of a Bill is about. I hope that we will be able to say thank you in other ways. I had not anticipated that we would not be sitting this evening—I might have organised something then. None the less, I will organise something. This evening would have proved difficult anyway because of the football.
<P>
The Committee has proceeded in an exemplary fashion and I thank everyone who has played their part—all the officials and the Officers of the House and, of course, Hansard—for their contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I echo the Minister's thanks to all the staff and everyone who has been involved—the Clerks, Hansard, the police and the never-ending stream of officials who have whispered in Ministers' ears. I am sorry that I mistook the involvement of those officials this morning. I also thank members of the Committee—the, perforce, silent ones on the Labour Benches, who have been following the debates with interest and, in particular, my right hon. and hon. Friends, who have made some distinctive contributions. I do not detract from the contributions of Labour Members, but it was a real treat for me, in doing my job, to have two former Ministers on the Back Benches. They have been enormously helpful.
<P>
The Minister is right about the Committee being good natured. I said at the outset that I hoped that we could disagree without being disagreeable and I think that we have broadly achieved that aim. We have covered a gamut of issues from the tenets of Methodism, to the doings of Craven council—we heard rather more about that council than I would have wished.
<P>
I pay particular thanks to you, Mrs. Michie, and to your co-Chairman, Mr. O'Brien. Although you have had firm hands on the tiller you have been, where necessary, liberal and have allowed wider debates on the amendments so that we did not have to waste time with stand part debates where those were not appropriate. I am sure that that saved time in the long run.
<P>
I often think that being a member of a Standing Committee is like being in a hostage situation. A group of people are kept in a confined space for long periods of time, cut off from the outside world—that world may be unaware of where they are and what they are doing in many respects. A bond develops, not only among the hostages, but between them and the hostage takers. The only abiding question is: who are the hostages and who are the hostage takers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> You will recall, Mrs. Michie, that at the beginning of our deliberations some months ago I promised brevity. I will stick to that promise again now. I join in the thanks to all the officials, in particular, to the Clerk for all his help, and to the Hansard reporters, the security staff and everyone who has made our our deliberations possible. I also thank your co-Chairman, Mr. O'Brien and you for your chairmanship.
<P>
During the Transport Bill Committee, on which I served recently, there was considerable debate about the pronunciation of the name of my constituency. There were only two options, ``Bath'', or ``Baath''. I have noted with interest the numerous different pronunciations of your name, Mrs. Michie. I suspect that we could all do with some lessons in pronouncing it as you would like.
<P>
I have enjoyed my time on the Committee very much, not least because I have learned a great deal from listening to all the other members—for that I am grateful. I am delighted that we have found a new meaning of the word, ``a technical amendment''—it appears to mean, ``Shut up, and sit down'. For those who took my advice on such matters, I am particularly gratefully.
<P>
Finally, I thank the Whips for the Labour and Conservative parties, who often do not get the thanks that they deserve, for ensuring that we have made progress at the agreed rate, with opportunities for gaps to rest, recuperate and recharge our batteries. I am looking forward to the party that the Minister is throwing.

I have enjoyed chairing the Committee, not least because its members have remained affable, retained a sense of humour and have not raised too many weird points of order. I am duly grateful.
