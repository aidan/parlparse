<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Benton. I am sure that you will have as interesting a time as your two co-Chairmen. I know that you are familiar with many of the issues that we shall be discussing.
<P>
Perhaps for ease of reference I should recap what I was saying before the break. I was about to conclude my remarks.
<P>
If Government amendment No. 137 is accepted, it would set the quorum for ordinary meetings of the board at seven. The quorum for the selection of the second or subsequent chairman and vice-chairman of the board would be 12 for a 19-member board. I said that I would take into account amendment No. 153A, which was moved by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis), and amendment No. 181 in the name of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) in considering the impact of that number on a sliding scale. Therefore, we shall want to consider what the quorum should be if the board is smaller than the minimum size of 14 up to 19, which has already been agreed, and I shall come back to it on Report. I thank the hon. Gentlemen for raising that issue.
<P>
The Secretary of State has already accepted that the number of members who should support an inquiry should be lower than the figure of 12 in the Bill. I said earlier that I was minded to move to a majority of board members voting for an inquiry, whatever the size of the board—10 for a 19-member board and eight for, say, a 15-member board. In the devolved structure we would expect to have 19-member boards. Any variation of that would apply only if there were direct rule.
<P>
I fail to understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) does not accept the reasonable proposition that, for an inquiry to be triggered, a majority of board members should want it. It would be, in the words of Patten, an extreme measure, so it is not unreasonable to expect the majority to be convinced of the merits of an inquiry before it was triggered. That is the working premise on which this approach has been developed.
<P>
My hon. Friend put strong arguments on the other considerations for being forward looking, imaginative and trusting. If I correctly picked up the tenor of his approach and the way in which he questioned how the new Policing Board would operate, he seemed to lack an element of trust and to base his view on the expectation that the type of society, the new police service and inter-party and inter-community relationships would be the same in the future. Clearly that is not our aim in all that we are hoping to do, and are doing, as we implement the Good Friday agreement. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend to consider a different type of environment from the one that he was predicating, which was backward looking.
<P>
My hon. Friend referred to previous cases and said that if they had taken place at some point in the future, an inquiry would not be held, but that seems to presume that all the worst features of the past 30 years—as he would describe them—would remain in place. He is basing his judgment on that, and I ask him to consider the merit of our proposal. Given that Patten—we are trying to be true to Patten, as my hon. Friend undoubtedly is—referred to the power of inquiry as being an extreme measure, there can be nothing unsound in persuading a majority of the board to hold such an inquiry. Such inquiries would probably be time consuming and demanding and will clearly be expensive. The board would then have to make a firm commitment that it wanted to move into that arena, instead of finding a different approach to the matters that concerned it.
<P>
My hon. Friend also said that he would expect a large attendance of members at meetings held to discuss such inquiries. Clearly there would be. If the issue was to be considered by a board, it is likely that a large number of the members—probably all of them—would turn up for the meeting. That strengthens the view that the power of argument should prevail in the board rather than the power of numbers: it should not be a neat percentage calculation based on suspicion and mistrust. If an inquiry is justified, the members of the board who want to pursue it must persuade others of the merit of doing so. That is no different from the process that the newly established Executive is going through of trying to convince people of arguments across a boundary that would hitherto have been difficult to cross. The Policing Board will be introduced into that new environment, and it is not unreasonable to believe that a majority of board members will want to adopt the extreme approach of holding an inquiry.
<P>
A strict reading of amendment No. 153A could suggest that, if the board has a quorum of seven, four people could initiate an inquiry. Four out of 19 does not seem a sound approach. As I have explained, it would be likely to be a major inquiry, with a great deal of commitment being given to it by many people. Heavyweight powers would be allocated to it to call people to give evidence and so on.
<P>
On that basis, I ask the Committee to accept Government amendments Nos. 137 and 138. I accept in principle amendments Nos. 153A and 181 and I ask the Committee to resist amendments Nos. 100, 182 and 64, although it has been suggested that there is no determination to press them to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton.
<P>
It simply falls to me to concur to a large extent on this issue. I do not want to give the impression that I shall make a habit of it, but on this occasion I am happy to concur with the Minister. He has put forward—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but there have been complaints about the noise of the fans. Some hon. Members are having difficulty hearing. Could we have the sound switched off, please?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is not the hon. Gentleman's sound?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I assure you, Mr. Benton, that, in view of my present tenor, the Minister would not wish to have me switched off, which is a unique experience.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. It was impossible, because of the noise behind me, to hear what the Minister said. I believe that he asked me not to press amendment No. 64 and agreed to return to the matter on Report. Perhaps he will confirm that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The interruption was unfortunate and perhaps the Minister will reiterate his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My comments were not specifically directed at amendment No. 64. I was responding to amendments Nos. 181 and 153A. However, it is clear that the Government must respond to the matter on Report, and when my hon. Friend has read what I said in Hansard, he may want to reflect on the matter and return to it on Report if he is not satisfied with my response on the quorum. I am sorry that my hon. Friend could not hear me, but that was due to the mechanics of the system and not to my voice. I hope that my hon. Friend will understand the thrust of my argument when he has read my response and the assurance that I gave to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone that the matter will be further considered on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I hope that the Minister is saying that he will reconsider the matter and table further amendments on Report. Will he confirm that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have explained that my response on the way in which the quorum will operate was directed at amendments Nos. 153A and 181, but not amendment No. 64. I set out my argument against the principle of amendment No. 64 and explained that its weakness was that it could result in a quorum of seven with only four people triggering an inquiry, which would be undesirable. I gave my reasons for believing that a simple majority of 10 out of 19 would be appropriate for a policing board within a devolved structure. Because of the gravity of an inquiry, it is not appropriate for a simple majority to trigger it.
<P>
The matter will be debated again on Report because of the need to re-examine some of my comments in response to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I am sorry to delay the Committee, which is the last thing I want, but my comments about amendment No. 64 concerned the capacity of the Policing Board to hold inquiries, not the quorum. The Minister mentioned 10, yet the Bill speaks of 12. Perhaps I missed something due to the noise behind me. I hope that he can assure me that the matter will be reconsidered on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> On our present thinking, 12 would be reduced to 10, which is a simple majority of 19. That change would trigger a further examination on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg the Committee's indulgence, but that is not a simple, but an absolute, majority. A simple majority is the majority of those present and voting. The Minister said that it is up to people to convince others. I agree, but how does one convince people who are not there? We have all had experience of that over many years.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This is becoming a bit of a dialogue. If I am using a term that has a different meaning to me than to the hon. Gentleman, I regret that. It is not unreasonable to require a majority of 19 members to agree on a very serious issue. Whether that is described as a simple, an absolute or an overall majority is neither here nor there: what is important is the practical effect of how the numbers stack up.
<P>
I accept that it is not easy to convince people who are not there. However, as the hon. Gentleman said when he spoke to the amendment, it is likely that there would be a full or good attendance at a committee hearing on a matter of such weight. In those circumstances, obtaining a majority of 10 out of 19 would not be unreasonable. Not to do so would introduce a different set of parameters and definitions. Under the amendment's proposal of a quorum of seven, it might be for the simple majority—to use the hon. Gentleman's terminology—to trigger an inquiry. That would not be helpful in dealing with a matter of such a heavyweight nature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I did not propose a number for the quorum; I am querying what that number should be. We should consider the merits of the amendment on the basis of its actual content.
<P>
People who did not wish an inquiry to take place would not have to vote: they could stay away, and prevent the inquiry by their absence. Unless the Minister can confirm that the matter will be reconsidered on Report, I should like to press amendment No. 64.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 64 will come up later in the proceedings, and there will be an opportunity to vote on it then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 37, line 31, leave out `or who has resigned'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 116, in page 37, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) A member of the Board who has resigned shall not be eligible for re-appointment until after a period of one year from the date of his resignation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 118, in page 40, line 16, leave out `or who has resigned'.
<P>
No. 119, in page 40, line 17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(10) A member of the Board who has resigned shall not be eligible for re-appointment until after a period of one year from the date of his resignation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The four amendments would affect the board however it was operating. For example, paragraph 4(6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A member of the Board whose term of office expires or who has resigned shall be eligible for re-appointment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have no problem with people whose term of office expires being entitled to reappointment. However, we have some difficulty with those who have resigned being so entitled. Amendment No. 115 would remove the words ``or who has resigned'' from the provision.
<P>
Amendment No. 116 would incorporate an additional paragraph requiring that a member of the board who had resigned would have to wait a year before becoming eligible for reappointment. It seems reasonable that someone who resigns because they are disaffected or disenchanted, or because they wish to make a political point, should not, having done so, be immediately eligible for reappointment. [Interruption.]
<P>
Amendments Nos. 118 and 119 apply to—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but the noise level is rising as other conversations are being carried on. I must ask the Committee to bear with whomever is speaking at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Amendments Nos. 118 and 119 would apply to the board when there is devolved government. We believe that, especially in those circumstances, those who resign should not be eligible for reappointment within one year. Someone with a political point to make could choose to resign just before a local government election, for example, to gain the publicity that might accrue from such a resignation, and then return to the board after the election. That would not be desirable. If anyone resigns from the board, whether an Assembly Member or a member from the population at large, they should wait for at least one year before becoming eligible for re-election.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth):</B> I join other hon. Members in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I am well acquainted with your tolerance, but I also know that it is not infinitely elastic, and that if we step out of order, we shall be treated accordingly.
{**p4
<p4**}The amendments that the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) has just moved would have the effect of limiting the Secretary of State's ability to reappoint a Policing Board member who had had to resign, perhaps for personal or family reasons, until a year had expired. The hon. Gentleman gave the example of a person who might resign just before a local government election in order to make a splash. He said that such a person might resign, fight the election— presumably expecting to gain some electoral benefit from his or her action—and afterwards quietly reapply and hope to be readmitted. <P>
I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the Secretary of State—by which I mean past, present and any future Secretaries of State that I can imagine—would consider such an action questionable and would think very carefully before reappointing someone who had taken it. I understand why the hon. Gentleman would feel apprehensive about creating an opportunity for people to treat the position as a disposable political activity for as long as it suited them, and from which they could gain some advantage. However, it must be borne in mind—I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman acknowledged this—that the amendments would apply purely to independent members. I accept entirely that independent members can have political axes to grind, and there may be circumstances in which they choose to do so.
<P>
Although the amendments do not appear unreasonable, they could have unintended consequences that no Committee member, including the hon. Members for West Tyrone and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, would wish to see. Let us consider their consequences for the person who, because of a family bereavement, has to take on exclusive parental responsibilities, but will eventually be able to make alternative child care arrangements. Another example is the person—whether self- employed or employed—who is required to put in additional time at work in the short term, and who feels it appropriate to resign until the problem is overcome. In such circumstances, neither the hon. Member for West Tyrone nor other Committee members would want such a restriction to appear on the statute. Although such cases might never arise in practice, one can argue that we should be able to recognise that they could.
<P>
In such cases, one should sometimes proceed with a little caution. The best way to deal with them is to allow the Secretary of State to retain the discretion that he enjoys under paragraph 3(5) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. For the sake of emphasis, it is worth repeating that, in the example that the hon. Member for West Tyrone quoted­or any other clear example of the abuse of a position of trust on the board—any Secretary of State would take into account such behaviour before considering reappointment. We should also bear in mind the fact that we are talking about independent members, rather than members nominated through the assembly and the executive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall add briefly to what my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone has said. I find the Minister's explanation of the provision rather puzzling. He implied that someone who has child-minding problems that can be resolved in, say, a month may be required to resign in the meantime and seek reappointment. I find that totally inadequate—it simply does not wash. The Minister also referred to the more tragic circumstance of a death in the family. He and I have sat on various boards, and we both know that, in tragic circumstances, there is always a degree of tolerance. People are not required to resign when there has been an upset of a tragic or domestic nature. The Minister's reasoning should be balanced with that of my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone. An independent member in the run up to an election might draw publicity to himself by resigning from the board in an attempt to bolster his electoral campaign. If he were unsuccessful in that campaign, he could seek to be placed on a list of nominees and have a claim, for whatever reason, for reinstatement. He might press for an inquiry into a particular police action and be refused, after which he could make a grand gesture and resign from the board. I have already discussed the situation involving an impending election.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Those factors are more realistic than the point that the Minister put to us—I am slightly surprised that he did so—about a person with a child-minding problem. He must consider this matter in the terms with which I chided his right hon. Friend the Minister of State when I pointed out that the Bill's primary purpose involved politics rather than law and order. He has heard that argument before and he will hear it again. He should not confuse the Bill's political nature with a minor domestic matter that we would be unlikely to encounter if we lived for 100 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman giving way or has he finished?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): Perhaps I misheard the Minister—in which case, I apologise and I shall accept his correction—but I understood part of his argument to be that the amendments will apply to independent members. As I read the Bill, that is the case with regard to amendments Nos. 118 and 119 but not with regard to amendments Nos. 115 and 116. Amendment No. 115 does not apply only to independent members.
<P>
As I said in our debates on previous amendments, my concern about the board's constitution is that it is in danger of lacking credibility and of commanding insufficient confidence. The amendments involve people adopting the trivial, superficial political ploy of resigning for headlines. The board's structure and terms of operation are supremely important. Including the one-year rule in the Bill accords with common sense and will go a little way towards injecting into the board the potential to create confidence—the Bill's drafting means that that is currently lacking.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In the light of what the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) suggested, the provision applies exclusively to independent members. We are discussing membership of the board during suspension of devolved government. Amendments Nos. 118 and 119 refer exclusively to independent members when there are both independent and political members on the board. In both instances, the Secretary of State will appoint independent members. The next amendment refers to reasonable constraints on political members and is intended to ensure that they do not make unreasonable gestures to disrupt the board or undermine confidence in the board's integrity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris </B>(Leominster): I want to make a plea for flexibility on behalf of the Secretary of State. As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said, this is a political Bill and many political circumstances could be responsible for resignation from the board during suspension of devolved government. That would make it even more political because, if devolved government were suspended, the peace process would be in trouble. If someone has resigned, his reappointment might help to get us out of that trouble. There could be a community split and a political party could order a member to resign. Fences may be mended and the Secretary of State may wish to reappoint the member who resigned for reasons not of his choosing. I love the idea of discipline and do not react against it, but it is more necessary for the Secretary of State to have some flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Savidge </B>(Aberdeen, North): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton.
<P>
Perhaps the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will consider some of the possibilities with which, as a former councillor, like me, he will be familiar. We are discussing not just maternity or bereavement, but the possibility of a family member having a prolonged illness and requiring care. The sick person might subsequently die and the carer might become available for reappointment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> If the hon. Gentleman looks carefully at our amendment, he will see that the word ``prolonged'' is catered for in so far as a period of one year is specified. A prolonged illness is more likely to last a year than for the period between the end of one Assembly and the re-election of another. There is not a huge difference between us and I am more convinced by the hon. Gentleman's use of the word ``prolonged''. We did not say that such a person could never be reappointed, but that a year would be a reasonable period of time before which that could happen, provided that the person's motives were honourable. If they were not honourable, that year would become a kind of penalty.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Benton. I had forgotten that I was making an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> If I may intervene on the intervention, Mr. Benton. We live in a world in which someone may resign because a close relative is very ill and needs care, and they do not know for how long their help will be required. Sometimes the illness comes to a tragic end in much less than a year; sometimes the person is cured and there is a happy ending. Alternatively, one may oneself become ill and then be cured.
<P>
It would be much more likely for a Secretary of State to reinstate someone who had been in that position. In the case of someone who resigns for frivolous reasons or for deliberate political reasons, as a demonstration, are we seriously to believe that a Secretary of State would be tempted to reappoint them to the board straight away so that they can play further games? We should be confident that he would show a fair degree of common sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Basingstoke said that I had misdescribed the effect of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I withdraw my comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman generously concedes that he was wrong. I noted that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone gallantly leapt to my defence in his speech.
<P>
Amendment No. 115 deals with a period of direct rule, in the course of which a different kind of board would be in place in any event. The subsequent amendment deals with the position of independents in other circumstances, which would be the normal arrangements, provided that devolution continues.
<P>
Despite his gallantry, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone misrepresented my comments about bereavement. I did not say that bereavement would be followed by child care arrangements, but that it could take a bereaved person several months to set up the necessary child care arrangements, in the course of which they might feel it appropriate to withdraw from their position in the knowledge that at some point in the future, having straightened matters out, they could reapply. The hon. Gentleman may still believe that to be inappropriate; I do not.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) provided another example. A person with a serious illness could find that within a matter of months the situation had changed and they felt more able to reassume the position.
<P>
I am giving these examples to illustrate the fact that it is as well to maintain a degree of discretion. My hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) made a good point, which I had not previously considered. In certain circumstances—which we have seen often enough in the recent past—the party, say, of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, or of my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh, may, for reasons of principle, find it necessary to withdraw from a particular part of the political process. When we suspended devolution, I am sure that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone appreciated that we had good reasons for doing so. In those circumstances, someone might feel it appropriate to resign on temporary basis in the hope that devolution would soon be up and running again. That person might take a principled stand on that, even though they were an independent. It should be accepted that those circumstances could arise. However, I entirely accept the points that the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone are trying to address.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I think that the Minister is wrong on that point. If for example, the Assembly were suspended—I do not look forward to those circumstances—the board would disappear and the Secretary of State would seek to re-appoint people. It would be possible for the person concerned, who thought that the suspension was wrong as a matter of principle, to say to the Secretary of State, ``By the way, I do not wish to be nominated for appointment to the board at this time. That is not to say that I would not wish to be nominated in the future.'' That would not entail an appointment and a resignation. On that point, the Minister is stretching the credibility of his argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Far be it from me to stretch the credibility of my argument or anyone else's. The difficulty in using examples is that there is never one that really fits. However, the principle of what I am saying is right. The nine independents on the board would fall, but the intention would probably be to reappoint them automatically. In those circumstances, they might feel that it was appropriate to withdraw for a short period in a spirit of solidarity, for political reasons, because of the general political climate. That climate might change, and they might then feel it appropriate to go back. I am not saying that that is likely to happen. No particular set of circumstances that we are discussing is necessarily going to happen. However, it could happen, which is why there is strength in allowing discretion in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): It is always possible in a longish Committee for a Member to miss a point that has been raised, and I am quite ready to be corrected.
<P>
I have been reflecting that it is not unusual in local government for a person's membership to lapse if he fails to attend to his duties for a period of, let us say, six months. I cannot recall having covered this ground before. Would the Under-Secretary regard extended non-attendance as susceptible to sub-paragraph (5)(e)? If a member had not attended the board for six months, would he be deemed either ``unable or unfit''? Will the Under-Secretary cover this point now? I realise that it is not directly connected to the point that he was addressing. Is it intended to have a mechanism in the Bill whereby membership of the board could lapse through non-attendance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I have not had time to check the provision to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but, from memory, I think that he is right. In fact, I am able to confirm that the provision is contained in paragraph 4(5)(d) and (e).
<P>
I can confirm from my time in local government that such arrangements applied there—the hon. Gentleman has reminded me. This might be constructive in relation to the arguments put forward by the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone. I remember being a member of Huyton urban district council in 1973— 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I did not know that the hon. Gentleman was that old.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will come to that in a minute. Many Committee members will remember that, during that period, the Heath Administration introduced the contentious Housing Finance Act 1972. Perhaps somewhat foolishly, we entered into the local elections on a promise that under no circumstances would we implement the 1972 Act, which would have led to a rent rise of 50p—or ten shillings, as it perhaps was in those days. However, we were told in no uncertain terms by the town clerk, who was the legal officer for the local authority, that we would break the law if we kept our election pledge. In the circumstances, Labour members of the council—including me—resigned their seats and contested them again in the subsequent by-election, which was held a matter of weeks later.
<P>
One could argue that we salvaged our principles by resigning and standing again for election. The issue was one of principle—we had made a promise that we could not keep, so we resubmitted ourselves to the electorate. I realise that those circumstances were different, but they support the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster. He said that, although one might act on a matter of principle, it does not necessarily follow that one would be ineligible on future occasions. Indeed, I am pleased to say that, on the occasion to which I referred, the electorate decided to give me a further lease of life on Huyton urban district council, albeit on a much reduced turnout.
<P>
I want to conclude by reiterating that, although I fully understand their reasoning, any statute bar of the type that hon. Members are proposing can prove heavy-handed. It would simply make us peer into the future to determine a particular set of circumstances, when we all know that one cannot do that. I recognise that there is no major disagreement between us in principle, but this is precisely the sort of matter for which discretion is preferable to a statute bar. The hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone referred to those who blatantly abuse their position, and we would all agree that any Secretary of State would take that into account in considering their reappointment. In that respect, there is little principled disagreement between us, and I hope that the hon. Member for West Tyrone will accept that the best way to deal with the matter is to leave discretion with the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I have listened with interest to all the comments on the amendments. Of course, in cases of sickness and emergency, members often do not need to resign: they simply absent themselves for a time and return when the emergency is over. I have also listened with interest to the Under-Secretary's response, and I am delighted to discover that he, like all politicians, sometimes has to acknowledge that he has not got matters right. Sometimes, we all act foolishly.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I should tell the hon. Gentleman—I allow him to draw his own conclusions—that I was 22 at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Sometimes it is in our youth that we must learn from experience, especially in politics. When we make mistakes, we generally have to live with the consequences, and one hopes that we learn from them.
<P>
This has been a useful debate, and some attention should be given to the question of non-attendance. Although the Bill states that the Secretary of State can remove a member if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>he has failed to comply with the terms of his appointment,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
there is nothing to suggest that his terms of appointment will include business that involves missing many meetings. We reserve the right to raise this matter at a later date. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 117, in page 38, leave out line 33 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`confirming to the Secretary of State that he complies with sub-„paragraph 7(3) declaring—
<P>
``I hereby do solemnly and sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will faithfully fulfil my duties as a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board with fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I give notice at the outset that this is not a probing amendment—it is of the utmost importance. It relates to the position of political members of the board once devolved government is in place. It states that the nominated person may take up office as a member of the board by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>confirming to the Secretary of State that he complies with sub-„paragraph 7(3) and declaring—
<P>
``I hereby do solemnly and sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will faithfully fulfil my duties as a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board with fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Earlier today, we discovered—perhaps ``confirmed'' would be a better word, because it was no great discovery—that political members of the Policing Board could be people who were elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly and who had the most heinous criminal record. The amendment will not get us over that huge difficulty.
<P>
There is a debate about whether the present police oath is adequate, and there is a proposal to introduce a new one for new members of the Northern Ireland police force. Some people want the new oath to apply to policemen and policewomen who have already taken an oath. Similarly, it is not unreasonable for political members to take an oath.
<P>
The oath in the amendment is derived from that which will be taken by new recruits to the RUC or the police service in Northern Ireland. That is not an answer to our concern about political people who can become members of the board but it is a means to realise the good intentions—the metamorphosis—that Labour Members have told me I should believe will occur. I understand why they hold their head in their hands, or keep their heads down.
<P>
We need a police service that delivers on law and order. Although the hon. Member for Leominster said a few moments ago that the Bill was not about law and order but about politics and political accommodation, just as I feared, we want to get something out of it that will reassure ordinary men and women in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
By insisting that political members in a devolved situation make a commitment not dissimilar to that which will be required of new police recruits, we are asking for little change to the Bill. That will not apply to independent members, because we have been given the reassurance, which I take at face value, that the Secretary of State will be assiduous in the way in which he selects and appoints independent members from lists of nominees.
<P>
An oath is an oath. If the amendment is carried, the provision will apply only to political members during a period of devolution. The expectation that those board members will have of the police service should be reciprocal. Therefore, this is an opportunity to accept a sensible and sincere effort by my party to enhance the Bill and give a vestige of confidence to the law-„abiding members of our society, who will otherwise view the board and that element of it with concern and scepticism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I well understand the direction from which the hon. Gentleman is coming on this point, but I shall try to explain it in this way. The provision exists for constables, not just in Northern Ireland, but throughout the United Kingdom because of the functions that they perform. It does not apply to others, who would serve on other boards in other ways. It separates the role, functions and responsibilities of a constable from those of other members, whether they are political appointments, as in the case of the 10 members that the hon. Gentleman described, or independents.
<P>
To put the onus on only 10 of the 19 members, as the hon. Gentleman is arguing, may suggest that there is suspicion about their integrity and commitment. I understand the motivation, but I would not sign up to it, because in establishing the Policing Board, we are not suggesting that everyone must be viewed with suspicion and uncertainty or that they will not deliver or act in the best interests of the greater number. The implication is that they are not to be trusted. If they are not to be trusted on the board, they should not be trusted to be in the Assembly, which brings us back to our previous reasoning.
<P>
The ballot box has spoken, people have given a certain party a mandate and, from that mandate, 10 people will be selected to serve on the Policing Board. The judgment, as I said earlier, rests not only with the Secretary of State but with the Assembly to decide how people are performing. Discipline would come into play. If people act in a wrong and partial way, others in the Assembly are likely to pass judgment on their conduct. That is part of the democratic forum.
<P>
Importantly, under paragraph 9(1)(d) the Secretary of State has the power to remove a member from the board if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>he is otherwise unable or unfit to discharge his functions as a member of the Board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill, if safeguards are required.
<P>
How would the hon. Gentleman reach the conclusion that someone was in breach of the board? I would argue that his approach would not be dissimilar to the Secretary of State's judgment about whether someone was carrying out their functions properly. Therefore, there are sufficient safeguards. Taking the oath implies that some discipline must follow. It is as simple as saying that the members have taken the oath and the Secretary of State makes a judgment by himself without further definition of how the oath has been breached.
<P>
The same applies to constables anywhere in the United Kingdom. They take oaths and are subject to disciplinary codes and all the measures that protect not only our citizens but those who serve on behalf of them. There is an important range of checks and balances for constables. I believe that paragraph 9(1)(d) contains a sufficient safeguard.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman must answer this question: how would he lay down the criteria against which to judge those 10 democratically accountable members who have taken the oath and have been appointed? On the basis of the arguments that he has advanced, I would not be minded to accept the amendment. I therefore ask him to seek to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister poses questions that I shall endeavour to answer, and I might pose one or two myself.
<P>
The political people who will be on the Policing Board present us with a huge dilemma. I believe that the Minister's logic is fundamentally wrong when he says that, because people are elected to a political forum and allowed to sit on it, they should be allowed to sit on a policing board. The two things are not comparable. How do people have access to the forum? They have access to the forum through a number of commitments that they must give in respect of it. It may not be an oath, but it is certainly a commitment. Why should they not have a similar commitment to the Policing Board? Let the Minister tell me that.
<P>
The Minister seems to fail to recall the reality of terrorism, and forgets about policemen who have betrayed colleagues over the past 30 years, about prison officers who have betrayed colleagues over the past 30 years and about civil servants who have betrayed colleagues over the past 30 years. I do not want to mention many names, but I remind him of deputy governor McConnell and of an Ulster Defence Regiment officer called Toombes. Over the past 30 years there have been many examples of betrayal by people in positions of trust. Some such people are Members of the Assembly and could become members of the Policing Board—there has not been a metamorphosis.
<P>
The Minister might say that he will not establish the new Policing Board until there has been a significant start to the disarmament process, but he and I are aware of the problems of putting time scales to such matters. I do not want to embarrass him or to create more difficulties for him than he already has as a Minister—[Interruption.] I am not sure why he finds that funny—there are huge difficulties with disarmament and the way in which we shall convince ourselves that a metamorphosis has occurred. We need a way to establish whether we are moving towards the normality that he envisages.
<P>
We should not put the people whom I mentioned earlier on the Policing Board until there is tangible evidence that they have reacted positively to current political accommodations. With respect, the Minister should be more careful when he tempts us—he said that they were on a forum and the Policing Board. If they are not on the forum and we do not provide an opportunity for metamorphosis, our society may be condemned to more of what we experienced during the past 30 years.
<P>
That approach should not apply to the administration of law and order in Northern Ireland. The Minister asked whether I believed that the Secretary of State would discharge his responsibilities under paragraph 9(1)(d). He can do so only when he is presented with evidence, but he views evidence through the wrong end of a telescope and puts that end of the telescope to his blind eye. I do not have huge confidence that he will fare better with political members of the Policing Board than we did with regard to the organisations that are still engaged in violence in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Minister asked how I should decide whether the oath had been infringed. We could use the same approach as is involved in establishing whether a police officer has infringed the oath. If the Minister does not agree, he should explain why. I fear that his argument is that there is and always has been discipline in the police and that policing involves a process that allows discipline to be imposed, but there will not be any discipline on the Policing Board. No questions will be asked and people, whatever their integrity or lack of it, whatever their impartiality or partiality, whatever their fairness or unfairness, will be appointed willy-nilly to be in charge of the police. How can I or the Committee be expected to accept that?
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Making a commitment is not foolproof, but there is something about it, whether it is a commitment to marriage, to the House or whatever. We are failing to impose a significant commitment on people from dubious backgrounds. Why does the Minister want to impose on Northern Ireland such laxity and unfairness in the political element of the Policing Board? Are we abandoning all sense of propriety? Does it not matter any more? Is it acceptable for people in Northern Ireland to have a fifth-rate system of policing and administration as long as the tentacles of corruption and criminality are contained within Northern Ireland? There can be no other explanation for the Minister's conclusive rejection of a reasonable expectation, not on my part, but on the part of ordinary men and women in Northern Ireland who believed that there really would be a new beginning and that they would never again have to accept the diktats of people running around their housing estates with guns and bullying them into accepting the most primitive law and order imposed by terrorists. Such a new beginning must start with the Policing Board, not on the housing estates. The lead must be given by the various institutions that the Government have put in place, and if they fall down in that, there is little hope—

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman has lived in Northern Ireland almost as long as I have, and during that period there has been no scarcity of oaths affecting all forms of administration, professions and so on. Does he believe that that plethora of oaths created greater loyalty to the institutions to which they were taken, or contributed to stability in Northern Ireland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Bluntly, the answer is yes. The hon. Gentleman and I, throughout our lives, have not given promises and pledges lightly, or without consideration of what was intended, but I am prepared to accept that he feels that pledges and oaths mean nothing. I hope that when we reach the part of the Bill that deals with the new oath for the police, we shall look at the example of those who have honourably discharged their duties as policemen on the basis of the oath that they now take, an oath to uphold law and order. I do not know how an oath that promises to uphold law and order differs greatly from an oath that pledges to uphold human rights. I should have thought that the former, which encompasses law and order, and is complete and based on human rights, was probably better.
<P>
If I accept what the hon. Gentleman says about what is in an oath, I will expect that, when it comes to this quibble as to whether we should re-swear our existing constables, he will confound us all with his silence
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> But not at the moment, I see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Not at the moment. The hon. Gentleman is not addressing the point that I put to him, as is his right. I take oaths very seriously, but I believe that those who take the job seriously will show it through fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality, and not by the words that they say.
<P>
Will the hon. Gentleman also consider the terms of the amendment? Can he imagine people arriving and saying, ``Knock, knock, dear Mr. Secretary of State. I am glad to get you here, because I have come to attest to you this oath that you require of me.'' That is taking the matter to extremes, but in recent times even the Lord Chancellor was found to be remiss in requiring oaths of people to be appointed as Queen's Counsels. We should consider experience and recognise that fairness, impartiality and integrity are not shown by what people say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The difficulty with that is that the hon. Gentleman is not comparing like with like. He is talking about whether a specific oath is appropriate to a specific situation. I am talking about what we can expect from board members. To a degree, the Bill already includes such a provision. Paragraph 7(4) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The nominated person may take up office as a member of the Board by making a statement to that effect to the Secretary of State.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am simply enhancing that paragraph by applying to it the sort of language that makes the hon. Gentleman and me pause and consider what we are undertaking before we make the commitment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and I could keep this debate going for a considerable time longer. It is not my intention to do so. It is my intention to measure the Government's intent and good will in terms of how they deal with the difficulty of ex-terrorists, to put it bluntly, and other criminals being appointed as political members of the Policing Board.
<P>

<H4><center>[MR. EDWARD O'HARA in the Chair.]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There is a fundamental difference between myself and the hon. Gentleman on this issue. I do not see members of the board in the same light as constables. They have different functions to perform, as I have tried to explain. Police officers are part of the formal criminal justice system, providing protection against wrongdoers in society. They assist in bringing people to justice. The whole principle of their having to attest as constables is a long-established practice in this country.
<P>
I genuinely believe that it would be wrong to try to elevate those with a democratic responsibility for the management of the system to that level, especially in the way in which the hon. Gentleman has proposed. He has particularised the requirement to the politically appointed members of the board because he obviously has deep suspicions, to which he is entitled, about the way in which some of those people might perform their functions. However, he has not proved the case.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's suspicions may be based, in his view, on a very detailed knowledge of the history of events, and perhaps even on the history of the individuals who might take up the appointments, but that does not necessarily prove that those individuals would not perform their duties in a rational, impartial, structured and properly discursive way on any body on which they served. We must take all those factors into account. That is where the difference between us lies.
<P>
Furthermore, the people appointed to the board will have to go through another fundamental test: they will have to obtain a mandate from the people. They will have to pass the test of the ballot box to get into the Assembly and on the board. They will, therefore, be judged in a number of ways. They will undoubtedly be judged by their peers in the Assembly, and ultimately by the electorate. People have the power of the ballot box to remove those whom they have elected to represent their interests, if they are not performing their duties. That is certainly a powerful discipline on those elected in this part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
An additional test will exist in the role of the Secretary of State, who will have the perhaps onerous job of forming judgments on whether people are fulfilling their functions. That will not be an easy task. If my knowledge and experience of Northern Ireland amounts to anything, the minute certain people are appointed to the board, others will say that they should not be there and should be removed before even being tested. Every time that such board members say or do something, it will be alleged that they are acting in a partial way because of their traditions and culture, when in fact a member might have made a statement or a decision for other reasons.
<P>
We are not suspending our knowledge on these matters. We must try to envisage a different time scale into which all these provisions are to be placed. They are not all being visited on Northern Ireland now. The Bill has to receive Royal Assent and we have to go through the process of appointing the Board, which is likely to exist in its shadow format some time next year, and be fully functioning by April next year, according to the current time scale. We are some way away from that eventuality.
<P>
If the gloom and doom scenario suggested by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone turns into a reality at that time, we shall have to make further judgments then. That is why we have had to take account of the possibility of a direct rule Policing Board. The underlying principle is that a Policing Board is as essential as the Police Authority. The Government are trying to deal with the practical realities that exist now. They will look at the eventualities, but also travel inspired with considerable hope that what the people of Northern Ireland want will be reflected in those who have been appointed and elected to serve in their interests. There is no question but that this is a very important task that members will be asked to perform.
<P>
<H5>6 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Another mechanism that we shall apply in relation to the board is that of transparency in what it does. It will act in the name of all the citizens of Northern Ireland, not on behalf of the individual cultures and traditions from which its members originate. If people are to perform their jobs properly, they must be mindful of that. That expectation applies to their jobs on the Policing Board as much as to their jobs in the Northern Ireland Assembly.
<P>
I do not think that I will be able to convince the hon. Gentleman of the merits of my argument. I hope that he does not want to press the amendment to a vote, but that is a matter for his judgment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendment No. 66, in page 43, line 15, leave out `(7)' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7A)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 139.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The amendment is designed to bring the Bill into line with Patten, who expressly required that the primary function of the Policing Board should be to hold the Chief Constable publicly to account. Patten also recommended that the Policing Board should meet publicly at least once a month, but the Bill as drafted does not impose such a duty. Given the weight attached by Patten to transparency, we believe that to be a serious omission. I look forward to the hearing the Under-Secretary's comments on Government amendment No. 139, because it seems that the Government are moving towards fulfilling the Patten recommendation. However, I shall wait until he has spoken before forming a firm opinion.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Let me say at the outset that I accept the argument that the board should be open in its dealings with the public, as should the police, for that matter. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh made clear, paragraph 6.36 of the Patten report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recommend that the Policing Board should meet in public once a month, to receive a report from the Chief Constable. We suggest that meetings should from time to time be held outside Belfast, so as to give the Policing Board a visible profile throughout Northern Ireland. Minutes of Policing Board meetings and Board papers should be publicly available except where the public interest would be damaged.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, paragraph 15(7) to schedule 1—which amendment No. 66 would remove, and which amendment No. 65 would replace with a new sub-paragraph—is not designed for that purpose. It provides for the board to establish procedures for requesting reports from the Chief Constable, and is therefore concerned not with open meetings but with the board's having transparent and regular proceedings, which I am sure we would all welcome. Sub-paragraph (7) is therefore necessary and should not be deleted, as amendment No. 66 would do.
<P>
As I said, we support the principle of open public meetings. We had intended to cover the matter in the code of practice that was to be issued under clause 25. Our intention was to set minimum standards, to require meetings to be held in public and to set out the circumstances in which the public would have been excluded. However, as a result of discussions with my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh, and after reflecting on amendment No. 65, I am persuaded that this is an issue of substance, which we shall continue to examine.
<P>
I hope that, in the circumstances, my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh will agree that amendment No. 65 is a little short on detail. Government amendment No. 139 seeks to flesh out the provision and is based on arrangements that apply under the Local Government Act 1972 in Northern Ireland. I therefore ask my hon. Friend to withdraw amendment No. 65 and not to press amendment No. 66 to a vote. Given that we want to achieve the same kind of outcome, I hope that the Committee will agree to accept Government amendment No. 139.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I have listened carefully to the Under-Secretary and, on this occasion, I agree that his amendment is much better. It is fuller and more complete, and it fulfils the requirement of Patten in a more than adequate way. It is, therefore, with pleasure that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

THE CHAIRMAN, being of the opinion that the principle of the schedule and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68, That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.
<P>
Question agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 1, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of functions, assets, liabilities and staff of Police Authority for Northern Ireland</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 45, line 24, leave out `or the Board'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 140.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> This is a technical amendment which aims to fix a defect in the drafting of the Bill. Schedule 2 deals with the transfer of assets, liabilities and staff of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland to the Policing Board. Paragraph 4 of the schedule deals with the transfer of staff directly employed by PANI, whether they work for the police or for PANI, but not the transfer of seconded civil servants, who are dealt with in paragraph 5. Clearly, the staff concerned must have their employment transferred, as PANI is to be abolished. Paragraph 4 does this in conformity with the standard TUPE provisions.
<P>
Paragraph 4(6) allows a person to object to the transfer, in which case they would not be transferred, but neither would they receive redundancy payments, which is the main point of the provision. As drafted, sub-paragraph (6) states that a person can lodge an objection with the authority or with the board—in other words, with his or her present or prospective employer. That makes no sense, because authority staff can raise an objection to being transferred only with their present employer—the authority. Once transferred to the board, there would be no point in objecting, because the transfer would already have taken place. Amendment No. 85 will rectify the problem by deleting the phrase that would allow authority staff to object to the board about being transferred.
<P>
Amendment No. 140 will rectify a defective reference; it will have no substantive effect. Although these issues are technical and difficult to explain, I hope that Committee members agree that they should nevertheless be put right.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Why did the draftsman insert the phrase ``or the Board''? Given that he must have had a reason for doing so, why is the phrase no longer deemed necessary? I understand the logic of the Under-Secretary's argument, but I suspect that the draftsman had something else in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I cannot explain what was in anyone's mind at a given time, and the hon. Gentleman, who is something of an amateur psychologist, probably realises that I cannot. I think that a simple, honest-to-goodness mistake was made, which the amendments try to rectify. I do not think that there was a sinister motive or hidden agenda behind the drafting; rather, there was a failure to recognise a consequence of the wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Perhaps the draftsman had in mind those who come to the conclusion that they should not have transferred. As the provision is currently drafted, they would be able to inform the board that they were not happy. In the light of the amendment, I presume that that possibility will be excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is not necessarily the case. The hon. Gentleman is searching for a conspiracy that does not exist. As I said, I shall not speculate what might have been in anyone's mind—the amendment simply corrects a defect. Policy decisions, on which parliamentary counsel act, failed to take account of a consequence of the schedule as drafted. The policy was always clear; there was simply an inadvertent drafting error, which we are trying to put right. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman smells neither a rat nor a conspiracy.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 1, line 14, leave out `force' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`service'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have experience of such matters through participation in a similar Committee. The Patten report refers throughout to the police service. The same applies to the Good Friday agreement, from which the Patten report derives. I fail to understand why the term ``police service'' is not used in the Bill. That is not a matter of semantics or of splitting hairs—it goes to the heart of Patten and the Good Friday agreement. The Bill should refer to a police service rather than a police force.
<P>
There may be good drafting reasons for the Government's approach. However, I am puzzled by the fact that clause 69 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the police force'' means . . . the police service; and . . . the police service reserve.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It might appear that that requirement had been hidden away at the end of the Bill where no one will see it. That clause defines the phrase, ``police force'', which is used throughout the Bill.
<P>
I have tabled only one amendment on this matter, but the phrase crops up throughout the Bill. If the amendment were agreed to, the matter would be followed through consequentially. It might be necessary to add a clause to the Bill stating that ``police force'' means ``police service''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not unsympathetic to my hon. Friend's point. We debated this matter during the passage of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, when the same arguments were raised. I argued that the matter involved the ethos of the police service, not the use of the word ``force''.
<P>
We had difficulties drafting the Bill because we use the word ``police service'' to mean regular police officers—it is necessary to distinguish regular officers from their reserve colleagues. ``Police force'' was the only option that was left to the Government as the umbrella term for reservists and regulars.
<P>
Having said that, I am conscious of the weight of the argument about removing the ethos from the police service and the suggestion that the Bill should refer to the police service rather than the police force. I cannot accept the amendment because, in one sense, it is technically flawed. As my hon. Friend said, we should have to change all instances in the Bill in which the phrase ``police force'' was used.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend will allow me to consider his argument. If there is a better way to solve the matter, we shall come forward on Report with an appropriate amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I am prepared to wait until Report. I remind the Minister that clause 69 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the police force'' means . . . the police service; and . . . the police service reserve.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If both our memories serve us well, the problem is that the distinction involves those members of the police service who are not actively involved in policing functions, traffic wardens, for example, fall into that category. There is a third category of people, including civil servants. The matter should be tidied up once and for all. If we are creating the Police Service of Northern Ireland, we might even get round to calling it that one day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am a little surprised that the hon. Gentleman has raised this semantic point, which has little relevance. I am even more surprised that the Minister—given his inability so far to accept substantial points—should cede the matter so easily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I am opposed to the change. I have always believed that it is wrong to call the police the police service, because it gives the wrong impression to the public at large. The prime responsibility of the police is to enforce the law, irrespective of colour, class or creed. Calling the police a service gives the general public the impression that the police are there to serve them and, to some extent, to do what they think that they should do. That is the wrong impression to give. The police should be called a force, because that is exactly what they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's flow. As he has so kindly educated me in the ways of his Province, I wonder if I might refer to the example of London. In London, we do not have a Metropolitan police force, but the Metropolitan police service. The change was debated extensively a few years ago, and several suggestions were proposed—of which ``the guards'' was one—but we chose Metropolitan police service. The police are happy with that, as, by and large, are the people of this city. It is symbolic, but it is a very important symbol.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Perhaps we are now beginning to live with the consequences of changing the name of the Metropolitan police force to the Metropolitan police service, because it is now beginning to encounter problems of reduced morale as a result.
<P>
In certain respects, the police give a service and help out. There have been many occasions on which officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary have helped people in distress, to whom they have had to take very sad news. The Royal Ulster Constabulary has been congratulated throughout Northern Ireland on the way in which it has carried out those service duties. However, the police are primarily an enforcement agency, and the people for whom they are responsible must realise that. Once the police are called a service, people start to say, ``You have to do what we say'', ``You can't do that because we don't like it'' or, ``You are supposed to be here to serve us''. That is the wrong message to give to the public, which is why I oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I am pleased with my hon. Friend the Minister's reply and I am broadly sympathetic with the amendment. The police service is a service and I oppose what the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) said. The concept of service is important and it would be wrong to continue to use the word ``force''. The amendment is consistent with the recommendations of the Patten report and, if the drafting technicalities can be overcome, it would benefit the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If I thought that a long discussion of the new approach to policing in the United Kingdom would convince the hon. Member for West Tyrone, we could have one, but I shall try to shorten what could be a heavy debate. The concept is not new and has not been dreamt up for political correctness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That is exactly where it comes from.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall quote from Rowan and Mayne, who were the Commissioners of the Metropolitan police from 1829. They said that a police officer,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>whilst prompt to prevent crime and arrest criminals, must also look upon himself as the servant and guardian of the general public.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means providing a service—
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me finish my point.
<P>
The concept is not new and comment has been made of the way in which the debate has evolved recently in the metropolitan area of London. I am sure that the word ``service'' could be found in the description of other police forces in the United Kingdom. Police officers want the new approach, which was precipitated by public demand. Police officers are not remote from the public; they must have regard to what the public need, want and think of those who act in their interests.
<P>
We could have a long debate on the matter, but I stated the Government's position when I was responsible for the Committee stage of the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill in 1998. The same philosophy should have prevailed then but did not, and ``force'' continued to be the description. We have waited a long time—since 1829—for the change, but we hope to get it right in the Bill and for the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Minister's quotation stated that the primary duty of the police is to prevent crime. No one has denied that the police must sometimes give a service, but their prime responsibility and duty are to prevent crime and maintain the law. That is why they should continue to be described as a police force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Having condemned others for semantics, perhaps I should not make this point, but I suggest that the Minister is wrong to confuse provision of a service with being a servant. Every police officer is a public servant and provides a service to the public, but he does so in the context of a set of rules—what we call the law. I fear that, in presenting it in this way, the Minister is suggesting that the police force should be reactive, first and foremost, to the demands of the people that it serves. That would weaken the police. It suggests that, if people in one part of Northern Ireland demand a certain service, it is delivered as that group wants it, but if people in another area demand a different service, it is delivered as they require it. Where is the consistency and the reassurance?
<P>
The Minister talked earlier, as did I, about individual police officers being disciplined, but there is also a need for corporate discipline in the police force. It is the fact that it is a police force that imposes that corporate discipline on a constabulary: it is disciplined in the context of the law overall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Are our armed forces referred to in every Act of Parliament as ``our armed forces'' or ``our armed services''? Does the hon. Gentleman believe that whether they are referred to as ``armed forces'' or ``armed services'' has a great effect on their morale or discipline? Indeed, given the comment by his hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone, does he think that it has an enormous effect on morale or that most members of our armed forces are the slightest bit aware how they are referred to in Acts of Parliament?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I cannot help the hon. Gentleman on that. I suspect that the Royal Air Force is called the Royal Air Force and not the royal air service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lewisham, West): What about the SAS, which is the Special Air Service, rather than the special air force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am trying not to be rude to hon. Members. I am not comparing our armed services with our police services. I am trying to convey the impression that will be given if we remove the idea of corporate discipline that comes with calling the police force exactly that.
<P>
I have no huge prejudice about whether we call it the police service or the police force, but I have a prejudice against the arguments that are being put to try to accomplish the change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> If we were to follow the hon. Gentleman's point logically, the Metropolitan police service would be undermined in the same way, but there is no evidence that it has been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> With respect, there is overwhelming evidence that the morale and corporate discipline of the Metropolitan police service have been undermined over a number of years. The hon. Gentleman would do well to speak to someone like Commander Grieve and ask him to—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We should not go down the path of discussing morale in the Metropolitan police service, though one might make a passing reference to it. I ask the hon. Gentleman to return to the distinction between ``force'' and ``service'', as it applies to the police in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I note your guidance on the issue, Mr. O'Hara, but I told the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) that his question provokes a truthful response. I may have an opportunity on another occasion to expand on what I was saying.
<P>
Morale is being lowered among virtually all constabularies throughout the United Kingdom—that is not peculiar to the Metropolitan police and the RUC. It has become much more difficult for our constabulary in Northern Ireland to carry out its duties over 30 very difficult years. It is difficult at present, and will be so in the immediate future, in terms of the mafia culture to which I have already alluded. Other police forces are experiencing the same kind of difficulties, for different reasons. If the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh were to press the amendment to a vote, I am not sure that we would oppose him on the basis of the name, so much as on the basis that his argument to justify the change is flawed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh will not press the amendment to a vote. This is a matter of drafting. I shall make one further point, on which he briefly dwelt, concerning an inconsistency in the Bill.
<P>
Far more profound provisions in the Bill clearly stipulate that, before the Secretary of State eventually christens the police force, it shall be known as the police service. Therefore, it is inconsistent to refer to it throughout the Bill as the police force and, at the end of the Bill, to state that it is to be known as the police service. In that spirit, I believe that this is a good amendment and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will look at it further, although this is, admittedly, a drafting matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): Ignore that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Tempting.
<P>
I have expressed my sympathy for the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh. In response to the hon. Member for West Tyrone, let me say that I have sympathy with some of the general thrust of his arguments about what the functions of the police should be. Those functions are set out in clause 30, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It shall be the general duty of members of—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in this case, the Bill uses the term ``the police force''—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to protect life and property;
<P>
(b) to preserve order;
<P>
(c) to prevent the commission of offences;
<P>
(d) where an offence has been committed, to take measures to bring the offender to justice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no difference of opinion between the hon. Gentleman and me on what the functions of the police should be. We are debating a generic term to describe them. The whole concept of service, and the way in which the community should respond to the police and vice versa, has been around for a long time. It has now picked up some pace—not because of Northern Ireland—and has been debated not only in metropolitan London, but elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<P>
It is healthy that those whom the police serve, in whatever form, are saying what they would like from their police. The police are saying that they have learnt lessons over the years about how to perform their duties and functions, and how to engage in a closer relationship with the wider community. That is a healthy debate. Any police officer who is dedicated and committed to his or her job understands that driving force. This is about that point of engagement with the wider community. If they constantly thought of themselves as a force, it would negate all the good work that good police officers do in encouraging more participation with the police in discharging their functions.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh appeared to accept the spirit in which I responded to him. I hope that Opposition Members will reflect on our approach, listen to their constituents and talk to police officers—they probably do so anyway—to establish what they think. They want to be seen to be a force, not a service, and their views should play an important part in our deliberations.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The contributions to this debate were enormously interesting, especially that of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. His view of what policing involves is almost an anachronism. He uses the term ``constabulary'', which is of little relevance nowadays, and he discussed the mafia culture in the north of Ireland. Constabularies—those highly professional guys who bashed the square in hobnailed boots—will not deal with the people who are involved in such operations. Nowadays, recruits come from university with expertise in law or accountancy—they can deal with the modern day. We must take such changes into account when we debate the important provisions about training. I do not deny the validity or veracity of the hon. Gentleman's view of the constabulary, and I recognise the affection that underlies his comments. I am of the generation that watched ``Dixon of Dock Green'' on a Saturday. I can still remember the mood music—[HON. MEMBERS: ``Give us a tune.''] Dixon has now been replaced by the slick guys, who never don a uniform and never bash their feet on the square. Their's is a new world, and the amendment is intended to get us into it.
<P>
I caution Committee members to treat carefully the fact that the Bill contains the name of the police service. It used to be the RUC and it almost became the Northern Ireland Police Service. Look at what it is now.
<P>
In anticipation of the Government's efforts on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

I may have been promoted this evening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> The hon. Gentleman is asteroid man.
<P>
<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> We should leave asteroids out of this debate, or I might start talking about the Omagh observatory.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 144 and 148 relate to human rights. Amendment No. 144 would add to the Bill the requirement to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>operate in accordance with international human rights standards and norms.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Patten recommended that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>performance of the police as a whole in respect of human rights, as in other respects, should be monitored closely by the Policing Board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Later, the report adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Procedures to secure compliance with the law and with international human rights standards and norms are thus an important safeguard both to the public and to the police officers in carrying out their duties.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is thus clear that Patten put a high premium on explicitly aligning Northern Ireland's police service—whatever it is to be called—with human rights conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that traffic wardens should operate in the rather high-flown way that he suggests?
<P>
<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> Absolutely. If a traffic warden were to violate the international standards of human rights—in respect of racism, sectarianism or anything else—we should all have something to say about it. Having recently had an exchange with a traffic warden, I can say that, at least in London, they operate to the highest standards of probity and listened to my argument very reasonably before giving me a ticket.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Is it not the case that the Human Rights Act 1998 is incorporated, and therefore operational in the Northern Ireland context? On that basis, does the hon. Gentleman agree that to be efficient and effective, traffic wardens would have to comply with the 1998 Act, and that there is a danger of lawyers using words such as ``otiose'' and ``surplusage'' in that regard?
<P>
<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> I remind the Committee that English is not my first language. Certainly, the language of lawyers has never been at all clear to me. English is my second language, and Latin my third.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggests that this is overkill. That is fair enough, but clearly I do not agree—otherwise I would not have tabled the amendment. This matter is largely about trust. We must ensure that people who have felt disenfranchised from the activities of the police can see an explicit assurance that human rights standards will be respected. I understand the hon. Gentleman's comment about traffic wardens. However, to be serious, we must assume that public servants—whether they are traffic wardens, members of the police or civil servants—will genuinely accept the standards that we are trying to implement. On a positive note, we have the opportunity, as the Secretary of State has said, to make Northern Ireland a model of human rights, not merely as good as the rest of the United Kingdom—so much so that we may import some of the things that are done in Northern Ireland back to the rest of the UK.
<P>
I differ with the view that the amendment is otiose or overkill. It is useful to be explicit. It is easy for us to use these words now, but the time when they will become important is when there is a conflict involving an accusation that the police have not fulfilled their human rights responsibilities. For that reason—and, especially, because Patten made such specific recommendations—I believe that it would not be going too far to include the words of the amendment in the Bill.
<P>
Responsibility for human rights is not sufficiently met simply by asking the Policing Board to monitor the performance of the police's compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998, as the Bill currently requires. For example, the Association of Chief Police Officers' guidelines on the use of plastic bullets refer to United Nations standards on the use of force—but those standards are not addressed in the 1998 Act, and would therefore fall outwith the board's responsibility unless the Bill is amended in the way that we propose.
<P>
We welcome the Bill's explicit reference to the 1998 Act. That is a tremendously constructive step forward, and I praise the Government, Ministers and officers for taking it. However, one might argue that it adds little other than a number of exemptions. It is already a function of the current police authority to ensure that the police uphold the law, and the 1998 Act is part of domestic legislation. Those are the reasons why we believe that it should be made more explicit. I am happy for the Government to say that they need to think about this matter. I do not intend to try to win a great human rights victory here. However, I ask them at least to give an assurance that they will take these views seriously.
<P>
It will not have escaped hon. Members' attention that there are other amendments in my name. Amendments Nos. 145, 146 and 147 involve changes to comply with Patten's recommendation that the Policing Board's statutory primary function should be to hold the Chief Constable and the police service publicly to account. We believe that those changes should be made. They relate to a point that I made on Second Reading and at the start of our deliberations in Committee. I shall not repeat what I said then, except to underline my concern that the balance between the triumvirate—the board, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State—tilts too far from the board. The changes would strengthen the board's power in that relationship.

<P>

<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> The hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but my impression is that the combined effect of his amendments is that they would hold the police service publicly accountable for the exercise of functions of the support staff and the traffic wardens. Was that the intention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> The primary intention is to ensure that the triumvirate relationship works as I have described. I shall respond to that point in any comments that I make at the end of the debate. I need to think about the consequences of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Strategically, my main concern is not about traffic wardens, but about the board's specific role and responsibilities.
<P>
My point is not trivial. We may make fun of the consequences of implementing human rights requirements on traffic wardens, but they must be carried out in an even-handed way. Although we may trivialise the point a little, we seek consistency and, more than anything, public reassurance for those who have not trusted the police force in Northern Ireland that they can now do so with the backing of legislation.
<P>
Amendment No. 149 adds some points that are there for all to see, so I shall not read them out.
<P>
Some additional Patten recommendations on the functions of the Policing Board do not appear in the Bill—recommendations 64 and 73, and chapter 16. Recommendation 64 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Responsibility for inspecting all custody and interrogation suites should rest with the Policing Board, and Lay Visitors should be empowered not only to inspect the conditions of detention (as at present), but also to observe interviews on camera subject to the consent of the detainee (as is the case for cell visits).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Recommendation 73 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Policing Board and, as appropriate, the Police Ombudsman should actively monitor police performance in public order situations, and if necessary seek reports from the Chief Constable and follow up those reports if they wish.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 4.5 Patten found:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Human rights training in the RUC also lags behind other police organizations we have spoken to.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not believe that he was condemning the RUC; it was an objective assessment and we should take it as such. We should treat it as a matter of fact rather than as a condemnation of the RUC.
<P>
The Government's implementation plan states on page 73:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>New legislation will also confer on the Policing Board responsibility for monitoring police training needs and the performance of the police service in meeting them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill should reflect that by placing a duty on the Policing Board to monitor the training, education and development strategy of the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Is not all this already contained in (2)(b)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> Or not (2)(b)!
<P>
<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> I shall resist the tired Shakespearean intervention, refreshed as I am from having worked even harder in another place recently.
<P>
Some of what is in the implementation plan is contained in subsection 2(b), but my desire is to make it explicit where it counts. I am happy to hear reaffirmation from the Minister that, in his judgment, all that I have said is explicitly included in the Bill. It is not explicitly included in the sense that it appears in clause 2 on page 2 at line 29. That is why I have tabled amendment No. 149. So far the Committee has been constructive, so in that spirit I shall be happy to hear what others have to say.

<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I had given way, but the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) is not yet back in his seat. It will be too bad if I conclude my comments before he returns.
<P>
Some hon. Members have rightly noted that an unintended consequence of my amendments would be the inclusion of traffic wardens and others under the remit of the Policing Board. That is not the primary aim. The strategic concern is to increase the board's influence in the triumverate relationship in line with what I interpret Patten as having wished. I am happy to hear what other members of the Committee feel about the subject and also to hear the Government's view. I impress on the Government the importance of taking seriously the policing board's unease about its importance and power in the operations that I have described. I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about strengthening the explicit reference in the Bill to acting in accordance with international human rights. For me, there is no downside to that, although some might feel that it would be overkill. Surely it is better to take a belt-and-braces approach, given the disenchantment with the Northern Ireland police force that is felt by some, especially because those small changes might give an explicit and positive signal that human rights issues are taken seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am not unsympathetic with the hon. Gentleman's purpose in tabling the amendments, but they do not help in drafting legal documents. There was once a time, back in the 16th century, when Bills had a long title and started with two or three pages of polemic that set out the general thrust of the legislation and criticised certain sections of the population, as one can see if one looks at Bills from that period. I seem to remember that there were many Bills about the activities of papists. That enabled Members of the House of Commons, or perhaps the monarch, to get things off their chests before moving on to the nitty-gritty of the legislation. Perhaps it is fortunate that we have moved away from that, but I sometimes think that it is not so fortunate because we now seem to have an extraordinary tendency to transfer all that into the body of the legislation. I do not think that the sentiments that the hon. Gentleman has expressed, which I share, need to be placed in the legislation. The hon. Gentleman should remember that the Bill is not just a document that will be looked at—in fact, I venture to suggest that few people will actually bother to read the Bill as a piece of evening reading for their reassurance. The legislation will also have to be interpreted by judges, and if judges are still allowed to wear wigs in Northern Ireland by then, although I suspect that they might not be, they will throw their wigs on the ground in despair as various members of my profession start earning some money by pointing out all the oddities that have been inserted in the legislation.
<P>
I shall not refer to all the amendments, but I want to focus on amendment No. 144. The hon. Gentleman seeks to suggest that the wording should be:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>effective and operate in accordance with international human rights standards and norms.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think I know what the hon. Gentleman is getting at, but the dictionary would say that a norm is that which is normal. I regret to say that if international human rights standards were applied on that basis, for all I know, the norm might be the way in which the Chinese police behave in Lhasa. In fact, as a statistical maxima, it must be likely that the behaviour of the Chinese police force represents international norms more closely than the sort of behaviour that I would want the police service in Northern Ireland to engage in. For those reasons, the phrase used in the amendment, which I recognise is well intended, ultimately obfuscates the real purpose of the legislation, which is to ensure that the police behave in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I will not labour the point, but surely the statement used in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) and myself is still more specific than the phrase ``efficient and effective'', which is likely to create much more mileage for lawyers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I disagree with him. It is clear that compliance with existing statutory provisions is necessary for efficiency and effectiveness. That is implicit and does not need to be spelt out. The legislation must include the Human Rights Act 1998 and the clause ensures that the monitoring of a police force will have regard to compliance with that Act. I suspect that that provision was not 100 per cent. necessary, although I shall certainly not quibble with it, as it is a clear restatement that the 1998 Act is fundamental to the running of Northern Ireland—a fact that can probably bear restatement.
<P>
We get ourselves into terrible difficulties when we start inserting into the Bill what I have described as surplusage by trying to make legislation say more than is necessary for its purpose. I should like to provide a simple reassurance; I am satisfied that the issues that appear to be causing the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire anxiety and which he has incorporated into his various amendments are already fully and completely covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I rise to support the comments made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). If we accepted the amendments, we would be doing a disservice to the Bill, rather than improving it. Although I agree with the sentiment that the amendments express, I must point out that if we start building into legislation words such as those that are proposed—there may be examples of other legislation in which this has happened—the human rights standards that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire supports will become even more difficult to interpret. That is a positive reason for not agreeing to the amendment and why the existing drafting is sufficient. The clause is backed by the Human Rights Act 1998, which already opens a Pandora's box. It is right for it to do so, and I support that 100 per cent. We must be careful about inserting words such as those that are proposed. I am not an eminent lawyer, but I am a lawyer, like the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. When giving advice to clients, it is difficult to deal with legislation such as that which is proposed. Such difficulty is encountered not only by lawyers but by judges.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has just had two of the cheapest pieces of legal advice that he is likely ever to receive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> He has not had the bill yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall not comment on that suggestion.
<P>
The group of amendments is large and complex, and contains some important issues that must be addressed. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield made his case well in his short and incisive speech, but I am sure that he will appreciate that I am obliged to explain our difficulties with the amendment in full. I apologise to you, Mr. O'Hara, and to the Committee for the length of the observations that I am about to make.
<P>
I am disappointed by the overall impression that has been unfairly created by the Bill and especially by the implied criticism that we are not giving effect to the spirit of the Patten recommendations. I do not believe that that criticism is justified and it is incumbent on me to explain what the Government have done and my reasons for holding that view. In setting out the general functions of the new Policing Board, the clause provides the foundation stone of the future accountability of policing in Northern Ireland. That ambition is not an overly grand; it was why the Patten commission was established on the back of the Good Friday agreement.
<P>
In maintaining the police, their support staff and traffic wardens efficiently and effectively, clause 2 obliges the board to hold the Chief Constable to account for the performance of his functions and for those of the policing service. That provision reflects the report's recommendation 9. The Bill gives the board several new powers and functions, which go well beyond other accountability arrangements in the British Isles, to carry out its new role. We will be debating those provisions, which enable the board to undertake its role effectively, so I will not continue at length. However, it is important in the context to restate the issue.
<P>
<H5>7.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The detail of clause 2 requires the board to monitor, to assess or to keep itself informed of several important issues. Recommendation 13 of the Patten report said that the board should monitor police performance against the policing plan. That proposal is set out in subsection (3)(a)(iii); the proposal on crime trends is covered in subsection (3)(c)(iii); police performance in public order situations is dealt with in subsection (3)(b)(i); recruitment and representativeness is covered by subsection (3)(c)(iv) and (v) and subsection (3)(d)(i). The policy on public satisfaction with the police is in subsection (3)(d)(ii).
<P>
Recommendation 7 of the report says that the board should monitor the performance of the police service in respect of human rights. Subsection (3)(b)(ii) gives effect to that recommendation. The clause also gives the board appropriate duties for oversight of and involvement in local community consultation arrangements. I will not detail those measures; they show the Government's great commitment to implementing Patten's important principles and recommendations.
<P>
I want to pick up on a further recommendation from Patten to which the clause gives effect. Recommendation 15 stated that the board should co-ordinate its work closely with other agencies whose activities touch on public safety. Subsection (4) requires the board to co-ordinate and to co-operate with such agencies. The recommendation has been faithfully replicated.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone has justifiably reminded us on several occasions of the serious problems facing our society generally and, specifically, Northern Ireland. The problem of drugs, which probably affects all of us in our constituencies, is serious and growing in areas of Northern Ireland, including parts where we would not have expected such a situation and which otherwise have had a reputation for peace, stability and even respectability.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to smuggling and specifically to the smuggling of fuel oils, which has a disastrous effect on the economy. We could argue about the scale; the hon. Gentleman gave us estimates. Whichever figure one accepts, the problem has consequences, which my right hon. Friends the Minister of State and the Secretary of State are concerned about and are acting on.
<P>
Such primarily operational matters are for the police. The provision will require the board to take a joined-up strategic approach to give impetus to addressing the serious problems to which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone has drawn our attention.
<P>
Taken together, the provisions present the board with a challenging and, at times, onerous responsibility and are the basis for robust and transparent accountability. I know that all hon. Members are interested in transparent accountability, and that my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh has a special interest in it, for good reason. Taken together, the provisions give comprehensive effect to Patten's recommendations 7, 9, 13, 15 and 73 and his important injunction that the board should be a powerful regulatory body.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has invited us by amendment No. 148 to consider adding compliance with international human rights standards to the reference to the police force's compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998, which, under clause 2(3)(b)(ii), the board would have a duty to monitor. The hon. Gentleman said that Patten specifically referred to subjecting the police to international human rights standards. I should be grateful to be told exactly where that reference occurs in the report. Patten mentions international human rights standards, but the primary recommendation under the human rights section of the report—recommendation 3—states that a code of ethics should integrate the European convention on human rights. It states that all aspects of policing should be strictly in accordance with the ECHR but goes no further. The cover of the Bill provides, as always happens now, an assurance by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that the Bill complies in all respects with the European convention.
<P>
I must agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that it is not clear what international human rights standards and norms the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire means. I say that in a co-operative and friendly spirit. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said, some appalling human rights abuses, which it would be invidious to go into, take place around the world. Those low standards should not be compared with the past activities of the RUC or with those of the police service that we want to create from the Patten proposals. The RUC carried out a difficult job, often in impossible circumstances. Such comparisons as might be made in the light of the amendment could cause unnecessary offence. We might reasonably say that, against the norms in question, the RUC has a good record on human rights, often in the face of intolerable terrorist attacks, in its efforts to create a society with more respect for the law. Are the norms that I have mentioned the ones that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire means? I do not think that they are. Does he mean any international instruments or those that the United Kingdom has already signed up to? If the latter, it is axiomatic that the Government would not have signed up to them if domestic law were incompatible with them and there was no provision for derogation.
<P>
We have every reason to be proud of what has been done to embed human rights into UK constitutional arrangements. The Human Rights Act 1998 gives domestic effect to the European convention on human rights. That applies to Northern Ireland and its police in the same way that it applies to every institution in the UK. It will come into force in October. In addition, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 established the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland. Section 69(7) of that Act requires the Secretary of State to ask the commission for advice on what human rights might be defined in domestic legislation in addition to those set out in the European convention on human rights. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire knows Professor Brice Dixon and others who are involved in that process. He is aware that there is no shyness on their part when it comes to advising us on how we should proceed. That is the proper way to address the issues raised by his amendment. I suspect, on the basis of his reaction so far, that he is not unhappy with our explanation.
<P>
We agree that one vital principle should be in the Bill. Impartiality is crucial to policing and the provision of any service in Northern Ireland or elsewhere in the UK. It is an important issue. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh for bringing it to my attention. His concern is reflected in amendment No. 58, which he tabled. It has not been selected for debate today, but we may discuss it later in our proceedings. I sincerely and seriously undertake to consider how we can reflect that principle in the Bill. We need to reach a conclusion on that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has tabled amendments that would make the Bill refer to the police service rather than the police force. In his absence, which was for the good reason of fulfilling other responsibilities, we covered that issue in our debate on amendment No. 127, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh. We will address that issue. The hon. Gentleman's amendments raise the additional matter of the board having to hold the Chief Constable and the police service publicly to account. We have again accepted the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh, and the Bill provides for that consideration. We thought that it could be dealt with in a code of practice but, on reflection, we decided to table Government amendment No. 139 to amend paragraph (8) of schedule 1. In the light of that, I invite the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to withdraw amendments Nos. 145, 146 and 147.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 128, 129, 130 and 149 deal with the board's monitoring functions and raise issues of public order, training, lay visiting and the code of ethics. Given the hour and temperature, I am sure the Committee would agree that my response should be brief, which applies in particular to my hon. Friend who represents the Patronage Secretary.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire proposes in amendment No. 149 that the board should monitor the training, education and development strategy of the police service. We agree, which is why the Bill already deals with the matter. The training strategy will be a part of the policing plan by virtue of regulations made by the Secretary of State under clause 24(2). I have made available today a preparatory draft of those regulations to aid the Committee's deliberations.
<P>
<H5>7.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I trust that the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) will acknowledge that, in doing so, the Government are attempting to meet what he said on Second Reading about making draft versions of subordinate legislation available. The board is already required to monitor the performance of the police in carrying out the policing plan under clause 2(3)(b)(iii). The training strategy will be part of the plan. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is therefore unnecessary to include a further reference to it in the Bill.
<P>
That point was raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire in amendment No. 149 and by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh in amendment No. 130. The latter amendment would place a duty on the board to monitor public order. The board is obliged to monitor the general duties of the police under clause 2(3)(b)(i). Those general duties are set out in clause 30(1) and they include the provision of order. The point is therefore already covered. It makes sense to cover all the general duties of the police, not only their response to the public order situation, but it is a sensitive and important matter and I have no doubt that the board will pay particular attention to that important responsibility.
<P>
 In amendment No. 130, my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh seeks to make arrangements to monitor police performance in public order situations. He will doubtless tell us that Patten wanted the board to monitor police performance in public order situations, not simply to make arrangements to do so. That was said in recommendations 13 and 73 of the Patten report, so there is no cause for confusion. My hon. Friend has an eagle eye for spotting such matters, and I am sure that he will know what I mean. He may think that the Government have departed from the Patten report, but that it is not necessarily so.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh in amendment No. 129, and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire in the first part of amendment No. 149 suggest that the Bill provides a statutory basis for combining the police authority's current role in lay visiting arrangements and the role of the independent commissioner for the holding centres. Both have a non-statutory role. At page 32 of the Government's implementation plan, we say in response to Patten's recommendation 64 that the role of lay visitors will be extended once the arrangements have been completed to hold all suspects in custody suites located in police stations. The Government have no objection in principle to making reference in the Bill to those arrangements, but we shall have to give the matter further thought.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall give way in a moment. I ask my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendments on the basis that we understand what they want to achieve and we want to give serious thought to how to accommodate their wish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In so far as he is giving a guarantee, although I have not pressed the argument on amendment No. 158A, will the Minister consider that amendment too? I believe that there is an inconsistency between clauses 22 and 4 in that the board will be required to have regard to objectives determined by the Secretary of State under clause 22. It is a simple point. I should be grateful if the Minister would consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I intend to refer directly to that point, and he probably will not be disappointed by what I have to say.
<P>
Amendment No. 128, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh and others, would require the board to monitor the performance of the police in complying with the code of ethics in clause 48. Compliance would be at odds with the current formulation of clause 30(4), which requires members of the police force to have regard to a code of ethics. I acknowledge that the code of ethics provision would repay further consideration; we can do so when we reach clause 30. I hope that the hon. Gentleman realises that our minds are not closed to that; we want to reach a sensible conclusion.
<P>
I am not convinced that the board should have a specific monitoring function. The board is already required to consider police complaints and disciplinary proceedings under clause 2(3)(c)(i) and the performance of the police in complying with the Human Rights Act 1998 under clause 2(3)(b)(ii). I remind the Committee that Patten's recommendation 3 was that there should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a new code of ethics . . . integrating the ECHR into police practice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The recommendation adds that the new code and other codes should be strictly in accordance with the ECHR. Again, there will be an overlap. I ask my hon. Friend not to press amendment No. 128.
<P>
Amendment No. 158A, tabled by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, would require the board to have regard to the Secretary of State's policing objectives. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government agree with the purpose of the amendment, but the point will be covered under clause 2(4)(a). By virtue of the regulations made under clause 24(2), draft copies of which I have made available to the Committee, the Secretary of State's objectives will form part of the policing plan to which the board must have regard under clause 2(4)(a). On the basis of that explanation, and given that we are one about what the hon. Gentleman seeks to achieve, I hope that he will not press the amendment.
<P>
I hope that I have said enough to satisfy the Committee. I have tried to give a clear indication of the direction that we wish to take.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that if the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is minded not to press his amendment, he should not move it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the Minister for a long exposition. I thank also the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire for raising crucial elements of the Bill, which have been dismissed too facilely.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I tabled three amendments. Perforce I must speak to the three of them, as they are all important. I will apologise if I am long winded, although I will try not to be. On a general point, the list of requirements in terms of the policing board is comprehensive the board will monitor, will keep itself informed and will assess situations. Is it not astounding that the code of ethics, the monitoring of interrogation centres and the monitoring of police performance in public order situations are not covered? I come from the north of Ireland, where I have experienced policing during the past 30 years; the absence of those three elements must raise questions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire dealt effectively with the subject, as I hope to do. There is more to be discussed in relation to the Human Rights Act 1998. How do we move policing on in the north of Ireland while ignoring the recommendations of the Patten commission on both the interrogation suites and the performance of the police in public order situations? My how things have changed over the years—suites!
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Clause 30(4) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In carrying out their functions the members of the police force shall have regard to the code of ethics under section 48.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision is already included. While the hon. Gentleman's other two points are significant, they will be covered under normal police functions in the same way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the hon. Member for his point, which has validity in terms of the operation of the code of ethics. However, the matter is not for the police service but for the Policing Board. What is the board's role? It is surely to ensure compliance with the terms included in the code of ethics. That is exactly what my amendment says. It requires the Policing Board to comply, to monitor and to ensure compliance with the code of ethics referred to in clause 48.
<P>
It has been argued that the issue is covered by the Human Rights Act 1998 through subsection (3)(b)(ii). However, it is not. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is right. Clause 48 is integral to the Bill and is crucial. Responsibility for complying with that clause rests with the Policing Board. If the Policing Board does not have a responsibility for ensuring compliance with the code of ethics that we are drawing up under clause 48, who does? The matter is not for the Chief Constable, although he has a specific role in ensuring the code of ethics. The role of the Policing Board should be to ensure compliance with the code. That we measure 12 major policing practices under clause 2 but not compliance with the code of ethics is astounding. Whether we like or dislike Patten, whether we can take him or leave him, we cannot dispute that the code of ethics is central to the Patten report. I believe that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire was right to make that distinction, but I believe that our amendment is better because it focuses on compliance.
<P>
<H5>8 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We must also consider how clause 48 fits into the Bill, and we have a responsibility to ensure that the provision is complied with. To do that, we must ensure that the body that has authority for policing monitors conduct and ensures compliance. Not only should the board be under a duty to examine compliance with the convention, but it should be under a duty to monitor compliance with the code. That is because the code is designed to implement the convention. The fact that the code is designed to implement the convention is crucial to this part of the Bill. Again, I pose the question whether the code of ethics is not sufficiently important to be monitored by the Policing Board?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> It is probably appropriate for me to help my hon. Friend at this point. It is right to say that the code of ethics is important. My hon. Friend thinks that it is, and I suspect that all Committee members share that view. We have thought about the issue and intend to amend the Bill to require the board to approve and issue the code of ethics. The board will therefore have the final say on the contents of the code of ethics and will be able to keep it under review. My hon. Friend and I are heading in the same direction. We accept the need for an amendment and, at the appropriate time, we will try to draft a provision that covers his requirements and ours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary, who has been very helpful, but not helpful enough. We are not discussing keeping the code of ethics under review. We are discussing the monitoring of compliance with the code of ethics by the Policing Board. Of course one expects the Policing Board to keep all its procedures under review, but I believe that there should be a specific legislative requirement to monitor that compliance. That is substantially different from keeping the code of ethics under review. If that task will not be carried out by the Policing Board, who will carry it out? Do we omit it entirely, and leave the situation inadequate and ill-defined, or do we do what I believe the amendment does and require the Policing Board to monitor compliance with the code of ethics referred to in clause 48? I ask the Under-Secretary to consider that carefully, because it goes to the heart of the policing board's role.

Amendment No. 129 would require the board to

That, too, is a requirement of Patten.
