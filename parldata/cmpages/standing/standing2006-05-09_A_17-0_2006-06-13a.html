Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): Thank you, Sir
John. I welcome you back to the
Chair.</div><a name="06061412000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Picking
up where I left off, we were discussing the problems that will result
from the proposal inschedule 20 to move the vesting age from
25 to 18. The reality is that a sudden windfall at 18 is far more
likely to be squandered to fund irresponsible behaviour than money that
is transferred at 25. Research by the Financial Services Authority, for
example, shows that 18-year-olds are much less financially capable than
25-year-olds. In its report, &#147;Levels of Financial Capability in
the UK&#148;, the FSA concluded that 18-year-olds have a factor score
of just 27 out of 100, while those aged 20 to 29 have a higher factor
score of 40.</div><a name="06061412000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly,
I received too many representations on this point to hope to be able to
cover them all, so I shall select just a few. Ian Buckley of Rathbones
solicitors, which has many years of experience with wills and trusts,
wrote:</div><a name="06061412000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Accumulation and Maintenance Trust was the creation of a previous
Labour administration and has been used in good faith pursuant to
legislation distinguishing them from discretionary trusts. To unravel
these in order to avoid a punitive extra charge will have a negative
effect on savings and furthermore assets in the hands of 18 year olds
are more likely to be spent than saved...It is our view that 18,
an age when many young people can be particularly vulnerable is not a
suitable age 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 590</div>for an individual to receive material wealth absolutely. 25 is widely
regarded as a more acceptable
age.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colin
Jelley of Skandia Life was even more outspoken. He stated:</div>
<a name="06061412000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Forcing beneficiaries
to get outright entitlement at 18 simply fuels the conspicuous
expenditure of teenage alpha
males.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
solicitor practising in the Paymaster General&#146;s home city,
Bristol, contacted her local MP, my hon. Friend the Member for
Woodspring (Dr. Fox), to protest about the shift in the vesting age
from 25 to 18. She did not want to be named directly but wanted her
views made known. She
wrote:</div><a name="06061412000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
clients are responsible and caring adults; they are infuriated by the
State&#146;s attempt to manoeuvre them with the threat of unfair tax
penalties into making decisions which they believe to be fundamentally
wrong and against the best interests of those they hold
dear.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">She goes on to
outline the following
case:</div><a name="06061412000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
client is a widower. He lost his wife 8 years ago. He has3
children aged 16, 13 and 11. His sister lives with the family and helps
care for the children. His estate comprises a house worth about
&#163;350,000 plus savings of about &#163;200,000. He has recently
been diagnosed with a brain tumour and is not expected to live for more
than a few months. He knows and accepts that his estate is above the
IHT threshold. If he dies this year, as is likely, his estate will face
a bill of &#163;106,000. He wants to leave what is left of his estate
after tax in trust for his children. He wants the fund retained until
the eldest child is 25. This way, he hopes that there will be enough to
provide all 3 children with a roof over their head at least until the
youngest child is 20. If he tries to avoid the penalty Inheritance Tax
of the Budget and chooses 18 instead, child 2 will be 15 and child 3
only 13 when the house will have to be sold to provide child 1 with the
one third share to which he will then be absolutely entitled. If the
client chooses the more prudent course, the capital (not just the
income gains) of the trust will be eroded with the periodic inheritance
charges and exit charges. This man is not one of the super-rich but the
Budget for him and his family produces an atrocious result. He is not
alone.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another

who cannot be named, lost her father in the Hungerford massacre in
1987. Her mother later died of an atrophying illness. Her
parents&#146; assets were put into trust to be held until she was 25.
The trust was supposed to pay out its assets to Girl A in 2011 with no
tax liability. After Gordon Brown&#146;s Budget attack on
trustafarians, the funds could be hit with a tax charge of up to 6 per
cent. David Rule, head of trusts at Moore and Blatch, the solicitors in
Lymington...that run the trust, says that the trustees could
override the deeds and pay out early. He says, &#145;We are being
bullied into the tax charge. If it&#146;s right for the trust to pay
out at 25, it&#146;s wrong for the trustees to pay out at 18 instead
to avoid the
tax.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="06061412000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000515"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> It is true that children going to university
need financial support, because they have tuition fees to pay, but
accumulation and maintenance trusts have the facility to cover such
needs. Income can be paid out while the student is at university and
chunks of capital can also be paid out if necessary, to provide
accommodation for example. The trusts that I am proposing be retained
would meet the needs of such situations, because one could tailor the
amount that was given to the needs of the student&#151;it would not
have to be huge.</div> <a name="06061412000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the argument has moved on, I shall probably not be pressing the
compromise amendments that would have vested capital at 25 and income
at 18.</div> <a name="06061412000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 358 sets out proposed new provisions relating to trusts
in which property does not vest until the age of 25. This morning the
Paymaster General indicated that the Government position represented no
change. However, I believe that the new provisions demonstrate a
welcome shift of position since the original draft of schedule 20 and
since the debates on Second Reading and in Committee of the whole
House, when no Minister seemed inclined to accept that there was any
problem regarding trusts for those aged 18 to 25. The fact that some
relief is now envisaged for such trusts represents a welcome change.
</div><a name="06061412000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way in which the
amendments work is currently defying some of the best legal brains in
London, so I will let the Paymaster General explain her own amendments.
The thrust of the changes seems to be to allow parents to provide that
the vesting of income and capital be postponed to the age of 25,
without the20 per cent. up-front entry charge being incurred.
However, the trust property will be subject to the periodic charge
during the seven-year period when the beneficiary is aged between 18
and 25. That would amount to approximately 4.2 per cent. of the
property in the trust at the
time.</div><a name="06061412000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The shift is
obviously welcome but it still levies an extra charge, albeit a reduced
one. There is also an important question which I hope that the Minister
will be able to address for the Committee. The supporting documentation
issued by the Treasury in relation to the amendments indicates that the
option could be used by all existing A and M trusts, rather than just
in the future. However, proposed new section 71D(1) provides that it
only applies where one of the beneficiary&#146;s parents is
dead.</div><a name="06061412000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
limitation, the relief will have limited impact on the thousands of
responsible parents and grandparents who have set up such trusts to
provide for children. It would mean that the harsh consequences of
retrospective legislation would still apply to many A and M trusts. It
seems that the later provisions in the Government&#146;s amendments
can be interpreted to disapply the restriction and to extend the relief
provided for in section 71D to all existing A and M 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 592</div>trusts, even when both parents are still alive, but I would welcome
clarification from the Paymaster General on the extent of the relief
provided by the Government&#146;s amendments. Even if she is able to
give that assurance, her amendments seem to presume that setting up
trusts that do not vest until the age of 25 is some sort of privilege
that has to attract a tax penalty, albeit a smaller one than originally
proposed. That is why I am still minded to press both my amendment that
would retain the current A and M structure and keep the vesting age at
25, and my amendment to ensure that existing A and M trusts are not
affected by the schedule 20 changes.</div>
<a name="06061412000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me to the group of
amendments that would remove the retrospective impact of the
Government&#146;s proposals on existing A and M trusts. It is not the
Opposition&#146;s view that there should be an absolute bar on
retrospective legislation. No doubt the Paymaster General will be able
to cite instances of such legislation that has been adopted by previous
Conservative Governments. However, we believe strongly that
retrospective legislation should not be adopted unless there is a good
reason and a clear justification for doing so. We believe that there is
no such clear justification in this case.</div>
<a name="06061412000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of retrospective
provisions in this case jeopardises confidence in the tax system and
deters people from saving and taking responsible steps to provide for
their future and that of their children. The Society of Trust and
Estate Practitioners points out the similarity with the pensions system
as an area where long-term stability is needed to encourage people to
make long-term provision for their future and that of their families.
It
states:</div><a name="06061412000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Individuals
enter into long-term arrangements in expectation of a particular tax
treatment. The professionals believe that the government should not
bring forward legislation which bears upon the decisions of families
who have no opportunity to unravel arrangements that they would never
have entered into if they had known the change was
coming.&#148;</div> <a name="06061412000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I received too
many representations on this matter to recount them all. However, I
think accountant Richard Meynell summed up the feelings of many when he
wrote in forthright terms to a national newspaper:</div>
<a name="06061412000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regardless of the
merits or demerits of the proposed tax, the fact that it is to be
retrospective is unfair, unethical and an intolerable betrayal of
trust. If one cannot trust the law extant at the time of making the
decision, what can one trust?&#148;</div>
<a name="06061412000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">This legislation is genuinely
retrospective. When the matter was discussed in Committee of the whole
House, the Paymaster General argued that it was not because wills and
trusts can be varied. As I shall describe in relation to the discussion
of immediate post-death interest, where this matter is even more
crucial, variation of wills and trusts can often be problematic. Even
if one gets over such practical problems, to which I shall come in due
course, it is still no answer in this case because settlors simply do
not have the options open to them that they did when the trust was
initially set up. At that point, they could have decided not to set up
any trust, they could have set up a trust that contained less property
or they could have taken the tax hit and set up a fully discretionary
trust.</div> <a name="06061412000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clock
cannot be wound back to enable settlors to make a decision on whether
to set up the trust all over again, as illustrated by the case study
provided by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 593</div>David Rule at Moore and Blatch, which I outlined before. Trustees face
the invidious choice of taking the tax hit or seeking to change the
trust so that income vests at 18, knowing that the settlor did not
believe that this was in the best interests of the beneficiary. I
welcome the limited but important relief provided by the
Government&#146;s amendments in this area. However, in the light of
the very serious concerns that have been expressed on the retrospective
nature of the legislation, I am keen to press the matter to a Division,
specifically in relation to retrospectivity.</div>
<a name="06061412000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we come to Government
amendmentNo. 384, which extends the scope of persons who can
set up bereaved minor trusts from parents to include step-parents. That
extension widens the scope of the bereaved minor trust and from that
point of view it is welcome. I shall return to that issue in relation
to amendments Nos. 270 and 271, which seek an even broader expansion of
the ability to set up a trust for a bereaved minor. In my view, there
is no sense in limiting such trusts to settlors who are parents. They
should be open to all relatives, and I have tabled amendments to that
effect.</div><a name="06061412000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I close my
remarks by welcoming the modest change of position as helpful to
existing A and M trusts, while maintaining that the Opposition still
have significant concerns about the vesting age, even assuming that the
Government&#146;s changes are incorporated in the
Bill.</div><a name="06061412000460"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
<a name="06061412000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000516"></a><b class="B">Ms
Celia Barlow</b> (Hove) (Lab): I should like to speak to
amendment No. 358. The Government&#146;s decision provides a good
answer to the concerns that several professions and official bodies
raised on behalf of families during the Bill&#146;s consultation
period. The Government have rightly argued that people gain their legal
maturity at 18. People aged 18 are old enough to drive, to sign
contracts on their own and, happily, to vote. It was therefore
unreasonable to go on protecting people&#146;s personal choices to
make their money available to children only when they are 25, and to
grant them certain exemptions in inheritance tax. The Government are
forcing no one to pass on their money when their children are 18. All
sorts of provisions in wills are still possible; they just do not enjoy
tax exemptions. On the other hand, I recognise the arguments that have
been put forward. Inheriting a certain sum of money when one turns 18
can be a dangerous temptation, especially if one is not prepared for
it. It might be reasonable advice to gain some experience in managing
one&#146;s own finances before the assets are finally
bequeathed.</div> <a name="06061412000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have found a good compromise. The new tax charge of 4.2 per
cent. is not punitive; it makes it clear that all the choices that the
individual makes can be tax free. The Government have taken into
account the legitimate interests of bequeathers and the necessity to
close tax loopholes. I therefore support the
provisions.</div><a name="06061412000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000517"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I am
pleased to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Sir John. I
shall start by declaring an interest: I am a settlor of an accumulation
and maintenance trust for my children.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 594</div><a name="06061412000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addressing this group of
amendments, I start by requesting that the Paymaster General answer the
questions that I put to her in this morning&#146;s sitting in
relation to the request from the Treasury Committee for detailed
information on the evidence of the abuse that the clauses seek to
address. She chose not to respond to my challenge, and I hope that she
will do so when she makes her winding-up speech on these amendments. I
particularly hope that she will do so, because having re-read the
contributions made in the Committee of the whole House, I think that
the Government&#146;s intent is clear. The statement was made:
</div><a name="06061412000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We believe
that trusts have an important role to play in helping people to manage
their affairs&#151;of course they do&#151;but we also believe that
a person's choice whether to use a trust structure should not be tax
driven.&#148;</div> <a name="06061412000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It continued,
stating that</div> <a name="06061412000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is
unfair that some people exploit the trust rules in order to avoid
inheritance tax.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 2 May 2006;
Vol. 445, c. 866.]</div><a name="06061412000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those were
not my words, but those of the Paymaster General. The Government
clearly believe that exploitation is taking place for tax avoidance
purposes, but they have provided no evidence whatever to establish the
scale of the problem or, indeed, whether the problem exists.</div>
<a name="06061412000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard the hon. Member for
Hove (Ms Barlow) talking about age discrimination, and the argument has
been made that there is a discriminatory impact, but those on the
Government Front Bench have not advanced that argument with any
coherence. The professionals, whom my hon. Friend the shadow Chief
Secretary to the Treasury has cited on more than one occasion, deny
that any significant avoidance is going on through those trusts, and
they are united in that view. I shall quote from the Society of Estate
and Trust Practitioners in relation to accumulation and maintenance
trusts. It says:</div>
<a name="06061412000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do not think that
the Government has made the intellectual case or evidenced any form of
inappropriate tax avoidance that justifies such a material unlevelling
of the playing field as between the ability to make gifts outright free
of IHT under the potentially exempt transfer regime compared with gifts
into trust.</div><a name="06061412000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">Going
forward, the ability to use trusts will therefore remain a poor second
in fiscal terms to outright gifts which means that many of the socially
desirable uses of trusts continue to be
penalised.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
statement was issued in a press release following the publication of
the Government&#146;s amendments, in full recognition of the moves
that the Government have made in an attempt to climb down from the
untenable position that they adopted at the time of the Budget and in
the debate on the Floor of the
House.</div><a name="06061412000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
abuse going on through accumulation and maintenance trusts; if there is
abuse, the Government need to demonstrate it to us. Such trusts are
used, as my hon. Friend has clearly mentioned, to enable settlors to
provide some protection for capital value assets for those who are not
in a position to manage those at a young age. This is not a
discriminatory device; it is a protective device to enable individuals
to reach a level of financial sophistication and maturity before they
have access to their capital. That is perfectly reasonable. I urge the
Government to withdraw these proposals completely, not in part. I
support my hon. Friend&#146;s amendments.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 595</div><a name="06061412000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000518"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I welcome you,
Sir John, to the
Chair.</div><a name="06061412000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have three fairly straightforward questions for the Paymaster General.
First, if the Government are insisting on applying the new regime, on
what basis did they choose to apply it to existing trusts as well as
new ones from the date of the Budget? I should be interested to hear
what impact they judge it will have and how many people will be
affected. Secondly, on trusts for bereaved minors, can the Paymaster
General confirm that the proposed changes will restore the pre-Budget
situation to people who are eligible on the basis of their age and if
their parent is deceased? Unlike the hon. Member for Hove, I found
Government amendment No. 358 tortuously complicated to
understand.</div><a name="06061412000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
will the Paymaster General explain the situation for those currently
over 18, who were due to benefit at 25 before the new proposals were
put in place? Under the proposals being enacted, will those people
become immediately liable for the new tax treatment unless they
withdraw?</div><a name="06061412000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000519"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): Earlier
today, the Paymaster General said that she was taken by surprise by the
reaction to many of the elements of the Budget proposals, including
those on IHT and trusts and the publication of the Finance Bill.
However, it is not just the Government who were taken by surprise. The
proposals took the whole profession by surprise, including the
accountants and lawyers who deal with this matter. There had been no
indication that something of this sort was on the way. Indeed,
Government policy had been to avoid creating artificial obstacles to
using trusts where they would bring significant non-tax
benefits.</div><a name="06061412000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful that the Government have made some movement in this area and
introduced amendments, but one has to question them. This matter has
been going on for some months. Why have the Government only now brought
out their amendments? There were only available on Friday, which does
not give the Committee a great deal of time to evaluate their contents.
As we have heard from my hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary and the
hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), many of
these provisions are complex. I suppose that I should declare an
interest, of which everyone in the room is aware, because I am married
to a tax lawyer.</div><a name="06061412000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a
number of occasions in these proceedings, the Government have noted
comments made by the professionals and tabled amendments, which is
sensible. That is the nature of this proposal and the process. We are
considering perhaps the most controversial part of the Bill, but the
Government have, it seems, substantially changed their original
position. The period in which professionals can analyse the new
sections&#151;we have heard particular mention of Government
amendment No. 358&#151;is absolute minute; we are talking about a
couple of days. That seems to be a failure in the system. There will
not be adequate scrutiny of the Government&#146;s amendments if we
work within such a time frame. Although it is pleasing to have these
amendments, it is regrettable that they came out so late. We are
debating them on a Tuesday, but they became available only on the
previous Friday.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column595" />Column number: 596</div><a name="06061412000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">On whether it
is right for 18-year-olds to receive the bequest, or whether there
should be some sort of tax penalty or charge if it is delayed until the
child is 25, the starting point ought to be that parents are in the
best position to decide on the appropriate time. Common sense might say
that 25 is better than 18, but people may take a different view; we
hear the argument, &#147;People can vote and have all sorts of rights
at the age of 18, so why delay until 25?&#148; We can have an
argument about that, but who is best placed to decide&#151;the
Government, or the parent making the
bequest?</div><a name="06061412000080"></a>

have come up during the two-and-a-half-year debate with the industry on
the future of modernising trusts? As far as I am aware, it was not
raised.</div><a name="06061412000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000531"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point and takes
me back to where I began these few comments. The industry was taken by
surprise. No one was expecting this provision to come along. There
should have been a long-lasting debate about it. It is regrettable that
it is now crammed into the Finance Bill and that the
Government&#146;s position has changed a couple of days before we
debate the issue.</div>
<a name="06061412000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the fundamental point
is the one made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne).
What is the harm done by the existing arrangements? How is there an
abuse? What is the cost of the abuse? The Government have not been able
to establish that there is an abuse and if they cannot establish that,
I do not see why we should change the law in this
area.</div><a name="06061412000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000532"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I
also welcome you, Sir John, to the Chair. I want to make a brief
contribution and endorse many of the things that have been said by my
hon. Friends, particularly the point made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Ludlow, which has just been referred to. Despite the encouragement
of the Select Committee, it seems that the evidence in favour of the
change has not been presented to us. The Committee are entitled to see
it before we judge whether or not it is a sensible change in the
law.</div>
<a name="06061412000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000533"></a>The
Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> What is the hon.
Gentleman referring to? The Select Committee did not ask for examples
of abuse. It asked for how we settled on the numbers that we thought
would be affected by the changes. Is he referring to another
recommendation or to something
different?</div><a name="06061412000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000534"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I would settle for that information, but I do not
believe that we have seen that either. The Government have the
obligation to provide the justification for the changes that they wish
to make. To date, the Committee has not been presented with that
justification. The Government have the opportunity to do that in this
Committee sitting. I hope that they take advantage of it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 598</div><a name="06061412000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the point was put to the
Paymaster General that 18-year-olds might not, in some cases, be
suitably mature to deal with the substantial amounts of money that
might be involved, she said, &#147;Well, I prefer to trust
18-year-olds in this country.&#148; She did not think that we were
giving 18-year-olds enough credit. It is clear from that statement that
the people she does not trust are the parents and the grandparents who
set up the trusts in the first place. They must surely know their
children and grandchildren better than the Government do. The whole
problem with the measure is that, yet again, it indulges the
Government&#146;s view that they know best. The truth is that parents
and grandparents often know best and that is why the trusts ought to be
available up to the age of
25.</div><a name="06061412000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000535"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman has just
let the cat out of the bag. Those on the Conservative Front Bench argue
that the change will affect those who are on a middle
income&#151;those who are not very well off. What he has just said is
that the issue may involve considerable sums of money. That is what it
is about. It is about people settling considerable sums of money to
those at
18.</div><a name="06061412000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000536"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> It may involve considerable sums of money. The
question that I am raising is whether 18-year-olds are, in every case,
sufficiently mature to deal with the money that they are given or left.
The bigger the amount of money and the more irresponsible the
18-year-old, the bigger the problem. That is common sense. That is the
point that I am making. The problem is that, as I would have thought
every Member of the Committee would
accept&#151;</div><a name="06061412000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000537"></a><b class="B">John

give way to the hon. Gentleman and then to the Economic Secretary. The
problem is, as I would have thought every Member of the Committee would
understand from their own personal experience, that all 18-year-olds do
not mature at the same rate. Therefore, some will be well and truly
ready for the responsibility that will be passed on to them. Some
16-year-olds will be ready for it and as the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West suggested, some 51-year-olds will not.
However, the point is surely that the greatest discretion must be given
to those who know the individual

am interested in the issues to which the hon. Member for Rugby and
Kenilworth referred because I have ministerial responsibility for
matters that pertain to them. If we take the logic of his argument
about a child trust fund to a sensible conclusion, it becomes clear
that access to funds should be open only to individuals when they have
reached the degree of maturity needed to make sensible financial
decisions. Is he proposing that we should change the limit
from18 to 25-years-old? It is interesting that he suggested an
increase in the inheritance tax threshold this morning. Does he wish to
create some further policy for the
Conservatives?</div><a name="06061412000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000543"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I think that the Economic
Secretary fully understands what I am saying, but let me explain it
again. We are talking about money that belongs to the parent or the
grandparent. It is for them to decide what they wish to do with it. The
Government are arguing that the law should be changed and that we
should alter the age from 25 to 18 years in all but certain
circumstances. I wonder, first, whether they have the evidence to back
up that change and, secondly, whether they have really thought the
matter through. It cannot be right for all 18-year-olds to be
considered similar in this regard, and it must be right that parents
and grandparents know their children and grandchildren
better.</div><a name="06061412000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000544"></a>Helen

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000545"></a>Jeremy

earlier.</div><a name="06061412000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000546"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Perhaps I made the mistake of taking the arguments
made by the hon. Gentleman too seriously. Given what he said about the
maturity of 18-year-olds to make financial decisions for themselves,
surely I should be as worried about the maturity of individuals to make
decisions about the use of child trust fund money when they reach the
age of maturity. Surely, he should consistently say that all people are
not really fit to make those decisions until the age of 25. That is a
perfectly sensible position for him to hold. I disagree with it, but if
he wants to be consistent, he should say that to the Committee rather
than hedging
around.</div><a name="06061412000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000547"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b><b class="B"> </b>We are discussing not the child trust fund,
but a change in the law that the Government wish to make. The task for
the Committee is to test whether that change is the right thing to
do.</div><a name="06061412000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) drew an analogy by referring to the
age at which people can become Members of the House. They can do that
at 21. The problem with her analogy is that, in order for people to get
here at the age of 21, the electorate would have to make a judgment on
whether they are fit to hold that responsibility. It does not come
automatically. Every 21-year-old is not entitled to become a Member of
the House. There is a test whether the 21-year-old in question in
sufficiently mature to hold the job. The same test applies here. The
Government have not made their case.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 600</div><a name="06061412000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000548"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> It would be nice if the electorate were in a
position to judge the financial competence of all hon. Members, but
they are not. Furthermore, the hon. Gentleman is inconsistent in other
respects. We are sending young 18-year-old men to Iraq to fight for
this country. At the same time as we are giving them that
responsibility, which is a far more serious responsibility than that of
looking after a little packet of money, Opposition Members are saying
that, because they are really concerned about maintaining the loophole,
they want to keep the age at
25.</div><a name="06061412000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000549"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I should be delighted to discuss the hon.
Lady&#146;s analogies all afternoon, but I do not think that I should
do so. I am making a straightforward argument that she well
understands. Her analogy was flawed because intervening in the process
is the judgment of those who know the individual well. That is what
should happen in the circumstances that we are discussing; that is what
has been happening. The Government argue that the age should change.
They have not made their case on that. The trusts are made for good
reasons by people who know the individuals concerned very
well.</div><a name="06061412000114"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000551"></a>Jeremy

convincing argument about why the change should be made. Until we have
heard such an argument, the Committee should reject the
proposal.</div>

me.</div> <a name="06061412000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask the
Paymaster General two questions before she winds up. First, following
on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow said, have the
Government rejected the Treasury Committee&#146;s recommendation in
paragraph 109 of its fourth report which
states:</div><a name="06061412000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recommend that the Government provide detailed
information&#148;?</div><a name="06061412000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">If they
have not rejected it, at what point did they provide the information
before we reached clause 57 of the
Bill?</div><a name="06061412000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question arises from the speech that my hon. Friend the Member for
Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) has just made. Does a tax loss
arise for the Government if the age remains at 25 and is not reduced to
18? If there is a tax loss, it seems to me that the Government have a
legitimate interest in the ageat which trusts vest in the
beneficiaries. If the Government have no interest whatever in the
financial outcome, their position is somewhat less secure and they owe
it to the Committee to provide slightly more reasons than they have so
far as to why they wish to second-guess the
beneficiaries.</div><a name="06061412000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow) said that if we do not reduce the age
to 18 that would erode the personal choice of the 18-year-old, but the
personal-choice argument, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and
Kenilworth said, works both ways. If the age is reduced to 18, the
personal choice of the person 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 601</div>who currently has the assets&#151;the beneficiary&#151;is eroded.
The Government should make a slightly stronger
case.</div><a name="06061412000121"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000553"></a>Ms

Gentleman said, the personal choice of the beneficiary. What is in
question is the right of the nation as a whole that the money should be
taxed as other forms of income are
taxed.</div><a name="06061412000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000554"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> The point is that the Government are seeking
to influence the personal choice of the donor by imposing a tax penalty
if the age at which the trust vests is 25 and not 18. A number of my
hon. Friends have asked what the argument is that forces the Government
to reduce the age from 25 to 18 given that they may have no financial
interest in the outcome. If the Paymaster General cannot produce a
figure for the loss to the Government if the age remains at 25, their
argument so far seems to be astonishingly
weak.</div><a name="06061412000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000555"></a>Dawn

trusts.</div><a name="06061412000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the nicest
possible way, I caution the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet against
continually referring back to 1975 and what happened in that context.
If she looked a little more closely, she would see that the context in
which the 1975 rules were introduced with capital transfer tax was a
background of every transfer from an individual during life or after
death being liable to CTT. If she dug a little further, she would see
that the technical debate at that time in connection with interest in
possession trusts were treated as being earned by a tenant and were not
subject to the mainstream periodic and exit charges in that context. At
that time, trusts that were not a vehicle were subject to a series of
changes that started in 1986&#151;the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne touched on this when she hinted that the Liberal Democrats
might want to abolish potentially exempt transfers&#151;and were
developed in 1987 through subsequent changes. That began a process that
paved the way for some of the tax planning that the Government now wish
to deal
with.</div><a name="06061412000462"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="06061412000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the
first opportunity that we have had to debate the schedule. Second
Reading did not give us an opportunity, and we debated a new clause in
Committee on the Floor of the House. I have no complaints about it, but
the Opposition chose to debate a new clause rather than the clause and
schedule. In those debates, I tried to make it clear that it was the
Government&#146;s intention to make progress in this area.</div>
<a name="06061412000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal first with the
amendments themselves and then the points that the hon. Member for
Ludlow and others made about the mischief. I shall do my best to
describe the mischief without breaking taxpayer confidentiality. I am
sure that Members will understand that some of these arrangements are
long in the maturing&#151;the time from when arrangements are put in

<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 602</div><a name="06061412000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are specifically
concerned with the provisions in the Bill for trusts for young people
and, in particular, trusts set up when parents die and leave money to
young children. It is true that there has been a good deal of reaction
to the proposals in schedule 20, and it has focused on the rules for
bereaved minor children. It may help the Committee if I explain what
our legislation and associated amendments do and then turn to the
Opposition
amendments.</div><a name="06061412000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that the pre-Budget tax rules for A and M trusts were being
exploited to avoid inheritance tax. I shall give examples later, as
they are rather complicated. Opposition Members are trying to conflate
the sensible financial planning that parents or grandparents might make
for their children or grandchildren with the added advantage of getting
around the inheritance tax laws. The provision is not about that. I do
not have a trust, so I do not have one to declare. I have a will, but
it is not very complicated as I will not be paying&#151;not yet, I
hope&#151;inheritance tax on my estate. For most people, it is very
straightforward.</div><a name="06061412000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was clear that A and M trusts have been routinely used to shelter large
amounts of wealth from inheritance tax for long periods of time. We are
talking about money going into trusts in excess of the IHT threshold.
We are not talking about somebody&#146;s house, but about
&#163;285,000 going in to a trust with specific objectives in mind
about the tax consequences of the
trust.</div><a name="06061412000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">A debate that
we have had on many occasions in Finance Bills is about the development
of tax-driven strategies, as opposed to sensible strategies that people
would have engaged in anyway, all things being equal. That is what we
are trying to get to in dealing with these
arrangements.</div><a name="06061412000131"></a>

Primarolo:</b> I would like to make some progress, but I shall
give the hon. Lady an opportunity later. I am trying to lay out the
Government&#146;s changes and why we have made them. I shall then
come back to the abuse that we are attempting to deal with, and also
the point about the age of 18 or
25.</div><a name="06061412000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts are set up
ostensibly to provide for minor children, but that often happens in
circumstances in which there is no particular need for a
trust&#151;the sums involved being grossly disproportionate to those
required to provide for the child and most of the trust assets being
destined ultimately for other beneficiaries. However, let us park the
difference between sensible planning that allows children to have a
nest egg&#151;quite a large one in some cases&#151;and cases in
which there are other
beneficiaries.</div><a name="06061412000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have repeatedly said that continued special provisions are justified
when trusts for bereaved minor children constitute a way to protect
children should they lose one or both parents, and that is precisely
the situation with which the provisions of schedule 20 are designed to
deal. The Government have also made it clear, as have I, that special
tax rules for bereaved children should no longer apply when children
reach adulthood at 18. It seems to me that however much to-ing and
fro-ing there is in the Committee, the age of maturity is 18, and the
point is the age of interaction with the tax system, rather than
whether parents want to tell their children that they cannot have the
money.</div>

advance my case. The discussion is going to be a long one and it is
important that the Government&#146;s approach be put on the record on
the first occasion.</div> <a name="06061412000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw the attention of Opposition Members to the rules applying to
trusts that pay income tax and capital gains tax. Special tax treatment
ends when a bereaved child reaches adulthood at the age of 18. My hon.
Friend the Economic Secretary has referred to child trust
funds.</div><a name="06061412000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that there is nothing in the Bill that forces settlors or
trustees to do anything whatever. The Government are providing a
specific inheritance tax regime for trusts for bereaved minor children
and it is subject to the conditions that we regard as appropriate. If
people do not wish to meet the conditions, they can still set up a
trust and pay some tax under the relevant tax legislation conditions.
In other words, they will simply fall within the mainstream rules that
apply to any other
trust.</div><a name="06061412000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have tabled amendments that refine the provisions in this
area&#151;amendments that are necessary to ensure that the
legislation accurately reflects the Government&#146;s intention on
the treatment of trusts for bereaved minors. Opposition Members were
not inclined to agree when I said that that was my intention and the
Government&#146;s intention, but it is. As drafted, the Bill requires
parents to decide in advance in their will whether, if they should die,
the trust that they have established for their children should end at
18 and receive special treatment, or end at a later age and not receive
such treatment.</div><a name="06061412000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have always recognised that that can be a difficult
judgment, and I entirely agree with the points that some Members made.
Particularly if one is settling something on the child when they are
very young, it is difficult to decide whether, at 18, the child will be
alright, but the point that we are advancing is that we should not
assume that they will not be. However, I understand&#151;the point
has been put very well&#151;that people want their trustees to have
some flexibility, so that they can decide to hold back the full
entitlement to an inheritance past the age of 18 if that seems
appropriate to them in the circumstances.</div>
<a name="06061412000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to
remind us, A and Ms terminate at 25&#151;well, they are supposed to;
we will come to that. That is the Government&#146;s view. People
often overestimate the risk that such a deferral will ultimately be
needed. When 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 604</div>people talk about what is in wills, we have to remember that they are a
sort of precautionary principle&#151;just in case. Presumably, in the
case of most wills, the children are not bereaved before the age of 18;
in fact, their parents go on to live happy and long lives. The question
is whether our intention has always been to allow a degree of
flexibility, and whether that flexibility can be provided in a manner
consistent with our
objectives.</div><a name="06061412000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled by the Government make sure that the legislation for
trusts for bereaved minors operates in line with our intentions. When a
trust that is set up for a child in the event of the death of their
parent is set to run on until the child is 18 and 25, the amendments
provide that charges&#151;as the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet
acknowledged&#151;will apply only after the child&#146;s 18th
birthday. Amendment No. 384 makes it clear that the term
&#147;parent&#148;, in the context of a new trust for bereaved
minors, extends to step-parents. Taken together, the amendments mean
that the rules will operate fairly, but of course if there is an
absolute disagreement on whether the age should be 18 or 25, that
cannot be resolved in this Committee; that is where the Government
stand on the issue.</div>
<a name="06061412000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments tabled by the
Opposition appear to be designed to achieve a number of different but
related effects. One set of amendments&#151;Nos. 272 to
279&#151;allow trusts for minors to run on through to the age of 25
as a matter of course. The Government do not accept those amendments,
and I have explained why. It is clear that if we provided for that, the
maximum age would in practice become the standard age, and that is how
the system operates under the existing rules. I have already explained
why the Government believe that the special tax rules for children
should end at adulthood, at
18.</div><a name="06061412000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
set of amendments in the Opposition&#146;s name&#151;Nos. 287, 290
to 294 and 297&#151;seek to shelter existing A and M trusts from the
new charges. There is no justification for that. The mainstream charge
will not arise on the existing trusts until the end of the transition
period in April 2008, and even then charges will only start to accrue
when such a trust goes on after the child has reached 18. That seems a
perfectly reasonable arrangement and I see no reason to go
further.</div> <a name="06061412000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
remaining Opposition amendments in this group&#151;Nos. 280 to 282,
and 284 to 286&#151;seek special treatment for A and M trusts if the
beneficiary becomes entitled to the income, but not the capital, when
the young person reaches 18. I think that the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet sensed that that was open to manipulation, and so did not
particularly want to speak to that point. As we discussed in our
earlier, broader debate, the heart of the issue is that the gift is
controlled.</div>

action that I propose is fair and proportionate and offers a way

decide what might be the case when the children reach 18. Allowing
flexibility for trustees is a sensible way
forward.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000562"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Paymaster General stated that
the question was about whether the legislation accurately reflected the
Government&#146;s intention, which was to allow flexibility. Will she
clarify something? Has the Government&#146;s intention all along been
to allow flexibility, but in its original drafting the Bill woefully
failed to do that, or have the Government changed their intention in
favour of flexibility and amended the Bill
accordingly?</div><a name="06061412000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000563"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> On the issue of 18 to 25, it was, on
reflection, a little harsh to start the charge immediately, so we are
making the relevant changes. On flexibility, as I have said during
Second Reading debates and in Committees of the whole House, I have
always tried to concentrate on the point at issue, which is when the
tax system engages. I have acknowledged that trusts are made for many
reasons that have nothing to do with the tax system, and there is no
intention to disturb that. It is a question of when the tax system
engages.</div><a name="06061412000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000564"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000566"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I still do not feel that the Paymaster General
has explained why the shift in the vesting age addresses the point
about which she is concerned. A number of her comments seem to have
been predicated on anxieties about the potentially exempt transfer
system. Are the proposals in schedule 20 a prelude to a Government
proposal to get rid of the potentially exempt transfers? What is it
about a vesting age at25 that gives rise to the possibility of
abuse when that is not present for a trust for which the vesting age is
18?</div><a name="06061412000154"></a>

Primarolo:</b> If I address the issue of abuse, perhaps that
will answer the hon. Lady&#146;s questions. Unfortunately, I fear
that whatever I tell her, she simply does not believe me. I explained
that the changes under discussion and those we made elsewhere were part
of a longer process of making sure, whenever possible&#151;as the
hon. Lady has acknowledged, the area is incredibly complex and at least
a modicum of simplification, and a modicum of standardisation of rules
across trusts, should take place.</div>
<a name="06061412000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this area, we were also
looking to deal with a small number of specific cases, which caused
people to fear the worst, hence the sense that somehow we were going to
deal with potentially exempt transfers. People feared that something
huge was happening when it was not. Let us not go back over what helped
to contribute to those perceptions; I have advanced my view.</div>
<a name="06061412000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
look first at what has been said. I dealt with the question of
retrospection, and the date is April 2008. On 10 May, a leading
accountant appeared before the Lords Economic Affairs Committee. He
comments a lot on Finance Bills, and has done for many years. He said
that many of the professionals are exaggerating the problem, and that
the problem for the Government was that if they had consulted when they
were dealing with what they perceived to be an avoidance mechanism,
there would have been forestalling, and dealing with the problem would
have been more complicated.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column605" />Column number: 606</div><a name="06061412000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context of all those
millions being bandied about, the Treasury Committee rightly
questionedhow the estimates were achieved. Under the new
rules, A and M and IIP trust charges apply on trusts with assets
exceeding the inheritance tax threshold of &#163;285,000. Anything
under that is not affected. The transitional rules mean that pre-Budget
IIP trusts are effectively grandfathered. So, taking into account the
exemption for trusts with assets under the IHT threshold and the
transitional provisions, it was modelled as best could be that there
were about 100,000 discretionary and A and M trusts. Only some of them
are A and M trusts, and of them, only some are large enough to be
potentially liable for trust charges. Believe it or not, people do not
actually tell HMRC when they are making financial arrangements to try
to get around tax charges for which they should not be making
arrangements.</div>

<a name="06061412000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000569"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I shall just finish, because
I want to give the examples of abuse. It was interesting that the hon.
Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) talked about
grandfathers and grandparents, and we are talking about inheritance tax
so we need to be clear.</div>
<a name="06061412000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
give two examples of the type of arrangements. The first is in answer
to the hon. Member for Ludlow, using an A and M trust in line.
Grandparents put&#163;1 million into an A and M trust in the
name of their newborn grandchild. No IHT is paid when the trust is set
up, and once the grandparents survive seven years, any potential IHT
liability is wiped out. The trust is set to operate in accordance with
the grandparents&#146; wishes, even after they have died. The trust
is set up ostensibly to pay for the grandchildren&#146;s education,
but the child&#146;s parents also have substantial wealth, so in
practice, the contents of the trust are barely touched. At 25,
theA and M trust, now worth &#163;2 million, having been
actively invested in, transforms into an IIP trust for the grandchild.
No IHT is paid at that point. Trustees will follow the
grandparents&#146; wishes in deciding how the now adult grandchild
will benefit from it. The grandchild might eventually receive it
outright, or alternatively, the trustees might decide to give the trust
to someone else entirely. In the meantime, the trustees can make other
payments to anyone else they feel like.</div>
<a name="06061412000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, by putting money
into a trust during their life, a wealthy grandparent has transmitted
significant wealth down the generations without paying any IHT and
while effectively retaining control of how the money and trust is used.
If the &#163;2 million had been left outright in a will and had
attracted IHT at 40 per cent., the Exchequer would have been paid
&#163;800,000. This is not a debate about whether people agree with
inheritance tax and with a tax on the estate of a person who dies. That
is how it operates, and this is about making sure that it operates for
everyone else.</div>
<a name="06061412000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000570"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> The comparison should not be
between the amount of money that the grandparent leaves in their will,
because they have decided to gift their money at a much earlier stage,
and as a result of the potentially exempt transfer, it escapes IHT. It
could have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column606" />Column number: 607</div>gifted outright, survived the seven years and there the money is:
&#163;2 million, once well invested. That is the
comparison.</div>
<a name="06061412000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000571"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I agree, but the hon.
Gentleman heard what I said this morning: it is not gifted.
&#147;Gifted&#148; means complete control and Opposition Members
are making a case in favour of there not being control until the age of
25. I shall give an example of how, even at 25, it finds its way
somewhere else. At the heart of the matter is the use of potentially
exempt transfers and the question of whether it was a
gift&#151;complete control&#151;or an arrangement in name only,
without the control and with directions on the use of the assets not
coming from the person who is supposed to be the beneficiary of the
gift.</div>
<a name="06061412000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider the example of an A and M trust on death. Grandparents state
in their will that on their death &#163;1 million will go into an A
and M trust for their grandchildren. When they die, 40 per cent. IHT is
payable on the grandparents&#146; estate, but moving the money into
an A and M trust is the first step in a series of
transactions&#151;the interaction of A and Ms and IIPs&#151;that
could enable the money to remain completely free of IHT for several
generations. IHT is not paid once for all the generations in a family:
that is not how it operates.</div>
<a name="06061412000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">At step 1,
because &#163;1 million was moved into atrust for
grandchildren, a generation is skipped. Before schedule 20 was
introduced, the A and M trust was completely exempt from IHT for as
long as the money remained in the trust. At step 2, when the
grandchildren reach adulthood, the trustee often sets up an interest in
possession trust with the capital, which presumably led the hon. Member
for Chipping Barnet to table her amendment that sought to separate the
interest, as opposed to controlling the capital because it is the
capital that can then be transmitted on to the interest in possession
trust. The grandchildren do not have access to the capital. The trust
remains free from inheritance tax and the trustees are able to make ad
hoc payments out of the trust to any other beneficiary. Those payments
are free from inheritance tax as long as the grandchild lived for seven
years after the transfer.</div>
<a name="06061412000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, at step 3, the
trustees can resettle the capital in the trust to a new A and M trust
for the grandchildren&#146;s children. Again, those resettlements are
free from IHT if the relevant grandchild survived for seven years. That
pattern can repeat itself for as long as the money
lasts.</div><a name="06061412000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
wealth is put into trusts at the death of the grandparents. They ensure
that they are sheltered from IHT for several generations, while at the
same time ensuring that they effectively retain control over the assets
indefinitely. That is the narrow mischief that the Government want to
deal with in the schedule. As we deal with the rest of the amendments,
we shall see how that matter plays out in relation to the different
subject
areas.</div><a name="06061412000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000572"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000573"></a>The

hon. Lady has completed her remarks, but I also want to raise a point
of order. Could I ask the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Stephen
Hesford) to ensure that his communication device is not audible in
future? I also remind all hon. and right hon. Members that the Chairman
of Ways and Means has ruled that communication devices should not be
used in Committee: that includes BlackBerrys and everything else. If
anyone has a mobile phone or something similar, can they ensure that it
is set to silent and does not interrupt the work of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000574"></a>Stephen

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000576"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I thank the Paymaster General for illustrating the
mischief. I should like to make two points arising from her remarks.
First, I believe that she said that the Treasury had modelled the
number of discretionary trusts to which the measure might apply. I am
pleased to hear that the Treasury is capable of doing some modelling.
Will she please elucidate further by declaring the basis of the
modelling and the assumptions that were
used?</div><a name="06061412000464"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000577"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I did not
mean to mislead him. I told him how we settled and how I was advised on
the number of trusts. I concede that that is difficult to do. That is
our view and that is how we settled on those numbers. I should not like
to lead him to believe that there is some economic model operating. I
am sorry if that was the impression that I gave; that is not
true.</div><a name="06061412000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000578"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I am grateful for that. It is clear that the
Treasury has no idea how many trusts are involved and, therefore, has
no clear idea of the extent of the
mischief.</div><a name="06061412000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Paymaster General gave the Committee some examples. I congratulate her
on the complexity, particularly in her second example about assets
cascading forever, potentially, from generation to generation. With
regard to the second point that I was going to make, I should be
interested to know how many instances of that type of thing have been
reported to HMRC. I suspect that it is a very small number. As is so
often the case with this Government, a sledgehammer is being used to
smash a minuscule
nut.</div><a name="06061412000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000579"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I am grateful to
the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I am not sure in the complex example
given&#151;I may not have understood it correctly&#151;how the
Government would ever know. That is the point of the example; there is
no tax being
paid.</div><a name="06061412000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000580"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I had finished my
remarks.</div><a name="06061412000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000581"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I should like to take the
opportunity to respond to some of the points made by the Paymaster
General. I remain concerned, like a number of my hon. Friends, about
the Government&#146;s assessment of the number of families and trusts
affected by the proposals. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 609</div>As we shall see, in relation to the IIP provisions and the spouse
exemption, the impact of the proposals will potentially be felt much
more broadly than in the small fraction of the wealthiest of the
wealthy that the Paymaster General envisaged being affected.</div>
<a name="06061412000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee still lacks much
information about how the Treasury reached its conclusion. Of course,
had the Government chosen to consult on the proposals before
introducing them, they would have had a much clearer understanding of
who would be affected by them and we would not have a problematic
schedule amended by highly complex amendments that still leave a number
of people puzzled about how they work, as the hon. Member for Falmouth
and Camborne explained. This is not the best way to write the tax law
of this country.</div><a name="06061412000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the point that I put to the Paymaster General, which is that
the heart of her concern seems not to be the fact of setting up a
trust, but the availability of a potentially exempt transfer. That
seems to be the vice that she is concerned about. It is unfortunate
that the trusts are attacked as a result of something that is available
to outright transfers. There seems to be no justification for attacking
a trust used for all sorts of responsible reasons, as I outlined in
relation to clause 157, merely because of the application of the
potentially exempt transfer system, which can be used in relation to
outright transfers as well. Under the schedule&#151;departing from
many years of consensus on the approach to taxation&#151;taxation of
trusts will be more penal than the situation that is applicable to
outright
transfers.</div><a name="06061412000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the 18 to 25 age issue, the Paymaster General was focused on schemes
that she saw as abusive. She has not yet answered the concerns
expressed by a number of my hon. Friends on the right of parents to
take a decision about how much wealth to pass to their children. She
says that no one will be forced to transfer wealth to 18-year-olds,
which is correct in a literal sense, but the reality is that if a penal
tax charge is imposed on an existing trust, which can be relieved only
by changing the vesting age to 18, that is likely to put pressure on
parents to do so. As I said, the amendments would mitigate the size of
the tax penalty so that it would no longer be such a significant
problem. The changes to the IIP regime, which the Paymaster General is
also putting forward, would mitigate the problem because parents and
grandparents would have the option to set up IIPs on death.</div>
<a name="06061412000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that with existing A
and Ms and the 4.2 per cent. tax hit that is envisaged in the schedule
as the Paymaster General proposes to amend it, many parents will decide
to take the hit. They may prefer to pay the tax rather than see wealth
vested in their children before they are mature enough to cope with it.
Contrary to the assertions made by a number of hon. Members, the
Opposition are not saying that every 18-year-old is incapable of
handling their own money. Many 18-year-olds may be mature enough to
cope with vast quantities of cash, although I am not sure that they are
that common. We are obviously not saying that no teenager is capable of
handling money. But we are saying that the people who are best placed
to decide when teenagers should get the money are their parents, not
the Government.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column609" />Column number: 610</div><a name="06061412000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000582"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> The hon. Lady has made much of the point about
parents deciding about the maturity of their children. Will she suggest
the age that children need to reach in order for parents to make such a
judgment? It would be ridiculous for parents to make that judgment when
the children were only five, but would the parents be in a position to
do so when the children were aged 15? The reality is that such
judgments are made more than 10 years before anyone is 18 or
25.</div><a name="06061412000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000583"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> There are many ages at which a parent could make
a decision on how responsible a child is likely to be at
18.</div><a name="06061412000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the
point that the Economic Secretary made repeatedly&#151;that the child
trust fund vests at 18&#151;my understanding is that parents cannot
claim tax credits until they are 25, so there are other ways in which
the law recognises the higher age. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am prepared
to be corrected, but I understand that some tax credits are not payable
until the age of 25. No doubt the Paymaster General can explain the
correct position.</div><a name="06061412000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of my hon. Friends mentioned the last-minute tabling of the
amendments. It has proved to be a challenge to consider them in the
short period before they were discussed in Committee and I hope that
there will be an opportunity to return to the matter on Report if they
have significant defects. During the period before Report, I hope that
we can have a little more clarification on how they will
work.</div><a name="06061412000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still
unsure about whether the relief for existing A and Ms will apply to
trusts where neither parent is deceased or whether it is restricted to
A and Ms where there is one deceased parent. If the Paymaster General
can give me an indication one way or the other it would be useful
because it has a significant impact on how positive the changes
provided by her amendmentswill
be.</div><a name="06061412000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that that more or less concludes what I wanted to say. I
reiterate our concern about the amendments. Many parents who are faced
with the choice will probably retain the vesting age at 25 and pay the
tax. That is further proof of the critique of these proposals that the
Opposition made from the outset: that in the main the vast majority of
trusts that will be hit by schedule 20 as drafted are motivated not by
tax considerations but by prudent families trying to provide
responsibly and sensibly for their children and their relatives. That
is why I propose to press our amendment to retain a vesting age of 25
and to disapply the retrospective effect to current A and M
trusts.</div><a name="06061412000189"></a>

Goldsworthy:</b> I have a couple of brief points. During her
earlier remarks, the Paymaster General referred to the fact that the

the number of amendments that they tabled and the time at which they
tabled them.</div><a name="06061412000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
the Paymaster General for the examples that she gave. Unlike the hon.
Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers), my concerns do not focus
around the age at which individuals should have access to capital or
income from trusts but around retrospection, which is my primary
concern. I may not have heard the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 611</div>Paymaster General discuss that issue. I would appreciate her comments on
why the Government chose to apply the new regulations to existing
trusts as well as new ones. Clearly, trusts below the inheritance tax
threshold may need to change to reflect the changes in the legislation
in order to comply or if in the future they fall above the threshold. I
would be grateful if she would clarify why it is not possible after 22

point when I gave examples of how the trust structure was being
misused. As existing trusts are the very point that we are trying to
deal with, the obvious question is why the Government would countenance
allowing all the trusts that are at present undertaking avoidance to
continue to do so, given that the Finance Bill is about limiting
damage. I thought I dealt with

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000622"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The amendments relate to rules for trusts set
up to provide for a disabled person. At the outset, let me briefly set
out the broad purpose of the measure. As I said earlier, it had become
clear that some individuals were using trusts&#151;in particular,
trusts set up by people during their lifetimes&#151;to achieve an
unfair IHT advantage. That is the primary source of IHT avoidance,
which amendment No. 383 is trying to counter, and that is why the
Government believe that it is right to bring the sorts of trusts that
we have been discussing under the mainstream IHT rules for
trusts.</div> <a name="06061412000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
inheritance tax rules have always contained special provisions for
trusts set up to provide for a disabled person. For people who find it
difficult or impossible to cope with the demands of owning assets
outright, a trust will often be the most practical way for substantial
assets to be held. The rules recognise that, and in such circumstances
treat those trusts in the same way as outright ownership. Trusts for
disabled people are the only exception to the new rules for trusts set
up in life. The Government have always tried to be clear that that
treatment is justified. Furthermore, the Government took the
opportunity in the draft Bill to bring the rules into line with the
equivalent parts of the income tax and capital gains tax
rules.</div> <a name="06061412000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 388, along with the consequential Government amendments
Nos. 383, 389, 390 and 392, will introduce new sections 89A and 89B
into the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. They will extend the relief in two
further respects. First, the Government amendments make technical
changes that will ensure that the rules operate for all types of trust
set up for a disabled person. The old rules made explicit provision for
discretionary trusts for disabled people, but not for interest in
possession trusts for disabled people. An omission in the drafting of
the Bill meant that some interest in possession trusts for disabled
people might not be brought within the new rules. That is clearly not
what was intended, and the amendments rectify the situation.</div>
<a name="06061412000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the amendments extend
what is already in the Bill to cover people with degenerative
illnesses. I am talking about people who do not yet fall within the
definition of &#147;disability&#148; in the rules, but who have
good reason to expect that they will shortly be incapable of dealing
with outright ownership of their assets. There are good arguments for
the use of a trust in such cases, and our amendments will extend
special treatment to trusts set up for people in those circumstances
for their own future benefit.</div>
<a name="06061412000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
Opposition amendments Nos. 199 to 203, 205 to 207, 344 to 346, 348 and
349, I am pleased to say that the Government amendments make the same
technical changes as many of the Opposition amendments, particularly
amendment No. 344. However, I am afraid that the other amendments in
the group would modify the Bill in ways that we do not propose to
accept. One theme in the amendments is to replace the current reference
to people who are incapable as defined under the Mental Health Act 1983
with something based on a notion of capacity within the Mental Capacity
Act 2005. While I sympathise with the desire to keep the tax code up to
date with developments in non-tax legislation, I do not consider that
those particular changes would really improve matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column613" />Column number: 614</div><a name="06061412000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the amendments raise
doubts over the continuing eligibility of trusts already in existence
that qualified originally for special treatment by reference to the
provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983. The majority of the trusts in
question will fall into that category for many years to come. Secondly,
the Mental Capacity Act 2005 is not yet in force, which would mean a
delay in introducing the provisions for disabled trusts. Thirdly, even
when the Act does come into force, it will be effective only in England
and
Wales.</div><a name="06061412000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000623"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> If the Paymaster General is worried about the
impact of trusts that qualify at the moment under the terms of the
Mental Health Act 1983, could not transitional provisions be included
to ensure that they continued to receive the same treatment? As for the
point that the Mental Capacity Act 2005 is not yet in force&#151;it
is not expected to be for another couple of years&#151;it would be a
problem if we were to postpone the implementation of the definition for
that period, which one of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne proposes. It would leave the trusts in limbo. The
Mental Capacity Act received Royal Assent, but the fact that it is not
yet in operation does not stop the Bill cross-referring to
it.</div><a name="06061412000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000624"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The final important problem is that the
amendments make a fundamental mistake about how the Mental Capacity Act
is meant to work when the amendments refer to an individual who lacks
capacity. The whole point of the Act is that capacity is not an
all-or-nothing issue. People may lack the capacity for dealing with
some matters while remaining quite capable of dealing with other
aspects of their life. The Act is designed to ensure that affairs
should only be interfered with to the minimum possible extent, so any
reference to it would have to spell out precisely what sort of matters
a person would have to lack capacity to deal with in order to qualify
for the special IHT treatment. That would be especially difficult when
looking ahead five years along the lines of the Opposition
amendments.</div><a name="06061412000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed what Act is the most appropriate to use at different points
of the tax system with regard to mental health. It is difficult to see
how that can be made to work without attempting to put hugely complex
and probably highly subjective statements and definitions into tax
legislation. The Government&#146;s view is that the existing
legislation works perfectly well by reference to the Mental Health
Act.</div><a name="06061412000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
suggested that we should allow someone to set up a disabled trust if
they can show HMRC that, when the trust was set up, the disabled person
would have qualified for the allowance if they had claimed it. I am
reluctant to accept the amendment for a practical reason. HMRC is
capable in many ways&#151;never a truer statement&#151;and the
growing department is handling more and more. However, it is not
equipped to reach medical judgments on whether an individual would in
the past have been capable or able to claim attendance or disability
living allowance had they decided to do so. We have had similar
discussions when considering different Finance Bills and that has
always been my view. It is not a poor reflection on HMRC. I just think
that there are limits.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 615</div><a name="06061412000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">If someone were thinking of
setting up a trust for a disabled person, I am sure that arrangements
could be made for that person to submit a claim if that were believed
important for tax purposes. We have discussed that in relation to other
parts of the Bill and other tax legislation. It may only be necessary
when the amounts involved exceed the inheritance tax
threshold&#151;currently &#163;285,000, rising to &#163;325,000
in 2009.</div><a name="06061412000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
substantive proposal in the Opposition amendments would extend the
scope of IHT provision to beneficiaries who have any form of
entitlement to disability living allowance, rather than restricting it
as at present to those who are eligible specifically for the care
component of DLA at the highest or middle rate. That might reflect a
straightforward difference of opinion between the Government and the
Opposition.</div><a name="06061412000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
IHT reliefs have never been designed to deliver extra resources to
disabled people on account of their disability. It is clear that many
people who suffer some degree of disability as a matter of general law
may have no material difficulties in handling the financial aspects of
their life. That is true for many people who are entitled to disability
living allowance but who do not currently fall within the tax
definition. The mere fact that an individual has a mobility problem
does not mean that they cannot handle their own finances, and to assume
otherwise would take us down a difficult and unhappy route&#151;one
that tax legislation took in the distant past, when judgments were made
about the capacity of
individuals.</div><a name="06061412000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition in the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 is the same as the
definition for income tax and property gains purposes, which itself has
only recently been subjected to extensive consultation. There is a
surprise. The consensus in that consultation, which included
contributions from a wide range of groups representing the disabled,
and some large charities for the disabled, was that the definition used
by the Government is the right
one.</div><a name="06061412000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have explained the Government amendments. I can see the
desired effect of the changes proposed by the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet, but the route she suggests would be a difficult one to take at
this point. The Government have taken care to ensure that the rules for
disabled people&#146;s trusts will operate fairly and practically.
The amendments do not provide for a better system&#151;they could
lead to a more difficult situation and could have some unintended
effects.</div><a name="06061412000261"></a>

account of her own amendment and for her discussion of my proposed

the amendments tabled by myself and her. Some of them are identical,
and both are based on those contained in the useful briefing that was
circulated by members of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which has
worked with a number of organisations on the
matter.</div><a name="06061412000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group has
expressed grave concerns that the provisions in the Bill could have a

<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 616</div>amendments do not imply that the disabled are incapable of managing
their own affairs&#151;far from it. The Opposition amendments are
designed to give to the disabled every facility to use trusts when they
feel that it would be in their best interests to do so, and I
understand from a number of groups that work closely with those
affected by disability that the trust device is an extremely useful one
for many of them in dealing with their daily
lives.</div><a name="06061412000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">6.15

well. The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group is
concerned</div><a name="06061412000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the

<a name="06061412000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Organisations such as
that group believe that the definition is too narrow, hence my
amendments and those tabled by my hon. Friends to broaden that
definition.</div>
<a name="06061412000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prior to the
Budget, the section 89 carve-out received little attention and was
seldom used. It has only become more important with the imposition of
new charges on a range of other trusts. It has grown in significance.
Prior to the Budget, most people who set up trusts for disabled
children or relatives chose to set up life interest trusts. They were
considered simpler and more user-friendly than the rather clunky
discretionary trusts that could be used within section 89. Typically,
trusts for the disabled are set up inter vivos&#151;during the
lifetime of the settlor. Therefore, given the changes in the Budget,
they will attract the new charges, unless they fall within section 89
or within the scope of the Government amendments tabled in the past few
days.</div>
<a name="06061412000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
move to embrace interest in possession trusts, which is envisaged by
the Paymaster General&#146;s amendments. The problem with section 89
and schedule 20, as originally drafted, is that it provided for
discretionary trusts under section 89 but did not provide for interest
in possession trusts; and it did not allow disabled people to set up
trusts over their own property. Schedule 20, as drafted, would apply
the new charges to such trusts because they are set up inter vivos and
trusts set up during the lifetime of the settlor will attract the new
charges, unless they can be fitted into the
carve-out.</div><a name="06061412000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the problems in relation to the definition of disability that the
Paymaster General has already outlined. Organisations such as Mind, the
Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society and the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group
are concerned about the limits set on the people who are considered to
be disabled for the purposes of the new IHT regime. There is the
question whether it is appropriate to include a definition from the
Mental Health Act 1983 as opposed to the more up-to-date legislation
contained under the Mental CapacityAct 2005. There is also the
matter of the limitation to people who are in receipt of attendance
allowance or disability living allowance by virtue of entitlement to
the care component at the highest or middle
rate.</div><a name="06061412000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another definition of disability used in statute. It is not
contained in the amendments because it was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 617</div>felt to be too radical. However, under the Disability Discrimination Act
1995, the definition of disability
is:</div><a name="06061412000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person has a
disability for the purposes of this Act if he has a physical or mental
impairment which has a physical or mental impairment which has a
substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out
normal day-to-day activities.&#148;</div>
<a name="06061412000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Low
Incomes Tax Reform Group cites that broad definition in contrast to the
restricted definition on which the Government are relying. It
highlights a number of groups that will fall outside the categories
proposed in schedule 20 and section 89, including people who receive
one of two mobility components of DLA, those who get a lower-rate care
component of DLA&#151;people who need an hour&#146;s care or more a
day, but not frequent care&#151;non-claimants who would have been
entitled if they had claimed, as the Paymaster General mentioned, and
people who are not mentally disordered, but have a partial capacity or
who have a progressive illness and need to organise their affairs in
advance to take into account the deterioration of their
condition.</div>
<a name="06061412000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group also
highlights concerns about people who have fluctuating capacity, such as
those with periodic attacks of mental illness. In particular,
beneficiaries under trusts set up over personal injury damages or money
from disaster funds who may have a high mobility component and a lower
care component of DLA are excluded. Falling outside the scope of
section 89 means that their trust funds will suffer the 10-year charges
and exit penalties, so it is important to get this issue
right.</div>
<a name="06061412000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 20 could
also mean that similar charges apply to trusts set up for the benefit
of people with progressive illnesses such as Alzheimer&#146;s, which
is also an important matter. Those with fluctuating conditions such as
depression or schizophrenia may also be outside the scope of the
definition since their conditions may not be serious enough to deprive
them of capacity as set out in the Mental Health Act
1983.</div><a name="06061412000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course there are other options for dealing with the situation of
disabled people or those who lack capacity. It is possible to protect
vulnerable beneficiaries of that nature via an enduring power of
attorney or the Court of Protection. Those options are important, but
they may not be an adequate or suitable way to deal with the needs of
many people. In particular, the Court of Protection route is highly
prescriptive and very expensive, and an enduring power of attorney
suffers the drawback that it is granted to an individual. If anything
happens to them, they may not be available to deal with problems.
Therefore, it does not have the flexibility of a trust in all
cases.</div><a name="06061412000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Neither
the enduring power of attorney option nor the Court of Protection
option caters well for people with a fluctuating capacity. Both options
are important, but the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group states that there
should continue to be the same choice available to vulnerable
beneficiaries of the sort that we are discussing&#151;that is, the
same choice between use of trusts, enduring power of attorney and Court
of Protection. It states
that</div><a name="06061412000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the determinant of
the choice should be the best interests of the vulnerable beneficiary,
not the vagaries of the tax system.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 618</div><a name="06061412000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Paymaster General said, I have tabled amendments&#151;in some cases
with the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne&#151;that seek to deal
with the problems that I have outlined. Amendments Nos. 199 and 201
deal with the life interest point by extending the carve-out in section
89 to cover interest in possession trusts for disabled people.
Consequential drafting changes are made in amendments Nos. 200, 202 and
204. The result of the amendments would be that life interest trusts
set up for people who count as disabled within the definition contained
in section 89 would be free of the new entry and periodic charges. Such
trusts would continue to be governed by the present rules, with an IHT
charge on the death of the life tenant. The amendments would have that
result regardless of whether a disabled person set up a trust over
their own property or whether someone else set up a trust for them.
Thus the amendments would also cover the self-settlement point, which I
shall address
later.</div><a name="06061412000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
assistance in respect of self-settlement would also be derived from
amendments Nos. 300 to 318, which we shall discuss in due course. They
would put all self-settlement outside the scope of the new
charges.</div><a name="06061412000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the short time since the Government amendments in the group were
tabled, it has not been easy to establish exactly how they will work,
but it appears that many of the issues that I have outlined in respect
of interest in possession trusts and self-settlement will be solved
with adoption of the Government&#146;s amendments. I welcome them as
a response to the amendments that I tabled along the same
lines.</div><a name="06061412000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems from the drafting and from what the Paymaster General said that
new section 89B(1)(d) will make it possible for a disabled person to
set up a life interest trust over their own property. That is a welcome
move by the Government. New section 89B(1)(c) seems to provide that a
third party can also set up a life interest trust for a disabled
person. Again, the Paymaster General&#146;s earlier remarks seemed to
confirm that my understanding of that is correct. It seems that the
primary problems with life interest trusts would be solved by the
Government&#146;s
amendments.</div><a name="06061412000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
section 89A provides that someone who has a condition that is likely to
lead to their becoming disabled can set up a trust over their assets.
It seems to provide some comfort to those with degenerative diseases
such as HIV, Alzheimer&#146;s and Parkinson&#146;s. With diseases
of that seriousness, one would have thought that many of them would be
able to show on the balance of probabilities that their condition would
eventually lead to the ability to make the required benefits claims
within the meaning of disability, or to bring themselves within the
capacity definition that is contained within the meaning of disability
for the purposes of section 89.</div>
<a name="06061412000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s
amendments do not appear to resolve one problem concerning IIP trusts
that those people with the degenerative conditions to which I have
referred set up in contemplation of the onset of disability. Although
the individual themselves can set up that trust, if their parents,
relatives or other people wish to pay into it, they would have to pay
the new IHT charges. I should be interested to hear from the Paymaster
General whether I have understood that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 619</div>section correctly, because it would seem to be a drawback, preventing
others from contributing to the trusts that the disabled person set
up.</div> <a name="06061412000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
welcome those moves, the Government&#146;s amendments leave a number
of other significant problems that have not been solved. I received an
e-mail from Mind this morning, which confirmed its view on the
matter:</div> <a name="06061412000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
sensible approach would be for the government to undertake a longer and
more considered review of the issue relating to charges on trusts for
people without mental capacity, people with fluctuating capacity and/or
disabilities.&#148;</div> <a name="06061412000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
barrister, James Kessler QC, who is very much an expert in this area,
said&#151;in my view rather harshly&#151;of the
amendments:</div>
<a name="06061412000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In my view, the new
clauses offer about 1 per cent. of what is needed to give us a proper
system of trusts taxation for the most vulnerable in
society.&#148;</div> <a name="06061412000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
drawback, as we have already heard from the Paymaster General, is that
her amendments do not address the problems with the definition of
disability.</div> <a name="06061412000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment No. 345 removes from section 89 the reference to the
definition contained in the Mental Health Act 1983 and inserts instead
a reference to the definition of mental incapacity contained in section
2 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. There is a fundamental difference
between the two. First, the Paymaster General has already referred to
the fact that the Mental Capacity Act is more up to date. It represents
more closely the current thinking on the issue, it was consulted on for
about 12 years and it includes a good definition.</div>
<a name="06061412000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is another
serious distinction between the way in which those two statutes work.
The 1983 Act is about deciding who should receive compulsory
treatment&#151;the criteria at the heart of it are about whether the
person is a risk to themselves or others&#151;whereas the 2005 Act is
designed to be empowering and to focus on capacity and people&#146;s
ability to make their own decisions about their own lives.</div>
<a name="06061412000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take on board the Paymaster
General&#146;s point that the test is more complex, and that it
applies differently in different situations. The definition provides
simply:</div> <a name="06061412000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in relation to any
matter if at the material time, he is unable to make a decision for
himself because of an impairment of or disturbance in the functioning
of the mind or brain.&#148;</div>
<a name="06061412000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a superior definition, and it
relates more closely to the situation with which we are dealing: for
example, the question about whether the person is happy and able to
deal with their own affairs. That is a different criterion from that in
the 1983 Act.</div> <a name="06061412000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said in an intervention on the Paymaster General, it is not necessary
as a matter of logic to postpone an implementation of a definition
based on the 2005 Act. It may not be in force, but the definition is
clear, and the fact that it is not in force does not prevent us from
incorporating it in section 89 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. I agree
that significant problems would arise if we were left in limbo without
a definition for several months, because section 89 could not be used.
As we have heard, the significant extension 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 620</div>of the new IHT charges will mean that the importance of section 89 will
be increased, and it would be very difficult if the disabled were
prevented from using it.</div>
<a name="06061412000467"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30 pm</div>
<a name="06061412000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment No. 345 would not
only substitute an up-to-date definition of mental capacity, but
provide protection for people who are expected to lack capacity at some
point in the following five years.</div>
<a name="06061412000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne has tabled amendment No. 201, which is similar to
mine. I prefer my formulation; hers could be interpreted very widely,
because it brings into the definition anyone who might be expected to
lack capacity in the future. On the balance of probabilities, we are
all eventually likely to lack capacity, even if only during our closing
illness. By limiting the carve-out to those instances in which
incapacity is likely to follow within a particular period, my amendment
focuses more clearly on the concerns about degenerative illness and
fluctuating capacity that I have
outlined.</div><a name="06061412000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 203 and 349 widen the definition of the benefits relevant to
determining whether someone falls within the definition of
&#147;disabled&#148;. They would delete the restriction to those
claiming the highest or middle rate of the care component of the
disability living allowance, and therefore allow someone claiming the
low component of the care allowance to be included in the definition.
Amendment No. 205 provides that people who are entitled to attendance
allowance or disability living allowance will qualify under that
provision, even when they are not claiming it.</div>
<a name="06061412000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems
arbitrary to base the criteria on those who choose to claim benefits,
rather than those entitled to claim them. I acknowledge the
administrative implications of the change that agreeing to my amendment
would involve, but I hope that the Government will consider it, given
the importance of the issue. We have inherited the definition of
&#147;disabled&#148; from a tax statute that dates back many years
and is in pretty dire need of
updating.</div><a name="06061412000293"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000626"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I want to help the hon. Lady
so that she does not dig herself into a very deep hole. The Government
consulted extensively on the definition with charities and groups
representing the disabled, and that is how we arrived at the definition
of &#147;disabled&#148; for income tax and capital gains tax
purposes. We have simply used the same definition here. The hon. Lady
has cited organisations that took a different view, but in that
consultation, 41 organisations advised the Government to go the way
that we have gone. I entirely accept that there are different views,
but there are substantial organisations that say that we are using the
definition that we
should.</div><a name="06061412000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000627"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for that,
but the organisations to which I referred are concerned. The National
Autistic Society also has concerns and a number of organisations have
written only very recently to the Treasury to ask it to consider the
issue again.</div>
<a name="06061412000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
that the Government amendments help to mitigate what would otherwise be
the very damaging impact of schedule 20. Once agreed to, as I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 621</div>assume they will be, I hope that it will be possible for IIP interests
to be set up for and by disabled people. However, those amendments will
not protect vulnerable people who fall outside the definition of
&#147;disabled&#148;, nor those struggling with addiction problems,
who may wish to self-settle to protect their assets when they perhaps
fall off the wagon.</div>
<a name="06061412000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nor will the amendments protect
people who may be mentally vulnerable but are not so seriously ill as
to lack capacity. A classic example would be manic depressives. On its
website, Rethink, the charity that campaigns on mental health matters,
sets out some of the reasons why those with mental health problems
might wish to set things straight on their use of their own property.
It states that</div>
<a name="06061412000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Debt can also be
brought on by symptoms of the illness itself. People with mania
sometimes believe they are rich and go on spending sprees and people
with depression commonly spend money in an effort to make themselves
feel better. Conversely, people with depressive symptoms may withdraw
and ignore official letters, appointments and bills often leading to
mounting debt and a decrease in
income.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts can be an
invaluable support to those people and their families struggling with
mental illness and addiction.</div>
<a name="06061412000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the concessions made
by the Government, but I do not believe that they have gone far enough.
There is still a danger that the punitive charges under schedule 20
could be levelled at vulnerable people. The bar on self-settlement,
particularly, poses significant problems for vulnerable
people.</div><a name="06061412000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
shall quote a letter sent to the Treasury just a few days ago by the
organisations that I mentioned: the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, Mind,
the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society, the Chartered Institute of
Taxation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Law Society, STEP
and the National Autistic Society. In supporting the changes put
forward by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne and me, it
says:</div><a name="06061412000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
not seeking favoured tax treatment, but to protect vulnerable trust
beneficiaries from incurring a tax penalty that they would not have
incurred before Budget Day. There are so many inconsistencies in the
definition
in&#148;</div><a name="06061412000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">section</div><a name="06061412000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;89
that we firmly take the view that legislation cannot go forward as
currently drafted without causing severe prejudice to vulnerable
beneficiaries and discrimination between different classes of disabled
beneficiary, some of whom may qualify as disabled under the definition
and some of whom will not. I hope that the government will listen to
their
appeal.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000628"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Given the similarities between many of my
amendments and those of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet and her
colleagues, I shall not dwell too long on the same ground. However, I
have a few remarks to make. Like the hon. Lady, I can see some benefits
in the Government amendments dealing with some problems, including
situations where, if the Bill progressed as it is, trusts set up for
disabled people by means of a life interest in possession
trust&#151;not a discretionary trust&#151;would have been liable to
charges that would have depleted funds set aside for their medical and
care needs. However, the key issue is the definition of
&#147;disability&#148;, and eligibility to fit within this
regime.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 622</div><a name="06061412000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard plenty of
contributions. The Bill currently defines a disabled person, according
to the Mental Health Act 1983,
as</div><a name="06061412000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person who by
reason of mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act
1983 is incapable of administering his property or managing his
affairs, or...a person in receipt of attendance
allowance...or...disability living allowance...by virtue
of entitlement to the care component at the highest or middle
rate.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 1983 Act will
be repealed when the Mental Capacity Act 2005 comes into force in April
2007. As has already been said, that should not preclude the definition
of the 2005 Act being used in the
Bill.</div><a name="06061412000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
argument for using the more inclusive definition, because there is also
an issue about whether there is consistency with other areas. Section 1
of the 1995 Act defines as disabled a person
with:</div><a name="06061412000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a physical or
mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect
on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day
activities.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Work and Pensions consultative paper &#147;Delivering
Equality for Disabled People&#148;, at paragraph 5.4, sets the
standard for policy making and legislative drafting in relation to
disabled
people:</div><a name="06061412000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government considers that the definition used in the Disability
Discrimination Act...is most likely to be suitable for public
authorities working to promote
equality.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that there have been representations to HMRC and it has said that the
definition is too wide. If we are looking for consistency across
Departments and consistency of treatment, surely we need the definition
to be applied
uniformly.</div><a name="06061412000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
definition will exclude some people&#151;the relevant groups have
already been mentioned&#151;and affect people with fluctuating
conditions, which could include mental health problems, such as
schizophrenia or depression, and physical disabilities, such as
multiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy. These issues have still not
been addressed by the Government amendments, although, to some extent,
they have been looked
at.</div><a name="06061412000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to
mention that, under the definition in the Bill, referring to the 1983
Act, reference is made to the definition of the situation where
somebody has to be in receipt of attendance allowance or disability
living allowance. I am sure that the Paymaster General was aware that
not all the people entitled to those benefits claim them. There is a
concern that those people may fall through that
gap.</div><a name="06061412000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Conservative amendment No. 345, which is similar to amendment No. 201
that imposes a five-year time limit, again, people with fluctuating
conditions may not qualify, but in future their condition may
degenerate to the point where they would benefit from having access to
such beneficial treatment. Given the long-term nature of some
conditions, it is appropriate to retain the situation as it
is.</div><a name="06061412000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
improvements are welcome, but there are still considerable areas that
are problematic and need to be
addressed.</div><a name="06061412000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000629"></a><b class="B">Mr.

disabilities. It would be accurate to refer to all the children there
as vulnerable, which is why they were playing in a protected
environment. Many would also qualify as disabled, although that would
depend very much on which definition of disability was chosen. However,
I am not at all certain how many people, once they have reached 18,
will be judged incapable by reason of mental disorder within the
meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. Yet some such children, if they
are fortunate, and if their parents have the benefit of sound financial
advice, may well become beneficiaries of trusts that have been
established in order to protect their long-term financial
interests.</div><a name="06061412000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
the Committee that we are not dealing with faceless abstractions. Not
only have we all been lobbied by the usual professional bodies, some of
which have been mentioned today, on the potential repercussions of the
proposals, but we have all met with constituents who will be directly
affected. In the week after this year&#146;s Budget, I met with
members of my local branch of Rethink, the mental health charity. At
the time, some of the perverse implications of Budget note 25 were just
beginning to dawn, so it is fitting that months later we have the
opportunity to debate the proposals at length during carers
week.</div><a name="06061412000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts are
widely recognised as one of the great achievements of English law but
they are also often represented as a quaint anachronism, offering great
opportunities for the idle rich to cheat the Revenue of its right and
due. I am fortunate that one of my constituents is the chairman of the
probate and estate committee of the Society of Trust and Estate
Practitioners, known as STEP. He recently gave me some historical
texture, when he told me that trusts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 624</div>originated from the need for crusading knights to leave someone in
control of their property. There was no tax motive at all.</div>
<a name="06061412000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Foundation for People with
Learning Disabilities offers a less colourful justification for what
remains a practical vehicle for asset management. It comments
that</div><a name="06061412000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Historically
discretionary trusts were set up as a fund to pay for a few extras or
luxuries that welfare benefits or Social Services might not provide or
might not provide enough
of.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts
remain practical because they remain flexible, and the essence of such
flexibility is threatened by the current proposals. The amendments aim
to preserve something of that flexibility by ensuring that a
sufficiently large class of vulnerable beneficiaries can make use of
trusts without facing punitive taxation to which they would not be
liable if they held trust assets
outright.</div><a name="06061412000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rethink has
offered a compelling justification for the use of trusts. It has
said:</div><a name="06061412000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
people who are vulnerable to anxiety or psychosis it&#146;s
especially important for them to have a home and a regular
income...But many people with mental health problems find it
difficult or even impossible to cope with a benefit system which is too
complex for most people to understand and which sometimes demands
interviews or physical examinations as well as a great deal of form
filling.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts actually
answer this need by offering both stability and flexibility to meet the
needs of those who cannot cope with their own financial affairs. As
Mencap says:</div><a name="06061412000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
trust is a useful way to provide for a person with a learning
disability who may not be able to handle money left to them outright or
who may be vulnerable to pressure from other people. The trust
introduces a degree of protection because the trustees are in control
over the trust fund.&#148;</div><a name="06061412000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
degree of protection received by a beneficiary matches his or her
changing needs&#151;it is not an arbitrary, all-or-nothing solution
in the vein of an enduring power of
attorney.</div><a name="06061412000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed amendments are modest given the number of those potentially
affected by the current, overly prescriptive formula. Enlarging the
class of disabled persons defined by section 89 of the Inheritance Tax
Act to cover those in receipt of an element of the disability living
allowances still falls far short of a comprehensive definition of those
that society judges to be vulnerable. Furthermore, the definition of
capacity derived from the Mental Capacity Act 2005 falls short of the
broader definition that derives from the Disability Discrimination Act
1995. The question remains whether even that definition is adequate,
because being vulnerable is not synonymous with being
disabled.</div><a name="06061412000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Low
Incomes Tax Reform Group has argued that the definition derived from
the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is the most appropriate to the
protection of the vulnerable. However, the matter of definition is best
answered by the purpose to which trusts are best suited, not as a
vehicle for sheltering assets from tax, but as a means of meeting
fluctuating needs. As James Kessler QC noted, while the use of the
Disability Discrimination Act is an
improvement,</div><a name="06061412000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in several
respects the definition is too
narrow&#148;</div><a name="06061412000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">because it still
does not account for progressive illnesses or fluctuating capacity to
which reference has already been made.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column624" />Column number: 625</div><a name="06061412000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The failure to address
progressive illness is indicative of a measure that is not progressive
by any stretch of the imagination. On the contrary, the fact that it is
retroactive has led to the charge from the Chartered Institute of
Taxation that its provisions are probably the most inefficient in
history. Most worrying of all are the reservations that Mr. Kessler
makes in connection with the definition drawn from the Disability
Discrimination Act, which is that addictions and substance abuse are
not classified as impairments. Many of those whom we think of as
vulnerable are neither disabled nor lacking in mental capacity. It is a
class of people that includes the naive and impressionable as well as
the dissolute and
insatiable.</div><a name="06061412000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the Paymaster General believes that the Bill will affect only a small
number of the super-rich, it is perhaps fitting that I draw an example
from that set of people. When the seventh Marquess of Bristol, dubbed
by the &#147;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&#148; with the
simple epithet of &#147;wastrel&#148;, died in 1999, it was
discovered that he had left almost nothing remaining from an estate
that had been estimated to be worth some &#163;40 million. Even as
<i class="I">The Times </i>gloated, &#147;Junkie marquess died penniless after
spending millions on drugs&#148;, the dictionary was more phlegmatic,
commenting that the true fatality lay not in the genes, rather in too
money much too early. Lurid newspaper headlines aside, it is apparent
that the management of money presents its own challenges to the
vulnerable, and that vulnerability shows many
faces.</div><a name="06061412000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have quoted
perhaps an extreme example and not one, I think, that will attract much
sympathy&#151;from either side of the House. However, it serves as a
warning that the decision to settle assets on trust or to make an
outright gift should be tax neutral and made solely in the interests of
the beneficiary&#146;s potential
protection.</div><a name="06061412000331"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000632"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Surely the case that the hon. Gentleman has made
is for absolutely swingeing inheritance taxes with rates of, say, 90
per
cent.</div><a name="06061412000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000633"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I am sorry to say that the hon. Lady misses the
point of what I am saying. I was drawing attention to mental capacity
or incapacity.</div><a name="06061412000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would at least go some way towards widening the definition
of disability&#151;that is what I am talking about&#151;for the
purposes of section 89 of the Inheritance Tax Act. They would address
the issue of progressive or fluctuating capacity by being forward
looking. They would also remove artificial distinctions brought about
by the restriction of the qualification of disabled persons trusts to
recipients of only certain components of the disability living
allowance. However, there will still be a lacuna affecting many
vulnerable people who remain outside the scope of the amendments.
Meanwhile, the cost of the changes will be borne by those least
equipped to handle them and the gain to the Exchequer will be
inconsiderable. Moreover, not for the first time, of course, the only
true beneficiary of the changes will, unfortunately, be the legal
profession itself.</div><a name="06061412000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to amendment No. 205. We have heard that, broadly speaking,
two categories of disabled person will be recognised as beneficiaries
of a disabled 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column625" />Column number: 626</div>person&#146;s trust. The first relies on a stringent, punitive and
unworkable definition from the Mental Health Act 1983 and the second
relies on the necessity of being in receipt of certain benefits. It is
hard to think of a more demeaning provision to include in a Finance
Bill than the decision to define a disabled person either as incapable
by reason of mental incapacity or dependent on the state for
benefits.</div> <a name="06061412000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The very
purpose of trusts for the vulnerable and disabled is prudence and
empowerment: prudence, as the Economic Secretary well knows, on the
part of families looking to provide for vulnerable relatives, and
empowerment for those who are thereby given a measure of financial
security. It is true that the Government have tinkered a little with
the definitions found in section 89 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984.
Relief in the tax regime applicable to discretionary trusts has been
extended to those who cannot receive either disability living allowance
or attendance allowance because they do not satisfy the residency
requirement or because they are undergoing treatment for renal
failure.</div> <a name="06061412000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
is peculiar that the Government have introduced legislation
that&#151;we are told&#151;started life as an attempt to tackle tax
avoidance, but has ended up requiring the needy to be in receipt of
benefits in order to avoid punitive taxation of assets held on trust.
It is nothing short of absurd to suggest that disabled people must be
in receipt of benefits from the state in order to be able to make use
of the assets that should be free to be applied to meet their
needs.</div> <a name="06061412000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Disabled
people who choose to live on their own income instead of making use of
their entitlement to benefit from the state will, in future, be doubly
penalised. They will lose the income that they might have enjoyed if
they had decided to apply for it, and they will be penalised again
because their choice subsequently places them outside the narrow
definition of &#147;disabled person&#148;, so their assets will
become subject to tax.</div>
<a name="06061412000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me offer a hypothetical
example. A &#147;disabled person&#148; within the meaning of
section 89 of the 1984 Act chooses not to apply for either the
disability living allowance or attendance allowance despite being
eligible for one of those benefits, and lives instead on trust income.
There might be many reasons for not applying, ranging from a desire not
to be a burden on the state, to an unwillingness to engage with the
ever-increasing complexity of the benefits system. For whatever reason,
that person decides to forgo their right to benefits and the direct
consequence is that they are at least &#163;41.65 per week worse off.
However, that loss of &#163;41.65 pales into insignificance when
compared with the indirect cost of tax liabilities which result because
they fall outside the definition of a &#147;disabled person&#148;
as a result.</div> <a name="06061412000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
heard in the past that the Government are taking steps to increase the
uptake of benefits, but there is such a thing as going too far. I
cannot believe that it was the Government&#146;s intention to
predicate a tax exemption for &#147;disabled persons&#146;
interests&#148;, which is already too narrow to be of any practical
use, upon the mandatory uptake of benefits. I cannot accept that it is
right to force the vulnerable into the jaws of the benefits system
against their will merely in order to safeguard their own
means.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column626" />Column number: 627</div><a name="06061412000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might well be argued that the
number of people who fall within section 89 of the 1984 Act, by virtue
of being eligible for disability living allowance or attendance
allowance, but who do not choose to claim, is very small. However, we
should not be tempted into thinking that small numbers justify shoddy
legislation. Even if the Government remain committed to the restrictive
formula offered by section 89 of the 1984 Act and its proposed
amendments, the mere eligibility for benefits should be sufficient to
qualify as a &#147;disabled person&#146;s interest&#148;.
Amendment No. 205 will ensure that eligibility for benefits and not
their uptake is the crux of disabled persons&#146;
trusts.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000634"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> The Committee will be relieved to hear that I do
not intend to detain it too long. Not for the first time, my hon.
Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet&#151;if I may say so without
appearing too oily&#151;spoke with considerable clarity and
conviction on the issues, and with such comprehensiveness that we do
not need to rehearse the subject for long. The amendments should not
divide the Committee, because we are all committed to what they would
do. The Government made the concession that there will be a carve-out
for disabled people, but the issue is getting the definition of that
carve-out right, so that we cover all the groups that are vulnerable
and at risk.</div> <a name="06061412000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask
the Paymaster General to provide Opposition Members with some comfort
about people with the three kinds of fluctuating disability: people
with mental health problems, people with degenerative
illnesses&#151;both groups may be of sound mind when the trust is
entered into; the examples of Alzheimer&#146;s and HIV were
given&#151;and those who have an addiction, which is a condition that
will fluctuate. The Marquess of Bristol, an example given by my hon.
Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark), might fall into that
latter category, but one obviously needs to be careful about that.
However, as charities have told us, there are plenty of examples of
people who have an addictive problem for whom a trust provides a
perfect mechanism for preventing them from damaging themselves
financially during periods of unsoundness. I ask the Paymaster General
to reassure Conservative Members that those issues will be properly
addressed.</div><a name="06061412000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000635"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> We could be forgiven for forgetting that we are
talking about inheritance tax, and that the new rules apply to
inheritance tax amounts of over the IHT threshold of &#163;285,000.
Many of the trusts spoken about will not be worth more than that
amount, and are completely
unaffected.</div><a name="06061412000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000636"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> Will the Paymaster General give
way?</div><a name="06061412000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000637"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I should like to answer the questions. The hon.
Member for Ludlow put direct questions to me, which I will answer, and
I think that that will help the Committee.</div>
<a name="06061412000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
definition, I shall not read into the record the names of the 41
organisations with which the Government consulted on the use of the
measure. I acknowledge that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column627" />Column number: 628</div>some organisations take a slightly different view, but the consultation,
which was extensive, included&#151;and I name but a
few&#151;Contact a Family, the Council for Disabled Children,
Disability Alliance, Mencap, the Thalidomide Trust, Barnardo&#146;s,
Scope, the disability rights commissioner, and the Family Fund. The
issue was always what the appropriate read-across was. It is not
feasible to suggest that we consult all over again, and consider
changing tax law all over again, on the basis of the views of some
organisations with a contrary view that are certainly not in the
majority. Of course, the points are relevant for us when we watch the
operation, but I do not believe for a moment that the organisations
that I listed would have suggested the use of the Act that we are using
if there was a better route, and they have considered all the
routes.</div><a name="06061412000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely
accept Members&#146; deeply held views on the subject, but to suggest
that the Government have somehow been cavalier in their approach is
absolutely not true. Let us be clear: people have, in the past, used
self-settlement trusts when facing the onset of long-running
degenerative diseases. That is the first point that the hon. Member for
Ludlow asked about. Government amendment No. 388 includes provision for
trusts to be set up as disabled trusts that will get special,
tax-favoured treatment. That matter has been dealt with.</div>
<a name="06061412000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman then asked
for examples of other trusts. People set up other sub-settlement trusts
for a range of reasons in order to protect themselves. One such example
might be that of a wealthy drug addict who wants to prevent access to
the addiction, although there will be other methods of doing so. Trusts
are also used to prevent creditors gaining access to assets if someone
goes bankrupt. Apparently, they are also used to avoid tax burdens in
other countries, so if people want to use trusts, there will be many
and varied reasons. However, we are talking about the special reasons
for which we would give the special tax relief. The Government have
made clear where they believe the justification lies.</div>
<a name="06061412000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point that the hon.
Gentleman asked me to address was what he described as fluctuating
conditions, in which somebody&#146;s condition may be in remission,
or however we would want to describe it. The condition from which the
individual suffers is relevant at the time when the settlement is made,
so if a person&#146;s condition means that they periodically meet the
qualifying criteria and they set up a trust at that point, they
qualify. It is not withdrawn if a person&#151;I cannot think of the
appropriate language&#151;is in remission or stabilises. That is
where the Opposition amendments are mistaken, because we are dealing
with the fact that for some individuals, the issue is about their
ability to make decisions over financial matters. It is not about
having a vehicle to protect themselves. The qualification is specific,
so the point about fluctuation is dealt with.</div>
<a name="06061412000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet asked whether, for instance, manic depressives would qualify. We
would go back to what is certified under the Mental Health Act 1983 to
decide that point, and there are circumstances in which they would
clearly qualify. That is a matter for the Act.</div>
<a name="06061412000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definitions in the Bill were adopted from the trust modernisation
consultation, and they cater for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column628" />Column number: 629</div>mental as well as physical incapacity. They are deliberately focused on
cases in which a disabled person faces substantial difficulties with
handling their affairs. The hon. Lady acknowledged that they are not
intended as relief for a disability. A broader definition has not
achieved consensus, and we cannot proceed on a basis whereby she quotes
some organisations that disagree with the overwhelming majority of
organisations that specialise in the area.</div>
<a name="06061412000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
answered directly the points that the hon. Member for Ludlow asked, and
I have covered why he has approached the matter in the way that he has.
The provision is a fair and balanced response to the important points
that have been put to the Government since the Bill was published. I
commend the Government amendment to the Committee, and if Opposition
Members were to choose to press their amendment, I would have to ask my
hon. Friends to oppose it.</div>
<a name="06061412000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000638"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I shall not press my amendment, although serious
concerns must be addressed. It may be productive to come back to them
on Report or in a further discussion of the different definitions. That
will also give us more time to reflect on the Government&#146;s
amendments.</div><a name="06061412000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
the Paymaster General&#146;s clarification that if a trust is set up
for those with fluctuating capacity during a period when the
beneficiary qualifies as disabled, it will be a valid section 89 trust
even if there is a period when capacity is regained at a later stage.
That is useful clarification on the fluctuating capacity point,
although there are still some issues to be
resolved.</div><a name="06061412000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
difficult to distinguish between this issue and self-settlement, which
we will discuss shortly, because a range of vulnerable beneficiaries
would be difficult to fit into a definition of disabled as it is
generally understood, never mind one as narrow as that in section 89.
The fact that there is not a general power to self-settle puts pressure
on the definition of disability here. If everyone had the power to
self-settle without incurring the new charges, a number of the problems
in relation to the breadth of the definition of disability would go
away.</div> <a name="06061412000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
press my amendment. I welcome the Government&#146;s moves in the
right direction, although further moves need to be made before we have
an adequate, comprehensive and rational method for dealing with trusts
for disabled
people.</div><a name="06061412000357"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000639"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): For the sake of
absolute clarification&#151;although I think that the Paymaster
General answered my point&#151;I had in mind someone in my
constituency who is wheelchair-bound and has a degenerative illness but
who is as sharp and as bright as a button and extremely mentally alert.
I would not in any way suggest that he would be unable to look after
his financial affairs, let alone be not very good at challenging all
sorts of legislation with me. The test is that someone&#146;s
capacity to undertake their financial affairs comes before whether they
have an attendance allowance or disability living allowance, which my
constituent has. The fact that he is extremely able to manage his own
affairs, notwithstanding that he is in receipt of an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column629" />Column number: 630</div>attendance allowance and disability living allowance, would bar him from
being able to set up a disabled trust. Is that
correct?</div><a name="06061412000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000640"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> It is impossible for me to advise the hon.
Gentleman on his constituency casework. With due respect to him, it
depends on whether he has all the facts
correct.</div><a name="06061412000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said
clearly throughout our discussion that the arrangements relate to the
Mental Health Act. There are good reasons for that and they have been
made consistently and eloquently to the Government by those who
represent and campaign for individuals. Without an indication of why
the Government should move away from their approach, I am not prepared
to consider doing so. I am standing by commitments that the Government
made to that influential lobby. What is the point of having
consultation if it is set aside shortly afterwards because a small
group happens to disagree all the time with the overwhelming majority?
That is the case that I clearly made
today.</div><a name="06061412000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman wants to write to me with more details about his constituent
I will be happy to respond to him in writing if I can, but I am not
prepared to comment on individual cases in the Committee. That would be
entirely
inappropriate.</div><a name="06061412000361"></a>

definition of relative set out in the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992, with the exception of lineal descendants since there would seem
to be no need to give children the right to set up trusts for their
parents. It may even be a physical impossibility for them to set up a
bereaved minor trust.</div>
<a name="06061412000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment No. 384, the
Paymaster General also seeks to widen the scope of people who can set
up such trusts, but only to step-parents. There is no rational 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column630" />Column number: 631</div>reason I have been able to understand as to why the scope of the people
who can set up bereaved minor trusts has been restricted as it has been
in the draft legislation. I welcome her move in the direction of
widening it a little. However, many people who have contacted me feel
that there is no good reason to prevent the grandparents and other
relatives from providing for their grandchildren in a responsible and
prudent way.</div> <a name="06061412000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
anticipate the Paymaster General&#146;s response. She is going to
refer to the examples that she gave as to why she is anxious about the
use of A and M trusts generally. Returning to her example about wealth
going down the generations, I return to the point that I made at the
time that that is the consequence of the use of the potentially exempt
transfer system. It could just have easily been done via outright
transfers. It is not a trust problem.</div>
<a name="06061412000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government are concerned
about that, they need to address potentially exempt transfers, rather
than penalise trusts and grandparents who wish to provide for their
grandchildren. I would be interested to hear the Paymaster
General&#146;s reasoning as to what avoidance is targeted by
restricting the scope of the ability to set up a bereaved minor trust
to parents. If we broaden it to parents, what avoidance will there be?
What is the rationale for the restriction on the scope of people who
can set up those kinds of trusts? With that, I need not delay the
Committee any
further.</div><a name="06061412000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000645"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I support the amendment. It was
regrettable that, when the Paymaster General gave the complex example
in the first set of amendments that we discussed, in which she referred
to trusts cascading from one grandparental relationship through to the
next potential grandparental relationship, she did not remind the
Committee that all trusts terminate after 80 years. That somewhat gives
the lie to the suggestion that they could be used as a device to avoid
inheritance tax in perpetuity. That could not apply. The amendment
would broaden the identity of those who could set up trusts to lineal
descendants and antecedents and, for that reason, I support
it.</div>
<a name="06061412000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000646"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Member for Ludlow is wrong; in the
example that I gave, money is transferred into another trust; trusts
are created, and that is the
point.</div><a name="06061412000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Chipping Barnet spoke to Opposition amendments Nos. 270
and 271, which would change the idea that only parents were allowed to
set up a trust for a bereaved minor. The amendments would extend the
range to brothers, sisters, grandparents or any other living ancestor.
I think that we have lost the plot here, in terms of what inheritance
tax is about as a transfer between the generations, and under what
circumstances it is exempt. Every single set of amendments that the
hon. Lady has tried to advance would strengthen trusts so that they did
not have to comply with the IHT rules. I come back to the point that I
made right at the beginning: an outright gift has to be just
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column631" />Column number: 632</div><a name="06061412000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, the Government
believe that children whose parents have died are in an extremely
difficult and vulnerable situation, and such children cannot properly
look after assets that they have been left. They lack the parental
guidance to decide what to do with the funds left to them, and there
are some legal restrictions on what they can do, in a financial sense.
Of course it is clear that there is a role for trusts in those
situations, but it is a very particular situation that is being
recognised. That was the case before the Budget, and that will continue
to be the case in the treatment under schedule
20.</div><a name="06061412000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">A trust set up for
the benefit of a minor by a parent in case of that parent&#146;s
death&#151;a so-called trust for a bereaved minor&#151;is given
tax-favoured treatment, but the Opposition amendments seek to expand
the range of people beyond parents. The issue is not whether those
other people can set up trusts for their relatives, but the interaction
with the inheritance tax rules. The hon. Lady has advanced no clear
justification why there should be an extension beyond the current
exemptions. In fact, I would go further and suggest to her that to
create such exemptions would be to leave the door open, enabling people
to set up trusts to pass wealth on in a way that skips generations in
families, in order to limit exposure to inheritance tax, and that is
precisely what we are trying to deal
with.</div><a name="06061412000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000647"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> If the Paymaster General has such objections to
grandparents setting up trusts for their grandchildren, why does she
propose allowing grandparents to set up life interest trusts for
grandchildren in the case of the grandparents&#146; death? How is a
bereaved minor trust different in quality to an interest in possession
trust, and why does she find that so objectionable in the context of
grandparents?</div>
<a name="06061412000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000648"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Lady does not understand the
interaction of inheritance tax with the estate at that point. We are
trying to deal with the very small number of cases in which that
interaction does not occur, or where there is an attempt to ensure that
it does not occur. I am not clear about the point behind the hon.
Lady&#146;s amendments. Is it about passing money to one&#146;s
grandchildren without passing it through one&#146;s own children, and
if so, why? Will she explain why that is important and the position in
respect of inheritance tax? That would certainly be the effect and
there is no justification for it.</div>
<a name="06061412000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether Opposition Members like
it or not, they have to consider what inheritance tax rules say now
about what should happen. The hon. Lady does not want to accept this
from me, but I say again that the issue is not about sweeping changes
in inheritance tax, whether spouse relief or anything else, but about
dealing with a particular mechanism that the Government have identified
as seeking to circumvent the rules. Surely that is a matter for all
Members; those rules have been passed by this House and are supposed to
apply to all
citizens.</div><a name="06061412000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000649"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Clearly, the amendments proposed by the hon.
Member for Chipping Barnet and her colleagues extend by a long way the
range of the proposals that we have discussed today.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column632" />Column number: 633</div><a name="06061412000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely there is an issue. It is
not only a parent or step-parent who might require the setting up of a
trust for a minor in the event of their death; in some cases, a legal
guardian might want to provide for a child, not their son or daughter
but their ward, and protect them in the event of their death. Surely
there is justification in wanting to ensure that such young people, who
may already be in a very vulnerable situation, are
protected.</div><a name="06061412000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000650"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The special treatment is restricted to parents
because the trust is necessary to protect the child when they lose
their parents. In other situations there can be alternatives to using
trusts; normally, money is passed from generation to generation without
a trust being involved. The trust is interposed on some occasions, and
that is the point.</div>
<a name="06061412000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case has not been made for
why a very special exemption, necessary in such circumstances to
protect the child, should be expanded to a longer list of people. That
is not to say that grandparents will not want to make financial
arrangements for their grandchildren, nor that parents will not want to
plan for their children a long way in advance; the issue is about the
interaction then with the inheritance tax rules. That is what we are
dealing with here.</div>
<a name="06061412000381"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061412000651"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): If a child is brought up by a
legal guardian as a ward of court and the guardian passes away, why
should there be an inconsistency between the tax treatment of a trust
for that child set up by the guardian, who would have brought the child
up as a mother or father, and that of a trust set up by a natural
mother or father in similar
circumstances?</div><a name="06061412000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000652"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> That is because the inheritance rules provide
for that exemption specifically, and have always done so. It is now
argued that the exemption should be widened; that may be a very
interesting debating point, but the case has not been made. That is the
point.</div> <a name="06061412000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is it
claimed by some that schedule 20 will stop grandparents and close
family from setting up trusts? That is not the case. Trusts can be set
up, whether to pay for school fees or anything else, but from now on
such trusts will fall within the normal rules that operate for
discretionary trusts. There will be tax to pay only if the amounts
exceed the current IHT threshold of &#163;285,000. If people do not
want to take that route, the money can always be given to the parents
to spend on the children, or by direct gift, so if the hon. Lady
decides that she wishes to press the amendments I will urge my hon.
Friends to reject them. The exemption is specific and special and
should stay the way it
is.</div><a name="06061412000472"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000653"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I do not understand why the Paymaster General
suggests that I want to expand some form of long-established category,
when the long-established category is the A and M trust, which is
currently open to anyone to set up. I am trying to return matters to a
position whereby relatives are encouraged to provide for other
relatives rather than being penalised by the tax system. There is an
obvious situation in which such a trust could be enormously
important&#151;when the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 634</div>parents of a child have died and the grandparents want to make provision
for that eventuality. I still fail to understand why the Paymaster
General sees that particular situation as one of
avoidance.</div><a name="06061412000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000654"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Lady&#146;s point has revealed to me
what I thought might be the case: she is assuming what she is trying to
prove, and her amendment does not do the half of what she thinks it
does, because she has not undertaken the other half. She has assumed in
her hypothetical scenarios that the grandparents will give money to an
orphaned grandchild, but that is not what her amendment says. It would
allow the grandparents to give money upon their deaths, as the
deceased, to a minor whose parents were still living. That is the
mismatch between her and the Paymaster
General.</div><a name="06061412000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061412000655"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> The amendment would operate in relation to
bereaved minor trusts, so a bereavement would have to have been
suffered. The amendment would operate only in that situation and the
grandparents would be able to set up the trust in that eventuality. I
shall conclude there. The Government have sought to draw an arbitrary
distinction between parents and other relatives, and it is a matter of
concern that they should reconsider. However, given the majority in
Committee I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
