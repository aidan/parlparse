You are most welcome. We are grateful that you have given us your time
and experience this afternoon. We look forward to hearing your
evidence.</div>
<a name="0901287000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I ask
you all to say a couple of sentences about yourselves, so that we know
what your involvement with the legislation might be.</div>
<a name="0901287000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I am
Helen Banks from the British Bankers Association. I am a director on
its retail team, with specific responsibility for financial inclusion
and financial capability matters among others. I have seen the Bill
through its consultation stages.</div>
<a name="0901287000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I am Adrian Coles, director general of the
Building Societies Association. We represent the mutual building
societies in the UK. They have a good record in promoting the
individual savings account and the Child Trust Fund. We therefore have
a natural interest in the legislation.</div>
<a name="0901287000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> I am Mark Lyonette, chief executive of
ABCUL, the credit union trade association. The 500 credit
unions have just over &#163;600 million in savings, some of which
will obviously be for people in exactly this target audience.</div>
<a name="0901287000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> I am Alan Cook, managing director of Post
Office Ltd. As you may well know, we have 11,500 branches and a growing
aspiration to be a key player in the financial services market and, in
particular, to make a worthwhile contribution to the financial
inclusion agenda for this country, in which this account appears to
play a
part.</div><a name="0901287000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin
Seller:</b></i> I am Kevin Seller, head of Government
services for the Post Office, so I have been engaged in conversations
with the Treasury so far in terms of the role that I hope the Post
Office will play in developing these accounts and offering them to
citizens.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div><a name="0901287000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901287000176"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We shall open with questions. First, we shall
ask about provision of services, sales and interest. It will help our
witnesses and me as your Chairman if you indicate whether the question
is aimed at a specific person or is open to the whole panel. I shall
ask Mark Hoban to
start.</div><a name="0901287000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">49
</b><a name="0901287000177"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): This question is for all of
you. We heard this morning about why the saving gateway product is
attractive to potential savers. There may be demand out there, but will
there be supply? I think that so far only the Post Office has indicated
that it intends to provide a saving gateway account. Can you say, from
your various organisational perspectives, where you see the costs
arising on the gateway accounts and how attractive they are for the
bodies that you represent? Perhaps we can start with Helen and then
work our way along the
panel.</div><a name="0901287000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> First, there is a fundamental objective of
providing a savings facility to people on a low income, and the banks
have certainly supported that as part of our overall financial
inclusion agenda. You are talking about the specifics and how the
product might work in terms of cost of provision. It is fair to say
that it will come at a cost. A lot of the work that we have been doing
has been about trying to make it as economically viable a product as
possible. The benefits to the banking members who decided to provide it
would be around reputation, rather than a commercial product earning a
particular return for the
banks.</div><a name="0901287000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> Certainly some building societies will offer
this product, but not all of them. Those who are inclined not to offer
the product&#151;of course, we do not know until we have seen the
full set of regulations&#151;tend to say that the market will be
small and the costs will be high. We know that the maximum estimated
size of the market is &#163;260 million. That is about 0.6 per cent.
of the flow of new deposits in 2007, yet some
aspects&#151;the requirement to give statements, the transfer of
accounts between different types of institution during the two-year
period, the requirement to provide information to Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs and so on&#151;could lead to significant costs on
fairly low-balance products, so for many societies, the jury is
out.</div>
<a name="0901287000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am certain
that some societies are sympathetic to the product and will want to
offer it, but others, in the current environment of low profitability,
low margins, difficulties in the mortgage market and very low interest
rates, may decide to stay out of the
market.</div><a name="0901287000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> Many of our members would be very keen to
offer the account. We may not have some of the same systems costs as
banks and building societies in terms of development of banking
platforms, but we see the cost of collection as quite significant, in
so far as our members would want to encourage take-up, we would try to
move away from cash collection and make use of the more cost-efficient
ways that we have of collecting money from people on low incomes. We
will look to make have payroll deduction agreements with employers of
people on low wages. Similarly, for people who are paying their benefit
into the credit union, we would look to have deductions from benefit,
because even with our cost structure, which obviously is very different
from that of Adrian&#146;s and Helen&#146;s members, we cannot look
to make this work on cash collection. The cost of collection is not
sustainable, in our view.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="0901287000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also think
that the mechanisms for deducting from people&#146;s wages and
benefits have another advantage, which is that they are incredibly
convenient. One of the things that the credit unions have learned over
the years is that savings are not just about return. Convenience also
encourages saving. It is also about&#151;this is particularly
important in current times&#151;perception of safety. To get people
to part with their savings, you need those three things. Convenience is
key, not just the 50p match, so we will look to partner more with
larger employers&#151;in fact, with all ranges of employers. We want
to see if we can collect savings in a way that is very easy for
people&#151;like falling off a log, is how we like to describe
it&#151;and to make it as cheap as possible for the providers and
credit
unions.</div><a name="0901287000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> The Post Office has been very clear that we
would be keen to participate in this initiative. As I said in my
introductory remarks, this goes to the heart of the Post
Office&#146;s role in terms of financial inclusion. We have the best
part of 4 million customers still collecting benefits in cash from post
offices. We think that 1.5 million of those are probably eligible for a
saving gateway product in their own right. We are actually paying the
benefit in cash over the counter.</div>
<a name="0901287000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not,
though, want to trivialise the cost issue. I might lie somewhere
between ABCUL and the banks. I would need to find a partner to provide
the administrative capability and would pay that partner to do the
work. That partner might well belong to one of the other associations
at this table. The economics are there and need to be tackled. The Post
Office believes that it would be a good thing to do, and that we need
to find a way to make it work. We would expect, probably, to take a
significant market share of the accounts, which would of course make it
easier.</div>
<a name="0901287000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000178"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to follow up on a couple of points that have
been made. First, Helen, you talked about some of the things that you
would like to happen to reduce the cost. Could you go into a bit more
detail about what you would like to see in legislation to reduce the
cost to banks in providing the accounts? I guess that that question
applies to all of
you.</div><a name="0901287000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> Yes, of course. The Bill has already taken
into account a number of the views that we expressed on the early
proposals. It is important to say that we have been working with the
Treasury for some time on this. We had some issues with the complexity
of matching or maturity payments, for example.</div>
<a name="0901287000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
where we sit now, our members remain concerned about one or two key
issues. At the top of the list is transferability and the complexity
that it will add to systems developments. The transfer process will
probably have to be a manual workaround, and, of course, those are
always more costly than automated systems. That angle is slightly
complicated by the need to provide the history of an account in order
for the new provider to do the maturity calculations at the correct
time and to include such information in statements and so on, which
would be passed from one provider to another. That is one of our key
concerns about complexity.</div>
<a name="0901287000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
questions remain about the regularity of statements and the information
required in them, for example. At the moment, we are talking about a
six-monthly statement, which I think is fairly widely accepted.
However, if prescription of information required in the statement is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>particularly onerous, an additional systems build, and therefore more
cost, would result. Anything where we have to develop systems comes at
a cost,
frankly.</div><a name="0901287000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I agree with all of that, but is there a
requirement for six-monthly statements? Let us suppose that you offer a
passbook account, in which customers have in their hand, any time that
they want to look at it, a statement recording all their payments. Why
then force the savings provider to go to the trouble of posting an
additional statement? Again, that would be too prescriptive. One or two
things can be left to the discretion of the customer and the
institution, without being in the
regulations.</div><a name="0901287000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000179"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Alan, it sounds like you have gone the furthest in
looking at this, and yours is the only body to have expressed an
interest. What share of the market do you think that the Post Office
would need to make the operation economically
viable?</div><a name="0901287000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> That is a tricky question to answer, because it
is not yet clear to me how it can be economically viable&#151;full
stop. If we obtain a larger market share, it is easier to produce a
justification for doing it. I can only really look at this in the
context of broader financial inclusion, of which this is a component.
If I ask it to stand up in its own right, what you are hearing from the
other witnesses is that it is quite tough. There is quite a lot of
administration running off very small average balances, which makes it
difficult to make the thing pay.</div>
<a name="0901287000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000180"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Are we in danger of repeating the mistake made with
Santa products, which were low-cost, simple products that were not
attractive to providers to
retail?</div><a name="0901287000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> That is the potential risk. If there is
over-prescription, you will introduce extra costs. We do business in
different ways with our customers, and we should allow the
organisations to play to their strengths. Our strength is face to face,
for example, as Mr. Lyonette&#146;s would be, although he
may be working for employers, from what I hear. Mr. Coles
already made the point that there is a tendency to have a passbook, for
instance, for building society accounts and other assets. If we are
very prescriptive, we will force everyone to do things in exactly the
same way, and it will rise to the highest average cost if we are not
careful. The fundamental problem with all financial inclusion
initiatives is that the average amount of money handled will be quite
small, and the cost is not really any less just because it is a small
amount of
money.</div><a name="0901287000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> Even we are looking, to some extent, for
hidden subsidies, although not Government cash. We have worked a lot
with the social landlord sector, and they are very keen on it. The
Chartered Institute of Housing did a big report on savings with rent, a
point at which people are parting with money anyway; a small amount can
be added if they agree to do so. We may be looking for social landlords
to do some of that collection business for us. They are doing that not
because the Government or the customer will pay them but because they
have an interest&#151;presumably often a strong business
interest&#151;in the wider financial inclusion
agenda.</div><a name="0901287000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
may be other people who can play a part who are not necessarily making
it stack up on an incremental basis. From our perspective, we probably
have a slightly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>different incentive from Adrian and Helen&#146;s members. We can
mitigate some of the costs because it attracts customers that we would
like to serve. In so far as that substitutes for some of the costs of
acquisition, it is beneficial to
us.</div><a name="0901287000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin
Seller:</b></i> I would only add that, as Alan said, our
advantage is that we have a lot of face-to-face contact with those
customers, so I do not think that attracting them will be an issue for
us. Our concern is that we might get an awfully large number of them
and exceed the Treasury&#146;s wildest expectations in terms of
take-up.</div>

53</b><a name="0901287000181"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): On the back of
those remarks, we heard evidence this morning from the Institute for
Fiscal Studies and other bodies that they were looking at more of a
one-size-fits-all, non-competitive product that would be the same
wherever people went, yet we hear that you want more discretion over
how you package the product. How far do you mean to go with that? Is
the Bill&#146;s basic premise of 50p saving in the pound, for
example, a sacrosanct element to which you would adhere? Are you
referring more to the administrative nature of the product when you
talk about
discretion?</div><a name="0901287000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> Yes, we are talking much more about the
behind-the-scenes operation of the account, which is not really
relevant for the customer. Obviously, building societies will not say,
&#147;We&#146;re going to pay 60p matching&#148; when others are
getting 50p matching from the Government.</div>
<a name="0901287000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> It is about having common features
recognisable by the consumer as being saving gateway scheme features.
Those would then be provided within providers&#146; existing
framework.</div><a name="0901287000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><a name="0901287000182"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Stephen Ladyman</b> (South Thanet) (Lab): In your first
answers, you all seem to reflect the accounts as a product from which
you hope to make money, or at least not to lose it. None of you seems
to factor in the business expansion premise behind them. If we take
Adrian&#146;s estimate of a market of &#163;265 million, that is
500,000 new savers a year at worst. The Government&#146;s figure is
that 8 million people might start saving for the first time. Is there
not a benefit to all of you in the fact that we are starting to
inculcate the saving process in a huge number of people, from whom you
can make money in future years? If you have thought about that, have
you tried to quantify what that might mean to
you?</div><a name="0901287000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> Yes. Those building societies that are more
enthusiastic about this&#151;there is a difference of view among
societies, as I said&#151;will certainly see it as part of the
marketing function. I hope that they would retain the customers. There
is a facility to switch the balance saved into an ISA, which is very
welcome. We are very active in the ISA markets, and we certainly hope
to be able to build on that. On the other hand, you may get lots of
people saving for two years, taking the bonus and never being seen
again. It is very difficult to judge what percentage of customers will
do each of those two
things.</div><a name="0901287000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> Yes, it is very much part of something that
we see as mitigating the costs of delivery. From our perspective, many
of the people who would take this up may also be future borrowers from
credit unions. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>might play differently for banks and building societies, in terms of the
prospect that they see, but we do not see this as the only source of
income, potentially, from these customers. They could become very
valuable customers in every sense to us over the
years.</div><a name="0901287000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> From a banking perspective, we already work
actively within this particular sector through provision of basic bank
accounts. We continue to open something like 50,000 basic bank accounts
every month across the piece. The saving gateway account very much sits
in that area. The problem with estimating future return is that it is
difficult to do not knowing the market share or exactly what will be
the take-up of other accounts or products at the end of the two-year
period, but certainly that is something that banks are looking
at&#151;how could people be encouraged to take on other products and
to stay within mainstream
banking?</div><a name="0901287000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> We are giving you four answers to every
question, but I feel that I ought to comment on that one. I do not
think that I suggested this was a profitable venture. What I said was
that this is something that needs to be looked at in the whole. It is
part of a financial inclusion offer. Therefore, as a result, when you
put that alongside all the other things, you should be able to produce
something that is worth while. That is why we committed to it. But the
cost will be high in comparison to the amount of money being handled.
You will have a relationship with a customer that we probably already
have a relationship with anyway. If you then look at it on a marginal
basis, you can begin to make a case

56</b><a name="0901287000184"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Si&#226;n C. James</b> (Swansea, East) (Lab): We have
strayed into an area that I was keen to develop, and you have already
answered some questions that I wanted to ask. Is there not a danger
that you will be actively encouraging people to take up your products?
We have seen where finance and financial products have been going over
the past few years. Will those customers be appropriate? Will they be
encouraged to take up products that they may not need, such as credit
cards? Do you have any plans not to limit but to help people understand
what commitments they are taking on and what dangers they may be
facing?</div><a name="0901287000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> Certainly in discussion with members, it has
become clear that they have been looking very much at how they would
help inform and guide customers who came in through this route. We are
also active in looking at the developments around the pilot of the
pathfinder for money guidance, and how the greater financial education
agenda might be used to inform consumers coming through this route. So
I do not think that it is, &#147;Let&#146;s take them on and put
them into a product&#148;; it is really looking at an all-round
service.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="0901287000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I cannot see most building societies seeking
to sell additional products to this particular group. The main other
product that building societies sell is mortgages, and these days the
amount that you will save in a saving gateway is not enough for a
deposit.</div><a name="0901287000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> I suppose that I would turn it around. I am
not worried about our members irresponsibly lending to them or anything
else. I do think, though, that there is an interesting challenge with
the saving gateway, around financial education. That is, in our
experience it is hard to teach people to save. People seem to value
savings only when they have them, which is counterintuitive in terms of
financial education. We teach people this and then they go and do that.
In our experience, people value it only once they have it, so the
challenge with saving, particularly with people on low income, is how
we incentivise it and make it like falling off a log. When they have
it, they say, &#147;Actually, I feel much more confident now. I have
a couple of hundred pounds saved&#151;an emergency buffer.&#148; We
see that all the time: it is not the economic value of a couple of
hundred pounds, but people&#146;s confidence in their financial
health. We see the saving gateway as being much more about how we can
all reach that point. It is probably counter-cultural, when the
Government are encouraging everybody to spend more, but savings are an
important part of the piece in terms of protecting
ourselves.</div>
<a name="0901287000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901287000185"></a>Mrs.
James:</b> It is a good habit, yes.</div>
<a name="0901287000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> Some 24 million people go into post offices
every week, and I would hazard a guess that nearly all 8 million people
who are the target market in this instance visit the post office every
week. We are already talking to and servicing those customers. The
existence of the saving gateway will not change our relationship with
them, but in so far as it will inculcate a savings habit, one will
reach the end of the saving gateway and the money will be paid out, and
it would be rather nice to think that the money might roll into
something like an ISA and that the savings habit might be established.
I guess that that is what the Bill is all about, but it does not change
our relationship with the customer, because we are already dealing with
them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000186"></a>Mrs.
James:</b> In your original evidence, you both
quoted&#151;Mr Lyonette and yourself&#151;how many branches you
have, and the comparison was quite stark: Mr. Lyonette, you
have 500, and Mr. Cook, you have 11,500. Do you intend to
grow the credit union network, Mr. Lyonette? You talked
eloquently about developing the savings habit, but will your
organisation provide enough coverage in comparison with the coverage
that the Post Office can offer?</div>
<a name="0901287000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> We see this in two parts. We expect to get
more than our fair share, because of the size of our sector already,
but some things that are currently happening, such as the
Government&#146;s support for new legislation in the sector, will
allow us to work much more closely with employers. I was talking to
Alan before, and the measures could allow us to work much more closely
with partners such as the Post Office. Some of those things will enable
us to play a much bigger role. I do not see there being more credit
unions than the current 500, but I see an awful lot more people using
them. It is not about the number of institutions, but about how we can
reach people and how they can conveniently use credit unions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000187"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The Bill is permissive on the subject of whether
the Government should insist on interest being paid. It does not set
any amount; it allows that to be set by regulation. Do you have a view
about whether you should pay interest on the savings in the accounts,
and, if so, what level it might reach?</div>
<a name="0901287000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> I have a view. Commercially, if banks were to
be the provider, they would probably prefer not to pay interest on the
account. However, there is a rationale. Obviously, one rationale is the
economics of it, but it is worth pointing out the danger of confusing
the Government&#146;s incentivisation through the maturity payment
with the return on a normal saving account. It is better, and simpler
from the consumer&#146;s perspective, that they understand that the
maturity payment continues throughout the period of the saving gateway
account, at which point they will move on to another saving
vehicle, where an interest rate would of course be
appropriate.</div>
<a name="0901287000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000188"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Let me explore that a little more. It was pointed
out this morning that if interest is not paid, people begin to think
that what the Government add is the interest. When the account
finishes, therefore, they may look for the same interest and, when they
cannot get it, stop saving. It was suggested that it might be worth
paying some interest, so people could at least see the difference
between the bonus at the end and the interest.</div>
<a name="0901287000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> It is a point of view that I do not share.
</div><a name="0901287000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> The bonus so dwarfs the rate of interest that
might be paid in the current environment, with base rates at 1.5 per
cent., so I really cannot see how the interest rate will be relevant to
a saver&#146;s decision to save and where to save&#151;which
organisation to go to. The competition will be between people paying
0.5 or 0.6 per cent. If someone is saving &#163;25 a month
and reaches &#163;600 at the end of two years, I am told that the
equivalent, expressing the bonus as the interest rate, is 44 per cent.,
so it really will not make much
difference.</div><a name="0901287000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> I understand from a colleague that the
argument raised this morning was in terms of the financial education
benefit if people were to have an interest rate, but we do not think
that is the way people save at all. We think that, for this
marketplace, people are not motivated solely by the match or the
interest rate. As Adrian has said, in this market, it is not going to
be significant. We think you would lose an awful lot more by requiring
it, not particularly because of the argument about cost structure, but
because it would confuse people. We saw that with the child trust fund,
when there were so many providers with different offerings. I know that
it is a different product, at a different point in people&#146;s
lives, but part of the research showed that was because it was too hard
to choose.</div>
<a name="0901287000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our view,
there are two different things going on: getting people into a savings
habit is one thing, and getting them to a point where they can choose
between savings products is another. Goodness knows, that is a lot more
difficult than it was 20 years ago because of all the terms and
conditions around savings products. They are two different stages, and
the most important thing that this should hope to achieve is getting
people into the habit. Once they are in the habit, after a couple of
years, they might be in a much better position to think, &#147;Do I
want to stay with this account, or do I go to this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>one because it will pay more interest?&#148; If you try to do both at
the same time, people will turn away from it, as with the child trust
fund.</div><a name="0901287000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> I endorse what Mark says. If you want
mass-scale success, this needs to be as simple, straightforward and
clear as possible. Everything that you have said supports that
view.</div>
<a name="0901287000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin
Seller:</b></i> The experience that we have had with the card
account is that a lot of people use it to save, but there is no
interest payable on it. I therefore agree with the others. The matching
payment is likely to be more attractive than any level of interest we
could
pay.</div><a name="0901287000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901287000189"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000190"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> Mark Hoban touched on the collection of savings.
The proposal in the Bill is that the accounts will be cash-based, to
the exclusion of equity investment. Is there is a case for equity
investment being part of these types of account? If so, what would be
the benefit of having that option available? That question is to
everybody.</div><a name="0901287000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I would say that it would be inappropriate for
low-income groups, probably without other savings, to be encouraged to
invest in equities over a two-year period. I would think that cash is
much more
appropriate.</div><a name="0901287000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> I agree 100 per cent. To come back to my point
about simplicity, that would introduce a raft of complexity and could
undermine the Government&#146;s offer to produce a bonus at the end,
because that could be swallowed up by a fall in
equities.</div><a name="0901287000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I want to add one more point about equity
accounts. The regulatory requirements on selling equity-based products
are much greater, so you would be adding another layer of
administrative
complexity.</div><a name="0901287000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> I totally agree; it is not appropriate for the
target market for these accounts. We are trying to teach&#151;that is
probably a bad word to use&#151;or to encourage people to put money
to one side and to save for future shocks. I do not think that playing
the stock market at the same time is the way to
go.</div><a name="0901287000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> Adrian is absolutely right; it would not be
good advice to tell people to take that kind of risk over two years. I
think that it would also be met by people&#146;s perception that, as
we have seen with child trust funds, although you might be able to say
that over any 18-year period it is always better to have used the stock
market, that is not necessarily what people on low incomes want to do.
They feel more comfortable&#151;for good reason, as things have
developed&#151;with cash-based savings, whether or not they give the
best economic return. All the other arguments are also
sound.</div>

61</b><a name="0901287000191"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Mudie</b> (Leeds, East) (Lab): One of the issues thrown
up by the pilot schemes was better-off people recycling their existing
savings to get the match payment. The eligibility criteria include
jobseekers, so they are not necessarily the people we have been
speaking about so far. Do you think that this will be a
problem?</div><a name="0901287000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> It is hard to say that it will not happen.
I want to make two points. The Government have tried to design the
scheme so that borrowing a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>substantial amount and loading your savings account in one go would not
be worthwhile because you have to chip in so much each month. There is
a maximum limit on that which will help. On the other hand, if a mum
gives her daughter &#163;10 a week to put in this account because she
has put &#163;25 in herself, is that fraud or is it a good thing
because it encourages the saving habit? I am not answering the
question, but asking one. Those sorts of things could
happen.</div><a name="0901287000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also sure that if we designed a scheme for zero leakage, it would be
disproportionately expensive for what it would save, and may put off
all those hard working, honest people who think that this is a good
thing to try to do. We must get the balance right. We must find the
right cost to attach to the policing of the scheme that fits all the
different
needs.</div><a name="0901287000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I would have thought that if the interest rate
is, in effect, 44 per cent., any decent financial journalist will write
an article immediately telling people to take &#163;25 a month out of
their current savings account and put it into one of these accounts if
they are eligible. I would have thought that that would be all over the
financial pages of the
newspapers.</div><a name="0901287000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin
Seller:</b></i> I agree. The stakeholder pension bears that
out. The people who are most financially savvy will be those who have
money to spare. They will certainly make the best use of
this.</div><a name="0901287000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> Although that is correct, I am a little closer
to Mark&#146;s view. It is a good investment trick to buy your wife a
stakeholder pension if you are a high rate taxpayer. I do not know how
marked that is. The eligibility criteria go a long way towards
minimising that. As you say, there will be sectors that could be better
off. Whether that is at the front of the minds of jobseekers is a moot
point. It will certainly not stop the press from recommending it left,
right and centre. Whether it happens in scale is a moot
point.</div><a name="0901287000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> I am sure that you will want to ask the
civil servants about that when you get to that stage. I am sure that
they have done their homework on how many of the audience of 8 million
who are eligible have savings that they can do this with. I hope that
they have done their
homework.</div><a name="0901287000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I suppose the other question is whether it is
worth borrowing to invest in one of these accounts. Should you leave a
bit of cash unpaid in your credit card account, which might attract
interest at 19 per cent., so that you can make this month&#146;s
payment of &#163;25 into your saving gateway account that will
attract 44 per cent.? I do not
know.</div><a name="0901287000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> You would have to work out that
19 per cent. over two
years.</div><a name="0901287000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I know. Those are complex
calculations.</div><a name="0901287000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen

62</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000192"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I was going to ask for the answer to the question
that Mark just asked. Of course financial journalists will immediately
say that at this rate of return, people must shift money from their
savings account into a gateway account. However, has this been designed
so that very few people will be in the position of having such a level
of savings? Have you made an estimate of the number of
people?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div><a name="0901287000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I certainly have
not.</div><a name="0901287000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> From our perspective, that is a big danger.
Borrowing rather than transferring savings has a bigger risk. However,
presumably the scheme has a certain monthly limit because civil
servants have worked out that that is the point at which it would not
be sensible borrow the money. For example, people could borrow
&#163;400 and try to keep it for 12 months while sticking &#163;25
a month in the
accounts.</div><a name="0901287000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> It needs careful
management.</div><a name="0901287000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> In a sense, I do not think that that is the
provider&#146;s responsibility. It is the
designer&#146;s&#151;the
Government&#146;s&#151;responsibility.</div><a name="0901287000092"></a>

63</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000194"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b><b class="B"> </b>Robert Chote, who gave evidence to the
Treasury Committee&#151;he is a very awkward man who asks awkward
question, and we are fed up with him&#151;suggested that there was a
risk that people would be tempted to borrow in order to save. Do you
agree with that, and how would you mitigate against it? I told you that
he was a bloody
menace.</div><a name="0901287000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I think that there is a risk because the
return is so fantastic&#151;44 per cent. a year is a wonderful return
in the current environment of 1.5 per cent. bank base rates. It is very
difficult for an institution to police where the customer gets the
money from. How would you investigate that and work out where the
&#163;25 came from in one month, and how could you tell whether it
came from a savings account or a credit card account if you are just
paying cash or cheques into the saving gateway
account?</div><a name="0901287000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> I agree. As a provider, that is a very
difficult matter to deal with. I guess that it is about assessing the
risk across the scheme and looking at what measures might be put in
place and the cost of providing those measures to militate against
that. As an individual provider, that would be very difficult to
manage.</div><a name="0901287000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> For many of those people, their borrowing
options might not be at the lowest mainstream rate and could be at
several hundred per cent. You could do a calculation to see whether the
home credit company, or whoever, might be lending you &#163;20 a
month to top that up. The important thing is not to lend it in a lump,
but drip by drip. Would that still be worth your while to do? I think
that it is much more likely to come from mum and that it will be
lending without an interest rate that is part of that. However, is that
necessarily a bad thing if at the end of it the daughter, who maybe did
not save before, saves a little bit and sees the benefit of it. We have
to see it in those terms. It cannot just be for the one-off payment at
the end. The success of this has to be measured by whether people have
begun to see a role for savings in their lives and continued to save.
Surely that must be the criterion for
success.</div><a name="0901287000006"></a><h4 class="hs_76fChair">[<span class="SmallCaps">John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000196"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I want to come back to Mark. Do not most of your
members save with credit unions precisely because their whole
attraction is that you put a little bit of money away, establish that
you can save, and are then able to borrow from someone who charges a
reasonable level of interest, but who is not the tally man who breaks
your arms if you cannot pay him back? Are not your customers exactly
the ones who might be tempted to borrow something in order to save, as
Mr. Mudie suggested?</div>
<a name="0901287000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> No, I do not think so. There is a certain
irony in this for credit unions, as much of our experience of learning
about savings has come from a period of time when credit unions did
encourage people to save, not for the value of saving, but in order to
be able to obtain credit. In a sense, it was a sort of arm twisting and
a way of saying, &#147;If you save, we will potentially lend you some
money.&#148; However, the learning that comes from that is that those
people were not natural savers, but were saving in order to get credit,
whether they were bus drivers or whoever. We might have 20,000 bus
drivers in Britain who could, I suggest, have larger savings than many
of us, not because they are natural savers, but because somehow someone
persuaded them to part with it from their wages. Having done it, they
think that it is fantastic.</div>
<a name="0901287000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that that is all coming back. I am as interested in the
mechanisms, convenience and channels, to use the technical terms, as
the match here, because what we have to work with is what drives
people&#146;s thinking on that. Personally, I do not think that it
will be worth while to borrow in order to save, because the amounts of
money we are talking about are small. Someone other than the providers,
the Government presumably, should be satisfied and do some calculations
on that before they launch it. I go back to what I said before: if that
happens for a few basis points of the total population, what is the
benefit of that versus designing a zero-tolerance system where it is
not possible? Would that actually deter savings when there is a much
bigger picture here? A balance has to be
struck.</div><a name="0901287000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000197"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I want to look at the question of penalties and
appeals. I do not know how many of you have seen what is proposed in
the Bill for a penalty that is improperly administered&#151;I think
that it is &#163;300 or a pound per account. Do you think that is
reasonable? Will it be a sufficient disincentive to encourage people to
administer these accounts properly, or is it the sort of penalty that
might put people off getting into the
market?</div><a name="0901287000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> It is not something that ABCUL&#151;the
trade association&#151;has taken a view on because the regulations
are quite new. Again, I would say this issue is similar to the last
question: what is the right level to set the penalties to disincentives
the bad behaviour while hopefully encouraging good behaviour from the
vast majority of people. Again, the level and terms of a penalty are
not things the providers will be directly choosing or deciding; it will
be part of the Government
package.</div><a name="0901287000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> Are you also talking about the &#163;300
penalty that I read will be imposed on an individual for making a false
declaration?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div><a name="0901287000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901287000198"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Yes, that is an individual who is trying to cheat
and have another one of these accounts. Particularly in your case, I am
thinking about the penalty on
providers.</div><a name="0901287000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> I did not think that the penalties on
providers were unduly high. I was interested to see how that balanced
against the penalty that was imposed on an individual for false
declarations. You have to be careful where that is set when looking at
the other potential for saving that is involved. We did not have any
issues on that
point.</div><a name="0901287000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000199"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> What about the situation where, for example, a
bank decides it will go into this market and is trying to make the
package look as attractive as possible&#151;I am speaking
hypothetically. Perhaps the bank tries to bundle something together
with its basic account package and in doing that perhaps gets itself
into trouble because it administers the scheme in a way that,
technically, is breaking the rules and the regulations. Do you think
that the process set out so far for appealing any charge put on that
bank is reasonable? Do you feel that you would be able to make your
case and defend yourself by saying that you were trying to do the right
thing, even if it turned out that by accident you had done the wrong
thing?</div><a name="0901287000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> I certainly feel that providers looking at
this will consider very carefully how the information was provided to
the consumer&#151;potential account holder&#151;in the first place.
Our members are particularly used to doing that under the terms of
existing regulations, FSA requirements and so on. I did not think that
that was a particular issue. The rules are there and the accounts will
be provided in accordance with those
rules.</div><a name="0901287000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000200"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Just one further question on this issue. I have
tabled an amendment today to explore this matter with the Minister
later in Committee. On reading the Bill, it did not look to me as if
the accounts would necessarily come under the FSA and therefore you
would have no right of appeal to the Financial Ombudsman Service if you
had been misled in some way. Do you think that ultimately you should be
able to go to the Financial Ombudsman
Service?</div><a name="0901287000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> These are deposit accounts, are they not? I
would have thought that they would come within the
ombudsman.</div><a name="0901287000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000201"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> It is just that it is not specified in the
Bill.</div><a name="0901287000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> All our discussions with the Treasury had
assumed that that was definitely the case. It is important that these
are not seen as stigmatised accounts without some of the benefits of
recourse that other people would have. I would hope that both the
regulation of the FSA and presumably the compensation scheme&#151;the
FSCS&#151;and the ombudsman scheme would be
available.</div><a name="0901287000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> It would be very odd to sell these accounts
with all of those things
excluded.</div><a name="0901287000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000202"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> So, if the Minister confirms in the Committee
that all those protections are there, none of you would have any
objections?</div><a name="0901287000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> We assume that they will be there.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div><a name="0901287000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> I am sure they would be. I should declare an
interest, because I am on the board of the Financial Ombudsman Service,
so I think it would be a jolly good
idea.</div><a name="0901287000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901287000203"></a>The
Chairman:</b> At the risk of allowing levity to trump
sobriety, I feel bound rather prosaically&#151;and from the point of
view of some of you, probably boringly&#151;to observe that at least
three of you have names that add a particular piquancy to our
proceedings. We have Banks, Seller and Cook. The other two can argue
the toss as to the appropriateness of their names to the subject matter
that we are considering, but it is all part of the sense of humour of
the occasion. We will now proceed to Edward Timpson and then George
Mudie.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000204"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> It is likely that when the take-up of this
account starts to come to fruition, there will be different levels of
financial understanding and acumen among the people who are opening the
accounts. The pilots that have taken place have borne out some
confusion among those who took part, as to exactly what will happen
when they make repayments, or the timescales for repayments and
withdrawals, and also on what happens when the account matures. Have
you given it any thought, or is too early to say what type of
mechanisms you will put in place to advise and provide guidance to
account holders, to ensure that as part of their wish to embrace the
savings culture, they actually understand the mechanisms for doing
so?</div><a name="0901287000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> If I can answer that, our members have
certainly given consideration to that aspect. We have also spoken to
HBOS, which provided the pilot service, to understand its learning from
carrying out those pilots. The need to spend sufficient time helping
savers to understand how the account will work and what will what
happen at the end of the account is an integral part of acting as a
provider and, of course, it has to be taken into consideration when
looking at the overall cost of providing these structures. Members have
already considered what they would need to do, for example, to train
people at branches, in way that is similar to that used now for basic
bank accounts. Staff members are trained in how to deal with customers
who approach them in that context and it would be a very similar role
for this too.</div>
<a name="0901287000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> From the Post Office&#146;s perspective, we
would have two types of branch. For the typical sub-Post Office, in a
village or rural area, this is what they think that they were put on
this planet do; to help their customers manage their daily lives. We
would need to be really clear on the training. One of the biggest costs
will be getting the training right, to make sure that they are giving
the right information&#151;advice would be the wrong word.</div>
<a name="0901287000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, we
would produce documentation, but it would be the conversation with the
sub-postmaster that would produce the action. Kevin referred earlier to
the Post Office card account; the benefits card. It was the actions of
the sub-postmasters talking to their customers that resulted in 5
million people taking out one of those accounts. It is that community
that we are talking to here, so we will put a lot of effort into it.
That will be the primary activity. As I said earlier, there is the
administration, which we have all talked about and highlighted
but,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>although I would hesitate to call it the sales process, as that would be
rather grandiose, the conversation that results in an individual taking
out an account is really important and we put a lot of effort into
it.</div>
<a name="0901287000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901287000205"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. Stephen, is it on this
point?</div>
<a name="0901287000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000206"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Yes, it is. It concerns the issue of advice,
which we discussed in considerable depth this morning. The people who
gave evidence were firm about the need for proper support and advice
when choosing the appropriate product, but also at the end of the
scheme, on what to do with the money; whether to put it into an ISA or
something else. I thought that they were all a bit po-faced this
morning. They all seemed to think that the purpose of saving was to
save for a rainy day. I acknowledge that that is one of the reasons for
saving, but the other reason for saving is to buy yourself something
nice when you saved up for
it.</div><a name="0901287000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> Go on
holiday.</div><a name="0901287000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901287000207"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Exactly. People borrow the money to buy
themselves a pair of Jimmy Choose or whatever. But I do think that the
witnesses were right in saying that these schemes will have to go hand
in hand with proper advice and support to help people make the right
decisions and benefit from them. One of you mentioned earlier that you
are probably going to have to do that in partnership with somebody.
What sort of partners were you thinking of that might provide this
advice and support to
people?</div><a name="0901287000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> Perhaps I can kick off. We certainly would
expect to work with a number of our existing partners. Probably going
on for a third of our members already have partnerships with people
like Citizens Advice, and I know that you talked to them this morning.
They certainly help people with budgeting and income maximisation and
all those kinds of things. Whether they would be in a position to help
them with anything approaching regulated financial advice, I do not
think so in many cases. Similarly, social landlords have an interest in
this largely because they are already one of the major sources of
credit in the country, through rent arrears. They are keen to see the
benefits of people having a little bit aside to protect against
emergencies. I am not sure that the wider financial community, in terms
of independent financial advisers, will get too involved in this
process. I do not think that it would come across their radar. I am
also not sure necessarily at the starting point how much advice people
need.</div>
<a name="0901287000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
purchasing a product in the sense of parting with money that you have
then lost. It is on the other side of the balance sheet, putting away
&#163;10 a month and seeing what happens after six months. To be
honest, if people have not got the habit after two years, and if they
have gone all the way to term with this and not realised that it is
quite a good idea and that perhaps they should do it for Christmas as
well, I am not sure that sitting down with a third sector intermediary
will make a blind bit of difference. I am not entirely sure that there
is a big package of encouragement to start this in that sense for the
agencies. I am sure that the partners we have will work with us on it
with general promotion and that kind of
thing.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div><a name="0901287000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> Yes. We must be careful not to suggest that
too much advice is needed on this. That may put the customers off. It
would also put the institutions off if they had to train their staff to
too high a level for the amount of money
involved.</div><a name="0901287000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> Although we are considering it as part of the
overall provision of the account, our members would give guidance or
information on an appropriate product for the money to go into at the
end, if that is what the saver chooses to do. There should be some
flexibility around the default option&#151;whether the money would
automatically go into some form of savings account&#151;and then it
would be for the consumer to choose what to do with that money
thereafter.</div><a name="0901287000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevin
Seller:</b></i> May I chip in? I am convinced that the
process that we would follow in the Post Office would be that customers
got a letter outlining their options and the first thing they would do
is go down to the Post Office with that letter asking what to do about
it. To emphasise Alan&#146;s point, we have to get the training
absolutely right when we get to that point in the process.</div>
<a name="0901287000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000208"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> This is a variation on that. Do you have an exit
strategy thought out for individuals? In the Treasury Committee we have
had terrible trouble with your industry in terms of basic bank accounts
and getting people into a saving habit. You could get them to open
basic bank accounts or even not so basic bank accounts. I get the
impression that the Post Office is very keen to take the footprint
because of its coverage, but would want the banks or building societies
to administer it. Do you envisage them going into
banks?</div><a name="0901287000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> I certainly think that providers would be
looking at retaining the saving amount that had been built up and
transferring it into an appropriate account from their suite of
products. The difficulty is that there was some discussion in the early
documentation about automatic roll-over into an ISA. Providers disagree
about whether that is the appropriate route for the people in this
category. The idea would be to set up a default account, which would be
some form of savings account that is right for this market. The
customer could then explore what other options might be
available.</div><a name="0901287000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000209"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> Do your members welcome the prospect of this number
of customers coming into the banks? They certainly did not with basic
bank
accounts.</div><a name="0901287000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> If they decide to act as providers of the
account then that is obviously one of the things that they will be
looking at very carefully.</div>
<a name="0901287000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000210"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> So they do not really, or you have not asked them
yet. Is the number of basic bank accounts still
growing?</div><a name="0901287000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> Yes, 50,000 accounts are being opened every
month. To address some of your points, I am aware that issues were
raised at an earlier stage about the hand-holding needed to encourage
or help people in this sector to open accounts. A lot of work is going
on at the moment as part of the work of the Financial Inclusion
Taskforce. The banks have been working to produce some guidelines on
how to make that whole process more acceptable from the
consumer&#146;s side, as well as from the bank&#146;s side. Yes, we
are aware that there were problems, and they have been
addressed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div><a name="0901287000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000211"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> Alan, do you have a tailor-made exit strategy for
these new savers, to keep them coming in and being
customers?</div><a name="0901287000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> I think that this will turn out to be the
biggest feature of the scheme. We will be congratulating ourselves
through the two years if there is a good take-up. What happens at the
end of the two years is absolutely critical. I think it was Mark who
said that it is not always the case that people have saved in order to
invest&#151;sorry, perhaps it was you, Dr. Ladyman&#151;but it
might be that there is a destination for this money which is not
another savings account but a spend activity. It might be the holiday
of a lifetime or something for the kids, who knows?</div>
<a name="0901287000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
important is that the institution offering the saving gateway accounts
has some options for the customer at the end of that. That is where the
risk is. I do not think that one could be criticised for
&#147;selling&#148; someone a saving gateway account when they are
going to get such a handsome return at the end of it. You might be
criticised for how you handle the saving gateway customer at the end of
the period. As Kevin has already said, that is an area that we would
focus on. We know full well that, whatever we put in writing, the
customer will march straight back to the post office and talk to the
individual behind the counter about what their options are.</div>
<a name="0901287000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is going
to have to be a default option of some sort, because many of these
people will do nothing at the end of the two years. They will not seek
to spend it or invest it, so we need to have a standard strategy, as we
all will. The simpler and the more standard we can make it, the
better.</div>
<a name="0901287000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000212"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I asked earlier about paying interest on the
account. It just occurred to me that one of the options at the end of
the default might simply be that you start paying some interest on it.
At least then, if the person does not move it, the money is not just
sitting there doing nothing. Have any of you considered that?</div>
<a name="0901287000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> I am sorry if I did not make it
clear&#151;that was what I was trying to imply by saying that the
money would move into an ordinary interest-bearing
account.</div>
<a name="0901287000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000213"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> What happens if anyone puts more money into one
of these accounts? By my reading of the Bill, that will be possible. If
you put more money into this account than the Government will match,
will that attract interest or will it sit there earning no interest? If
it will, there may be a role for someone to say, &#147;There is no
point putting in this level of money, because the Government will match
&#163;25 a month, but with &#163;30 a month, you are better off
putting the &#163;5 somewhere else.&#148;</div>
<a name="0901287000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> Again, we have thought about that aspect. It
is difficult to ensure that &#163;25 a month and no more goes into an
account. There would be exit strategies there&#151;for example, the
extra money could be transferred into a separate interest-bearing
account, or returned to the customer. But that is something that would
have to be worked out in detail.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="0901287000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> On most regular schemes that the building
societies offer at the moment, at the end of the saving period, the
literature states that the money will be transferred into an instant
access account from which the customer can withdraw their money when
they feel that is appropriate. There is no loss there&#151;it is
virtually there as cash and the customer can just take the money out
when they want. I would have thought that those building societies
offering the account would pursue this option.</div>
<a name="0901287000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Cook:</b></i> May I make the additional observation that it
is interesting that, as you get into this, the complexity comes out all
over the place. If we do not fight the complexity, the scheme will not
fly.</div>
<a name="0901287000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="0901287000214"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I go back to talk about ISAs and why they are
not the right default option? My casual characterisation of an ISA
would be that, on the whole, it pays a better rate of interest than
most instant access accounts. If there was a default option, it would
be much better for it to be an ISA because one would be saving at a
higher rate of interest. Initially, it may be inconvenient to go into
an ISA, but these people are on virtually no income and may not be
paying any tax, so it is even better for them to go into an ISA because
they will get a higher rate of interest, and they will receive it
gross, rather than having to claim back the tax
later.</div><a name="0901287000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Banks:</b></i> I am not suggesting that an ISA is not an
option. Some may offer it, some may not. I guess we are thinking that
people in this category are not going to get the tax benefits of an
ISA, but it is appropriate to look at the interest rate that is
available on whichever account is open to
them.</div><a name="0901287000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Lyonette:</b></i> I would like to think that our
members&#151;it will be different for different members&#151;will
offer the best alternative option in their wherewithal rather than the
worst option. If they have a cash ISA available and it has the best
rate, I should like to think that they would offer that. If they do
not, and there is some other alternative share account or deposit
account, I should like to think that they would offer the best product
that they could find.</div>
<a name="0901287000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> It is certainly good that the legislation
allows one to break the usual ISA limit by adding this extra bit from
the saving gateway. To make that mandatory, however, could preclude an
institution offering a better account in some
circumstances.</div><a name="0901287000150"></a>
