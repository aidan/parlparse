<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
36</h4><a name="06112882000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Payment
of housing benefit</div>
<a name="06112882000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06112882000308"></a><b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): I begto move
amendment No. 267, in clause 36, page 29,line 40, leave out
&#145;may&#146; and insert
&#145;must&#146;.</div><a name="06112882000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Hood, following our brief
break. It is hard to resist the temptation to begin by saying,
&#147;As I was just saying&#148;, after two or three weeks away for
the Queen&#146;s Speech, but I shall try.</div>
<a name="06112882000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is aimed at
preserving the option of making direct payment of housing benefit to
landlords without going via claimants, should that be necessary. The
Committee had a useful and informative discussion&#151;I think that
there was cross-party agreement on this point&#151;about the
importance of trying to expand financial literacy and of deepening the
level of bank account penetration among claimants of benefits in
general and of housing benefit in particular. There is still great
support for that proposition.</div>
<a name="06112882000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there are occasions
when it would not necessarily be appropriate for some groups of
claimants to receive housing benefit directly, and when it would be
appropriate to pay the benefit directly to the landlord instead.
Examples of those to whom it might be dangerous to make direct payments
include drug addicts who are not yet recovered, who may be in the
process of recovery from their addiction. For such people, the
difficulty of dealing with financial affairs and, to them,
comparatively large amounts of money, which arrive in one lump every
week or so, will create an impossible degree of temptation that would
be impossible to manage, given the chaotic lifestyle of people who are
in the depths of addiction. Clearly, there are some groups of people
for whom direct payment may not be appropriate. The amendment seeks to
ensure that there will be a guaranteed facility to preserve the option
of direct payments of housing benefit to landlords if
necessary.</div><a name="06112882000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
landlords are very concerned about losing such an option as a way of
receiving the benefit. They regard it as an essential piece of
certainty and of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 484</div>protection of the rent stream. Many have said that they are concerned
enough to consider getting out of the sector and stopping providing
accommodation if the option of direct payment ceased.</div>
<a name="06112882000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition are therefore
not asking that the proposed measure should apply to everybody. We
completely support the notion that there should be an extension of bank
accounts and financial literacy to the majority of people claiming
housing benefit, but we feel that for some groups, at some stages, it
will be important to maintain direct payment. We therefore hope that
the Under-Secretary can give us some reassurance on the
matter.</div>
<a name="06112882000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06112882000309"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): May I also welcome you back to the Chair, Mr.
Hood, and say what a pleasure it is to be back here under your guidance
for the final sittings of the Committee? I shall pass up the chance of
making a meteorological reference at this stage&#151;perhaps I will
do so on Thursday for the Committee&#146;s pleasure.</div>
<a name="06112882000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to question the
Under-Secretary on a further point that relates directly to the
provisions that assist those who until now would have been likely to
have their housing benefit paid directly to their landlord, but who
might well be required under the new system to take responsibility for
paying rent themselves, for all the reasons that the hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare has rightly outlined. That is an idea that I would
support, subject to the caveats that he has
entered.</div><a name="06112882000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
pathfinder areas, significant resources have been provided to give
financial advice, such as support from citizens advice bureaux, to
enable people who are going through that transition, and are perhaps
paying their rent directly for the first time, to cope with it. Advice
and support will be provided to them, for example in the process of
opening a bank account or taking advantage of other such payment
mechanisms. As the local housing allowance is rolled out throughout the
country, it is important that provisions for that sort of advice and
support are made as intensively in the areas where the new benefit is
being rolled out, as in the pathfinder areas.</div>
<a name="06112882000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having talked to claimants and
administrators in the pathfinder areas, I know that the provision of
that advice and support, principally through Citizens Advice, has been
a valuable part of the package to ensure a smooth transition from the
old to the new benefit. There are also those claimants who are not
vulnerable according to the new vulnerability assessment but none the
less need a bit of help to get started in paying rent for themselves. I
would be grateful if the Under-Secretary outlined the plans that the
Government have to provide that sort of support and advice when the new
local housing allowance is rolled out.</div>
<a name="06112882000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000310"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mrs. Anne McGuire):</b> Thank you, Mr.
Hood. It is a delight to be back here this morning. I have suffered
withdrawal symptoms for the past two weeks when we have not been here,
as I am sure all my colleagues have done. I missed the weather forecast
from the highlands and islands&#151;so much so, that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 485</div>have been forced to listen to the shipping forecast at10
minutes to 1 in the morning on Radio 4, before hearing the in-shore
forecast for fishermen. Anyway, that is enough of that. Those of us who
were in the highlands and islands at the weekend know that when a force
10 gale blows, it can fair blow. We have great understanding and
sympathy for those who are in the margins, in the more fragile areas,
in terms of the weather, in the United Kingdom.</div>
<a name="06112882000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for
Weston-super-Mare and for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
have raised some positive points on financial inclusion. They have also
highlighted the issue of those who are not able to manage their own
funds. We agree that direct payment is not appropriate for all
claimants. In the pathfinder areas, we put in place safeguards to
ensure that, if a claimant could not manage their own affairs, payment
went to the landlord. Having built that in in pathfinder areas, we
would have the same intention when rolling out the programme, because
it has worked well.</div>
<a name="06112882000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">On funding during the roll-out,
I am not sure whether we have yet received recommendations from the
Select Committee on the Treasury, but I understand that it is looking
at the issue of financial inclusion. I can confirm that we will provide
funding alongside the local housing allowance roll-out to support local
authorities in the provision of money advice. The pathfinder evaluation
has demonstrated that the take-up of such advice was lower than we
anticipated, so it may well be that people are more able and willing
than expected to take responsibility, although the system has never
given them that responsibility. Limiting the roll-out to new claimants
and those moving house will help to ensure that the provision of advice
is manageable. We recognise the operational issue that
exists.</div> <a name="06112882000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
continue to explore more coherent approaches to provide generic
financial advice. It is not just a matter of rent or rates when people
have serious financial difficulties: they are caused by a cocktail of
financial pressures. Having said that, we ask the hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare to withdraw the amendment because it would restrict
the Secretary of State&#146;s flexibility in such matters. The issue
that he raised is important, but we have built it into the system and
the amendment would not add anything to the Bill. I am happy to put on
the record the fact that we recognise that some vulnerable people are
unable to manage their finances in quite the way that we would want
them to. We have built in such support and, having highlighted such
issues, I believe that the amendment could be
withdrawn.</div><a name="06112882000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000311"></a>John
Penrose:</b> On the basis that the Under-Secretary has put on
the record the fact that she envisages that an element of direct
payment will be retained, particularly for vulnerable people, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06112882000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I, too, welcome your return
to the Chair, Mr. Hood. In the spirit of my hon. Friend the
Member for Weston-super-Mare, I wish also to comment on the fact that
we could use the words of Louis de Leon, a lecturer at Salamanca
university who had tangled with the inquisition. He was imprisoned for
five years and, on his return, he started his lecture, &#147;As we
were saying yesterday&#148;, although he did say it in
Latin.</div><a name="06112882000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis,
I am sure that I, too, might be allowed to make a short personal
statement to the Committee although, during the interregnum, I have not
been subject to a period of imprisonment or, indeed, cruel and unusual
punishment. However, I have retired from the Opposition Front Bench and
I assure avid Labour Members that I have not done so from a desire for
a policy disagreement or even a particular sanguinary coup, but, as
they say, it is to spend
more&#151;</div><a name="06112882000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06112882000313"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): Will my hon.
Friend allow me to say on behalf of all his colleagues on the
Opposition Front Bench that we hope he comes back
soon?</div><a name="06112882000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000314"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b><b class="B"> </b>That is ingratiating and delightful. It
may not be an offer that I would be entirely pleased to accept after 16
years, but there we are. I simply want to say that the Bill covers a
hugely interesting subject. I welcome the Committee, the tone of which
has been positive. Now let me get on with the points that I am anxious
to make.</div><a name="06112882000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that we
have moved on to the exchange of personal information, it is right that
the Committee should pause for a moment to reflect on some issues. I
have a strong interest in human rights and civil liberties, which I
shall not rehearse at length. In fact, it is shared by many members of
the Committee and we just need to get the provisions right.</div>
<a name="06112882000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the avoidance of doubt, I
wish to say that it is not wrong to provide for better data sharing in
relevant areas subject to the appropriate safeguards. That is not the
issue. The assurances that we seek from the Ministers are whether those
safeguards are appropriate or sufficient. I wish to pick out three
points that are, in a sense, generic to clauses 38 to 41. I want to
receive the right assurances from the Under-Secretary about the lowest
common multiple or the highest common factor. I notice that the hon.
Lady is wrinkling her eyebrows. I shall explain what I
mean.</div><a name="06112882000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
different regimes are coming together, such as local authorities and
different Government Departments, in a way that is set out coherently
and clearly under the Bill. I am not arguing about that. They will all
have different cultures and traditions about information sharing and
protocols. Let us consider protection for people on benefits, many of
whom will be vulnerable and who should not be put upon through their
involvement with the benefit system. Whenever there is a meeting of
protocols or doctrines, the solution that is selected must provide the
highest possible degree of confidentiality and protection to the
citizen, rather than the lowest common factor on which they can all
agree. I would therefore like the Minister to say that we now need a
regime where safeguards are, if anything, enhanced and there is no weak
link in the system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 487</div><a name="06112882000279"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06112882000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next point
is that we should ensure that the system is looked at as a whole, in
terms of training and the exchange of information about
practices&#151;I am not talking about individual cases&#151;between
the various participants. Misunderstandings arise when there is a
central doctrine and access to central computer system and other people
are outside that but may have access to the gateway for specific
reasons. It is important that the local authorities talk.</div>
<a name="06112882000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary will be
familiar with the fact, through the Department&#146;s own practice in
local benefit payment reviews that are reported to this House, that
there is already a dialogue. I am simply saying that, first, we do not
want any weak links in the system of protection for the individual in
terms of the formal safeguard set out in these clauses. Secondly, we
want as far as possible for everybody to adopt a similar and protective
approach.</div> <a name="06112882000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary will reasonably say that all this is within data
protection rules. She will also draw attention to the clause that
imposes criminal sanctions on the misapplication of information. I take
the view that the criminal law is not something that should be invoked
unless there are extreme reasons for it. There are cases where public
officials misuse information for malign and corrupt purposes but they
are not by any means common or typical. It is far more likely that
there is a great deal of over-enthusiasm or cutting of corners under
pressure of work, but the law is equally important in protecting the
citizen in that.</div> <a name="06112882000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
criminal law is an important sanction and it should be there. But on
top of that is the question of operation in practice. I do not know
whether the Under-Secretary has given any thought to this, and I have
not rehearsed it with my Front-Bench colleagues, who may take a
different view, but it may be useful if someone kept an eye on the
process as it works in practice&#151;someone outside the system,
outside the Department and outside the payment of benefits.It
may be a natural role for the Information Commissioner to look at how
it works, to ensure that nobody is abusing the system and that it is
not being stretched beyond the purposes that are tied down in these
clauses. If we can have those assurances, the Committee will not have
wasted its time. These changes should be made and it is equally wrong
that they should not be safeguarded.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000320"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div> <a name="06112882000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I endorse many
of the comments made by the hon. Member for Daventry and I look forward
to hearing the Minister&#146;s response in due course. May I say how
much, in my brief time in the House, I have valued the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s contribution from the Front Bench? I look forward to
that continuing from the Back Benches
too.</div><a name="06112882000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 8 is
designed to elicit a debate and probe in a bit more detail the
Government&#146;s thinking about the non-dependent deductions regime
for housing benefit and other benefits. The thought behind it,
supported by evidence from Shelter and Citizens Advice, among others,
is that the current non-dependent deductions regime causes problems for
claimants from time to time and significant reform is needed. Reform of
the non-dependent deductions regime has been considered before. It may
be of interest to Labour Members, some of whom were not around at the
time, that when in opposition the Labour party raised a number of
concerns about it. In 2000 the Government&#146;s housing Green Paper,
&#147;Quality and Choice: a decent home for all&#148; proposed the
simplification of non-dependent deductions. Of the 103 organisations
and individuals who responded to the consultation paper, only five
raised objections.</div> <a name="06112882000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be worth discussing briefly the problemsthat can be caused
by the present non-dependent deductions regime. In some circumstances
it can lead to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 489</div>rent arrears and consequential hardship, and perhaps even eviction and
homelessness. It can also, which is an important point in the overall
context of the Bill, create disincentives to work. In my constituency
casework I have had experience of the regime causing all those
problems, except eviction. Other hon. Members may have broader
experience than
that.</div><a name="06112882000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea behind
the non-dependent deductions regime is that non-dependants living in a
person&#146;s house, such as grown-up children, should make some
contribution toward the rent. One might ask who could argue with that.
In many cases that would be a fair point, but there are certain
categories of claimants for whom the current regime causes problems.
The regime has a minimum non-dependent deduction, which at this
year&#146;s rate amounts to &#163;7.40. The deduction is banded
according to income and the highest rate of non-dependent deduction
goes up to &#163;47.75, but where no evidence of the income of the
non-dependant is provided, the deduction takes place at the highest
rate. </div><a name="06112882000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Department
for Work and Pensions has conducted some research on non-dependent
deductions and who claims them, but that research is rather out of date
as it is 10 years old. Is the Minister happy to agree that further
research should be carried out to update the figures? For example, 52
per cent. of claimants for the non-dependent deduction were aged 60 or
older and the average age was 58. Clearly, those figures apply to a
wide range of categories of people, but
mainly&#151;probably&#151;to those with children who have grown up
or are growing up, or adult non-dependants, such as spouses or
partners.</div><a name="06112882000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">A problem
arises&#151;certainly it did in relation to a constituency case with
whom I have dealt&#151;when the non-dependant is a child and the
parent is the claimant. Whether or not they are on benefits&#151;my
constituent claimant was on other benefits&#151;the parent has to
seek from the non-dependant some of the money to make up the
difference, if they do not wish to suffer a reduction in living
standards or a shortfall in their rent. In that case, if the minimum
amount applies, &#163;7.40 would be required from the non-dependant
to meet the shortfall. Citizens Advice found that where the
non-dependant is a grown-up child under the age of 25, it can be very
difficult for parents to get the money to meet that
shortfall.</div> <a name="06112882000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
I am anxious to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the concern that
the rules, which are in place for very good reasons in the vast
majority of cases, are, in a minority of cases, causing hardship, can
cause rent arrears and might even in extreme circumstances lead to an
eviction. That is disruptive for the individuals concerned, and in some
cases for families.</div>
<a name="06112882000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment reads:</div>
<a name="06112882000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State
shall make regulations such that the non-dependent
deduction...where the non-dependent...is in non-remunerative
work, or...has a gross income from remunerative work of
under&#148;</div><a name="06112882000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">a certain amount
should be nil, so that if the non-dependant is either living on
benefits or has no, or a low, remunerative income, the housing benefit
would be payable to the claimant in full. That is an attempt to get
around some of the problems. I appreciate that that might not
necessarily be a perfect solution, but I wanted to identify in this
debate the fact that in some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 490</div>categories of case there are quite serious problemswith the
operation of the current rules. I encouragethe Minister to
update the Committee on the Government&#146;s latest thinking on that
matter.</div> <a name="06112882000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me return
to the Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee on Social
Security in 1999-2000. The Committee recommended
that</div><a name="06112882000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the number of rates
of non-dependent deductions is substantially reduced, and that this
should be accomplished by abolishing the higher rates of
deduction&#148;.</div><a name="06112882000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In their
response, the Government
said:</div><a name="06112882000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government acknowledges that the present scheme does increase
complexity and that the highest rates of non-dependent deductions may,
in some cases, exceed total rent liability. There would of course be
costs arising from abolishing the highest two rates....The Housing
Green Paper put forward the idea of simplifying non-dependent
deductions and the consultation responses will need to be considered
before a decision is made about making any
changes.&#148;</div><a name="06112882000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">At that stage
the Government&#146;s thinking seemed to betray a degree of awareness
of the problems that the current regime can cause in a minority of
cases. I would be grateful if the Minister could inform the Committee
of whether under the new local housing allowance that issue could be
looked at
again.</div><a name="06112882000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000321"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Good morning, Mr. Hood. It is a great
joy to see you again after such a long
break.</div><a name="06112882000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope,
Mr. Hood, that you will not have to witness the scenes that
some of us had to witness in the Chamber, not once but twice. At oral
questions to the Department for Work and Pensions, there were dangerous
signs of a breakdown in the valuable consensus that has been displayed
in Committee. Ministers were actually criticising Opposition Members,
quite openly and on the record. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i>
</div><a name="06112882000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06112882000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate
yesterday afternoon started badly and then got worse. I am glad those
scenes, which took place during the winding-up speeches, were after
the9 pm watershed because children should not have been
watching. There were sneering and barracking noises from Government
Members in a pathetic attempt to put off my hon. Friend the Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). I really hope that we
do not see scenes like that in Committee
today.</div><a name="06112882000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000322"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am sure we are getting round to the new
clause.</div><a name="06112882000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000323"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am merely trying to rebuild the consensus and
remind hon. Members on both sides of the divide of that. There is still
sedentary chuntering from the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West, but
that is part of the great glory of the Committee. All shades of opinion
are welcome here under your excellent chairmanship, are they not, Mr
Hood?</div> <a name="06112882000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us move on
to the business of the clause. This important and probing amendment
owes much to the excellent work, campaigning and lobbying done by
Shelter and Citizens Advice. For Members of Her Majesty&#146;s loyal
Opposition, the amendment is important for two reasons. First, the area
of non-dependent deductions is complex and Opposition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 491</div>Members and&#151;I think&#151;Government Members want benefit
simplification higher up the agenda, mainly because it will help
customers, many of whom are the most vulnerable in society. Secondly,
the amendment would streamline Government business and make it more
efficient and cost-effective.</div>
<a name="06112882000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current regulations
discourage housing benefit claimants from allowing friends and adult
relatives on benefits and low incomes to reside with them. In extreme
cases, that may result in eviction, but I do not think there is any
great evidence of that, so we are not scaremongering. However, the
regulations may well encourage under-occupation of housing units,
particularly social
housing.</div><a name="06112882000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thrust of
the regulations is based on an unassailable proposition that
non-dependants with a reasonable income should be expected to
contribute to the cost of their housing. No one disputes that. However,
the current requirements and rates at which non-dependent deductions
are applied can cause hardship either to the non-dependant or the
claimant. What concerns us, and I am sure Government Members, too, is
the work disincentive effect. Another concern is the possible impact in
terms of family breakdown, which is why the modern Conservative party
is looking at the area of non-dependent deductions afresh and with
renewed interest.</div> <a name="06112882000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has,
in a modern way&#151;not in a traditional, tub-thumping, right-wing
way&#151;talked about the importance of the modern family and about
the way in which family units no longer have to have a marriage
certificate attached to them. Keeping families together is an important
part of any Government&#146;s public policy, and it is a very
important part of the benefits system as well. Sometimes the system can
keep families together and sometimes it can keep them apart. I suspect
that the new clause teases out the problems that some families have in
relation to non-dependent family members. Quite often the elder member
of the family will be claiming housing benefit, and we can see that
there is a disincentive in keeping that non-dependant in the household
because of the way that the regime
operates.</div>
<a name="06112882000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06112882000324"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): I, too, welcome you
back to the Chair, Mr. Hood.</div>
<a name="06112882000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does my hon. Friend share two
of my concerns about non-dependent deductions with respect to work
disincentives? First, the statistics are very clear about the greater
incidence of child poverty in workless households. In such a
non-dependent deductions regime, there is a clear disincentive for
someone else living in the household to take work. There is therefore a
risk of increasing the number of workless households, which has a
direct impact on child
poverty.</div><a name="06112882000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does my hon.
Friend also share my concern about the possible impact on carers for
disabled people? If a carer is living with a disabled person, that
carer might also have a strong disincentive to work because of the
non-dependent deductions. Does he share those concerns, and does he
think that they might be another reason why the new clause should be
taken very seriously?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 492</div><a name="06112882000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000325"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do indeed share my hon. Friend&#146;s
concerns about the impact, both in relation to disabled people and on
child poverty. I think that I am right in saying that slightly fewer
than three out of four children in single parent workless households
are in poverty, whereas only one in eight children in single parent
working households are in poverty. Ministers would not disagree with
those figures. As they have a 2020 child poverty reduction target, I
know that they are seeking to tackle those figures and to halve them by
2010. We sign up to those aspirations, but it is certainly the
case&#151;</div><a name="06112882000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000326"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy)</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div>
<a name="06112882000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000327"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b><b class="B"> </b>Target or aspiration&#151;whatever. We
sign up to those propositions, but to get from where we are now to the
2020 target and to the first milestone at 2010, we must all understand
that the decisions made by the Government will have an impact on our
ability to meet that target. That is why the new clause is extremely
important. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey makes an
excellent point.</div><a name="06112882000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first area of concern is benefit complexity. It contributes to delays
and cases of maladministration, but above all&#151;this is the key
point for us now&#151;it creates confusion for claimants, many of
whom are vulnerable and who will sometimes be in distress. The
confusion and uncertainty about how the quite complicated rates and
different levels operate can worry the non-dependant, who wishes to
stay in a family house or flat, as well as the housing benefit claimant
him or herself. That confusion is compounded by the knowledge that
failure to provide evidence of a non-dependant&#146;s income will
result&#151;without any ifs or buts&#151;in the top rate deduction
of &#163;47.75 being applied straight away, which seems quite a harsh
principle.</div> <a name="06112882000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Under-Secretary first explain the rationale for that sanction? I do not
think that there is any other word for it. One must remember that
individuals might not be able to provide accurate evidence, or any
evidence at all, of a non-dependant&#146;s income, for perfectly
understandable reasons. In explaining the rationale for why that top
rate deduction is applied in such circumstances&#151;where evidence
is not fully forthcoming&#151;will she say whether there are any
derogations, such as mental illness, which might be just cause for not
disclosing that information? If such a good reason is given, could the
&#163;47.75 hit be avoided? That is quite an important
point.</div><a name="06112882000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">On complexity,
it is worth reading into the record that quite a lot of rates are
involved for non-dependent deductions. My second question to the
Under-Secretary is why the rates start at the top with &#163;47.75,
then descend to &#163;43.50, &#163;38.20, &#163;23.35, &#163;17
and finally &#163;7.40? We understand a deduction regime is needed,
but will she explain why there are so many rates?</div>
<a name="06112882000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
also fully answer my second question, which was: has she had any
discussions with her hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington
(Mr. Plaskitt), the Under-Secretary of State who is
responsible for benefit simplification? If she has not discussed with
her fellow Minister why there are so many levels of benefit, I ask 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 493</div>her to explain why not, because it is an area that is ripe for
simplification. We say yes to the principle of deductions, but why are
there so many rates?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000328"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> My hon. Friend must now get used not only to
criticism from in front but occasionally even
withering&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06112882000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000329"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Ministers on the Front Bench may need to
confer, but if I can hear them they are conferring too
loudly.</div><a name="06112882000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000330"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I will be brief, Mr. Hood, so as not
to excite them. I simply want to say to my hon. Friend that if there
are a series of benefit rates there are, by definition, steps, with
which he will be familiar from his work in the Treasury. There are
important marginal implications when people cross each of those steps
and that contributes to the pattern of disincentives, which worry my
hon. Friend and me.</div>
<a name="06112882000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000331"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important conceptual
point, which we come across in the parallel area of tax simplification.
There are often very good reasons why tax codes and tax legislation are
so detailed: they are protecting the Chancellor of the
Exchequer&#146;s revenue base on which we all rely. Were that base
not protected we would not have the revenue, the tax pounds, to pay for
all the public services. It is always a case of striking a balance. In
the case of these benefit levels, my hon. Friend says that there must
be no sharp cliff edge in terms of the marginal effect, but it would be
useful to understand why there are so many rates for deductions. None
the less, I will simplify the question about simplification and ask the
Under-Secretary to tell us, without going into the theology of marginal
rates and cliff edges, whether she has had any discussions on the issue
with her hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington?</div>
<a name="06112882000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third question for the hon.
Lady is on a matter that puzzles me. It is a &#147;techy&#148;
point, which is also made by Shelter and Citizens Advice, but we should
have a reply to it. Under-25s who are in receipt of income support or
income-based JSA are exempt from NDDs, but those in the same age group
claiming contribution-based JSA, paid at the same rate, are not. My
simple question for the hon. Lady is: why?</div>
<a name="06112882000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Income support and JSA
claimants, both income and contribution-based, aged over 25, attract an
NDD of &#163;7.40 a week, which is the lowest deduction, but that
means that NDDs can still push people below minimum income levels and
into poverty. Those benefit claimants are expected to contribute
towards the rent from their benefits when they would not be required to
do so if they held their own tenancy, which prompts another important
question for the hon. Lady. There is a perverse incentive in that
people might be better off if they found their own tenancy and made
their own housing benefit claim at a far greater cost to the taxpayer,
rather than not finding their own tenancy, not claiming a large slug of
housing benefit and instead lodging or taking a room in a family home
or with a friend or relative. Have the hon. Lady and her Department
done any research on that question?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 494</div><a name="06112882000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should we not encourage better
and more efficient use of our housing stock? Would not an answer to
that question help to tease out what is going on? Is it the
Government&#146;s policy to encourage greater occupation or to drive
people into finding their own tenancies at inconvenience to
them&#151;they might not want the responsibility of their own
household unit&#151;not to mention the extra cost to the taxpayer of
a new housing benefit claim for a brand new
tenancy?</div>
<a name="06112882000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06112882000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The spokesman
for the Liberal Democrats referred to the age of the last DWP research
on NDDs. I shall not say that it was done when dinosaurs stalked the
earth, but it was 10 years ago, and that is a long time in governmental
terms. I do not have the advice of numerous brilliant civil servants,
advisers and speechwriters that Ministers have; I have only my basic
research, which says that the most recent DSS and DWP research into
NDDs is the 1996 DSS research report No. 43, &#147;Paying for Rented
Housing&#148;. How long it seems since that report, and the days when
the Major Administration was constructing its golden economic legacy, a
legacy from which the Labour Government benefits in no uncertain
way.</div> <a name="06112882000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the record,
that research, albeit 10 years old, found that 52 per cent. of
claimants of an NDD were aged 60 or over&#151;that is a high figure;
more than half&#151;that the average age of all claimants was 58, and
that 48 per cent. of claimants survived on income support. Touching on
the point about which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry speaks
with such authority, 11 per cent. were sick or disabled&#151;the
study said parenthetically that that was believed to be an
underestimate&#151;and 71 per cent. were either aged over 60 or
disabled, lone parents or on unemployment benefits. The 1996 study also
looked at the profile of non-dependants and found that the average age
of non-dependent children of claimants was 28 and that of brothers or
sisters was 55.</div> <a name="06112882000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
figures illustrate the fact that NDDs are more likely to affect the
elderly and people who are in receipt of other benefits. The
departmental data are supplemented by troubling data from Shelter and
Citizens Advice. Their advice centres find evidence of family formation
being undermined. They report that the application of NDDs to JSA and
income support claimants causes problems for the housing benefit
claimant in two ways. First, housing benefit claimants with adult
children often find it difficult to recover the expected contribution
from those children, leaving them with no choice but to ask the
children to leave or to meet the shortfall from their own incomes. We
can imagine that that can lead to difficulties in families. The second
problem that the advice centres have discovered is that claimants might
allow a friend, rather than a relative, to stay but find out
later&#151;when the friend has moved on&#151;that they have been
overpaid and anNDD has been applied retrospectively. In those
circumstances, the housing benefit department will attempt to claw back
the overpayment. It can be difficult for the host to recover a large
sum from the friend who was staying if he is receiving only the low
income that benefits provide.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 495</div><a name="06112882000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000332"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In the spirit of the exchanges at DWP questions
yesterday, does my hon. Friend agree that if it is difficult for the
Department, with its debt recovery organisation, to make much inroad
into overpayments centrally, it is particularly difficult under the
present rubric for a council housing benefit department to recover
overpaid benefits in a world in which people move on and change
location?</div><a name="06112882000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000333"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point, to which
the Under-Secretary might like to respond. Overpayments like those
often result in rent arrears, with the possibility of eviction for
tenants. That is not
desirable.</div><a name="06112882000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
like to make a short excursion into recent history and remind the
Under-Secretary that, when in opposition, the Labour party raised
concerns about the non-dependent deduction regime, and later did more
than that. When it got into Government, the Labour party considered the
matter quite purposefully, by all accounts. In 2000, the housing Green
Paper, &#147;Quality and Choice: a decent home for all&#148;,
proposed the simplification of NDDs, and 103 of the individuals and
organisations that responded to the consultation paper supported their
simplification or reform. Five respondents apparently disagreed with
simplification.</div><a name="06112882000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
1999-2000 Session, the Select Committee on Social Security held an
inquiry into housing benefit and recommended that the number of rates
of non-dependent deductions should be substantially reduced, and that
that reduction should be accompanied by abolishing the higher rates of
deduction&#151;which refers back to a point I mentioned earlier. In
its response to that Committee recommendation, the then Department of
Social Security
stated:</div><a name="06112882000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government acknowledges that the present scheme does increase
complexity and that the highest rates of non-dependant deductions may
in some cases exceed total rent liability. There would, of course, be
costs arising from abolishing the highest two rates. The Housing Green
Paper put forward the idea of simplifying non dependant deductions and
the consultation responses will need to be considered before a decision
is made about making any
changes.&#148;</div><a name="06112882000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">To repeat the
point, in spite of what seemed overwhelming support from the
respondents to the consultation, in December 2000, Ministers announced
that they were not taking forward options to simplify NDDs. To ask a
simple question, in the spirit of honest inquiry, about something that
happened before the Under-Secretary&#146;s time in the Department:
why? A lot of valuable work was done by her predecessors after the 1997
election and many important noises were made, particularly on benefit
simplification. This was not my bedtime reading in 1999 and 2000, so I
come into this area with a relatively fresh mind&#151;well, certainly
a mind; I am getting on in years, so I am less fresh than I used to
be&#151;and I am puzzled by the basis for the policy decision by the
Department not to proceed with what look like sensible benefit
simplification measures. I should have thought that such measures would
have benefited those operating and administering the system and, most
importantly, the customers on the receiving end&#151;those requiring
the help that they clearly
deserve.</div><a name="06112882000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shelter and
Citizen&#146;s Advice, which have done a lot of work on this matter,
have helpfully sketched out three main runners as options for reform,
which I shall 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 496</div>place on the record. We know that each one has a price tag, so I do not
want the Under-Secretary to say that this is a spending commitment from
Shelter, Citizens Advice, the Liberals or the Conservative Opposition;
they are options offered in the spirit of genuine inquiry. Putting
aside the price tags, could she tell the Committee whether any or all
of the three propositions are being considered with a view to
simplifying and improving this area of the benefits
system?</div><a name="06112882000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
proposition is that no NDDs should apply for non-dependants in receipt
of income support or jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Currently, only
under-25s receiving those benefits are exempt. Has the Under-Secretary
considered that? If she has done so and rejected it, that is fine, but
it would be useful to know for the future whether we are barking up the
wrong tree. According to a written answer of 27 February this year, the
DWP estimates that such a change would cost &#163;22 million per
year.</div><a name="06112882000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
proposition is that total NDDs should be capped at 50 per cent. of the
rent. Currently, some claimants with more than one non-dependant living
at home have more than 50 per cent. of their benefit deducted. The DWP
estimate of the price tag for that is &#163;37 million a year. I
stress, however, that I do not wish the Under-Secretary to get hung up
on price tags at this stage; we are just discussing the
principles.</div> <a name="06112882000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly
and finally is the proposition from Shelter and from Citizens Advice
that the two highest rates of non-dependent deduction&#151;those at
&#163;47.75 and &#163;43.50&#151;should be abolished. That
proposition was prefigured in the musings of the
Under-Secretary&#146;s ministerial predecessors at the turn of the
millennium. According to DWP estimates that would incur a cost of
&#163;10 million a year.</div>
<a name="06112882000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thus conclude my
peregrinations around NDDs. I hope that the Under-Secretary will answer
some of our questions, which were asked in a spirit of honest inquiry
and probing and have excited the attention and interest in particular
of Citizens Advice and Shelter, to whom I am greatly indebted for their
briefing and informative
advice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000338"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Proceed more gently. That is
right.</div><a name="06112882000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate has
been interesting, and we have had discussions around a subject that I
know causes great concern to some. I hope, however, that I can persuade
the Committee that the Government are on the right track. By way of
preamble, as opposed to peroration, let me say that we have considered
the points made by the various organisations. However, I stress that we
are dealing with adults in households, because an underlying impression
seems to have been created that we are concerned with dependent
children. We are
not.</div><a name="06112882000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform and I can see, there is no
impact on child poverty in relation to the proposals. I appreciate that
the eradication of child poverty, as opposed to the creation of it, is
the new commitment of the Conservative party, but in our honest opinion
there is no impact on our eradication policy, nor on our strong
commitment to that policy. The point is whether adults in a household
can rightly be considered to make a contribution to the household
income.</div><a name="06112882000282"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06112882000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000339"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Can the Under-Secretary clarify something that I
might not have understood about non-dependent deductions? Suppose a
non-dependant is living in a household with someone who is claiming
housing benefit, and they have a child. The concern about child poverty
is that the non-dependent deductions might discourage the other person
from seeking work and therefore increase the number of workless
households. Can she clarify
that?</div><a name="06112882000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000340"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I know there has been a bit of a break since the
earlier part of our consideration of the Bill, but its general thrust
has been about supporting people into work. To deal with some issues
that have rightly been raised on child poverty, I do not accept the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s primus that somehow that will impact on our
policy of eradicating child poverty. We must recognise that we are
saying to adults within a household where there is income that there is
a responsibility to contribute to the general household
income.</div><a name="06112882000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
all the difficulties raised, in that sometimes it can be difficult to
get an adult child&#151;we are talking here about people over the age
of 25&#151;to make that contribution, yet I dare say that when some
of us went out to work and got our first pay packet, the first thing
that happened was a parent insisting that we make a contribution to the
household. That may not have been a great deal of money, but it was
recognition that we were inside a family community where a contribution
had to be made. That is a very good principle&#151;a good socialist
principle, I dare say.</div>

here.</div><a name="06112882000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000345"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b><b class="B"> </b>Thank you, Mr. Hood. The
Under-Secretary made the point that we are talking about only people
over 25 here, but we are not because for some reason&#151;perhaps she
can clarify this&#151;under-25s in receipt of contribution-based
jobseeker&#146;s allowance have non-dependent deductions applied to
them. It would be useful if she explained
that.</div>
<a name="06112882000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000346"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I probably stand corrected on that point, and I
will come back to it. I want to deal with some of the real issues
raised in the debate, and I hope to assuage some of the fears that have
been highlighted. As I said in my opening comments, we think it is
right that if someone is living in someone else&#146;s house, they
should contribute to the housing costs. I draw the parallel that people
on income support who are home owners have to manage all their
financial outgoings, including bills and so on. Why, then, is it being
said that if someone lives in the household, as described here today,
they should not contribute to meeting those costs? We think that asking
that question is consistent with our rights and responsibilities
agenda.</div><a name="06112882000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat that
we are talking about adults here. I do not want our discussion to be
muddied by any possible appearance, which I appreciate may have been
unintentional, that we are talking about children. If the non-dependent
person is on income support, or on income-based JSA, and under 25, no
deduction is taken into account for that
individual.</div><a name="06112882000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000347"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The last time that I made repeated interventions,
the Under-Secretary said that I was trying her patience. Obviously, in
our new consensual spirit, I would not wish that to happen, but I would
still like a little clarification. Given that one working-age disabled
person in three has children, if such a person were claiming housing
benefit and had a partner living with them, who could cause a
non-dependent deduction to be made? Does she not agree that, in that
situation, there is a concern that the non-dependent deduction acts as
a disincentive to that partner working? That could therefore indirectly
increase the number of workless households. That is our concern and why
we are pressing her on child poverty.</div>
<a name="06112882000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000348"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman is not trying my patience this
morning. He has made a reasonable intervention, but with the greatest
respect it is oftenthe case that if one element is taken out
of a whole approach, a conclusion can be drawn about disincentives. I
ask him to look at not only the housing benefit regime, but all the
other elements&#151;not only the Bill, but the tax credit system and
so on.</div><a name="06112882000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could go
through the whole gamut of our policies, which support people going
into work and sustain them in work. If the hon. Gentleman looked at all

<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 499</div>those measures, he would perhaps get a more realistic picture of what we
are doing to support people in that
respect.</div><a name="06112882000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the point I made earlier, which is that the Minister for Employment and
Welfare Reform and I think that drawing the issue of child poverty
across this debate is not particularly helpful. It is not relevant, and
if I was in a more tetchy mood I would say that it is a red
herring.</div><a name="06112882000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000349"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Will the Under-Secretary please give
way?</div><a name="06112882000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000350"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> No, I am going to deal with some other points.
Forgive me, but I cannot remember which Member raised the issue of
carer&#146;s allowance; it might have been the hon. Gentleman. If the
carer is a member of the household&#151;the unit of
assessment&#151;the carer&#146;s allowance will be taken into
account, but the claimant of the housing benefit will receive a
carer&#146;s premium as part of their housing benefit claim. That is
what I mean when I say that we cannot look at just one part of the
system&#151;there is a holistic approach to support. I appreciate
that sometimes it may appear to be fragmented, but it brings together a
whole range of support in terms of the household income. There is a
carer&#146;s premium within household benefit, which deals with some
of the issues raised on carer&#146;s allowance. I hope that that has
attended to the issue of disabled people with carers.</div>
<a name="06112882000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and for Bury St. Edmunds asked about a
simpler scheme with fewer deductions. We must recognise that one
person&#146;s bureaucracy can be another&#146;s sensitivity. We
must recognise that. Quite fairly, in highlighting the issue in the
Green Paper pre-millennium and looking at the development of our policy
post-millennium, we recognised that if we reduced the number of bands,
the system would be less sensitive to individual circumstances. We
feared that if fewer deductions were imposed over a given income range,
which I believe is the thrust of the new clause, that would create
winners and losers. Our assessment is that life would be made worse in
terms of housing benefit support because the bands would be wider, so
any change in the rate of reduction would be greater than the change in
income.</div> <a name="06112882000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, in trying
to deal with a simplification issue&#151;as an aside, Ministers in
the Department constantly talk about simplification because it is one
of our priorities&#151;we feel that, in this case, if we compressed
the bands in terms of numbers but extended the range, there would be
more losers than winners. That would be to the disadvantage of the
individual. It is often difficult to be sensitive in an enormous system
such as housing benefit or the benefits system in general, but we try
to differentiate and to pick up some sensitivities.
</div><a name="06112882000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
why&#151;this goes back to the comments made by the hon. Member for
Bury St. Edmunds&#151;many of our benefits have a range within them.
Disability living allowance has higher, medium and lower;
carer&#146;s allowance and JSA also have a range. All the way through
our benefits system, we try to recognise that not everybody needs the
same support and that people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 500</div>need to be assisted in a slightly different way
financially than could be managed if we went for an approach of total
simplification.</div>
<a name="06112882000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000351"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Under-Secretary is making an important
point about the need for the benefits system to be sensitive and finely
tuned to the range of concerns that might be present in a particular
benefit. However, in this case, the new clause suggests a zero rating
for the non-dependent deduction for people who have no remunerative
income. That could be seen to increase the sensitivity of the benefit
system. If the non-dependent person had a low or zero income, applying
the deduction could cause greater hardship and so could be seen to be
more, rather than less,
insensitive.</div><a name="06112882000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000352"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I shall come back to that when I try to pull all
the points together.</div>
<a name="06112882000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000353"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is it not the logic of the
Under-Secretary&#146;s argument&#151;although we do not always have
to follow logic to its ultimate conclusion&#151;that one should not
have bands at all and that the deduction should simply be income
related on the basis of a sliding
scale?</div><a name="06112882000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000354"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman, as usual, has put his finger
on the pulse of the issue. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister
for Employment and Welfare Reform will say something to him, on behalf
of both of us, when we reach clause 48, but I do not want to take up
the Committee&#146;s time just
now.</div><a name="06112882000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was saying,
I shall come back to the previous point when I try to pull all this
together. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
asked whether we have any plans to reform non-dependent deductions. It
is fair to say&#151;I hope the Committee recognises this&#151;that
we have looked constantly at how we keep under review the provisions of
the benefits system. We intend to amend the provisions for the local
housing allowance where a person could be a non-dependant of more than
one occupier. Instead of the existing process, which is probably
unnecessarily bureaucratic, where the deductions are portioned between
a number of occupiers if somebody is moving between two or three
households, the whole deduction will be made only in the calculation of
the first occupier who notifies the local
authority.</div><a name="06112882000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have dealt with the issue of simpler schemes with fewer deductions.
That links in with a point raised by the hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds on the simplification of non-dependent deductions. From October
2003, if the householder or their partner is aged 65 or over and a
non-dependant moves in to their home, or existing non-dependant
circumstances change and increase the deduction, we have not started
the deduction or the increase until 26 weeks have passed. We take into
account, for example, short-term visits to mum, dad or
friends.</div><a name="06112882000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another important issue. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has had to
leave us for a few minutes, because it links into the issue that he
raised about older people and those receiving pensions. If the
non-dependant is on pension credit, no deduction is
made.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 501</div><a name="06112882000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal with a point raised
by the hon. Gentleman on the non-dependent deductions and income
support, and why the measure kicks in at the age of 25. As has been
highlighted, we do not implement any deduction for claimants between
the ages of 18 and 24 who are in receipt of income support or
income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance. After the age of 25, only
the minimum deduction is applicable, which reasonably reflects the
levels of benefit for those in that age
range.</div><a name="06112882000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">That reflects
the fact that allowances for those on benefits rise at the age of 25 by
&#163;11.95 a week. Returning to our responsibility agenda, it is
reasonable to expect that someone over the age of 25 who is in receipt
of an income, albeit through income support or jobseeker&#146;s
allowance, should make a contribution to the household in which they
live.</div><a name="06112882000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
<a name="06112882000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000355"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> It is important to flesh out the point about
under-25s. Can the Under-Secretary explain why NDDs should be applied
to under-25s on contribution-based JSA but not those on income-based
JSA? Does that not throw up a potential anomaly for an individual who
is entitled to either income-related or contribution-based JSA? He will
choose the higher amount, and if that is contribution-based JSA and he
then has an NDD applied, his allowance might be reduced to below the
level of the income-related JSA to which he would otherwise have been
entitled. Having elected to take contribution-based benefits, the
individual might receive less benefit overall because the NDD has been
applied to him.</div><a name="06112882000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is also the case for somebody who is not in receipt of benefit or has
had his benefit sanctioned. If an under-25 has lost his JSA owing to a
benefit sanction and is a non-dependant, although there is no NDD while
he is in receipt of benefit, the effect of his benefit&#146;s being
sanctioned is that the person on whom he is dependent also has his
benefit sanctioned, so a double sanction is going on. From the point of
view of the person on whom the under-25 is dependent, that is a
particularly negative situation.</div>
<a name="06112882000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000356"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> There were so many negatives and double negatives
in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question that I can only hope to give
him a definitive answer. However, if I cannot do so, I shall deal with
that specific example in writing. I do not usually like to do things
that way, but this is a complicated matter and I should not want either
of us inadvertently to create an incorrect
impression.</div><a name="06112882000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
suggested to the hon. Member for BurySt. Edmunds, when he
talked about whether the income of senior citizens and those who had
had a short-term stay in another person&#146;s house would be taken
into account, the test for the non-dependant is whether his normal
residence is with the claimant. If it is not, no deduction is
made.</div> <a name="06112882000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">On capping, I
have to say to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey that if we went for a capping regime, it would cost
some&#163;37 million per year. That harks back to the point
that every person in a household should make a contribution to its
income, and deductions are made 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 502</div>accordingly. I hope that I have answered most of the points that have
been made. If I have missed any, or if I need to clarify a point of
detail, I shall deal with
them.</div><a name="06112882000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked about
non-remunerative work. What we mean by that is somebody working for
less than 16 hours a week. I do not know whether that will help him to
understand why we have used that term. If a person works more than
that, the normal situation will apply.</div>
<a name="06112882000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a fascinating
debate, and some genuine issues have been raised. It is important to
remember that the Government have frozen the deduction rates since
2000, although the income band widths that determine the rate of
deduction have been increased each year. For six years, there has been
no increase in the deduction level, although we have expanded the
bands. That has been beneficial both to householders and to
non-dependant individuals.</div>
<a name="06112882000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I respectfully suggest to the
hon. Gentleman that the new clause would break with the general
principles that I have outlined. In other words, it is expected that a
person who is a member of a household will make a contribution to that
household&#146;s running costs. In addition, if the new clause were
accepted, some people who at present attract a deduction would not do
so. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman recognises that. Those two
groups would be those in non-remunerative work&#151;those working
less than 16 hours a week&#151;and those in remunerative work whose
income is less than &#163;101 a week. Members of both groups
currently attract a &#163;7.40 per week deduction from the
tenant&#146;s housing benefit and a &#163;2.30 reduction from
council tax benefit.</div>
<a name="06112882000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not clear from the new
clause what the intention is regarding non-dependants who are in
non-remunerative work and who are in receipt of income support or
income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance. I have assumed that the hon.
Gentleman intends that no deduction should apply for anyone in
non-remunerative work. With the greatest respect, I suggest that that
is rather odd because the new clause would mean that a non-dependant
who was on income support and was not working would continue to attract
a deduction, but a non-dependant who was on income support and doing
some part-time work would not attract a deduction. There is an inherent
contradiction in the new clause, unless it is just a typical Liberal
Democrat attempt to play both ends off against the middle.</div>
<a name="06112882000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the lower rate of
deduction in council tax benefit applies to incomes of less than
&#163;157 a week, if the intention is to split the current lower
income band in two with the dividing line at &#163;101 it would mean
that the current lower rate of deduction would apply to weekly incomes
between &#163;101 and &#163;157. If the intention is to move the
current band threshold from &#163;157 to &#163;101, it would mean
that around 10,000 non-dependants with incomes between &#163;101
and&#163;157 would attract increased deductions, up
from&#163;2.30 to &#163;4.60 per week. I am not sure
whether the hon. Gentleman has appreciated that. Taking all of those
factors into account, the cost of the new clause would be &#163;45
million a year. Although I like the idea of ignoring the price tag, in
some circumstances we have to look at it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 503</div><a name="06112882000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State already
has broad powers in relation to non-dependent deductions. Using primary
legislation to set the lower rate would mean that flexibility to review
the rate each year would be lost. As people&#146;s incomes increased,
as they must under the national minimum wage, more people would attract
a deduction. The non-dependent deduction scheme is dealt with through
regulations and the Government continue to believe that that is the
right place for it.</div>
<a name="06112882000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a fairly lengthy
and somewhat detailed discussion of the clause. I hope that I have
managed to address most of the points raised. We will certainly
scrutinise the contributions of hon. Members. If there is anything I
have missed that needs to be clarified I will write to
them.</div><a name="06112882000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000357"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> May I raise two points quickly? The first is
about something that puzzles me. Under-25s on income support or
income-based JSA are exempt from NDDs, but those of the same age group
claiming contribution-based JSA are not. It happens with other benefits
too. Why is there this separation for those in the younger age group,
in this case the under-25 demographic, between income-based JSA and
contribution-based JSA?</div>
<a name="06112882000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second question is one that
the Minister will not be embarrassed to answer because there is no
price tag attached, although technically there is one. When will more
research on this important area be commissioned by her Department? Is
it intended to refresh and renew the research work done in 1996,
particularly in view of the disincentives to keep a family together
caused by the current regime? The present regime might lead to a
perverse incentive for a non-dependent to leave shared accommodation in
which they may be lodging or living and applying for their own tenancy,
thus putting pressure on housing stock and the Exchequer by giving rise
to a brand new housing benefit claim. There is anecdotal evidence that
that could be a problem, and any Minister would want to deal with it.
Will more research be done? Has any research been done on that? It does
not seem to do anyone any good if the current regime is forcing people
out of their homes and leading to further householder unit formation,
with people having to find their own housing and claiming more housing
benefit in their own
right.</div><a name="06112882000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall finish,
having asked a grand strategic question about research and made a
technical query about the distinction between income-based and
contribution-based
JSA.</div><a name="06112882000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000358"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I hope that I can tell the hon. Gentleman why the
two regimes are different. First, however, I should like to say that we
keep our research under review and I would not be surprised if we were
considering how to refresh&#151;as the hon. Gentleman said&#151;our
research in this field. That is within the Department&#146;s research
priorities, into which Ministers may have some
input.</div><a name="06112882000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">On housing
break-up because of a deduction, we have to be clear that when a person
moves into their own household, the &#163;7.40 deduction is not the
only factor&#151;there are many elements that someone needs to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 504</div>take into account in moving. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman said,
but he did say fairly that the evidence was anecdotal. Obviously,
however, we will keep an eye on that. As I said to the hon. Member for
Daventry, we have to recognise that, if we look at things in isolation,
an incorrect conclusion can be drawn because it is based on only one
piece of logic, if not
evidence.</div><a name="06112882000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
contributory and non-contributory elements of JSA, if the benefit is
income-related, we recognise that the individual&#146;s income and
capital is low, so there is an element built into JSA that takes
account of individuals&#146; financial circumstances. However, a
person can be on contribution-based JSA and not need any additional
income support, because they are entitled. If any Committee member
needed to do so, they could sign on for JSA as an entitlement because
of their contribution record. There are two different circumstances
that reflect the fact that within our large social security system
there are different ways of supporting people at various points in
their lives and in the light of individual circumstances. The new
clause opens up a discussion about that sensitivity; nevertheless, I
ask the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey to
reconsider and to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06112882000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000359"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that
clarification, although I should be grateful if she wrote to Committee
members about the regime for under-25s, not least about circumstances
where someone might be entitled to both income-based and contributory
jobseeker&#146;s
allowance.</div><a name="06112882000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her
earlier remarks, the Under-Secretary mentioned a particular change that
the Government are seeking to make to the non-dependent deduction
regime relating to circumstances in which there is more than one
householder and one non-dependant, and the way in which the
non-dependant deduction is shared between those people. Members of the
Committee may wish to reflect further on that point. One possible risk
is that it provides an incentive for one householder to wait on the
other to notify the Department. There are swings and roundabouts in all
these
things.</div><a name="06112882000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06112882000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo what
the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said about research. The Minister
said, slightly bashfully perhaps, that Ministers had some influence on
the Department&#146;s research programme. I hope that
Ministers&#146; influence on that programme is considerable when they
feel that a particular area is ripe for further research.</div>
<a name="06112882000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a good debate,
which has highlighted the fact that the NDD regime is ripe for
additional research, none having been conducted during the Labour
Government&#146;s term of office. The last research took place under
the Conservative Government, and Ministers may therefore want to have a
fresh look at it.</div><a name="06112882000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about household break-up. I
appreciate that many factors are involved, as the Minister said, but
that could be usefully addressed in further research by the Department.
I hope that it will also be taken into account in designing the
Department&#146;s future research programme, with due ministerial
influence.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 505</div><a name="06112882000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000360"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Just to clarify the position, as <i class="I">Hansard</i>
may show, I appreciate that I said &#147;some&#148; influence; I
meant, of course, that we have great influence on the Department for
Work and Pensions&#146; research
priorities.</div><a name="06112882000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000361"></a>Danny

intervention. I hope that she will use her great influence to ensure
that further research on the matter is
conducted.</div><a name="06112882000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister made some important criticisms of the amendment. As I said
when opening the debate, it was designed to probe the
Government&#146;s thinking and I hope that some of the issues that
have raised in the debate will be taken further in another place. With
that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06112882000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000362"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move that the clause be read a Second
time.</div> <a name="06112882000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
may be slightly technical but it makes an important point. It would
amend ground 8 set out schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1988, with which
members of the Committee will be familiar. Private landlords and
housing associations can use ground 8 to seek possession of
accommodation let on an assured tenancy when a tenant has arrears of
more than two months&#146; rent. Unlike other rent arrears grounds
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column505" />Column number: 506</div>possession, ground 8 is mandatory: the court has no discretion to decide
whether it is reasonable to make an order for possession.</div>
<a name="06112882000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed amendment to
ground 8 in the new clause is designed to give the courts discretion in
cases where housing benefit issues are outstanding&#151;for example,
the court can decide to adjourn the case or to suspend an order for
possession. I believe that that will help to ensure that tenants are
not evicted from their homes due to non-payment, or delay in payment,
of housing
benefits.</div><a name="06112882000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will be aware of the present position on delays in housing benefit
decisions and the problems that can sometimes cause. The average time
taken to process a new claim for housing benefit in 2004-05 was 36 days
and the worst-performing authorities took approximately 117 days to
process a new claim. I know that those are 2004-05 figures and that the
Government have been trying to improve them. In fairness, it is worth
noting that one of the benefits of the local housing allowance pilot
areas has been the speeding up of administration and the processing of
claims. Having said that, if one looks at the different pilot areas,
one can see that there is quite a degree of variety in the times taken
to process and administer claims.</div>
<a name="06112882000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly, the worst-case
scenario of it taking 117 days to process a new claim takes us well
beyond the two months&#146; arrears which currently allows possession
to be sought under ground 8. Faced with such an application, the courts
would have no choice, even if there was an outstanding housing benefit
claim and all the evidence suggested that once that claim was
processed, it would result in an award being granted. The way in which
ground 8 is framed gives a court no option but to enforce possession.
It important to say that under ground 8, a court has no discretion to
refuse an order, whatever the reason for the arrears. It is unable even
to adjourn the case. Ground 8 is open to private landlords and housing
associations that use assured and assured shorthold tenancies but not
to local authorities.</div>
<a name="06112882000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The inclusion of ground 8 in
the 1998 Act was originally designed to stimulate the private rented
sector and to make it easier for private landlords to recover their
property. However, since 1993, private landlords have been able to gain
possession of shorthold tenancies quickly and without a hearing under
section 21 of the 1988 Act. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will be
aware of the 2004 case of North British Housing Association <i class="I">v.</i>
Matthews, which explored in some detail the problems relating to ground
8, but I shall refresh the Committee&#146;s memory on the point
because the case starkly illustrated the problems caused by ground
8.</div> <a name="06112882000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The housing
association brought possession proceedings under ground 8 despite being
aware that the tenant had an outstanding housing benefit claim. A
county court judge decided that he had no choice but to grant an
outright possession order. However,Ms Matthews subsequently
received a backdated payment of housing benefit, which completely
cleared her arrears and, what is more, put her rent account into
credit. The Court of Appeal heard that where ground 8 is involved, the
county court had no power even to adjourn the hearing for a short
period to await a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 507</div>housing benefit payment. The Court of Appeal was troubled by that
situation. Lord Justice Dyson
concluded:</div><a name="06112882000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is a sad feature of contemporary life that housing benefit problems are
widespread. To a substantial extent these are no doubt the product of
lack of resources. But we do not consider that the non-receipt of
housing benefit can, of itself, amount to exceptional circumstances
which would justify the exercise of the power to adjourn so as to
enable the tenant to defeat the claim. We acknowledge that this
conclusion will lead to tenants who are in receipt of housing benefit
having no defence to a claim for possession in circumstances where they
are not at fault. The statutory scheme is, therefore, potentially
draconian in its
application.&#148;</div><a name="06112882000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
fair comment on the current powers.</div>
<a name="06112882000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary, who is,
like me, a Member for a Scottish constituency, will be aware that the
Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive have already introduced
measures to prevent the eviction of tenants with rent arrears caused by
housing benefit problems. Section 12 of the Homelessness etc.
(Scotland) Act 2003 amended ground 8 in almost precisely the same way
as is proposed in new clause 9. However, section 12 goes further,
requiring the court to have regard to non-payment or delay of housing
benefit in deciding whether it is reasonable to make an order for
possession under other rent arrear grounds.</div>
<a name="06112882000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause may be technical
in nature, but it has important implications. I am sure that everyone
in the Committee who is concerned about social justice wants to make
sure that where there are administrative problems with housing benefit,
they do not leave the court with no choice but to order possession. I
therefore hope that the Under-Secretary will accept the new clause, or
make it clear that the matter is something on which the Government will
table amendments in due course.</div>
<a name="06112882000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to Shelter and
Citizens Advice for their comprehensive briefing and background
information on this important matter, and I look forward the
Under-Secretary&#146;s response.</div>
<a name="06112882000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000363"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has raised
these issues. The new clause may be technical but as he indicated,
ground 8 can have a serious impact on the life of an individual. It is
not used extensively, but he is right to point out that it is in the
law and has the potential to be used. I am aware of the case that he
highlighted.</div> <a name="06112882000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figure of 36 days that the hon. Gentleman mentioned is correct, but we
are not sure where the 117-day figure came from. In 2004, the bottom 15
per cent. of authorities took an average of 74 days for processing. We
suspect that the figure may have come from the London borough of
Hackney, where the local authority took an average of 117 days to
process new housing benefit and council tax benefit claims in 2004.
That improved to 55 days in 2005-06, and Hackney is now processing
claims within 30 days on average. I had the pleasure of visiting
Hackney recently and I know that it has invested a great deal of effort
in managing the front-of-house and back-of-house operations to ensure
that people get the benefits to which they are entitled.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column507" />Column number: 508</div><a name="06112882000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of the Committee may be
interested to know how their own local authorities have improved their
processing. Slough, which I think is the local authority of the hon.
Member for Windsor, took an average of 67 days to process new claims in
2004; that figure is now down to 33 days. The Highland council was
taking 53 days to handle new claims, which was within the average, but
that has now decreased to33 days. South Northamptonshire has
gone from 97 days in 2004 to 26 days, which is a tremendous
achievement. Caerphilly&#146;s average processing time was 46 days in
2004 and is now 34 days. Waverley, which I understand is the authority
of the hon. Member for South-West Surrey, had an average of 81 days,
which is now down to 46. Kirklees council, of which we have heard a
fair bit in the Committee, has reduced its average time from 49 days in
2004 to 30 days. The star prize goes to Mid-Suffolk, the council of the
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, whose average in 2004 was not so
fine, at 90 days; that is now down to 32 days. I do not know whether
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interest in housing benefit, which is newly
found, as he admitted this morning, has prompted his local authority to
improve so dramatically.</div>
<a name="06112882000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can see that local
authorities recognise that they need to deal with the claims quickly.
They are working very closely with our Department and sharing
experience and good
practice.</div><a name="06112882000192"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000364"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> It is genuinely useful for the Committee to hear
about some of that experience. The hon. Lady is entirely on the right
lines to suggest that the answer to the problem is to encourage local
authorities to get on with the job. Although it is now deeply
unfashionable on the Opposition Benches to speak up for landlords, I
make the point on their behalf that it is clearly unsatisfactory if
they cannot get service of rent. If we were to go along the lines of
the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey, it would be equally important to ensure that landlords
were not disadvantaged. The answer is to get to the root of the
problem, whatever we may want to do about the legal shape or form of
the
sanctions.</div><a name="06112882000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000365"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am sympathetic to the points that have been
raised by both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, who tabled the new clause. In practice,
very few landlords use the ground 8 provision to secure possession. It
is fair to say that they, too, are generally sensitive to the financial
difficulties that their tenants may face, particularly in relation to
delays, which should not happen but sometimes do. Most landlords use
the no-fault powers in section 21 of the Housing Act 1988, which allow
the landlord to obtain possession of a property without going to court,
by giving two months&#146; notice at the end of a fixed term of
tenancy, or after six months of a periodic
tenancy.</div>

Mountford:</b> I am exceptionally grateful to my hon. Friend
for meeting members of CHAS from Kirklees, whom she kindly mentioned in
her opening remarks. Does she recall that, at that meeting, we noted
that some people are hidden among those figures? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 509</div>There are still some exceptional cases. Are the Lord Chancellor&#146;s
Department and the Cabinet Office still looking at possible remedies to
that
problem?</div><a name="06112882000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000367"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Not only is my hon. Friend a wonderful MP and a
tremendous member of this Committee, but she has just added to her
talents, because she can read minds. I was just about to come on the
point about the Department for Constitutional Affairs to which she drew
the attention of the Committee.</div>
<a name="06112882000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The pre-action protocol for
possession claims on rent arrears, which was recently published, as
myhon. Friend suggested, by the Department for Constitutional
Affairs, applies to social landlords who applied for possession due to
rent arrears and includes current good practice in managing rent
arrears. It clearly recognises that it is preferable to resolve
problems, including those related to housing benefit administration,
without resorting to court proceedings.
</div><a name="06112882000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Commission
produced earlier this year a final report on renting homes, which
follows the tenancy review and pertains specifically to the new clause
that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
tabled. There are many proposals in the report, including the possible
abolition of ground 8 for certain tenancies. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman will appreciate that the issue concerns a change to tenure
law, rather than to social security law, and that the Bill concerns
social security law. In that respect, could I also refer to the
situation in Scotland? He is quite right to indicate that there has
been a change of policy in Scotland, but again, I emphasise that that
is a matter of tenure law and not homelessness or social security
legislation.</div> <a name="06112882000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand, however, that the Department for Communities and Local
Government is generally supportive of the Law Commission&#146;s
proposals. Although it is not yet in a position to comment on how the
Commission&#146;s proposals may be taken forward within its wider
programme of work, I understand that my colleagues in that Department
are looking at opportunities to make legislation at some point in the
future. They are therefore keen to hear representations from the
stakeholders on all the Law Commission&#146;s
recommendations.</div> <a name="06112882000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yes,
we are sympathetic to the points made by the hon. Gentleman; we
recognise that this mandatory ground does not leave any room for
flexibility. It has been criticised by judges, as well as by
organisations such as Shelter, but this is not the appropriate vehicle
for doing that. I hope that he will accept the assurance that
colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government are
looking at the issue. With that, I ask him to withdraw his
motion.</div><a name="06112882000200"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000369"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div> <a name="06112882000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
of the new clause is clear: it would remove the requirement for the
claimant to have physically moved into the new home and become liable
for rent on two homes. It is to cover the situation in which someone
who is entitled to housing benefit on one home is moving to another
home where they are also entitled to housing benefit. It would allow
the period of four weeks to be extended where applicants are awaiting
the outcome of an application for a social fund payment to meet the
need arising from the move or in connection with setting up home in a
new dwelling.</div> <a name="06112882000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful again to Shelter for briefing and information in support of
the new clause. The idea is that regulations should be amended to
enable a household moving home to claim housing benefit on two
properties for four weeks in circumstances in which it continues to
have two rental liabilities but has not moved home. At present, housing
benefit is paid for rent on two properties only when the household has
moved to the new property. We are talking about the period before
somebody moves to a new property and has liability for two rents, upon
either of which housing benefit would be allowable.</div>
<a name="06112882000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of background, I would
say that homeless households living in temporary accommodation often
accrue arrears because, while they are not able to move into
unfurnished, permanent accommodation atthe point at which they
accept an offer of new accommodation&#151;perhaps because it takes
time to obtain furnishings for the new home&#151;the liability for
the rental on the new property cannot be delayed until such issues have
been dealt with.</div> <a name="06112882000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
result of the anomaly to which I draw attention, the regulations
governing entitlement to housing benefits on two homes can contribute
to hardship, rent arrears and, sometimes, repeat homelessness. The new
clause proposes a simplification of the existing rules to make them
more symmetrical in terms of whether the person has moved to the new
home during the four-week period. It would substantially improve the
situation. I admit&#151;I am sure that the Under-Secretary will say
this too&#151;that relatively few people are in such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 511</div>circumstances. Given her positive response to the last new clause, I
hope that she can be similarly positive to this
one.</div>
<a name="06112882000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000370"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the issue.
I hope that he will accept that the new clause is not necessary because
the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 already
contains the power that it seeks to introduce. The difference is that
the existing secondary legislation imposes restrictions in cases in
which a customer is waiting for a decision on a social fund
application. I shall come to that point in a
moment.</div><a name="06112882000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulations
made under the 1992 Act are in force and allow housing benefit to be
paid for up to four weeks on the former home as well as on the new home
if the customer has an unavoidable liability on the former home.
Regulations are also in force to enable housing benefit to be paid once
a customer has moved for up to four weeks prior to the date of the move
if the delay in moving is due to his waiting for a decision to be made
on a claim for a social fund payment in respect of a move, and if he is
disabled or aged over 60 or has a child aged under
five.</div><a name="06112882000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000371"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I did not want to interrupt the Under-Secretary
in the middle of what is clearly an important and complex technical
point. However, she seems to be telling the Committee that although the
payment relating to the new home could be backdated, it would not, by
definition, be available on the first day of moving. Therefore, a
tenant in that situation would potentially have a cash-flow
problem.</div>
<a name="06112882000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000372"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> That is the exact position, and weare
looking to alleviate it. As the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey says, there are circumstances in which people
have difficulties. I know that the local Jobcentre Plus office in his
constituency has had problems because the delay in processing community
care grants is causing a delay for people in the position that he
highlights.</div> <a name="06112882000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We feel
that the measure goes wide enough and that any further widening would
be a matter for regulation rather than for primary legislation.
Therefore, the issues under discussion are matters for regulation and
not for the Bill.</div>
<a name="06112882000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000373"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I accept the point that the Under-Secretary is
making. For the sake of the completeness of the debate, can she give
the Committee an idea as to whether, in the light of this conversation,
she is of the view that it might be worth while amending the
regulations in order to allow the powers to be taken in the way that I
describe, as opposed to the way in which they are currently
taken?</div>
<a name="06112882000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000374"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised a reasonable point.
In the light of the examples that he has highlighted&#151;and, given
that we want to consult on the regulations&#151;I hope he would
accept that we do not want to disadvantage anybody. I will obviously
reflect on this short debate to see whether, in the new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 512</div>regulations, we can accommodate what he admits are unusual but important
circumstances for an individual. With those comments, I ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw the motion.</div>
<a name="06112882000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000375"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that
response. I had not intended to draw particular attention to the
circumstances in the local Jobcentre Plus, but she is quite right to
draw the Committee&#146;s attention to that as an example of the
circumstances that I am trying to describe. I am particularly grateful
for her undertaking to reflect further on whether the regulations might
need to be updated in the light of some of these circumstances. I am
therefore happy to withdraw the motion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000376"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second
time.</div> <a name="06112882000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I will
try to be relatively brief but a few points need to be made here, and I
hope that our debate will stimulate a further fleshing out from the
Under-Secretary of the Government&#146;s position on this important
issue. This amendment would put into statute the regulation contained
in section 91(1) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987.
Again, I am sure that I am only refreshing the Committee&#146;s
memory of this and I can see that the Under-Secretary is fully informed
on this point already. The regulation requires local authorities to
make payment on account of a rent allowance within 14 days of receipt,
where an inability to make a decision on a case does not arise though a
failure of a claimant to provide required information.</div>
<a name="06112882000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">This duty exists in secondary
legislation, which was the point the Under-Secretary made in response
to the previous new clause that we debated. However, in relation to
that, Shelter&#146;s housing advice centres&#151;and I am grateful
to Shelter for this point in its briefing on new clause
11&#151;report that the requirement is all too often ignored or, in
some cases, treated as discretionary by local authorities. The idea
here is that placing this obligation in the Bill will reiterate and
underscore the vital importance of authorities making payments on
account of a rent allowance.</div>
<a name="06112882000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty exists to avoid
tenants falling into arrears at the outset of a tenancy and risking
evictionand homelessness. Prompt payment is, obviously,
particularly essential for private sector tenants&#151;and evidence
would bear this out&#151;as their landlords are perhaps more likely
to begin possession actions at an earlier stage than the relevant
social landlord. It is also vital for ensuring that private sector
landlords are willing to let to housing benefit claimants in the first
place&#151;an issue that I know we debated in one of our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 513</div>previous sittings, when the hon. Member for Colne Valley made particular
points about that issue. Along with benefit shortfalls, long delays in
beginning payments are cited by landlords as one of the main reasons
for not wishing to let to housing benefit&#151;or, in future, local
housing allowance&#151;claimants, so proper adherence to this
regulation could go a long way to improving the private rented
sector&#146;s image of housing benefit, and so improve the ability of
tenants to access that sort of accommodation.</div>
<a name="06112882000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth saying that failure
to make a payment on account is not considered an official decision, so
there is no right of review or appeal. The only recourse for a claimant
is judicial review, or to complain to the local government ombudsman.
Although either course of action might, in the long run, get a proper
remedy, both might cause lengthy delay and further problems for the
claimant. Indeed, judicial review is not usually a proportionate form
of recourse; it requires legal aid, a solicitor and court time. Also,
while the ombudsman does good and worthwhile work, often reaching the
right decision in the end, complaining to the ombudsman is not a
particularly effective remedy in cases with a sense of urgency, as we
would all agree is the position with such
cases.</div>
<a name="06112882000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06112882000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that in
her response the Under-Secretary again underscores the importance of
following through the regulation consistently. By putting it into
statute, we could ensure that all local authorities properly adhered to
it so that potential tenants, tenants, benefit claimants and private
sector landlords have a sense of security and understanding that the
system works in the way in which it is intended to work. I hope that
the she responds positively and explains how the Government intend to
remedy the
problem.</div><a name="06112882000227"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000377"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I support the new clause. The hon. Gentleman has
made several important points, and some deserve to be fleshed out more
for the Under-Secretary to deal with. She gave us examples of how the
Government have been pursuing various local authorities so that they
shorten the delay that inevitably is incurred from the start of an
application until payments come through. The various examples of local
authorities that she gave as an illustration were tremendously
impressive.</div><a name="06112882000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
Shelter is clear that there is still an enormous variety of performance
in different parts of the country. In some cases, authorities are at
the worst end of the spectrum, while their neighbouring authorities are
at the best end. Landlords, tenants and all of us as taxpayers are
entitled to expect continued improvement. Many of the figures that the
Under-Secretary quoted were those that had shortened from a 90-plus day
delay to a 30-something day delay. They were excellent, but the new
clause would make it clear that a couple of weeks is what the man in
the street and all of us are instinctively entitled to expect as the
usual level of efficiency from our local authority when it deals with
such an important
issue.</div><a name="06112882000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Progress may
have been made, but there is still a fair distance to go and an
unacceptable wide variety of performance in respect of the average
figures that have been quoted to us. Those variations create a number
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 514</div>effects, such as hardship for tenants, examples of
which we were given when discussing earlier clauses. The variety of
performance also has a negative effect on landlords and on the supply
of particular types of accommodation in the market. We have discussed
the baleful effect of constrictions in supply in such matters and,
thus, on tenants, which implies that a huge amount of work is still to
be done.</div><a name="06112882000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, for
whatever reason in the future, the performance of local authorities
either collectively or individually goes backwards and gets worse,
which, goodness knows, given the burden of history might sadly be the
case, we need to have a way to protect tenants from negative
performance. We also need to ensure that a sword of Damocles is hanging
over local authorities so that they know they will not receive a cash
flow benefit from acting slowly and not performing. The new clause is
vital, partly because it would give tenants a degree of certainty and a
reasonable length of time that they are entitled to expect before their
money comes in. It would also mean that local authorities do not have
an incentive to allow their performance to slide. In fact, they would
have a
disincentive.</div><a name="06112882000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000378"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the factors
that can make the process take much longer than it should is the
complexity of the assessment process? My hon. Friend the Member for
Daventry sensibly referred to the minimum constraints and the
Government making swifter progress in the sharing of information. If
there were much better sharing of information, and hence sharing of
verified information that the local authority could trust when making
its assessment of entitlement to housing benefit, we would then be able
to speed up the process considerably and achieve the important two-week
period.</div><a name="061128110000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000379"></a>John
Penrose:</b> My hon. Friend is exactly right, and his is a
good example of a wider issue. If one is going to shorten the times
much further, it will not be enough to act like a football coach on the
sidelines and just shout louder and ask people to work harder. That
will not achieve a delay time of two weeks or less, because other
things have to be done too. Among them is a series of efficiency
measures, some of which are concerned with the exchange of verifiable
information, as my hon. Friend says. In addition, and wherever
possible, processes and indeed benefits themselves should be
redesigned&#151;as attempted by many measures in the Bill&#151;to
make the intrinsic process simpler and faster. My hon. Friend the
Member for Bury St. Edmunds spoke about attempting to achieve greater
simplicity. If that can be designed into the system, it inevitably
makes it far easier for the people who are working to achieve such
goals.</div>
<a name="06112882000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000380"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I wonder whether my hon. Friend misspoke. He said
that I wanted to achieve simplicity, but of course that is in relation
to the benefits system, not in relation to any part of my professional
life.</div>
<a name="06112882000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000381"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that
correction.</div> <a name="06112882000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is important because it would give a guarantee. From the
tenant&#146;s and the landlord&#146;s points of view, and also from
the point of view of the market, it is important to deliver greater
supply of suitable accommodation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 515</div><a name="06112882000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000382"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the difficulty in the
process of obtaining housing benefit acts as a work
disincentive&#151;for example, people might feel that on taking paid
employment they would lose housing benefit, which would be difficult to
recover should they fall on hard times? The complexity and the
difficulty in benefits application procedures are themselves the cause
of the benefits trap. Addressing that would result in my hon.
Friend&#146;s arguments having much wider benefit in encouraging
people to move, when possible, back into the world of
work.</div>
<a name="06112882000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000383"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have been generous in allowing the hon.
Gentleman to make two long interventions, but they should be
shorter.</div>
<a name="06112882000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000384"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Thank you, Mr. Hood.</div>
<a name="06112882000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with much of what my
hon. Friend said. The benefits of benefit simplification, rather than
just straightforward simplification, go wider than mere cost reduction
and shortened lead times. One such benefit is that it is unquestionably
easier for people to access the benefits system. That is the case for
housing benefit applications, and I am sure that there are other
applications, which we will not consider today, that would nevertheless
benefit from simplification. Simplification has greater benefits than
just cost reduction and process efficiency. Behavioural benefits in how
people react when they try to access the benefits system are a vital
part of that. The Opposition support the new clause, and I hope that
the Minister will respond to those
points.</div><a name="06112882000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000385"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> The Committee owes the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey a debt of gratitude for the
way in which he has concentrated on the new clauses. He rightly focused
on the circumstances of individuals, their ability to pay rent on time,
and the effect that that has on their lives. However, we should
concentrate on ensuring that assessments are made quickly and are right
first time, with a proper means for reassessment. That, I am afraid,
takes us back a little to previous debates, in which I expressed the
differing opinion that there may be a better way of getting the same
effect.</div><a name="06112882000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman told the Committee that the measure can be implemented by
regulation, but that he wants to see it in the Bill. However, I want a
set of regulations that are thought through properly and work well
together. I am making a bid for regulations that would fit alongside
the provisions in the Bill and, in particular, that help to make
decisions right first time and speedily.</div>
<a name="06112882000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I direct the Committee to our
previous discussions on what rent officers do, how transparent their
work is, and how well they work with other parts of local authorities
and other agencies. I make a plea to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary
to think back to our discussions when she so kindly met me and the
director CHAS Kirklees. We were thinking about improving the process so
that decisions could be made speedily and more openly to ensure that
information can be made available to everybody in the way in which, I
think, the hon. Member for South-West Surrey indicated. If all the
information is pulled together and open, and is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 516</div>readily available at the beginning of a process when housing allowance
is set for an area, it would do a great deal to help speed up the
process.</div><a name="06112882000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
saying that I do not want that measure available to local authorities,
but I would like time to be made available for proper consideration of
regulations and orders in further Committees to ensure that those other
measures are available and are considered together. I make a second
plea to my hon. Friend that during further consideration of the Bill,
perhaps when it goes to the other place, she has another look at the
recommendations and perhaps comes back to the House, either on Report
or Third Reading, with
proposals.</div><a name="06112882000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000386"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I thank hon. Members for their contributions. I
am sure that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Stroganoff&#151;sorry, it must be getting near lunch time; I meant to
say Strathspey.</div> <a name="06112882000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman probably expects me to say that the proposal is
unnecessary because the power that he envisages is already in section
5(1)(r) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, but having said
that, he raises an interesting issue and one that is worthy of being
aired in Committee.</div>
<a name="06112882000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman had the
Committee&#146;s support when he said that we want to protect tenants
against accumulating rent arrears and, obviously, facing possible
eviction even when they have fulfilled their side of the bargain by
making an effective claim and providing the local authority with all
the information that it needs to decide the claim. I think that that
links in to some of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Colne Valley.</div><a name="06112882000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
pointed out earlier, we have seen a dramatic improvement in the
processing of housing benefits claims, as the hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare indicated. We recognise that a minority are still
taking too long to process claims, which can lead to problems for the
tenant. That is not what we want. Individuals should not be in the
middle of a process that is designed to help them but, because of
various failures, either bureaucratic or by individual professionals,
instead leaves them with a liability to pay rent that they palpably
cannot afford to do while they await their housing benefit
claim.</div> <a name="06112882000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman clearly said, that is why we have the existing requirement
for a payment on account when an authority is unable to decide a claim
within 14 days, subject to the customer having provided all the
necessary information. In some cases, the requirement would be more
stringent than the one that he seeks because the date of the claim can
precede that on which the claim was received. There is that nuance
within the new
clause.</div><a name="06112882000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members have recognised, we are focusing our efforts on further
improving authorities&#146; speed of decision making and the making
of the first payment of housing benefit through inspections, quarterly
monitoring and the setting of performance standards. We are dealing
with 408 local authorities. Trying to get them to work to a set of
standards where they have their own statutory responsibility for
implementation has not always been
easy.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 517</div><a name="06112882000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06112882000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
simplifying the housing benefit administration to speed up the
processing times, for example through the local housing allowance. The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal does not fit well into the increasing
trend for housing benefit claims to be received by the Department for
Work and Pensions. Around two thirds of housing benefit applications
are currently made to the DWP initially. The local authorities do not
become part of that process until later on. Increasingly, our intention
is for both Jobcentre Plus and the Pension Service to offer customers a
one-stop shop for benefits where claims to all benefits and information
are provided and, in most cases, verified by a single process. The aim
is to make the process more straightforward so that people do not have
to go from one Department to a local authority and perhaps carry
information back to another
Department.</div><a name="06112882000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increasingly
claims for information will be gathered by the Department and then
forwarded to the local authority. That is the point that my hon. Friend
the Member for Colne Valley was highlighting. We want a process that is
efficient and effective, that gathers the right information at the
right time and gives the correct decision at the right time. That is
what important to the individual claimant. While I am on the subject of
my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution, yes we want the housing benefit
process to be as open as possible, consistent with protecting the
independence of the rent officers. That came up in the discussion with
my hon. Friend and her constituency organisations.</div>
<a name="06112882000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because we are now gathering
the information in the Department more and more through Jobcentre Plus
and then forwarding it to the local authority, we recognise that local
authorities need to wait for the information. But the pay-off for the
local authorities and the individual is that, in many cases, most of
the information will be fit for purpose. In other words and harking
back to what my hon. Friend said, the local authority will have the
information to make a decision on the claim at that first point. That
is obviously something that we would all
support.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000387"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I know that when we had our discussions with
CHAS Kirklees, the Under-Secretary seemed surprised that some local
authorities are a bit more restrictive in sharing information than she
expected. Is she willing to look again at advice notes, guidance or
regulations that might free up some of that information to make it the
efficient method that she
seeks?</div><a name="06112882000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000388"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> My hon. Friend reflects the discussion that we
had with CHAS, and the answer is yes. Consistent with protecting the
independence of the assessment process so that rent officers are not
unduly influenced either by the local authority, stakeholders or the
private sector landlords, we want to see as much engagement as
possible. I am happy to reiterate the commitment that I gave to her in
private.</div><a name="06112882000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000389"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for
describing the administrative improvements. I appreciate that a lot of
hard of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 518</div>work is going into that and improvements are being made, not least
through the one-stop shop approach. In cases where the benefit
information is collected and processed by the DWP, Jobcentre Plus or
the Pension Service and then forwarded to the local authority, does the
14-day rule also apply to the DWP and its agencies in the collection
and processing of this information or does the clock start only when
that information reaches the local authority? In terms of allowing for
the interim payment of rent on account in the way that the regulations
currently describe, that is an important
point.</div>
<a name="06112882000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000390"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It is an important point and I hope to give the
hon. Gentleman a definitive response to it during the debate. I put on
record that more than80 per cent. of claims are dealt with
within 14 days from the date of the claim when all the information has
been provided by the customer. Every effort is made to ensure that the
customer gives the information necessary, and some of the time scales
reflect the fact that sometimes customers are not forthcoming with that
information. The blame for delay in the process does not always fall on
the local authority or the Department for Work and Pensions. As we said
during the debates on the housing benefit clauses, we are determined to
ensure that local authorities who have statutory responsibility for the
operation of our housing benefit policy improve their game, as many
have done.</div><a name="06112882000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked when the
14-day clock starts ticking. It starts from the date of the claim,
which can be at the time when the claim is received by the DWP. I hope
that that reassures him. A quick decision depends very much on the
co-operation of the individual making the claim in responding to the
request for information.</div>
<a name="06112882000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our wider policies and approach
on performance improvement, coupled with existing safeguards on the
14-day interim payment, are of greater benefit to customers than
introducing more pre-decision requirements. To be frank, they could
distract authorities from the main priority: getting decisions on
claims made accurately and on time, a matter that was highlighted by my
hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley and by Opposition
Members.</div><a name="06112882000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
points of clarification, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider
withdrawing his new clause. Once again, I thank him for raising an
important issue, which allowed us to reflect on the improvements that
need to be made to the process. I am sure that the officers of the 408
local authorities are hanging on our every word on this
matter.</div><a name="06112882000259"></a>

Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her
response, which rightly emphasised the ongoing efforts to improve the
speed of administration. I recently took part in a conference on
working age benefits with the Minister for Employment and Welfare
Reform, who said that, in relation to working age benefits, even a
two-week processing time was too long and asked why benefit claimants
should have to wait two weeks for decisions that in the private sector
would be made in a matter of days. I am not sure that it was a target,
but it may have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 519</div>been a long-term aspiration and if that is the context of the
Government&#146;s overall thinking on the issue, it is to be
welcomed.</div><a name="06112882000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reasoning behind the new clause relates to the cases of a minority of
claimants in which the Minister&#146;s aspirations were not met. I
appreciate the points made by the hon. Member for Colne Valley and the
Under-Secretary&#146;s remarks, with one proviso: I hope that she
will use the full power of her ministerial office to remind local
authorities of their obligations under the existing regulations. My
point was less about the rectitude and value of current regulations and
more about their non-observance by many local authorities. Perhaps the
Under-Secretary or the Secretary of State could issue a stern reminder
to local authorities oftheir obligations under the
regulations. With that imprecation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06112882000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06112882000392"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
Time.</div> <a name="06112882000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">This new clause
relates to the treatment of awardsof existing housing benefit.
Schedule 4 provides for regulations that will make provision for the
transition of those people receiving incapacity benefit on to the
employment and support allowance instead. However, the Bill includes no
similar provision in relation to housing benefit, so I look forward to
the Minister&#146;s response.</div>
<a name="06112882000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her previous remarks, the
Under-Secretary made it clear that the Government&#146;s intention is
that the new local housing allowance system should apply to new
claimants only and that it is not their intention to remove people who
are in receipt of housing benefit to the new local housing allowance.
The new allowance will be rolled out on a new claims only basis.
Ministers have made clear previously that, after two years, the
Government intend to review the situation and consider transferring any
remaining claimants on to local housing allowance.</div>
<a name="06112882000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the Citizens
Advice, in particular, for its comments on this proposal. There are a
number of potential criticisms to which I look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s answer. First, that this is an untested approach.
Under the local housing allowance, two approaches to implementation
were piloted. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 520</div>phased approach meant that new claims were transferred on to the local
housing allowance immediately and existing claims were transferred
gradually when their claim was reviewed or renewed. Secondly, in
another of the pathfinder areas, there was a big-bang approach. All the
claims were transferred from day one. Both approaches were extensively
assessed in the DWP&#146;s evaluation of the pathfinder areas, which
runs to several volumes. I know that every word of them will have been
studied by members of this Committee.</div>
<a name="06112882000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the natural roll-out, the
DWP is now proposing a third approach that has not had the benefit of
having been piloted or assessed in any of the pathfinder areas. In his
response, could the Minister set out what lessons the Government drew
from the evaluation of approaches one and two which have led
him&#151;if he will pardon my choice of phrase&#151;to choose a
third way in relation to the transitional
arrangements?</div><a name="06112882000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed implementation approach could be seen to undermine one of the
key principles thatwould guide the development of the local
housing allowance&#151;the promotion of greater fairness. Under the
Government&#146;s proposals, similar households with identical
incomes and rent levels may end up receiving different levels of
housing benefits for an undefined period of at least two years. Some
claimants may face a shortfall between their benefit and their rent,
whereas others in identical circumstances might receive an
excess.</div> <a name="06112882000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
local authorities will be required to keep the two systems of
administration running in parallel. The hon. Member for Colne Valley
has made repeated references to the need for rent officers to be more
open. I fully agree with that, but if rent officers are going to be
asked to provide information for two systems that will run in parallel
for at least two years for existing claimants versus new claimants, one
suspects that there is another difficulty facing that particular group
of people. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how that is
being thought through and why this conclusion has been
reached.</div> <a name="06112882000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That relates
to another point that I hope the Minister will address. Where the local
housing allowance results in a higher level of benefits, there will be
a risk that some landlords&#151;and I appreciate that this may only
apply to a small minority of them&#151;may seek to evict the existing
tenants in order to let to new tenants on the higher rate of the new
benefits. Although that may only apply in a small minority of cases, it
is a risk that has to be weighed in the balance in relation to these
transitional arrangements. It is worth noting that some citizens advice
bureaux, working in the pathfinder areas, have reported many cases of
landlords increasing their rent up
