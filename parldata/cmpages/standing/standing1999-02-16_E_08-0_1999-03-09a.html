<P>
<B>The Chairman:</b> Before we begin with clause 15, with  which we may take Government new clause 5,  Government new schedule 1 and the amendments tabled  to that new schedule, it may be of assistance to the  Committee if I outline the procedure to be followed this  morning.  <P>
<P>
I shall first call the Minister of State to explain why he  is inviting the Committee to leave out clause 15 and  replace it with new clause 5 and new schedule 1. It is for  the Minister to decide whether to address the amendments  tabled to the new schedule at the same time or whether to  wait until the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)  has had the chance to introduce them.  
<P>
When the debate is concluded, I shall put the question  that clause 15 stand part of the Bill, to which I assume  Labour Members will vote no. No further proceedings  will arise at that point, and we shall move directly to  clause 1 and schedule 1. Government new clause 5 will  be called formally, as the first new clause, when we reach  the end of the Bill. Government new schedule 1 will be  called formally after all the new clauses have been  disposed of.  
<P>
Once the new schedule has been read a Second time,  and without further debate, I shall invite the hon. Member  for Daventry, if he so wishes, to move formally one or  mor of his amendments to the new schedule for a  Division. I shall then put the question that the schedule  be added to the Bill, again without further debate. I hope  that that makes the position clear.  
<H4><center>Clause 15 </center></H4>

<P>
<B> The Minister of State, Department of Trade and  Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Good morning, Mr. Atkinson. That was the best speech that I have heard in  this Committee. I have been up all night wondering how we  might deal with the matter, knowing that the hon. Member  for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) and others would be at my  heels.  
<P>
I shall speak to clause 15 stand part, and, then to  Government new clause 5 and Government new schedule 1.  I shall not respond to the amendments to Government new  schedule 1 tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry until  the end of the debate, and I shall incorporate in my response  any additional points raised on the amendments. Those  amendments are considerable, however, and they deserve a  substantive reply. I hope today to have exhausted our  arguments on the questions before us.  
<P>
Clause 15 extends the right of protection for employees  taking lawfully organised official industrial action. That  is in line with our pre-election commitments, and it is in  response to the International Labour Organisation  criticism that United Kingdom law provides insufficient  protection for workers.  
<P>
Our law on strikes and strikers is peculiar to this  country. The law gives no explicit right to strike. Instead,  it provides immunities from civil action for unions when  they lawfully organise strikes and induce others to break  their contracts of employment. However, individual  strikers can be sued for damages by their employers for  breaking their contracts. They can also be dismissed. In  practice, it is virtually unknown for individual strikers to  be sued, but the threat of dismissal is real enough, given  the number of disputes and the possibility of people being  dismissed immediately following industrial action.  
<P>
During the past 20 years, the scope of union immunities  has narrowed, as the law on industrial action has become  more prescriptive. By and large, those changes have  become an accepted feature of our industrial relations  system. However, the position of individual workers has  remained much the same as it ever was. That is unfair.  
<P>
The existing law provides inadequate protections for  those individuals who exercise their fundamental freedom  to withdraw their labour. Our proposals aim to modernise  the law in that area, and redress a glaring imbalance. They  will provide a fair balance between the interests and  freedoms of individuals and employers.  
<P>
Under the law at present, an employee can complain to  a tribunal of unfair dismissal if an employer dismisses or  re-engages selectively; however such an employee cannot  complain if all the strikers are dismissed. That is illogical,  and it provides inadequate protection.     
<P>
The new right means that it will be automatically unfair  to dismiss workers for the first eight weeks of the action.  That will deter employers from making precipitate  dismissals soon after the action has begun.  
<P>
In the United Kingdom, there are few occasions on  which industrial action leads to dismissal. As part of the  process of conciliation, it is normal that employees return  to work with no sanctions against them. The clause  addresses the cases in which sanctions occur.  
<P>
Precipitate dismissals are bad in themselves. Moreover,  they complicate disputes and usually make them more  difficult to resolve. It is no accident that disputes  involving dismissals are among the most bitter and  intractable to resolve.  
<P>
Why choose eight weeks? I think that the hon. Member  for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) and some Conservative  Members asked that question on Second Reading. We  want to set a period that allows reasonable time for parties  to resolve their dispute and so avoid dismissals. In our  judgment, eight weeks gives enough time for detailed and  serious discussions to occur, possibly involving third  parties such as the Advisory, Conciliation and  Arbitration Service.  
<P>
Some employers might not use the eight-week period  to try to find a settlement. They might sit on their hands  and do nothing. Workers must have redress in those  circumstances, so clause 15 also gives employees a right  to claim unfair dismissal if they have been dismissed after  the eight-week period and employers have not engaged in  procedures to resolve the dispute.  
<P>
Those new protections will apply only to industrial  action that is official and lawfully organised. We will  therefore create a dual set of obligations on the parties.  Unions must organise the action in accordance with the  law, including the detailed provisions concerning notice  and ballots. If they do not, the rights will not apply, which  means that employer scan, without the fear of tribunals  against them, dismiss those taking unofficial action.  Employers are obliged to begin serious negotiations with  the union before they can fairly dismiss.  
<P>
This is an important clause, which we have looked at  again closely. On reflection, we feel that it can be  improved to give fuller guidance to tribunals, employers,  unions and employees on what the new right entails.  
<P>
First, the clause should do more to give guidance to  tribunals in assessing whether employers have taken  sufficient action to resolve disputes when judging  applications for unfair dismissal that have occurred  outside the eight-week period. Therefore, we have defined  in subsection (6) of new section 238A of the Trade Union  and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 the  factors that tribunals should take into account. They are:  respect for dispute procedures; whether reasonable steps  have been followed to re-open negotiations after the  beginning of action; and whether reasonable steps have  been taken to involve ACAS or other third parties to help  resolve a dispute through conciliation or mediation.     
<P>
In that context, "mediation"  means the involvement of  a third party that makes non-binding recommendations to  identify the further procedural steps that should be taken  to resolve disputes. The focus of mediation on procedural  matters is typical of ACAS mediations, so we are not  inventing a new concept of dispute resolution.  "Mediation"  is distinct from "arbitration" , and I urge hon.  Members not to confuse the two. "Arbitration"  means the  involvement of a third party to decide the substantive  issues of dispute. The amendments would not require  employers to accept such arbitration. However, if the  parties wish to proceed by agreement, they can always  take steps that amount to arbitration.  
<P>
Secondly, the clause should place greater onus on  unions to begin negotiations to resolve disputes. If  dismissals are to be avoided, both sides must be  encouraged to find a settlement. In drafting subsection (6)  of new section 238A, we have stated that tribunals must  equally take into account whether unions have made or  accepted overtures to resolve disputes.  
<P>
Thirdly, we do not want a tribunal to decide whether a  union or an employer has the better case in a trade dispute.  We do not want it to decide whether an employer's offer  was appropriate or whether a union's claim was excessive.  Its sole focus must be procedural matters it should  examine whether all reasonable procedural steps have  been taken to resolve a dispute. The clause has therefore  been redrafted to achieve that, to include wording stating  explicitly that tribunals should not become involved in  judging the merits of a trade dispute.  
<P>
Fourthly, the clause states that normal tribunal  procedures should apply in such cases. On reflection,  however, we now feel that those procedures should be  adapted to take into account the peculiar circumstances of  such cases. For example, it would be wrong for tribunals  to issue reinstatement orders while action is still being  taken. That might lead to absurd situations where by  tribunals issued orders to employers to reinstate people  who did not want to work. Employers might be required  to pay additional compensation to each worker up to a  maximum of over £11,000 if they failed to abide by  such orders, even though the workers involved were still  on strike. We have made provision to allow tribunals to  consider applications for unfair dismissal while industrial  action is still proceeding, but not to consider applications  for reinstatement or re-engagement until the end of the  dispute.  
<P>
Special provision for tribunal procedure is also needed.  Paragraph 4(5) of the new schedule ensures that it will be  possible to deal with that through regulations made under  the Employment Tribunals Act 1996. First, at the moment,  tribunals can reject requests to hold pre-hearing reviews  of unfair dismissal cases. We want tribunals to conduct  pre-hearing reviews in all cases when requested. If the  tribunal gives an early opinion on the merits of unfair  dismissal cases, it should help to stimulate negotiations to  settle the dispute. For example, if an employer had an  early indication that the case for unfair dismissal was  strong, it might change his or her willingness to negotiate  a settlement with the union on the underlying trade  dispute.     
<P>
Secondly, we must adapt tribunal procedures to allow  for circumstances in which the courts are considering  actions brought by the employer or others challenging the  legitimacy of the union's organisation of industrial action.  Tribunals must have the scope to adjourn cases of unfair  dismissal while such related court actions are under way.  
<P>
Finally, as currently drafted, new section 238A,  inserted by clause 15, contains a technical error. It fails to  define "protected industrial action"  accurately. It wrongly  states that an action is protected when the individual  worker was not committing a tort. That applies in a few  cases. Individuals may induce someone else to break his  contract and thereby commit a tort. However, such cases  are rare. In cases when the individual's only action is to  break his own contract of employment as is normal in  such cases he is not committing a tort. He would be  unprotected if we were to let the clause stand, and the  effect of the right would be minimal. Instead, in line with  the policy described in the White Paper, "Fairness at  work" , the clause should read that an action is protected  when the union that organises the action in which the  individual takes part enjoys immunity form tort because  it has done so lawfully. The amendment at subsection (1)  of new section 238A makes the necessary correction.  
<P>
The changes that we propose are significant. We have  therefore tabled amendments that delete clause 15 and  replace it with a new clause and a new schedule. The  changes greatly clarify the right; they encourage the  voluntary settlement of disputes, and give important  guidance to tribunals considering such cases. I therefore  hope that hon. Members will support the changes in  respect of Government new clause 5 and Government new  schedule 1.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> I rise on what is formally  the clause stand part debate, as you helpfully explained,  Mr. Atkinson, in terms that enabled even me briefly to  have a glimmer of understanding. The procedure that I  want to adopt is to make one speech which may relieve  hon. Members about the principle of the clause, and the  new clause and new schedule with which the Minister  wants to replace it, and to move and speak to my  amendments as a jumbo, economy-size pack. I shall not  subsequently try to intervene, save possibly to respond to  the Minister's response at the end of the debate. That will  help us to proceed. It is important, and not wholly  irrelevant, that the detail impacts on the general principle.  
<P>
At the end of our previous sitting, I recall saying to the  Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, the hon.  Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) that we ended on  a note of agreement. I welcome that and suspect that all  members of the Committee will have got the message  that, in industrial relations generally, agreement is  preferable to strife and that our interests are to promote  good practice, not subvert it. The Minister of State has  clearly picked up that message, given that he proposed his  reorganised affairs with becoming modesty. To use a  phrase of classical antiquity, "I fear the Greeks even when  they bring gifts" . Despite his charming bedside manner  this morning in which he emulates the Minister for Small  Firms, Trade and Industry, the Opposition have  considerable doubts about what is going on.  
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I most interested in  my hon. Friend's musings about classical antiquity, but I  doubt whether it would be necessary to go back that far to  find a precedent for what is happening. As a parliamentary  virgin, I should be most grateful if he would tell the  Committee when was the previous occasion on which a  Minister argued passionately that his own clause should  not stand part of the Bill?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> Unfortunately, my hon. Friend asks a  question to which I have no ready answer.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I am more than happy to assist  the hon. Gentleman. We undertook a similar exercise  during the consideration of the National Minimum Wage  Act 1998.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is trying to soften us up,  but it will not wash. Let us have a moment of consensus.  He wants the clause to be deleted, and I will not advise  my hon. Friends to resist that action. I hope that the  Committee will be unanimous in deleting it but we take  exception to the sting in the tail of his proposals new  clause 5 and new schedule 1. I owe it to the Committee  to explain the difference of motive.  
<P>
The Minister has decided, in his most urbane manner,  to try to rescue himself from a procedural shambles. As  the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for  Buckingham showed, such action is becoming a  distressing habit in the Department of Trade and Industry.  However, we would rather have a shambles that led to  some improvement than no shambles at all.  
<P>
To the discomfiture of many with a professional  interest in such matters who want to follow the Bill and  the amendments, the Government have tabled a new  paving clause and a schedule and want to withdraw  another clause before a shot has been fired. That has  created a Christmas tree of a debate, on to which all  possible points on individual rights and unfair dismissal  can be hung under a group of amendments. We have  consensus on the formal motion, so we cannot vote on the  Government's new proposals until the very last gasp of  the Bill, some weeks away.  
<P>
To pursue the analogy, we want to embellish the  Christmas tree with substantial amendments. Our motive  is metaphorically to weigh down the tree's branches,  possibly to cause them to break in certain cases. We  strongly suspect that when the Christmas tree in its  redrafted, new Labour form the new schedule is  exposed to the harsh heat of criticism it will suffer from  a combination of legal and practical needle drop.  
<P>
I am not sure whether to continue the analogy of  forestry, because it might not be appropriate to the  Minister. I am not describing him as the mad axeman. He  could be properly described as a small but perfectly  formed carnivore; from time to time, he needs a blood  meal the red meat of socialism.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce (South Dorset):</B> I wanted to stop my  hon. Friend before he got into his flow, so as not to  interrupt it, but I fear that I have done so. Is not it the  reality that new Labour has to add "new"  to almost  everything? That is the blood from which the Government  are feeding and why there is now a new clause and a new  schedule. I wonder whether the Committee will continue  for a very long time because the Labour Government  seem to get fed up of anything that is not new. Perhaps  we should be asking for better clauses and schedules  rather than simply new ones.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but he  takes me into dangerous territory. The Committee knows  that I am always generous with my declarations of  interest. My late father's second name was New he was  Eric New Boswell but he was in no sense new Labour  and would not have approved of the clause in either its  new or old form.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr.  Bruce) realised that he had interrupted my flow. I was about  to say that the Minister sits in Committee as a new licensed  meat eater in what is largely a party of political vegetarians.  Large parts of the Bill are an object lesson in how the forces  of moderation are exemplified by the Secretary of State,  who breathes the tenets of capitalism, to the distress of his  colleagues, and who appears to prefer wealth creation to  redistribution.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> He is an outrider.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the Minister's own interests, I shall  affect not to have heard that intervention. The Secretary  of State has to throw scraps to the pursuing hordes to keep  them at bay.  
<P>
Turning to more sober issues, why is there a need for  change? The Minister, vaguely, cast into the pool ILO  concerns about individual rights and alleged anomalies in  the position of individuals, as against the immunities of  trade unions. These are serious issues, but I do not think  that his argument was tight enough. Even if he had a case,  the facts speak for themselves when we consider  industrial relations. The world is a completely different  place thank goodness. My hon. Friend the Member for  Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) will not remember, but will  have read with interest about the days when Red Robbo  ran British Leyland into almost terminal decline. That led  inexorably to foreign takeover and, we hope, now to  successful resurrection under new ownership.  
<P>
Since those days, two things have changed. First, there  has been a substantive change right across the industrial  spectrum. I give credit where credit is due and  acknowledge that there is a much more constructive  attitude among trade unions and all sides of industry to  the positive promotion of good industrial relations and the  contribution that they can make to the nation's  productivity and competitiveness. That is a huge gain,  regardless of who is entitled to claim credit.  
<P>
Secondly, underlying the political point that I want to  make, disputes are running at trivial levels, compared with  20 years ago. On Second Reading, I said that at its best,  the level of disputes fell to only 1 per cent. of that which  characterised the late 1970s and early 1980s, until the  position was brought under control, Labour Members  cannot deny that it was the progressive approach of  successive Conservative Governments that brought that  about not solely through legislation, but through  pointing the unions and both sides of industry in the  direction of their own interests. Now that we have an  enviable industrial relations record, why disturb the  pattern? What ill is there to remedy and what good will  it do?  
<P>
What are the Government's proposals? I know that the  Minister tried to explain them in a considered statement  and I did not want to interrupt him because I was anxious  to have his explanation on the record. I am sure that  members of the Committee agree that the proposals break  new ground by giving virtual immunity from dismissal to  the individual who is connected with an official dispute.  
<P>
The doctrine that has developed since the Industrial  Relations Act 1971, which was not the most successful  foray into the area, paved the way for re-examination and  progressive reshaping of industrial relations law. It  enshrined and maintained the ancient rights under  common law about which neither I nor the Minister of  State is legally qualified to comment. I shall come back  to that issue, because the interaction of the statute law and  the common law is of concern to those who have been in  touch with me about it.  
<P>
The right is, and was, almost from time immemorial for  an employer to dismiss an employee who breaches his  contract by taking part in industrial action. Clearly, if  someone is under a contract to work and declines to do  so, that constitutes a breach of contract. It does not mean  automatically, however, that it is sensible or wise to sack  someone in that position. It may well not be, but  nevertheless it is clear that something has happened to  the contract.     
<P>
I realise that there is potential for confusion when the  word "immunity"  is used as it shifts from employer to  trade unions, but the employer's right to deem that  employees were in breach was forfeited in the interests of  fairness towards the individuals if the employer started  treating striking employees selectively either by not  re-engaging them or by engaging other people. That  applies both to dismissal and to subsequent  re-engagement.  
<P>
Such rules are well known and described colloquially  in the business as the "picking and choosing rules" . I have  no intention of re-opening that issue; it can be argued  there is a sense of British fair play in not selecting  individuals for dismissal simply on the basis of their union  membership. It is incontestable that a person who enters  freely and without duress into a contract to work for his  employer, but declines to do so, he is in breach of his  contract. That is a serious matter unless there is a good  reason to overturn that decision.  
<P>
Clause 15, the son of clause 15 and the new schedule  would simply reverse that position. Instead of a finite,  protected period of a limited cooling-off space, or the  opportunity to look again at the issue, there will be an  almost infinitely flexible period of protection, which  means that the basic right of the employer to dismiss a  striking employee is withdrawn. Ministers have never  really come clean about the matter or made clear their  arguments.  
<P>
Does the Minister of State consider that the picking and  choosing rules are inadequate to protect the individual or  the interests of natural justice? If there is something unfair  about the way in which the rules work in practice, we  should debate it. Does the hon. Gentleman feel that the  run of employers are too keen to pick up the blunderbuss  of mass sackings rather than enter into negotiations? The  Minister of State may have been hinting about that when  he talked about reasonableness and the need for  employees to get on with the business of showing that  they are ready to negotiate, conciliate or mediate all  actions that we entirely support.     
<P>
I wonder whether Ministers sit up at night worrying that  their new-found friends in business think that the right to  manage through the right to dismiss fairly and in defined  circumstances is coming to an end. The proposals amount  to the constructive ending of the right to sack and,  therefore, the right to manage. There might be a case for  doing that, but the Minister has not made it in Committee  this morning.  
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I am worried that the current good state of industrial  relations which is welcome; no one argues against it,  or wants to subvert it might be overturned, especially  because of the technical problems to which I shall refer  later. As I said on Second Reading, we might end up with  legislation that does not stand in place of strife but creates  a place for strife.  
<P>
This is a precursor of debates that we must have on  the wider issue of trade union recognition. Although that  chimes with the same philosophy, it is light years away  from the Minister's espoused cause right or wrong of  protecting individuals' rights to parental leave, for  example. The Opposition are concerned about such  matters, and we need to tackle them closely. The Minister  must give better answers about his rationale for the  proposals.  
<P>
On the substantive issue, I make three predictions. First,  as the Minister has said, under the Government's  proposals on the dismissal of striking employees, an  important distinction must be drawn between whether the  action is official and, therefore, protected under section  238 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations  (Consolidation) Act 1992, or whether it is unprotected,  unofficial action under section 237 of that Act. There is a  qualitative difference between such actions. The question  of whether industrial action is official becomes highly  important.  
<P>
I do not know whether this was the Government's  intention, but the result of their proposals will be to raise  the stakes in favour of union involvement and, indirectly,  of union recognition in industrial relations. Interestingly,  it reverses the position that some of us will have been  familiar with years ago, when unions often stepped back  from industrial disputes and allowed them to be unofficial  to protect their funds or other interests. There will be a  fast track to union recognition. The best way for  individuals to take industrial action will be to bundle up  their grievances with other matters, so protecting  themselves from unfair dismissal. I can envisage some  good arguments for conducting industrial disputes, if they  must take place, through official action. I am not arguing  about that. However, these proposals constitute a  disguised bid to load the dice in favour of union  recognition.  
<P>
The second point is that the wording of clause 15 and  its redraft are redolent with opportunities to argue about  definitions. First, what is the definition of industrial  action? When does something become industrial action,  rather than a minor tiff or a temporary interruption?  Secondly, I am concerned about the length of the  protected period after a break in industrial action. Is it the  same action, or a different action? What would make it a  different action? What view would the courts take on  whether it was a different action?  
<P>
The third point concerns the nature of the procedures  that are prayed in aid to establish whether a dismissal in  such cases is fair and whether disputes procedures have  been undertaken.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am reluctant to interrupt my hon.  Friend's flow, but I should like clarification of one point.  Unless the Bill specifically provides protection against  that eventuality, there is a danger that employees could  strike for a period over one grievance, cease to strike for  a period of days or weeks, and then strike again for the  original reason and another that they invoke, thereby  arguing that it is separate industrial action. Ministers  should take account of that important factor.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. It is for  Ministers to consider that problem. I am not saying this  in a partisan or party-political spirit, but we want the  Minister to get the legislation right and to avoid  confusion. There is a problem with what might be  considered serial industrial action.  
<P>
Another matter to which not enough attention has been  given, is the reason for dismissal. there will be a primary  purpose test, but if an employee has both struck and  started a fire on the premises because he is disaffected  with his employer, what will be the primary reason for  dismissal? I am sure that the Minister will say that it  depends on the facts, but it is an area that will be argued  over.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> There may have been a strike against  an employer that so damages his business that he has to  close a department, thereby making people redundant. The  primary reason for such redundancies is because the  employees went on strike and damaged the business, but  under the clause, the employer will be prevented from  taking such economic action.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a fine point that may end up being  decided in court, but my hon. Friend makes it clearly. My  concern is that at the industrial level, the provision may  be seen as a charter to return to old Spanish practices  to use a phrase that is now obsolete, thank goodness. At  the legal level, it may lead to the establishment of a  litigation-minded culture, in which all the issues will have  to be fought expensively through the courts.  
<P>
That brings me to my final general point about the  clause. I am worried that the real beneficiaries will be not  employees or trade unions, but the employment lawyers  who have to fight it out. The wiser among them, although  some of them seem to be more altruistic than I had  anticipated, are metaphorically licking their lips. I  sometimes think that the Minister and I should seek  retraining as employment lawyers and repackage  ourselves as McCartney, QC and Boswell, QC. We could  appear on television to great personal benefit, or we could  even go to the High Court and do just as well there. It  would be the same kind of show as in Committee, as we  would be raising the same issues, but we would be paid  by item of service.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is developing an  interesting train of thought. He also has a fertile  imagination. Does it stretch to being able to conjure up a  picture of the Minister of State wearing a wig?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> It might be out of order if I were to  comment further. I remember exchanges across various  Committees on the subject of whether or not colleagues  were assisted by that item of clothing, but I do not intend  to go further. I do not want to put the Committee off the  essential point, which is that the law is a good ally, but  an extremely poor master in sensitive industrial relations  matters. Ministers will have noted that yesterday, The  Times carried the first law report of an action on the  working time directive, involving a high-profile company,  on the definition of what was, or was not, required of  employees, and whether the company had used its best  endeavours to avoid going over the 48 hours.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am a little worried that my hon.  Friend is taking a route that might end up being sub  judice. Am I right in believing that the Department of  Trade and Industry has been accused of taking on  temporary employees for more than 48 hours a week, thus  breaking the working time directive? We do not want to  embarrass the Government, do we?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that if the Minister had any  worries about that, he would seek to make inquiries and  disabuse the Committee later. However, I am grateful to  my hon. Friend.  
<P>
Despite the helpful interventions of my hon. Friends, I  am anxious not to stray off the essential point, which is  that the law may be a useful ally but that it is not the best  determinant of industrial relations. It will destroy clarity  of the process of law if ambiguities are left in the Bill  through which malicious people, or even genuinely  confused people, may seek to leap. In our view, the clause  is not the best way to intervene in the process.  
<P>
In view of the general comments made so far, the  amendments may not require me to make a long speech,  but the complexity of the schedule makes it necessary to  speak to them all. The informal grouping of the  amendments is entirely to the point. Amendments (a) and  (b) together would omit the preamble to the new schedule.  Our purpose is to flag up doubts expressed to me by  professionals about the interaction of the new schedule  with the common law. I suspect that the Minister of State  and I may find ourselves not wholly able to deal with that  advice even to our own satisfaction. We were told that the  English common law principles that enable an employer  to dismiss a striking employee for breach of contract will  stand independently of any right extended under statute to  dismiss fairly.  
<P>
The 1992 Act, which many hon. Members have to  hand, establishes a procedure for fair dismissal by  defining circumstances in which dismissal would be  unfair, and therefore unlawful, and that it would be  compensatable, or in certain cases that it would lead to  reinstatement. That is separate from what happens under  common law. However, the Bill seems to be silent on the  common law question of whether a refusal to meet an  obligation to provide work and the resulting dismissal  would be covered by the schedule.  
<P>
The amendments, despite my somewhat lame,  amateurish and hasty attempts at drafting, are designed to  say that it ought to be either way or t'other. I am not  arguing for the principle of statutory dismissal against that  of common law dismissal. I say only that the same should  apply to each; otherwise, lawyers tell me, a striking  worker could be dismissed without notice under common  law. I hope that the Minister will not misinterpret me, but  that is one of the attractions to some employers of being  able to dismiss under common law. Under the new  schedule, however, they would remain liable for unfair  dismissal. The Minister needs to tease that out a little  more. Rather than challenge the principle of the new  schedule, the amendments are tabled so that we can  discover whether it will work properly, and whether it will  cover all eventualities.     
<P>
I turn to amendments (c) and (d). Amendment (c)  would simply reduce the eight week period to four weeks.  Frankly, Ministers have made no real argument for having  chosen eight weeks; they did not explain that choice even  in the White Paper. The Engineering Employers  Federation points out that in 1997 less than 4 per cent. of  industrial disputes lasted for longer than 30 days. I am  pleased about that, as, I am sure, is the federation. Another  fascinating statistic, this time from the Office for National  Statistics, is that only 15 per cent. of industrial disputes  last more than five working days, so, mercifully,  walk-outs are short and are usually resolved. The Minister  will rightly point out that some cases are deeply  entrenched and go on for a long time. Unless people  manage to string out the protected period, such cases will  not be covered by his proposals on unfair dismissal. The  eight-week period may be intended to cover it will  certainly have that effect-the great mass of industrial  disputes, without unions, on the statistical face of it,  having various means of recourse.  
<P>
<H5>11.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): In  addition to those statistics, is the hon. Gentleman aware  that the vast majority of disputes that go as far as  industrial action ballot are resolved after the result of the  ballot is announced, assuming that there is a positive  result? A positive vote in the ballot forces both sides  together. Therefore, we have to consider the procedure  that brings them together in that period of time. Is he not  worried that his amendment would do the opposite?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I need to argue for the amendment in  relation to the period of time. The Minister said,  interestingly and helpfully, that he is concerned that  employers should not sit back but should be positively  engaged in the process of dispute resolution. I am pleased  that he nods at my saying that. I am concerned that there  is not a comparable requirement on unions. The hon.  Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas),  who has direct experience of such matters, and the  Minister, will want to drive towards conciliation and  agreement.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart (Eccles):</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware  that, in the period directly after the ballot result that my  hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and  Saddleworth talked about, and using his example of a  positive outcome for action, there is a one-week period in  which the onus is on the parties to come together to try  to resolve the dispute?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> Of course that is sensible. However, I  am concerned that the Minister's proposal will allow  virtually all industrial disputes to fall within the protected  period. I suspect that Government Back Benchers will be  pleased about that, but employers may be less pleased.  Whether they are or not, the situation should at least be  clearer.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> In using his statistics, the hon.  Gentleman has not alluded to a very powerful one, which  is that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, there is  one distinguishing feature: no dismissal takes place. The  issue is protracted disputes, the usual causes of which is  dismissal. Most disputes end in a short period because the  employer and the work force come to an agreement  without the employer resorting to sacking them.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In case the Minister should misinterpret  what I say, I should point out that I have no interest in  advocating the weapon of dismissal for employers. Some  of my earlier comments were entirely consistent with that  philosophy. I am much happier if disputes are resolved by  agreement, and I welcome the use of ballots as part of the  procedures of collective agreement.  
<P>
The Minister is right to say that the majority of what  might be termed trench warfare disputes have involved a  dismissal at some stage. However, his proposals do not  address such situations, which are likely to have gone  beyond the eight-week period. If that is the frame of mind  that employers are in if they say, "Sack 'em. We will  start again,"  on a non-discriminatory basis they may  wait for eight weeks, take the minimum amount of action,  and then try to jump in. That needs to be examined, and  Ministers need to be clear about their intentions.     
<P>
Amendment (d) to new schedule 1 is slightly different  in character. Like amendment (c), it refers to four weeks,  in the interests of consistency. Our anxieties relate to  intermittent action, about which we have received several  representations. The Minister and those with industrial  experience will know that the practice about which,  again, I make no qualitative judgment has grown up in  industrial disputes not of an all-out strike but of  intermittent action, such as walking out one day a week.  It reduces the impact on the striking individuals and the  cost in strike pay. I make no judgment about whether that  is wise. It is probably quite sensible for unions to think  along those lines. The Minister must consider, as it is not  clear in the Bill, whether the eight-week protective period  will run from the first event or whether such events will  be considered separate, each restarting the clock. My hon.  Friends have already expressed anxiety about closely  related industrial disputes that arise from a complaint  about a, b and c, but in which, by the second week,  workers are complaining about a, b, c, d and e and by the  third week, seriatim. How will the courts interpret that?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies (Croydon, Central):</B> Does the hon.  Gentleman agree that, in trying to include intermittent  action, the amendment is a recipe for the escalation of  strike action? Action such as a go-slow once a week  would be considered the same as all-out striking for eight  weeks. A union might, therefore, take the view that it  might as well adopt the big-bang approach. The  amendment would therefore lead to more industrial action  rather than less.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is an ingenious argument. The short  answer is that I do not buy it. I realise that that could  happen. If it did, it might bring to a head a radical dispute.  I am worried that it may become easier for unions to  contrive intermittent or ambiguous action, because the  grievance is always being redefined or because it did not  start at a clear point, so that a union can argue that the  protected period has not yet started. It might say that  sporadic action, perhaps unofficial, has taken place, and  at the most opportune moment, it will press the starting  button, the action will become official, and it will enjoy  an eight-week protected period or longer, if it works  carefully. We must know when the meter flag will drop  and in what circumstances it will stay in practice. I readily  concede the hon. Gentleman's point that we do not want  to create a situation in which the best thing to do is to  continue a dispute because to do so is easier than dropping  it. However, the dangers on the other side are, perhaps  greater.  
<P>
Amendments (e), (f) and (h) are designed to introduce  a reciprocity of duties and obligations on employees and  their unions, matching those on employers. The Minister  referred to the need for employers to use proper  procedure, with which I have no argument. However,  anxieties have been expressed that unions may hold back  for that, and may not want to engage on the procedure or,  as the Confederation of British Industry has suggested,  might suggest a willingness to commence or to resume  negotiations only at the end of the eight-week period. That  could be interpreted as having acted reasonably, because  it took place in the eight-week period, even if the union  had persistently resisted taking the appropriate procedural  steps to resolve the dispute up to that point. Again, we  are trying to find the correct balance and to encourage  parties to agree. As is entirely consistent with other  matters for which Ministers argue, they should consider  some reciprocity of obligation. We are not suggesting  imposing obligations on unions or their members that are  not imposed on the employer; we are suggesting that those  obligations should match.  
<P>
Amendment (k) is an attempt at greater certainty by  providing that the procedures to be followed, that will be  taken into account in tribunal proceedings on an  employer's conduct, should be those prescribed in  legally-binding agreements. It is designed to cut out any  waffle about someone from the union side or the  individual employees offering to negotiate. We are trying  to preserve symmetry because, by definition, a  legally-binding agreement would be binding on both  sides. We are not asking unions or their members to  undertake an obligation that does not apply to their  employers.  
<P>
Amendment (g) is another effort to impose a test of  good faith to stop either side making paper offers during  the protected period. We want them to negotiate properly.     
<P>
Amendment (i) is somewhat different. It would require  a longer period for winding down an official dispute  merely by declaring it official. My immediate concern is  that, as we neared the end of an eight-week period, it  would be possible for a union to bale out and declare the  strike unofficial if it so chose. The amendment would  reflect that reality that if a dispute is, and has been,  official, there should be a reasonable time to turn it into an  unofficial dispute and, in effect, withdraw the protection.  Equally, we want to ensure that the period lasts for the  duration of that official dispute. I hope that the Minister  will consider that small point.  
<P>
Amendment (j) would provide a minimum cooling-off  period of one week before reinstatement to allow tempers  to cool, instead of saying that reinstatement would occur,  if the tribunal so judged, after a strike. There should be a  short period before reinstatement to allow matters to  settle.  
<P>
I am conscious that I have given a fairly long  presentation of a complex case. The amendments are not  designed to be asymmetrical, but to place the same rights  and obligations on both sides. They are not wrecking  amendments to subvert the Government's intentions,  although, in certain cases, they would curtail them. I have  sought to argue the case why that should be done.  
<P>
Unless the Minister of State can give better assurances  to the Committee that he had done, what cannot be taken  away is our underlying concern that the Bill moves into a  new area of industrial relations law by intervening, albeit  obliquely, on the setting of individual contracts between  employers and their employees. It will allow them to be  set aside only in protected periods and only in connection  with an official industrial dispute.  
<P>
The Minister of State may argue that such interventions  are appropriate rather than there being a comprehensive  withdrawal of the right. However, Ministers are not in  the business of simply providing a charter for expensive  employment lawyers in such an innovative area of  employment law. It is essential to get the maximum  possible clarity and to avoid as I am sure that the  Minister of State would wish any perverse incentives to  prolong or escalate disputes, as against getting them  solved.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The Committee is at one in hoping  that industrial action does not take place, and that  employers and employees can solve disputes. We all  disagree with the notion of people losing their jobs  because they have genuine grievances with their  employers. We do not want people to be dismissed. To  return to the issue of unintended consequences, we must  try to find the best way of resolving disputes. Labour  Members know that official Opposition Members are not  keen to frame the regulations rigidly because that so often  fails to help solve problems. Conservative Members are  proud of the industrial relations record that resulted from  our legislative changes and of the assurance that it gives  that employers and employees will stand back from  industrial disputes.  
<P>
<H5>11.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I was delighted that the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) said how wonderful it was when people  who wanted to rush out on strike had now legally to hold  a ballot first. He is right that Conservative Members are  proud of the opportunity to resolve disputes that that  pause gives. I am glad that the Labour party has also come  to appreciate how good that piece of labour relations  legislation is. I also agree strongly that an employer who  knows that his employees have been balloted and have  decided to go on strike has to say, "Whoa, these guys are  going to strike in short order because the trade union has  an absolute right to call them out and no union member  will disagree with that: everyone has expressed his  democratic voting right."  That pressure on employers can  encourage them try to solve disputes.  
<P>
Just as employees can threaten to remove their labour,  employers often make the threat rarely put into  practice of saying to staff, "if you walk out, I'll sack the  lot of you."  There is what might be called a balance of  terror, with one side fearing the loss of job, the other the  loss of staff, and with people in the middle saying that the  issues are serious and should be solved without employees  being dismissed or going on strike. The clause says to the  employer, "You ain't able to threaten your employees any  more by saying that if they walk out the company will  collapse and they will all have to be sacked."  That threat  is made in the heat of the moment, but sometimes helps  to resolve a dispute.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> In 20 years as an industrial relations  practitioner, I never encountered someone who wanted to  be on strike for the sake of it. That does not happen. The  hon. Gentleman describes such situations as involving a  "balance of terror"  but there is no equity of power. Only  in a minority of cases can workers use their bargaining  lever of threatening strike action and possibly strike action  itself, but an employer always has the power to dismiss.  Does he agree that employers therefore have superior  power in the bargaining stakes?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will make  a speech because the issues that he raises are important. I  am sorry to disillusion him: an employee has the ability  not only to go on strike, but to find another job. A small  employer, struggling like mad cannot stop a key worker  who decides to get another job by saying, "You have to  stay because you are essential to my business."      
<P>
It is often a question of achieving balance between the  parties. I am not saying that employers should threaten to  dismiss those who threaten to strike. I am simply saying  that a balance must be drawn. I am grateful to the hon.  Gentleman for saying that employees do not want to  strike. I was about to make that point. I have experience  of a strike in a factory. At the end of the dispute, all the  problems were solved.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Was the hon. Gentleman the  manager?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> No one has ever gone on strike while  I have managed a work force. I worked for the Sainsbury  organisation, where people regularly went on strike. After  a strike, the shop steward often resigned because of the  hassle. Going on strike is not a nice experience. Those  who strike for a week lose 2 per cent. of their income. If  people strike for eight weeks, they lose 16 per cent. of  their income, and, whatever they went on strike for, they  will generally not recoup that money. Striking is a very  nasty thing suddenly people live hand to mouth with  no money.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady (Altrincham and Sale, West):</B> I  suspect that some Labour Members fail to accept that,  when a work force go on strike, the employer also loses  2 per cent. of his income.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making  that point, which I was about to make, but I was trying to  get the sympathy and attention of Labour Members.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is making the valid point  that wholesale dismissals are undesirable and should be  avoided if possible, but, in extremis, they can prove  necessary. Does he agree that President Reagan's  dismissal of all the air traffic controllers who went on  strike to the massive inconvenience of their employers  and the public is a useful illustration of that point?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The trouble with giving way to my  colleagues is that they always make the point that I was  about to make and, when I then make it, they think that I  have stolen it from them. I was about to make exactly  that point.  
<P>
When people go on strike, employers often say,  "You're all sacked" . That happens, but how often do those  people remain sacked? The employers often say, "I can't  deal with this. I'm going to sack the lot of you and recruit  new people."  That has the effect of making people think  that the problem should be resolved; it helps to  concentrate minds.  
<P>
One side of the bargaining group will be told that it can  strike for eight weeks, which is a long time few strikes  last eight weeks. Therefore, in most cases, employers will  no longer be able to say, "If you don't come back, I'll  sack the lot of you" , because the employees will say,  "You can't do that. We're on an official strike. We are  not going to listen to that sort of threat."   
<P>
I am concerned that strikes might last longer.  Employees who used to be threatened that a dispute must  be settled, otherwise they would be sacked, will have that  threat removed. Instead of an undesirable strike lasting a  week or two, it might last eight weeks before the union  says that it should end to prevent people from being  dismissed and possibly replaced.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the  employer's use of dismissal as a threat is dealt with on  the ballot papers that people sign before they take  industrial action? By law, ballot papers must state clearly  that the action is a breach of contract and might lead to  dismissal. Workers are aware of that from the outset. The  majority of the Committee already accepts that workers  are always reluctant to strike, for the reasons that he gave.  Workers strike when they are forced into a position that  they see no other way of getting out of. All the legislation  that he and my hon. Friend the Minister of State  mentioned is intended to ensure that workers and  employers come together at every stage of the procedure  to try to resolve disputes and ensure that they do not  happen again.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman should make a speech,  and not just intervene. He has informed the Committee of  something of which I was unaware.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall deal with one intervention at a time,  if I may. The hon. Member for Eccles said that workers  receive ballot papers saying that they are liable to be  sacked even though they are involved in an official  dispute. I was unaware of that, but in future workers will  receive ballot papers saying, "It's all right. We shall not  keep you out longer than eight weeks."  He shakes his  head, but he has just made a wonderfully impassioned  intervention with which I agree. I do not know why he is  now disagreeing with my agreeing him. He now disagrees  that that is one of the factors in a ballot that people take  into account.  
<P>
I do not want to take away the ability of workers to  bring appropriate pressure on their employers, because I  know that that would hurt the employee. There should be  a balance of pressure that ends up ideally with no one  going on strike, and no one losing their employees and  having to close a workplace for a time.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for now  giving way. He had in a sense anticipated my point but,  to put it entirely neutrally, will the ballot paper if it is  not to inform the worker now have to say, "You are in  breach of your contract of employment and may lay  yourself open to dismissal outside the specified protected  period." ?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> That is a good point and one that should  be put to the Minister.     
<P>
Will the Minister of State say whether anything in  the new clause and new schedule would prevent an  employer from bringing in people on a temporary  contract to replace striking workers? In case the hon.  Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) argues that the debate  is now concentrating on employment agencies, the only  organisation that is not allowed to provide temporary  workers to an employer during industrial action is an  employment agency. I do not know whether all  employment agencies know that they are subject to that  prohibition. Will the Minister say whether, for example,  an employer will be able to take on people on a  temporary basis to keep his factory going?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Nothing in the provisions will  stop what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Minister.  
<P>
The Conservative Government consolidated  employment rights under the Employment Rights Act  1996. It runs to 200 pages, but at least all the rights are put  in one place. Problems are encountered when amending  piecemeal legislation because of all the additional  requirements that are placed on employers, trade unions  and others and all those who are interested that they come  through the minefield and do all that the law requires. Do  the Government plan to consolidate some of the  employment rights? They have said that one Act will be  in place and that a Bill will not be introduced each year.  I accept that governments try to do that, however I am  not sure that this Government will keep to that pledge.  
<P>
Given that few people work through an Act, will  millions of pounds be spent on ensuring that employers  or trade unions receive leaflets explaining their new rights  and duties? Employers will want to keep to the law as  well employees and, having made those requirements, the  last thing that we want is people ending up in litigation  simply through ignorance of legislation that has bene  passed in the House.  
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins (Staffordshire, Moorlands):</B> I should  like to say a few words about amendment (a), which  would limit protection against unfair dismissal to cases of  selective dismissal or re-engagement, allowing employers  to dismiss all workers.  
<P>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee  recognise that strikes are at a low level, and that strike  action is not taken unless union members have a  tremendous reason for doing so. Union members have to  go through a range of hoops to make strike action lawful,  and, as a few hon. Members have hinted, employees lose  substantial amounts of pay as a result of industrial action.  
<P>
<H5>11.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Although employees make the decision to strike, the  employer may provoke that decision. The hon. Member  for Daventry harked back to Red Robbo, and I would like  to hark back to the Timex dispute. In that case, the  employer cut fringe benefits they can hardly be  described as "fringe"  such as a subsidised canteen and,  more significantly, pension entitlements by 10 per cent.  A wage freeze was also implemented. The employer  sacked 320 people and, in a nasty dispute, bussed in  replacement workers. We do not want such industrial  relations under the new Labour Government.     
<P>
If it were fair to dismiss all strikers, employers could  be encouraged to adopt a macho approach to industrial  relations. Our approach is a partnership between employer  and employee. We want industrial relations to be about  negotiation and discussion of differences, rather than  about concentrating on the ultimate sanctions of strike  action and dismissal, which are available to employee and  employer respectively. The difference between those two  sanctions is that employees have to go through a range of  hoops to take lawful strike action, but, as in the Timex  dispute, employers can easily decide to dismiss all their  employees.  
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset suggested that  employees can walk away from their jobs. That may be  the case in theory, but in reality no employee can walk  away from a job when he or she has a mortgage to pay,  and a family to look after.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I was responding to an intervention.  Many employers decide to improve conditions because  their employees walk away and find other jobs. I am not  suggesting that people would leave without having  another job to go to, but employees can walk away and  take all their skills with them, which employers cannot do.  
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins:</B> I am grateful for that clarification  of the hon. Gentleman's position. When an employer does  not provide competitive wages and conditions, it is clearly  the right of the employee to walk away and seek  employment with a better employer. However, walking  away from a job is often a big decision, even when  another employer is providing better conditions, because  of the length of time that employees have spent at a firm,  seniority that they may have accrued and friendships that  they may have made.  
<P>
The Law Society argues that there may be conduct  during a strike that merits dismissal. The hon. Member for  Daventry suggested that in cases where a fire is started, or  where there is damage to the employer's property, that  would be a fair reason for dismissal. No one suggests  otherwise. However, dismissal of employees merely for  taking part in lawful industrial action should be  considered unfair.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for being  kind enough to mention my anxieties. Does she  acknowledge that the new schedule would prescribe that  that might happen when the prime, rather than the  exclusive, reason for an action was an industrial dispute?  One of the roots of our anxiety is that it might be  impossible to disentangle the individual's action from the  dispute in deciding the primary purpose of the action or  of the employer's decision to dismiss.  
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins:</B> I am not entirely clear what would  happen in such circumstances.  
<P>
It is important that Labour Members make it clear that  we want good industrial relations, so that no aspect of the  Bill encourages either side to engage in macho behaviour.  We must ensure good industrial relations, Therefore, we  must retain the hoops through which unions must jump to  ensure that they conduct industrial relations fairly. We  also expect employers to act fairly and appropriately in  the unfortunate event of a strike. The burden of proof  must be on the employer to show that the reason for  dismissal was something other than taking part in lawful  industrial action.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am keen to return to amendment (d) to  new schedule 1 and the question of the appropriate time  period. The Minister, who, sadly, for no doubt entirely  understandable and natural reasons ah, he is here. I  thought for a moment that he had left his place.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Call of duty.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I assumed that it was a call of duty or of  nature, and was not trying to impute   
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that whatever  the qualities of Ministers, when the call of nature sounds,  even a Minister cannot pretend to be deaf without  extraordinarily undesirable consequences?  
<P>
<B> Mr. Brady:</B> My hon. Friend's interventions are almost  invariably helpful, but on this occasion, I shall refrain  from pursuing that line, which, none the less, I cannot get  out of my mind.  
<P>
I am pleased that the Minister is now back in his place.  In his opening remarks, he gave insufficient attention to  the question of the appropriate time period and the  justification for the eight-week period. I am not sure  whether that time period has been plucked out of the air  or whether there is any precedent   
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We have done it scientifically.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall be intrigued to hear a deeper  discourse on the science that lay behind it when the  Minister responds.  
<P>
We do not know whether the eight-week period has a  precedent in employment law, whether the Minister has  drawn it from another source, whether the case for it was  made to him especially strongly by an outside interest  group or whether it has, as I suggested, simply been  plucked out of the air. Why eight weeks, rather than four,  or seven, or a longer period? All the arguments that  Labour Members have advanced so far lend themselves  equally strongly or perhaps even more strongly to a  longer, or even indeterminate, period. The question  whether it is appropriate that an employer be free to  dismiss an employee who acts in breach of contract is,  surely, an absolute? It does not necessarily lend itself to  a defined period of exemption.  
<P>
A case might be made for different time periods,  especially for smaller businesses. I am not keen to add  to the Bill's complexity or to increase the difficulty that  businesses may encounter in interpreting it and the  subsequent regulations, but in this instance, there is a  powerful case for a shorter period applying to smaller  businesses. I am not casting aspersions on the industrial  relations practices of ICI, Shell or any of the big  companies when I say that they can readily withstand a  dispute lasting four or eight weeks, but for a small  business, whose weekly or monthly turnover is critical,  even a short interruption in production could tip the  business over the brink into bankruptcy. A shorter period  is essential and critical in those circumstances.  
<P>
If Labour Members believe that the real motive behind  the Bill is to tip the scales in favour of employees, there  is no justification for doing that in a way that weighs more  heavily on one category of employer than on another. The  measure threatens to cause some inconvenience to the  large employer perhaps tying his hands for r a time,  changing the parameters of negotiating practices or  informing the personnel department or industrial relations  advisers about how to time their handling of a dispute.  However, for a small or medium employer, it could be  the life or death of his business.  
<P>
The balance in the negotiating position has been tipped  dramatically in the other direction. Instead of the trade  union applying pressure to an employer prior to taking  industrial action, or saying that the employees intend to  do something that may be inconvenient and costly for the  employer, the negotiators on behalf of the employees can  say, "We know this business. There may be only 40 of us  working here, but we know the business almost as well  as you do. If you lose X contract, you will go under, and  if you don't perform for six weeks, you will lose it. We  know the damage that we can do."   
<P>
The negotiating position has been entirely changed,  which again, I suspect, is an unintended consequence of  the Bill. I urge Ministers to take my argument seriously  and to accept that their proposals risk enormous damage  and destruction to smaller businesses. The Minister should  consider whether a different time period is possible for  businesses of a certain size.  
<P>
It was interesting and encouraging to hear my hon.  Friend the Member for Daventry say that less than 44 per  cent. of industrial actions last more than 30 days. On that  basis, it is hard to justify a considerably longer period  being written into the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point  about the need to take account of the special  circumstances of small businesses. Does he agree that it  is more than ever incumbent on Ministers to do so  including the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and  Industry as the Secretary of State said recently that  small businesses would be the main engine of increased  employment in the future. On their own terms, Ministers  are obliged to take account of and to respond to the logic  of my hon. Friend's remarks.     
<P>
<H5>12 noon  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The less  lavatorial intervention was infinitely more helpful than his  earlier one.  </B><P>
<P>
It is true that the Bill will be damaging to the very  businesses on which the Government depend to be the  engine of growth in employment. I shall not discuss other  clauses in the Bill, Mr. Atkinson, but it is typical of the  gamut of measures that we have been debating in recent  weeks that the sector on which the Government depend  most is precisely the sector that will be most profoundly  damaged by the Bill.  
<P>
The wider implications for the labour market and the  pattern of industrial relations go far beyond the readily  anticipated discussion of the details in the Bill. We are  debating the questing of shifting the delicate balance that  has been advanced over the years, and which most  dispassionate observers recognise has given us an  enviable industrial relations record. That balance has been  achieved with some difficulty, often with strident  opposition from the Labour party. There is a danger that  by changing the balance, that enviable record of harmony  in our industrial relations will be destroyed. Shifting the  balance may lead to an increase in levels of industrial  action and more days lost through strike action. Business  in the United Kingdom may become less competitive. I  note that the Liberal Democrats are not represented in  Committee a double call of nature, perhaps.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> To be fair to the hon. Member  for Eastleigh, he gave me a note to say that he was  preparing for tomorrow's debate on the Budget.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. Member for  Eastleigh did not give me a note as well.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Woolas:</B> He has gone to spend a penny.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the hon. Gentleman is not  here, perhaps we should return to business.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Member for Oldham, East and  Saddleworth was trying to reiterate one of the few  humorous offerings that the Prime Minister has made in  the House of Commons; he suggested that the Liberals'  penny had been spent more often than any other in  history. I do not think that he sought to lower the tone of  the proceedings.  
<P>
There has been a significant change in how businesses  can behave. They may have to constrain their operations  in disputes that have no obvious resolution. I shall not go  too far into the current situation involving the Rover  group because I know less about it than any other member  of the Committee, and I am aware of the negotiations that  are taking place. A business may agree that it must change  its working practices and that production operations and  commercial viability can be maintained only if profound  changes are made. That may in some circumstances  involve lower levels of remuneration or poorer terms and  conditions for the labour force. If a work force say  perfectly properly that they are not prepared to accept  that and a dispute arises, there is, in terms of public  policy, a need to reach some sort of resolution. That  resolution may not be in the best interest of the work  force, but it may enable a business to continue to operate  in Britain, a particular region or indeed to operate at  all and avoid bankruptcy, thereby continuing to create  and to generate economic benefits.  
<P>
The management of a business must be able to say to  a work force who refuse to accept a change in terms and  conditions that the change is none the less necessary. In  such situations, there is no more room for negotiation and  it has to be made clear to employees that if they do not  accept such a change they will have to be dismissed and  others engaged. The eight-week period is significant. In  some circumstances, the levels of skill demanded in  regard to certain types of machinery or to certain  procedures are too high. In others, the number of weeks  between the start of industrial action and dismissal could  be critical to whether management are able to train  replacement employees to a standard at which the  business could continue to operate without a lengthy  period of interruption involving loss of profits and of  turnover.  
<P>
An eight-week period particularly in regard to the  issue raised by my hon. Friends the Members for  Daventry and for Buckingham of serial industrial action  with a short period in between could allow a union or a  work force in dispute with management to engineer things  so that the management never have sufficient time to train  another workforce. That period might also prevent en  masse dismissal. I see the hon. Member for Eccles shifting  in his seat; does he want to pursue the point?

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman tell us  what he perceives the consequences of the action that he  has just described to be?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's  point, but I shall be as lucid as I can. I am describing  circumstances that are not ones that I, or I am sure he,  would want, but which occasionally arises. The hon.  Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)  mentioned the Timex dispute. I shall not go into the  details of that, but whether the employer is right or  wrong and whether we like it or not an employer may  sometimes conclude that a change in terms and conditions  is essential to the profitable operation of a business. The  choice involved may be between a work force accepting  a lower standard of terms and conditions and the closure  of a business obviously involving its removal from an  area.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> The hon. Gentleman is speaking  about the consequences of continued industrial strife and  the possibility that a business could close. Is he really  asking the Committee to accept that workers would fly in  the face of such circumstances on the majority of  occasions? In 99.9 per cent. of cases, the vast majority of  workers will act reasonably, seeking a consensus with  their employers to ensure that the company continues and  that they can continue earning a living.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman.  In his second intervention, he argues ably against his  position. The vast majority of workers would want an  amicable resolution to such a problem; that is precisely  why it is not necessary to have the protracted period of  immunity that it proposed in the Bill. If the employees  want to be conciliatory and helpful, and want to avoid a  dispute at all costs, it is hardly necessary to have an  immunity period stretching ahead for eight weeks; indeed,  four weeks, or even no time at all, might be equally  appropriate.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the  longer the period of immunity the so-called protected  period the greater the incentive the work force has to  string things along before seriously trying to resolve the  dispute?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Absolutely. Indeed, the import of an  interesting earlier exchange I think that it was between  the hon. Member for Eccles and my hon. Friend the  Member for South Dorset was that, if the Government  were to act consistently, they would want to increase the  time between a ballot taking place and action being taken.  Sensible and wise recognition has been given to the value  of allowing time for consideration.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I have done that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister says that he has done it, but  he has not done it for eight weeks. According to his  argument, it would be more logical to extend the time  for consideration to eight weeks, the new immunity being  limited to one week. If we are serious about avoiding  disputes, rather than encouraging them to stretch on for  longer periods, that would be a more logical approach.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the  reasoning of the hon. Member for Eccles is further flawed  in that, in his scenario, he assumes that employees have  Kantian-perfect information; but they often do not. It is  quite conceivable that employees, when warned that their  action could result in the closure of the company and the  loss of their employment, might think that the employer  was bluffing. Only subsequently, when the closure of the  company was announced and the employees all lost their  jobs, would it transpire that the employer was not  bluffing. The hon. Gentleman must take account of that  eventuality if he is to sustain his argument. He must  develop a response to it; hitherto, he has not done so.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right that,  during the claims and counterclaims of negotiation, the  employees often may not accept what they perceive to be  a threat from their employer but which may turn out to  be a simple statement of fact. I suspect that in the next  employment Bill, the Government may try to resolve that  problem by imposing worker directors on boards, in  which case the employees may receive rather better  information and management would have even less  power.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am reading the clause again; one can  become paranoid I am always paranoid when one is  opposing a Bill, but I wonder whether my hon. Friend has  noticed something. I may be reading it incorrectly, but it  seems that if a group of workers decided to hold a ballot  to strike and announced that they would strike on  Monday, their employer would be acting lawfully under  the new clause if he were to sack them all then and there,  so long as the strike had not begun. It is strange that that  is what is being proposed, but I am sure that the Minister  will respond to it later.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> rose   
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> It is marvellous that the debate is running  so freely and productively that hon. Members feel that  they can intervene. In a spirit of co-operation, I am  interested to hear what the hon. Member for Eccles has  to say.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving  way. The hon. Member for South Dorset is wrong in his  interpretation. Under existing tribunal law, the threat of  industrial action is not a reason for dismissal and such a  dismissal would be deemed unfair.     
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady: I am especially pleased to have given the  hon. Gentleman an opportunity to intervene. Given that  the Minister is not shaking his head or giving any sign of  disagreement, I presume that he thinks that what the hon.  Gentleman says is accurate. It was helpful of him to put  that on the record.  </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Am I right to say that the hon.  Gentleman is arguing that employers should have the  almost completely unbridled power to tell employees,  "Times are tough. The global economy is here, and we've  got to change pay and conditions or we'll go bust or make  less profit. If you don't change, we'll dismiss you all." ?  That seems to be what he is suggesting.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I  think that he gave me the status of a Privy Councillor.  Although it might only be a matter of time, I fear that it  might take longer than one might wish. However, it  prompts me to congratulate the Minister on his recent  elevation if that is the appropriate term to the Privy  Council.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman, but  that is happening tomorrow; I am working myself up to it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> In that case, I shall congratulate the  Minister on it properly on Thursday.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is not sitting  on Thursday.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> That is a source of the greatest  disappointment to me.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I extend to the Minister of State  the Official congratulation of the Opposition? Has it not  occurred to my hon. Friend that we shall not sit on  Thursday in celebration of a momentous occasion? It is  like someone awarding a half holiday at school. We are  all delighted at the Minister of State's success.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Put that way, it is appropriate. More  generally, I fear that the House is having rather too many  half holidays and spending too little time doing its work.  On this occasion it is appropriate, given that the express  purpose is to allow us to celebrate the Minister of State's  great achievement.  
<P>
Despite the importance of that matter, I am keen to  return to the point made by the hon. Member for Croydon,  Central (Mr. Davies). His understanding of my remarks  returns me to the confusion about the Government's  intentions. It is the Prime Minister who is saying that the  United Kingdom must follow the United States model and  adopt a hire-and-fire culture if we are to achieve the  growth and new employment of the United States.  
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that I believe simply  that if the law closes down too much on the freedom of  employers, managers and businesses to operate in a free  economy, the result can be negative for everyone. It can  be negative for employers, who cannot manage their  business. It can also be devastating for former employees,  who no longer have a place of work, and for others who  might in future have gone to work for that enterprise. It  should not be done through the Bill in a way that would,  in some circumstances, make it unduly difficult for a  business to re-engage a new labour force. If an employer  cannot do so when engaged in an intractable dispute with  his work force, his response may be to go elsewhere to  pull out of the United Kingdom. He might say, "I don't  want to do this any more; I don't believe that it is a  productive use of my time to run a business of this sort in  this country."  In those circumstances, everyone loses out.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> So the answer to my first  question is yes. The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing  that enlightenment is always on the side of the employer,  who should always have the whip hand and will always  know the best interests of the company and, indeed, of the  employees, and, therefore, that what he or she says goes.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman appears either not to  have been listening to what I said in response to his earlier  intervention, or not to have been able to follow it. He is  entirely wrong to draw that inference from my remarks.  
<P>
The Bill will impact in many ways on a market  economy. The hon. Gentleman must recognise that we  start from a position of balance. It may be possible to  move to another acceptable position of equilibrium that  will not lead to greater unemployment, lower productivity  or other developments that hon. Members on both sides  of the Committee would recognise as negative. However,  the Government may be risking tipping the balance in a  way that may move from the relatively positive and strong  position that we still occupy, whereby we have far better  levels of employment than our European Union I am  not sure whether we should call them partners, rivals, or  competitors; I tend to prefer the term competitors, but  others may take a different view

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend will recall that the  Secretary of State has intimated that the Bill represents  the industrial relations settlement for this Parliament.  From that observation, we are intended to infer that  Ministers do not plan a further substantial interference in  the operation of the labour market. Does my hon. Friend  agree that it is incumbent on the hon. Member for  Croydon, Central to state whether he believes that no  circumstances exist in which, in order to stay afloat,  employers would be justified in imposing different terms  and conditions on employees and, in the event that those  employees were not prepared to accept them and went on  strike, in employing an alternative work force? That is  the challenge that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central  must answer.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My hon. Friend puts his finger on the  point. As we have heard, most disputes are resolved  quickly and do not proceed to industrial action. However,  for businesses faced with the critical problem of an  intractable dispute, dealing with a serious grievance and  conflict between the employer and representatives of the  labour force, some circumstances must exist in which it  is in the interests of the British economy, at least, for the  business to continue operating, even at the expense of the  jobs of a particular group of employees.  
<P>
The Bill is instructive of the Government's attitude and  of whether their thinking on such matters really has  moved on something that I find rather questionable. We  receive conflicting messages.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give  way?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall in a little while. I wish first to  respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham.  
<P>
The question of whether it is better that employment  should be available or whether an amorphous concept of  social justice should be applied, regardless of whether  people have jobs, is absolutely at the core. I had hoped  that that matter had been resolved insofar as the  Government are taking pleasure in even taking the credit  for the current levels of employment, whereas a few  years ago if we saw growth in employment levels the then  Opposition would have said, "Ah, but it's all low-grade,  part-time jobs."  Given that the Government have taken  some pride in the employment position, the fact that there  is a large amount of part-time work and that it has been  increasing more than full-time work show their  acceptance that it is better for people to be in work than  to adhere strictly to their idea of social justice.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I cannot let this moment pass.  What does the hon. Gentleman think the new deal is  about? Why did his party oppose it so vehemently? Its  whole purpose was to get people in work and retain them  in work.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for raising  that subject. Obviously, he has no responsibility for the  new deal for lone parents, which, as the latest figures  demonstrate, is failing.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is talking about  the unfair dismissal of striking workers, not the new deal.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> There is, however, an important parallel  which, as a member of the Select Committee on  Education and Employment, I have sought to draw from  the Government's thinking. If you can bear with me for a  moment, Mr. Atkinson, I shall demonstrate that parallel.  [Interruption.] My hon. Friends are finding me amusing,  but I am making a serious point. The Minister of State  referred to the new deal for the young unemployed,  suggesting that it is indicative of the desire to see new  employment in the economy. However, the effect of  subsidising those who have been unemployed for six  months to go into jobs can be to push people out of their  current jobs or to give the economy an incentive so that  people will be employed for up to six months. The direct  parallel with the Government's argument is whether it is  better for the same people to be employed.  
<P>
You seem slightly confused, Mr. Atkinson. Perhaps I am not being as clear as I should be.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is trying  to be ingenious, but so far it is not working. We are  talking about the unfair dismissal of striking workers and  he is straying wide of that point.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Is it  not in order for my hon. Friend the Member for  Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) to refer, albeit  only parenthesis, to the new deal, given that the subject  under discussion is the Government's new deal for  striking workers?  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The answer is no.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Atkinson, for  your wise guidance and chairmanship. Even if some  Committee members do not consider that I have made my  point clearly enough, I feel that I have and I am now  ready to move on to other points of equal importance.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is dragging  out this dispute.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister is suggesting that there is  something other than a harmonious relationship between  us, which is wrong.  
<P>
The fundamental issue is the contract of employment  and whether the Bill will undermine it. I am not a  purist and I recognise that the picking and choosing  rules, to which my hon. Friend the Member for  Daventry referred earlier, constitute in themselves an  interruption of the contractual relationship. However, I  am concerned that the clause will create a far more  profound break with the ordinary contractual  relationship between employer and employee.  
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government's proposals will be damaging in  several ways. Many inequalities in the contractual  relationship already exist; some hon. Members may say  that the employer always has the whip hand and is in a  position of greater strength, but we must not forget the  already wide platform of individual employment rights  that provide implied contract terms and even up the  imbalance of power. It is therefore not possible for an  employer to break a contract with impunity simply by  saying that he will not pay employees for work that they  have done; on the other hand, employees have some  immunity if they refuse to do the work that they have  agreed to perform and for which they have been paid.  
<P>
An eight-week exemption from the normal application  of contractual responsibilities allows and, I would say,  encourages breach of contract by giving a period of  immunity that is, according to the industrial relations  statistics that we have heard, longer than necessary.  Contracts of employment are being taken away from the  parties involved and put into the Government's hands. We  are witnessing a corporatist approach.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> For how much longer does the  hon. Gentleman intend to speak? Other Committee  members may wish to contribute.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> It is coming up to the  eight-week period.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister is throwing down a  challenge, but I understand you may be able to help the  hon. Member for Croydon, Central, Mr. Atkinson,  because he clearly needs it that although we are not  sitting on Thursday, we shall sit this afternoon and that if  the hon. Gentleman wishes to make a speech, he will be  able to do so.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The only guidance that the  Chairman can give is that the sittings motion provides that  the Committee is due to sit at 4.30 today.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful Mr. Atkinson. I hope that the  hon. Member for Croydon, Central is now a little better  informed. I intend to conclude my remarks before we  break for lunch; I also hope to hear the Chancellor's  Budget statement. The hon. Gentleman will have a chance  to contribute and I shall, of course, listen to him as  intently as he is listening to me.  
<P>
Undermining employment contracts runs the risk of  undermining the Government's objectives or at least  their stated objectives on employment relations. The  United States model of employment relations in the  economy and labour market's operation would be  consistent with a more contract-dependent approach than  that adopted by the Government in the Bill. That would  be consistent with the Prime Minister's comments.  
<P>
We await the Budget statement, but the pre-information  that appeared in the media over the weekend suggested  that it would contain measures relating to employee share  ownership. Ministers suggested that it is the way forward,  because an employee who has a stake in the ownership of  a business will be more committed to it, and will see a  greater relationship between the input in terms of work  and what might be achieved in terms of benefits. I entirely  applaud that approach and hope that we see it this  afternoon. It is consistent with a contractual approach in  labour relations, and is a contract between employer and  employee, a recognition that there is a direct relationship  between what is put in by the employer, the success of  the enterprise as a whole, and the ability of that enterprise  to reward its employees.  
<P>
The new clause and new schedule will extend immunity  and so undermine the contract by sending the wrong  message. Instead of trying to improve an employment  relations environment in which there is a direct  relationship between employer and employee, the  Government are returning to the alien and unhappy  industrial relations environment of the 1970s, which we  are pleased to have left behind. In doing so, the  Government risk upsetting their declared goal of  proceeding towards a more productive and competitive  environment, and I am sure that all hon. Members would  regret that.  
<P>
The issue of the wording on the ballot paper was raised  helpfully by the hon. Member for Eccles. I spoke about  the importance of a contract of employment, and the  importance of employees and employers understanding  that they are engaged in a personal contract, one with the  other. That is fundamental to the proper and effective  operation of a business, which can be damaged by the  involvement of outside parties and of the state by undue  legal intervention. The more we concentrate on the  contract of employment, the better will employers and  employees understand the direct relationship between  them legally and economically, and that what one does  affects the interests of the other.  
<P>
In that context, the wording on the ballot paper will  have to be revised as a result of the measures that the  Government want to add to the Bill. In revising that  wording, there is an important message to be sent. As the  hon. Member for Eccles spoke, I wondered whether the  wording will be revised to advise employees that by  taking strike action they will be in breach of their contract,  but that for a period of eight weeks they would be immune  from that, or whether it will say that they will be in breach  of their contract if strike action is taken for a period of  more than eight weeks.  
<P>
Will the Minister enlighten the Committee as to what  he thinks on that important matter? It must be understood  that, regardless of immunities, there is still a breach of  contract. In taking strike action and withdrawing labour,  whether it is justified or appropriate, or good or bad for  the economy, the employee is breaching a contract of  employment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> The hon. Gentleman's suggestion  misses the point of what happens in practice. Since 1906,  employees have been in breach of contract whenever they  have gone on strike. The hon. Member for Daventry  alluded to that earlier. It is not helpful to include such  wording because it flies in the face of what happens in  reality. Since the early part of this century, most  employers the umpteenth percentage have never  considered dismissing workers who have been forced into  industrial action, so it is not necessary or appropriate to  include the hon. Gentleman's suggested wording.  
<P>
Everyone in the Committee and in the House is  working towards the motive behind the Bill, which is  conflict resolution at the earliest possible time and in the  most democratic way.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for  giving me a breather, but I am still slightly in the dark  about what he would like on the ballot paper. He seems  to be suggesting nothing.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> No. Not the hon. Gentleman's wording.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not like my  wording, so perhaps he wants to retain the existing  wording on the ballot paper. I look forward to the  enlightenment that the Minister may bring to the  Committee on that point.     
<P>
If the hon. Member for Eccles is correct that it is  possible and appropriate, within the terms of the Bill, to  leave the wording as it is, that would be welcome because,  if anything, it may be slightly stronger than the wording  that I have suggested. It will warn the person  contemplating strike action that he will be in breach of  contract. I can happily live with that because it still makes  it clear that withdrawal of labour is a breach of contract.  It probably goes further than the truth if I can put it  that way under the Bill, in giving a warning to someone  contemplating strike action that it is something that he  should be concerned about. In fact, if the Bill is enacted  in its present form, there will be an eight-week immunity  from action for breach of contract.  
<P>
If we were to leave the present wording on the ballot  paper, it would not be a reflection of the law or perhaps  it would. Again, I should welcome the Minister's  response. I wonder whether in enacting such legislation,  the Government see that as ending the position of a breach  of contract. Is a breach held not to have occurred for the  eight-week period, or is a breach held to have occurred,  but with immunity from legal action? That is an essential  point in terms of the relationship between the employer  and the employee. It is essential to understand whether  there is a direct contractual relationship and at what point  that begins and ends. I see no flicker of response from the  Minister, but I hope that he will return to the issue.  
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The "primary purpose"  rule was first referred to by my  hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. That is not strictly  how it is worded in the Bill; "principal reason"  is the term  used. I agree with my hon. Friend that that term will be  an invitation to legal conflict and uncertainty. How will  "principal reason"  be interpreted by courts and tribunals  that consider the conduct of an employer who responds to  the behaviour of an employee who has gone on strike and  done other things, either before or after striking?  
<P>
There are many other questions, such as whether it is  appropriate for an employer to take into account a  plethora of earlier misdeeds when deciding to dismiss  someone when that person takes strike action or during  the eight-week period of immunity. Will employers be  able to take into account only actions committed during  that period? Is a cut-off envisaged for the period in which  actions might be considered?  
<P>
Let us consider the case of an employee who joined a  strike. He might have already committed an offence such  as breach of contract and been given a series of  warnings although not a final warning under the  proper procedures. What is the position if his employer  decides that enough is enough? A decision may not rest  on the principal reason there might be a record of  misdemeanours, shoddy workmanship, bad attitude and  abuse to colleagues. There might be any number of factors  that in themselves could be justification for dismissal. An  employer might say, "This guy has gone on strike. He has  done all those things and I am not prepared to deal with  him any more because there is no return in it for me. He  is just costing me money and causing trouble" . Might  there not be dangers in the Bill for that employer if he  dismisses that employee?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman not  understand that his example flies in the face of good  industrial practice? Employees' misdemeanours should be  dealt with at the appropriate time and with the appropriate  disciplinary procedures and sanctions. That is good  industrial practice and a good employer or manager does  not leave such decisions to the tense time of industrial  action. That would not be right.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be right that that  would not be a good employer, but that is not to say that  such cases do not happen. I seek to consider what might  arise as a result of the Bill. If all employers were as good  as the hon. Member for Eccles suggested, we might not  be here at all and even the Government might recognise  that there was no need to interfere in the balance of  industrial relations. Unfortunately, that is not the case. It  is important to address how the principal reason test will  be measured, so will the Minister say how the test will  operate in practice? The current proposal is asking for  trouble and legal conflict.
