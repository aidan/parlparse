<P>
(Except Clauses 1, 7, 10, 11, 25, 27, 30, 75, 119 and 147) 
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we resume our proceedings, I have a brief announcement to make.
<P>
Right hon. and hon. Members will notice that a number of amendments to schedule 21 and to clauses 126, 127, 128 and 130, which appear on today's selection list as starred amendments, have been placed in square brackets. The amendments in question were properly tabled with the Clerk before the Committee rose on Tuesday night, but as a result of a fax machine failure they did not reach the printers in time to be issued yesterday. As hon. Members know, starred amendments are not usually called for debate, but in view of the technical problem, I shall treat the amendments in square brackets as if they were not starred. If they are reached, they may therefore be considered today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I apologise for removing my jacket before you gave formal permission to do so.
<P>
I have another, rather more serious, point of order. When we adjourned on Tuesday night, the Paymaster General was addressing the Committee. I note that he has disappeared from the Committee; more seriously, his speech has been removed from the relevant Hansard report. According to column 712 of it, the last recorded remark is that of Mr. Butterfill, your co-Chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody, who said "it is good to talk". However, as we remember it, the Paymaster General rose and began to respond to the debate he was on his feet and addressing the Committee when we adjourned. That speech appears not to have been printed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that the Paymaster General did not begin his speech because the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) interrupted him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> If the hon. Gentleman interrupted him, the Paymaster General must have been on his feet. He was on his feet, and he was addressing the Committee. A number of points were made during the debate to which he had begun to reply, and to which we are expecting him fully to respond. This is a serious point. If the Committee's proceedings are to be doctored, and speeches removed from the record, the matter should be put to Madam speaker.
<P>
Several hon. members rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Those hon. Members who wish to speak will be called to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Chairman's provisional selection of amendments says in respect of clause 116:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Question proposed: Mr. Robinson called".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The remarks made by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) are therefore pertinent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I stand to be corrected, but my recollection of Tuesday evening's proceedings is that the Economic Secretary had left the room by the time that the debate had progressed to clause 116, and before the Committee had adjourned. I therefore wonder how she can possibly respond to the matter. However, if I am wrong I aplogise unreservedly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I am the person who is perhaps most affected by this doctoring of Hansard, because it was my speech as recorded by Hansard to which the Paymaster General had begun to respond. However, he is not here to complete his response. Moreover, I have further points to make, to which I shall also not receive a response. That is a gross discourtesy not only to me but to the Committee and, indeed, to the House. It is a serious matter if Hansard is to be doctored in that way. There is no question in my mind but that the Paymaster General had started to reply to my points.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. In response to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), I know that I am on a diet but I have not disappeared yet. I was in the Committee. He may have missed the fact that during the Division, I managed to drop my handbag and a number of hon. Members spent some time helping me to find everything. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I was present in the Committee. I listened closely to the points that were made. The Paymaster General is involved in government business this morning. For that reason, I took great note of the points made and I have responses to Tuesday evening's debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. We have just heard the Economic Secretary say that the Paymaster General is engaged on government business. I think that you would agree, as Chairman of the most important Standing Committee, that the Finance Bill takes precedence over any other government business. Your selection list must stand. It says clearly, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) pointed out, that Mr. Robinson was called. He obviously has to respond to the debate. Otherwise, he is defying your authority as Chairman.
<P>
For the avoidance of doubt, may we refer to the taped record of the Committee? We know that our proceedings are taped for the purpose of the Official Report. That will clear up any doubts about which Minister was replying and who was on his or her feet when the Committee adjourned.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is already being done. When hon. Members raised the matter with me, I questioned exactly what had happened and the tapes are being[The Chairman]checked. My information is that the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East, who moved the adjournment, interrupted the Minister at the vital moment. Rather than argue the point, however, I should make it clear that the tapes are being checked. I shall report to the Committee in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As a matter of clarification, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not aware that there is a Standing Order for a point of clarification, but if the hon. Gentleman insists on raising a point of order with the Chair, I will listen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of order to you, Mrs. Dunwoody. As a matter of clarification, what you have said is exactly what happened. The Paymaster General was replying to my point when he was interrupted by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have made it clear that I was not present and that I will have the tapes checked. I do not wish to continue this discussion. It is clear that we need to check the tapes.
<P>
We must now come to the debate on clause 116, Question proposed, that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I thought that you said that you would adjourn the Committee until the matter was clarified.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, that is not what I was suggesting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> May I propose that the Committee does adjourn?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You may certainly propose that, but the Chair controls whether the business of the Committee shoud continue. Ministers are present and are prepared to respond to the debate. I am calling the debate because I am assuming that the debate on clause 116 is what we are dealing with this morning. In the interim, as we proceed, I am having the tapes checked on the specific point of whether the Paymaster General has in any way this is a very serious charge doctored the Official Report. We should proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am sorry to press this matter, but I now refer back to the selection of amendments, which is in your name. It says clearly that Mr. Robinson, who is the Paymaster General, has been called. If he has been called and he is not here to answer, that puts the Committee in an impossible position. I suggest that the only way to resolve this is for you to adjourn until the Paymaster General can respond to a debate that you have called on him to attend.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds) rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, the Chairman does not decide who shall or shall not respond to a debate, as the right hon. Gentleman knows. Secondly, I have called the debate on clause 116 and there are Ministers here who are prepared to take the debate forward. That is my responsibility, and I intend to fulfil it. Meanwhile, on the point of order that was raised by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen, we shall check the tapes. I have made the position clear, and I do not intend to take any more points of order on this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): On a new point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am extremely concerned about the Official Report's accuracy. It failed to report the fact that on Tuesday evening the Paymaster General had been called, and it states that the Committee adjourned accordingly
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at Ten o'clock till Thursday 11 June at half-past Ten o'clock."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My clear recollection is that we adjourned not at 10 pm but at 9.45 pm, when the vote was called in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is my responsibility to find out what happened. We have heard two totally opposing sets of memories, and we should establish the facts. The House is very well served by the Official Report, which, on the whole, fulfils its task with extreme accuracy. It is important that the tapes be checked, so that we can know exactly what happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> As I raised the original point of order, may I respond to your ruling, Mrs. Dunwoody? Two issues are being confused. The first is the discourtesy that the Paymaster General shows in not being present, which we should have raised with you anyway. The second is the substantive allegation that the Paymaster General was speaking when we adjourned on Tuesday evening, and that his speech in response to that debate has been removed from the Official Report. It is not right for us to proceed until we know whether he was speaking. May I suggest, Mrs. Dunwoody, that we have a short adjournment while that simple matter of fact is checked?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> There is considerable doubt about the accuracy of Committee members' memory of this matter, and we are checking the situation. It is for the Government rather than for me to decide which Minister should reply on their behalf. I have called clause 116, and we should make progress. I will not take any further points of order on this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> This is an abuse.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is not. I shall check the situation. It is for the Government rather than for me to decide who will reply for the Government in future debates. As to accuracy, the Official Report should record what was said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said that I would take no further points of order on this matter, and I mean that. I want no more diversions or discussions of matters that have already been debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I wish to seek your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Well, that is an original idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Would it be in order for the Committee to postpone the debate on clause 116 until a time when the Paymaster General will be able to attend?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have made it clear that the Chair does not decide who will answer for the Government. Indeed, it would be very entertaining, on occasion, if the Chairmen's Panel could nominate which member of which Front Bench spoke on which matter but that would not assist progress.
<H4><center>Clause 116</center></H4>
<H4><center>Claims for income tax purposes</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [9 June], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.43 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and good morning. I spent yesterday afternoon watching the second half of the Scotland match, but the Committee's proceedings so far are even more riveting! I am sorry that Opposition Members are so disappointed about the fact that I will reply to the debate I wonder what it is that they fear about me.
<P>
I shall respond to some of the points that were made in the debate on Tuesday evening. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) is not in his place [Interruption.] I am glad to see that he has just sprinted to his place. He ended last Tuesday's debate by telling us about his talents on the internet, for which I commend him. He raised a specific point and it is important to clear that up now, because it is germane to everything that we are discussing. He asked whether the use of electronic communication with the Revenue would meet tax deadlines. It is important to have mechanisms in place to ensure that electronic communications are properly logged. The claim will be treated as having been received on the date of the telephone call. The hon. Gentleman asked how that could be verified if it was disputed. All telephone calls to the Revenue will be recorded and a computer fingerprint will show the time at which the call came in and how it was handled. If there is a dispute about the content of a telephone call or whether it took place, the Revenue will be able to check its records.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I believe that during our debates my memory is not 100 per cent. accurate Labour Members suggested that call centres might be used to take calls. Will the hon. Lady clarify whether it is intended that these calls will be handled directly by the Revenue and taped by the Revenue, or whether they will be handled by commercial call centres and taped by them? If so, what are the implications for security.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It is my intention to come to the issue of call centres in a couple of minutes, but I want to clear up the matter raised on Tuesday by the hon. Member for Cotswold.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> We are breaking new ground in dealings between the Revenue and taxpayers. The issue is not whether a call is received but the contents of the call and the agreement reached. If a dispute subsequently arises, how will that be resolved?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I can easily answer that question. The call will be recorded, so there will be a record of it. That is not unusual in financial service businesses here and across the Atlantic. A couple of weeks ago I visited the Federal Reserve in Chicago, which has extensive means of monitoring all dealings with the public, not just in telephone calls but in banks. We need not go that far, but there will be monitoring of standards to ensure that an adequate record is kept of telephone calls.
<P>
Some hon. Gentlemen asked whether the Government wanted to do more business electronically. In a very good speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) expertly expounded on that matter. The Government aim to do as much business as possible by electronic means, and that will increase as information technology systems become more adaptable and security of IT systems becomes more advanced. Security is very important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> This is a positive discussion and a very useful one. When a communication is sent by E-mail, will proof of sending be acceptable to the Revenue if the sender's machine can produce a print-out showing that the communication was sent to the Revenue? Will that count as the Revenue having received it?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> This interesting point of whether claims can be accepted by E-mail was raised in a previous debate. At the moment, the Revenue does not intend to accept claims by E-mail because it is not confident that the mechanisms are sufficient to guarantee security. The hon. Gentleman will note that the clause is widely drafted, as is clause 117, to allow the Revenue to update its methods as IT is updated and provides more opportunities. We are all using electronic means of transmission more freely in our daily lives than we would have thought possible five years ago. It is important to ensure that we leave enough scope in the Bill to allow us to update what we are doing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge wanted to know whether the clause was one of the many that the Government had received in draft when they won the election last May. That is not the case; the initiative was taken after that.
<P>
We know from the use made by taxpayers of the self-assessment helpline and the employers' helpline how anxious people are to be able to deal with the Revenue by telephone. Until now, the only advice that the Revenue has been able to give over the telephone, in response to the 40 million calls that it receives each year has been that callers should fill in a form or write in if they want to make a claim in relation to allowances or expenses, or even to notify the Revenue of a change of address or a change to the figures in their tax returns. With 40 million calls a year to the Revenue, we know that there is a demand, which is hampered by the requirement to ask callers to fill in a form. So we are giving the Revenue the opportunity to deal with such matters over the telephone to make it easier for the taxpayer.[Mrs. Liddell]
<P>
The clause would facilitate the setting up of an experimental call centre in Scotland to deal with the affairs of 2 million employees and pensioners of Scottish-based businesses. In reply to the specific intervention of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, I can tell him that those calls will be handled by Revenue staff. I hope that that clears up any anxieties that he may have. On behalf of some rather disappointed Scots this morning, I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley that his generous comments about Scottish accents have been noted, and we are grateful for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Without wishing to disparage the Revenue's current performance in replying to correspondence, we all know that it falls somewhat short of what the Government and taxpayers would like. Does the Economic Secretary intend to set targets for the time within which calls are answered within six rings, for example as many businesses do? Otherwise, I can envisage armies of disconsolate taxpayers holding on the telephone line for many minutes without receiving a reply.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am continually frustrated by the message that one often receives when telephoning that the caller knows that I am waiting and will eventually answer the call. Unfortunately, I have the serious problem of two teenage children, who seem to be incapable of listening to the bleep on the telephone that tells them to hang up and shut up.
<P>
I can tell the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that technology will be introduced to allow callers to wait in a queue for a short time. That is common technology in the many call centres that now operate in all sorts of environments. The Revenue is aware of people's anxieties about not receiving prompt attention. That is one of the main reasons for introducing the clause.
<P>
The experimental call centre will open for business in the summer and will build up a range of services between now and April next year. That Scottish call centre will enable us to test the demand to do business by telephone, and to decide in the light of that whether the use of call centres should be extended across the United Kingdom. That is why the clause is widely drawn.
<P>
I believe that there will be demand from the public for access to the Revenue via the internet, but we must ensure that the necessary security is guaranteed. Well before the call centre opens, the Revenue will publish details of the telephone services that will be availabe in the centre, as well as in other Revenue offices, including services that will be available as a result of the clause. We hope that it will be possible to build up a much wider range of services, so that the Revenue will become more customer friendly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am fascinated by what the Economic Secretary has said. Will she give us a commitment that, when the pilot takes place in Scotland, the waiting times endured by callers will be recorded and made public at the end of the trial period?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It is up to the management to decide what technology should be introduced and how the call centre should be managed. Lessons must be learnt from the piloting of the call centre, as we must ensure that the technology is up to the job. As a Minister, I shall be anxious as will the Financial Secretary to ensure that targets are being met. They are met in other parts of the financial services industry and in the general retail industry. An extensive range of shopping is now available through direct telephone access. Rapid response is key to that development.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I share an ambition to ensure that the Revenue is kept on its toes in relation to the time that it takes to answer such calls. As soon as more details of the pilot's operation are available, we will be able to determine what targets can be set. The Revenue will be asked to respond to its success or failure in meeting those targets, which is good and sensible management. The pilot will allow us to gauge public demand for different kinds of services, and enable us to decide on a national strategy for telephone business.
<P>
The clause is exciting; it brings the work of the Revenue and the Government up to date with developments in the wider world.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have two points. First, I have visited a modern call centre selling direct insurance, at which I saw a computer printout showing exactly how long each caller had been waiting. The Revenue should be able to have a similar facility. Secondly, at our previous sitting I asked the Paymaster General what information would be made available by the Revenue on the internet. In particular, I asked whether draft secondary legislation and notes on new Revenue practice, which would be helpful to practitioners, would be available and regularly updated on the internet.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It is already possible to access that kind of information on the internet via the Revenue site. The Bill is also on the internet, although it is available through the House of Commons internet site rather than the Revenue site. Practitioners can already access regulations through the internet, which is a welcome development as it provides a rapid method of access. I hope that that will result in people's accounts being handled more rapidly. Paying taxes is never easy, but it should be as trouble-free and painless as possible. That is the intention behind the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Economic Secretary did not answer the specific question that I asked the Paymaster General. Will not the provisions of clause 116, which we all understand and I suspect that we all support, have to be written into the general body of legislation? As new media develop, legislation of any vintage that requires information to be put in writing will have to be subject to a general provision stipulating that electronic means of transferring information can fulfil that requirement.
<P>
I did not disparage the Bill in that respect, but I asked the Paymaster General whether piecemeal reference in individual statutes to the use of modern telecommunications methods and especially E-mail was the best way forward. Would it not be preferable to make a general legislative provision which stipulated that wherever a statute specified that information must be put in writing, E-mail transfer of that information was considered acceptable? I asked the Paymaster General whether the Government were considering such a proposal, and whether he could comment on it. I realise that he might not have been able to comment on Tuesday evening. I hoped, however, that he would since have taken the necessary advice to update us on the Government's general proposals for incorporating electronic media in the day-to-day business of government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The Government have made great strides in advancing the use of electronic media. Ministers are not necessarily wildly enthusiastic about some of those, such as electronic red boxes. There is a maximum number of papers that physical red boxes can contain, so my heart stopped beating at the thought of an electronic red box, which could contain an unlimited number of documents. So although one is very proud of the work done by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, aided by the Ministry of Defence, in constructing such equipment, I suspect that it will be another method of torture for Ministers.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the overall issue, the Government are anxious to move on as information technology permits. Various Departments are looking into better ways to make resources available to the public, especially electronic means. At the Treasury, we see an opportunity to move rapidly to introduce a means to give the 40 million callers to the Inland Revenue a much better service. That is the intention behind the clause, but I have no doubt that, over time, the pace of electronic advance will become even faster. The introduction of websites for almost every Department must be welcomed. The issue of whether enabling legislation to deal with electronic matters is the right way forward could more adequately be dealt with through the usual channels.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 116 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 117 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 118</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rate of CGT for trustees etc</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 107, line 37, after "settlement" insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"other than a settlement to which paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Act applies".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 75, in page 107, line 38, after "person" insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"other than for a year of assessment to which section 3(7) of this Act applies".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The clause is designed to attack tax avoidance and, in that respect, it has some merit. However, it will hit those whom it was not designed to hit.
<P>
At present, the capital gains realised by trustees in possession under a UK trust and persnal representatives of deceased persons are charged to tax at the basic rate of income tax, currently 23 per cent. That remains the case, even though beneficiaries under the trust may be top-rate taxpayers, although the tax on capital gains charged to personal representatives or trustees in possession will be only at the basic rate. There is evidence that that differential is being exploited by those who set up trusts to allow higher rate tax beneficaries to avoid the marginal rate of capital gains tax.
<P>
The clause will introduce a new uniform rate of capital gains tax of 34 per cent., which will apply to all UK trusts and personal representatives of the estates of deceased persons. The problem arises in relation to the small estates of testators or deceased persons, which would never, throughout the lifetime of that person, have been liable to as high a tax rate as 34 per cent. Many of those people will have been basic rate taxpayers. However, as a result of the clause, there will be the palpable injustice that, in the year of administration after death, capital gains will be chargeable at the full rate of 34 per cent.
<P>
To counter that perceived unfairness, we have tabled amendment No. 75, which would exempt from the new 34 per cent. uniform rate those estates that would usually be able to take advantage of an annual exemption. Section 3(7) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 sets out the period of exemption as being the year of administration and two years thereafter. We suggest that the 34 per cent. rate should not operate in that period. The 23 per cent. rate should remain operative for estates.
<P>
Amendment No. 74 relates to settlement trusts for disabled people and those who are in receipt of attendance allowance or disability living allowance. It would give relief to those trusts that are obviously not vehicles for tax avoidance.
<P>
The two amendments are sensible. They strike out in the direction of fairness, which the Government should find acceptable, and would enable the government to secure their objective of penalising trusts that have been set up for tax avoidance and that allow more relief than the Government believe should be available to higher-rate taxpayers, while giving sensible protection to those who should not be attacked by this otherwise worthy clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I support my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), who clearly put the case for the amendments. The Government must demonstrate whether they believe in the principle of neutrality when dealing with trusts. As my hon. Friend said, many trusts have nothing to do with tax avoidance. If there is a principle that the taxation of trusts is comparable to the taxation of indivduals, there will be no incentive for anyone to regard trusts as tax-avoidance vehicles.
<P>
It is unlikely that those who receive disability living allowance face a tax rate above the basic rate. It is not only a matter of public policy that trusts and their beneficiaries should have their gains taxed at the basic rate and not at the higher rate, but unjust that their gains[Mr. Nick St. Aubyn]should be taxed at the higher rate when their other income is taxed at the lower rate.
<P>
The clause will impose an unfair penality on estates, that are distributed slowly. If the executors of an estate are quick off the mark and manage to distribute all the assets to the beneficiaries in a matter of months, many of those beneficiaries will be liable to tax only at the basic rate. Any subsequent uplift in the value of the assets that were distributed will suffer tax only at the basic rate. If the administrators of an estate are dilatory and, during the full two years that it takes them to distribute the assets, the value of those assets increases significantly, the increase in value will be taxed at the higher rate, even if the individual who left the estate and its beneficiaries have always paid tax at the basic rate. The current provisions recognise that, because estates receive full annual exemption from capital gains tax during the first two years, estates administation is a special case. It is therefore quite incongruous that they are not to be liable to tax at the basic rate only.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Are you intending to have a stand part debate on clause 118, Mrs. Dunwoody? I have an important point to make in respect of the clause that is not germane to the amendment. Will you allow me to talk on the generality of the clause?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> So far, the debate on the amendment has been very precise. I therefore see no reason not to have a clause stand part debate, depending on the conduct of hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall therefore let others speak to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I hope not to wreck the chances of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) in that respect, but I wish to speak to both the amendments.
<P>
The Government are suffering from a form of tax prejudice they seem to think that all trusts inevitably involve some form of tax avoidance. I feel sure that the absentee Paymaster General would not take that view, given his own interests. It is a shame that he is not here today to reply to that. I am happy that the Economic Secretary, in her dazzling splendour, is here to reply to us. She looks even more colourful than the Paymaster General generally does.
<P>
Many trusts exist for those on modest incomes. If it were not for their age, infirmity or youth, that capital would go directly to the beneficiaries, who would be taxed at 23 per cent. or even less. However, all such trusts will be taxed at 34 per cent. Many such beneficiaries will therefore be penalised, purely to ensure that a higher rate exists for more affluent trust beneficiaries. That is an unfairness that amendment No. 74 seeks in particular to counter.
<P>
The clause will impose a 34 per cent. rate upon those beneficiaries who hitherto have been liable to income tax or to CGT at no more than the basic rate. Trusts arise from events, not from long-term planning. A life interest trust may arise in response to a person's old age or infirmity. Orphan trusts may arise when minors are sole beneficiaries of a trust following the death of an employee. Maintenance trusts may arise from a divorce settlement. Trusts may also arise to ensure a succession, to control family assets, or to protect the profligate.
<P>
As my hon. Friends have mentioned, trusts may also arise in order to provide for disabled people who have made personal injury claims. Such cases are at the heart of the amendment. However, all beneficiaries of such trusts, and indeed the trusts themselves, will be disadvantaged for the sake of mathematical averaging. Yet again we have a case of harmonisation without real purpose harmonisation without thinking through the consequences for all trusts and beneficiaries whom the measure will affect.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds has said, the new rate will be imposed despite beneficiaries' underlying tax rate. Amendment No. 74 seeks to ensure that the basic rate would continue to apply to trusts where the beneficiary falls below the lower rate threshold and has little or no income during the year of assessment.
<P>
We should also note that the clause will rub salt in the wounds of those who have been disadvantaged already by the removal of advance corporation tax on a small portfolio of shares. That matter was the subject of debate some time ago. Not only are the less well-off losing the tax advantage of owning a small number of shares, but they will lose out by suffering a higher rate of tax if they are beneficiaries of a trust as a result of any of the circumstances that I have already mentioned. Essentially, the clause forces trustees into making potentially expensive changes, not only in the case of acting in the best investment interests of the underlying beneficiaries in fulfilling their trustee duties.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On amendment No. 75, there is some logic in imposing a uniform rate of CGT on settled property, but to impose the rate of 34 per cent. on the estate of someone who was never liable, during his lifetime, to income tax or CGT at more than the basic rate is certainly harsh. It is often not possible to avoid realising gains in the administration of an estate because all sorts of costs may need to be raised. So it is especially harsh that the measure will be imposed on estates that are currently in the course of administration, as from 6 April 1998. It is especially unfair to trusts that have been able in the past to use holdover provisions, which are not available to life-interest trusts. Although it is beyond the scope of the amendment, there is a good case for the extension of holdover relief to all trust terminations.
<P>
It is fair that, in the year following death, such trusts should be taxed at the basic rate until the end of the period of administration, after which they will be treated as trusts and will qualify for trust exemptions in their own right. Both amendments have much merit. I hope that the Government do not intend to disadvantage trusts that are set up specifically for the purpose of helping people who are less well off, and who also find themselves less well off physically and need special arrangements to be made for them. Without giving away much additional tax relief, the amendments go to the heart of the problem of those most in need.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have had an interesting debate. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said that this was a worthy clause, which it is. Its purpose is to produce a rational rate structure and to make the charge to capital gains tax more fair by setting the tax at a level that reflects the various rates that would have applied if the gains had arisen directly to the beneficiaries of trusts or estates.
<P>
On Second Reading, the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) referred to the complexity of CGT and the need to try to introduce a more coherent and rational structure to the benefit of everyone. We are pursuing that objective of creating a more rational rate structure for CGT. Under this approach of taxing a gain at one rate, it is inevitable that some people will be advantaged and others disadvantaged. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) said, in the case of some trusts, if the rates at which the beneficiaries were taxed was ascertainable, the trustees would be charged at 23 per cent. However, the other side of the coin is that others would be taxed at 40 per cent. In view of that inequity, we feel that we must act to rationalise the structure. Indeed, it would be impossible to trace the gains through to the beneficiaries who might eventually receive them, so it would be difficult to say how many would be taxed at 40 per cent. and how many at 23 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Does the Economic Secretary admit that those trusts that have been taxed at 40 per cent., which will be advantaged, will be those that are rather better off, and that the beneficiaries will pay the higher rate of tax? Again, the Government are helping the better off with a broad-brush provision, which will disadvantage the least well-off in the circumstances that I have described.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> In the interests of coherence, I shall come to that point later because the matter is complicated and we shall complicate it even further if we jump in and out of it. I shall return to the point about the impact of the clause on those in possession of small trusts.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham attempted to arouse our natural sympathies with the disabled and the executors of diseased persons' estates, which is perfectly acceptable and understandable. I should, however, draw his attention to the fact that advantages are already built into the CGT system for people and trusts in those categories. The amendments' structure implicitly acknowledges that.
<P>
Trust for disabled people receive a full annual exempt amount to set against their gains in any year rather than half the annual exempt amount that is available to trusts generally. That is specifically to help trusts that are set up to assist the disabled. The first £6,800 rather than £3,400 of those trusts' gains for this year will be exempt.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is fully accepted that such trusts get the full annual exemptions I made the point myself. One has, however, to ask whey they get it. They get it because it is assumed accurately in almost all cases that they have no other assets on which they will enjoy an annual exemption. That is why it is equitable for them to have the full exemption and for only the basic rate of tax to apply above that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We may be talking at cross purposes. The intention in the clause is to rationalise the structure while bearing in mind that exemptions exist. We must also consider the issue that was raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham of the important issues with which those who possess small trusts must deal.
<P>
I must make it explicit that there is no proposal to change any of the annual exemptions that apply to the recipients of trusts that are specifically set up for the disabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> For the benefit of the Committee, will the Economic Secretary outline some of the reliefs and exemptions to which she referred in relation to trusts for the disabled and those who draw attendance allowance?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I referred to some of the exemptions in my reply to the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. Trusts for disabled people receive a full annual exempt amount to set against their gains in any year rather than half the annual exempt amount that is available to trusts generally. That means that the first £6,800 rather than £3,400 of their gains for the year will be exempt.
<P>
I want now to talk about the personal representatives of estates. They receive a full annual exemption for the year of death and for the two following years. There is no proposal to change those arrangements. Hon. Gentlemen referred to assets that increase substantially in value following the death of the person who held them. If assets increase substantially in value, it is not right that taxation should mirror the rate of that increase? The clause specifically takes that rate into account.
<P>
Also on the subject of the personal representative of the estates, there is a tax-free uplift to market value at the date of death.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> That is no concession. We all know that such estates invariably suffer inheritance tax. The only reason why there has always been a free uplift at the date of death is to avoid double taxation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> My purpose was not to make concessions or to suggest that there were additional concessions, but to explain the situation. It is understandable for members of the Committee to be concerned about trusts that relate to disabled people and the personal representatives of estates. It is essential that we get the facts straight on the table so that people are not worried and do not assume that they will hit a more regressive taxation regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I fear that when the Economic Secretary says that we are talking at cross purposes, it is she who is at cross purposes with the original intention of the legislation. Will she explain why she believes that a full annual exemption was given to disabled people's[Mr. St. Aubyn]trusts? Why does she believe that a full annual exemption was given to the estates of deceased persons?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I should have thought that that was pretty obvious. It was given because of the wish of Governments of both colours to protect people for whom trusts are set up specifically to assist in a time of hardship. The hon. Gentleman is trying to imply that they will be in some way adversely affected because we will remove current exemptions. We are not going to remove those exemptions. That is the point that I am making about the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Both sides of the House supported the exemptions because of one principle. Each case involves an individual who in other circumstances would have enjoyed a personal annual exemption the deceased or disabled person. In each case the assets are transferred in full to what is now, in effect, a trust. The principle is that the full annual exemption should continue because that is what such people would have enjoyed as individuals. If that is the guiding principle then, also as a matter of principle, tax should apply at the basic rate, as it would have done to individuals before their death or disability triggered the trust.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> At the beginning, I paid tribute to the comments made by the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) about the complexity of the capital gains tax legislation. As I said, our aim is to structure capital gains tax legislation in a more rational way. I made that point at the beginning. Some trusts will find themselves paying tax at 23 per cent., while others will pay tax at 40 per cent.
<P>
As such complexity exists in relation to the full annual exempt allowances, it is in the interests of taxpayers, both generally and specifically, for a more rational structure to come into play. In respect of personal representatives of estates, I said that there is a tax-free uplift to market value at the date of death. The beneficiaries of an estate therefore acquire the assets of the deceased at that value, not at an historic value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> So what?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Am I to assume that the hon. Gentleman wishes to change the taxation structure so that the historic value applies? That would hit recipients of trusts who are disabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> That was not my point, as the hon. Lady knows full well. The argument is about gains that arise in a period of administration. For her to say that there is basically zero basing upon a testator's death is just to tell us something that we have known for many years and which has been the status quo for a very long time. That is not the point that we seek to make.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> My point is that the Government have tried to rationalise the structure. The amendments fail to recognise some of the reasons why a more rational structure is needed. I have said before that trusts are liable to face a wide range of possible taxation rates. Not every one of them would face the lower rate of 23 per cent. Some would face a rate of 40 per cent. Any gains that personal representatives realise during the administration of the estate will reflect in the increase in value of the assets only from the value at the time of death. Few personal representatives realise capital gains, which, when they arise, tend to be rather modest. That takes into account the point made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about a possible incentive for personal representatives to go slow in settling people's estates.
<P>
I believe that the Law Society is encouraging the idea that the gains relating to deceased persons' estates in the year of death and two subsequent years should be taxed at 23 per cent. I understand why it is making that point. The personal representatives of an estate are currently entitled to the full annual exempt amount for the year of death and the two subsequent years. It should, however, be remembered that only an increase in value from the value at the time of death is brought into the charge. Given that fact, and given the availability of the annual exempt amount, I do not see any good reason for introducing a further complication into a system that we are trying to simplify.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also talked about the penalties for those who have a small interest in trusts. The uniform rate is intended to reflect the various rates at which the beneficiaries would have charged on their capital gains had those gains arisen to them directly. It is true that some beneficiaries would have been taxed at 23 per cent. or perhaps even 20 per cent. while others would have been taxed at 40 per cent. It is inevitable that when we try to take a rationalising approach, some will gain and some will lose; I make no apologies for that. It is not possible to align the trustees' rate directly with the rates at which the trust's beneficiaries would have been charged. That is why we have had to adopt a single rate.
<P>
Even without the tax advantages that are already built into the system of capital gains tax, I would be against introducing additional complexity into a system that is generally recognised as being extremely complex. A uniform rate of 34 per cent. for all trusts and estates is not only right in principle; it is the kind of simplification that practitioners have been looking for, as is recognised across the House. I advise the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. An hour ago I alleged that the Government had doctored Hansard. Are you yet in a position to report on that allegation, or can you say when you will be able to do so? It relates to our consideration of the Bill. I wonder how long the investigations will take.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not yet in a position to give a response to the Committee, but I expect to be able to do so by this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I understand that the tape has been listened to and that it confirms that the Paymaster General was speaking at the conclusion of our previous sitting. It is therefore more than just a monstrous discourtesy that he should absent himself from the Committee. Perhaps it is connected to the fact that we are about to deal with matters of direct interest to him: offshore trusts and tax avoidance. We thus have a motive for this crime, as well as the evidence.
<P>
I am raising a point of order to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, because this is a matter of urgency. We are still near the clause on which the Paymaster General should have replied. The further we get through the Bill, the more irrelevant the matter may become, but it is of extreme concern in this morning's debate because matters relating to that clause are still under discussion and fresh in the minds of Committee members.
<P>
Given that the evidence is available and confirms all the points of order that Conservative Members made, I ask you, Mrs. Dunwoody, to reconsider what you have just said and perhaps to accelerate further investigation. We want a full explanation of why the Official Report, which is entirely independent, should apparently have been doctored at the request of a Government Minister.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I make it clear that I am happy to report 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): That is outrageous.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will be happy to report to the Committee as soon as I have the information. It is not available to me at the moment, but as soon as it is, I shall inform the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. It has been asserted that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General has committed a crime and that he personally doctored Hansard.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not prepared to allow that. I am responsible for the good order of the Committee. I have listened carefully to the points of order. It is my intention that when information becomes available it will be reported to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am on my feet. Until then, unless there is another specific point of order, I do not intend to allow this to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Can you advise the Committee about what process of investigation will be necessary before you are able to report to hon. Members?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am informed that the tapes and transcripts are being checked. The results will be brought back to the Committee at the earliest possible moment. I have no vested interest in hiding the accurate information from the Committee. It is a very serious charge to claim that any Member of Parliament has sought to alter the official record in any way. I am therefore having the matter investigated and I have made it clear that I will report to the Committee when the occasion arises.
<P>
I call Mr. Ruffley.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Does my hon. Friend wish to speak?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall select the speakers, Mr. Ruffley.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> As you always do with technical style, charm and grace, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>  And as I shall continue to do: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Conservative Members found the Economic Secretary's remarks unconvincing. Her chief line of attack appeared to be that gains realised by trusts or by the personal representatives of estates will be so small as to be covered almost automatically by the annual exemption. She reminded the Committee that the assets of an estate are zero-based for capital gains tax calculations, but that is not pertinent to these two modest amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 74 would permit those in receipt of attendance allowance or disability living allowance to get some relief from what will be a more penal rate than at present. Amendment No. 75 should be welcomed by the Treasury, as it targets trusts that would be exempt from the higher rate for three years, thus preventing trustees from spinning out an administration to take advantage of a lower rate. The amendment would impose a three-year time limit by tracking the language of section 3(7) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. That focused proposal would prevent abuse or avoidance in the future.
<P>
The Economic Secretary has not responded to those modest amendments adequately, and we shall press them to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that Mr. Ruffley has moved the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I think that he intends to press the amendment to a vote in due course, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Very well.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We have heard a rather disappointing speech from the Economic Secretary. We are not disappointed in her personally, although we should have preferred to see the Paymaster General alongside her today, as he has much expertise in these matters. However, we were disappointed in what the Economic Secretary said, which no doubt came from her officials.
<P>
Conservative Members are worried that the Inland Revenue is dictating the Government's agenda when it comes to so-called tidying up measures. That suggests that there is no principle involved other than that of grabbing as much tax, as quickly as possible, for the coffers of the Inland Revenue.
<P>
The only principle that was prayed in aid for defeating the amendments was simplicity. That is a very dangerous principle on which to hang an argument about taxation, because, as in this case, it invariably hits hardest those who are least able to afford it. It would be simple to have a single tax rate of 33 per cent. instead of a lower rate and a higher rate, but it would be most unfair on those on a lower income or with smaller gains.[Mr. St. Aubyn]It would be simple to have no annual exemption for capital gains tax, but it would discourage smaller investors whom the Government claim that they want to help from getting involved in the stock market.
<P>
The doctrine of simplicity should be treated with caution. It is a bad doctrine to use in respect of disabled people. The Bill runs to 400 pages, to be backed up by countless pages of regulations. There is nothing simple about the legislation that we have been discussing in the past few weeks. The Economic Secretary has picked up the concept, and is trying to run with it, purely as a matter of convenience. That is harsh on the disabled. The doctrine of simplicity, which has been used nowhere else in support of the Bill, is being employed just where it hurts the interests of some of the weakest and least advantaged members of society. There is a far better principle that should have applied to the Government's considerations throughout the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is still debating specific amendments. The hon. Gentleman will be able to make the points that he is seeking to make if there is a clause stand part debate. If members of the Committee tip over into general speeches on the content of the clause, they obviate the necessity for a clause stand part debate. I hope that hon. Members will behave sensibly in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am conscious of that, Mrs. Dunwoody. However, the argument about simplicity, as opposed to neutrality, goes to the heart of the amendments.
<P>
The argument for neutrality is that the treatment of assets should not depend on whether or not they are in a trust. As I explained earlier in my intervention in the speech of the Economic Secretary, the neutral approach respects the disabled persons' personal circumstances where they have, in effect, given up their personal allowance and their personal tax rates as those would apply to the assets that are to be put in trust for them. Their personal situation, for entirely non-tax reasons, can be protected. If that principle of neutrality means that the disabled persons' trusts have a full annual allowance, and that is the only justification for their having that full allowance, the clear corollary is that they should have a full basic rate application of tax before they have to suffer a higher rate. Disabled people are very unlikely to be higher-rate taxpayers. A tax rate for their trusts based on the mean of the higher and lower rates is, therefore, especially unfair. Disabled people will suffer a double whammy, first because their assets are in a trust and not available to them as individuals, and secondly because they are taxed at the higher rate.
<P>
The same principle applies to the estates of the deceased. Until the person died, he or she enjoyed, every year, a full, personal CGT exemption. It is reasonable that that full exemption should continue for two years after death. It is thus also reasonable that people's gains after death should be taxed at the basic rate too. That clear principle should apply.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
To argue that the assets are uprated at death is a red herring, because that is to offset the application of inheritance tax. Inheritance tax will, in any event, be applied to estates at 40 per cent. and it will be unreasonable for them to have to suffer capital gains tax too. One could postulate an even more complex, but arguably more just, system for such estates which would take account of the uprating in the value of the assets to their market value at death and the extent to which inheritance tax applied to the estate. That is very complex indeed, but the thrust of the previous approach was that the matter should be treated as if the assets were still in the hands of the individuals and, therefore, that tax should be assessed at the basic rate, which in most circumstances would have applied to the estate.
<P>
We hear time and again that 98 per cent. of estates believe that that was the figure quoted earlier are below the inheritance tax threshold. That implies that 98 per cent. of those estates had income which would attract only the basic rate of tax. Therefore, in 98 per cent. of the cases that will now suffer the higher rate of tax, a clear penalty will be imposed as a result of the individual involved having died, and possibly because it may have taken some time before the assets of that estate were distributed to another group of individuals who were also, by and large, subject only to the basic rate of tax.

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman get a degree in mathematics? I cannot understand his preposterous extrapolation.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have to confess that I did not get a degree in mathematics. If the hon. Gentleman finds what I say preposterous, perhaps he will explain why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee. It gainsays the fact that there are different returns on different investments 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This may be a good moment for me to point out that as this has been a very general discussion, I do not intend to allow a clause stand part debate. Those who want to catch my eye later may wish to continue the debate on these amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have been careful to argue the cases for the disabled person and for the deceased person, both of which raise wider principles. The wider principles behind the exemptions that they have previously enjoyed will be consistent, as the Government have said that they have no intention of changing their approach.
<P>
I apologise that it has taken so long to explain the details. If it is your intention not to have a clause stand part debate, Mrs. Dunwoody, I could make other points now. I shall complete my remarks and wait for the Economic Secretary to respond to them; until now she has failed to do so. The argument for simplicity is dangerous and damages the interests of those who are least able to help themselves.
<P>
In reply to the point raised by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, surely it is always the case with a broad statement that some people are affected in one way and some are affected in other ways. In such a large group in which so many estates are below the threshold and we may assume that the income will be below the threshold, that was a fair statement to make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I can only repeat those famous words of Shakespeare that the hon. Gentleman
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"doth protest too much, methinks."
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that I have the Economic Secretary's attention.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> It is upsetting that the clause, which is a broadly sensible, anti-avoidance measure, will have an impact on the poorest and those who are least able to pay. We have seen that time and again during our proceedings. That is unfair and we cannot support the clause as drafted.
<P>
I have one constructive suggestion in connection with section 260 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which covers holdover relief. It has been argued that holdover relief should not be available to interest in possession trusts, largely because they have favourable capital gains tax treatment. That is in contrast with discretionary trusts and accumulation and maintenance trusts, which are most sophisticated. They have suffered higher rates of capital gains tax at 34 per cent., but they have the holdover option not only on a transfer into the trust but on a transfer or distribution in specie out of the trust or in cash, but that does not attract capital tax.
<P>
I am aware of the inheritance tax consequences of such transfers. As has been said, interest in possession settlements is often used by middle and lower-income Britain to protect the interests of disabled people. They are transparent trusts and transparent settlements. They are not vehicles for tax avoidance. I hope that the Government will allow the option of holdover relief for distributions into and out of interest in possession settlements.
<P>
I should like to dispel one or two myths. If the settlor settles upon himself for tax avoidance purposes and then makes the disposal, inheritance tax will be neutral, but if he does that with a view to avoiding 6 per cent. tax that is, 40 per cent. less 34 per cent. he will not achieve his aim because he will be squarely caught by the provisions of, I believe, section 77 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. If the settlor, again with the aim of avoiding 6 per cent. taxation, settles on his child or children in interest in possession trusts, again in an endeavour to avoid 6 per cent. tax, the settlor not only walks into a charge to inheritance tax, but is likely to have the entire transaction unravelled on the Ramsay principle a preordained series of transactions. [Interruption.] Have the Minister's officials finished discussing that?
<P>
According to the Inland Revenue, the 34 per cent. rate is the average capital gains tax rate in the UK. Simple, unsophisticated interest in possession trusts is frequently used not for tax avoidance purposes by middle-income Britain. As has been said before, that is a useful vehicle for protecting the interests of the disabled and protective trusts before any event transfers them into the discretionary trust regime. Why should they not have the same holdover relief advantages that are currently accorded to the more sophisticated accumulation and maintenance trusts and discretionary trusts? Those trusts benefit from holdover relief and, in the circumstances that will prevail in which the interest in possession trusts capital gains tax rate will be the same as that for accumulation and maintenance trusts and discretionary trusts why should there be discrimination against the simple, unsophisticated trusts?
<P>
I want to dispel a further myth. This is not relief on a disposal for cash and value. This is only a transfer in specie or in kind into trust and out of trust value money is not created in such circumstances.
<P>
I hope that the Government will consider granting holding relief in these circumstances. It would give a measure of relief and comfort to people who are not at the rich end of the scale and not seeking to avoid taxation.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This might be a good moment to tell the Committee what my inquiries have revealed. As has happened on other occasions, Hansard did not record the very first words of the Paymaster General, which were merely introductory. If it helps the Committee, I can reveal that those words were:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I have no intention of talking this Bill out this evening. I would respond in the good humour that has been shown on both sides of the Committee by saying that the Inland Revenue, as well as the Government as a whole".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was then interrupted by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East. To make the Paymaster General's contribution at that point clear, we will insist Hansard will do so automatically that those words are added to the record of today's proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am most grateful for your prompt reply, Mrs. Dunwoody, to the allegations that were made and have now been substantiated. It is clear that the Paymaster General had begun his speech. Two further points therefore arise. First, who was responsible for the decision to excise those words? Was it Hansard alone, or did it do so under instruction? Secondly, how is the Paymaster General excused from completing a speech that he has begun?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If I might take the second point first, the hon. Gentleman knows that it is common for hon. Members to start speeches and if they are not present for another hon. Member to be called to speak at the next sitting of the Committee. That is not a new development; it happens often. There was no attempt to "doctor" the record by anyone. Hansard made the decision, which was perfectly straightforward and not that unusual. The remarks, as I have made clear, were introductory. I hope that hon. Members will not look for a plot where none existed. The situation has now been made perfectly clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, you have helpfully reported that the Paymaster General said more than a few words. He was beginning to respond to the debate, as he should do. The selection list confirms the fact that he had been called. However, he failed to turn[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]up to deliver the rest of his speech. It appears that that is not unconnected with the fact that the matters to be debated today are of personal embarrassment to him. He has a motive but not an excuse for his behaviour. I can think of no other occasion in which a Minister failed to complete a speech on which he had embarked in response to points that had been made specifically to him.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
My point of order for you, Mrs. Dunwoody, is that we need more of an explanation of the circumstances in which the oversight or mistake was made, as well as of the fact that it was made. I have full confidence in Hansard reporters, who, in my experience, always faithfully reproduce the words that they hear. One explanation is that a mistake occurred because a transcriber failed to hear the words on the tape. However, if what occurred was suggested by anyone to Hansard reporters whether by way of request, suggestion or instruction the Committee is entitled to a further explanation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have made it clear that the Hansard editors have been consulted, that the tape has been examined and that nothing untoward happened. Mr. Geoffrey Robinson's remarks will be added to the Official Report of today's proceedings. There was no suggestion of an attempt by any Committee member to get words removed from the Official Report [Interruption.] No attempt was made to get any words removed. Hansard made it very clear that this was something which, I am sure, they did inadvertently, and it will be easily repaired by adding the Paymaster General's remarks to today's Official Report. It is clear that nothing untoward occurred in this case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. If the Paymaster General's words had appeared in Tuesday's Official Report, would it have been in order for him not to be here today to continue the debate?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes. I have already made the position clear. Previously, hon. Members have begun speeches in Committee and failed to arrive at its next sitting. That is not unusual. We have also dealt fairly extensively with Committee members' views on the matter.

<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do Committee members really want to raise a point of order that is different from that which was taken previously?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In my experience I have been in the House for six years it is unprecedented for a substantial 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With 31 years' experience in the House, I find the situation neither unprecedented nor unusual. I do not intend to keep repeating the same ruling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I do not have enough years of experience in the House to know whether or not the situation is unprecedented. I seek your guidance. If the Paymaster General knew that he was not going to be here this morning, would it have been better at the very least for the Committee to have been given an apology first thing this morning from one of the Ministers whom he left behind?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee does not give the Chair responsibility for the conduct of its members. I have made it clear that the Economic Secretary and the Financial Secretary are prepared to continue the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. One general point arises from this episode that there is a distinction, especially in relation to the Finance Bill, between the words of an hon. Member and the words of a Minister. A Minister's words on taxation are relied on outside the House by, for example, businesses and tax lawyers. It is a serious matter when the words of a Minister are removed from the record. Is there some way to ensure that that does not occur again?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes. I understand the point. Under normal circumstances, every word said by Ministers in the Finance Bill Committee is of considerable importance. I have made it clear that the Paymaster General's words will be recorded in the Official Report. I should also like to make it clear that the Chairman views all Members as being equal. That has always been the case.
<P>
On amendment No. 74, I call Mr. Loughton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I neglected to say that I have a potential interest. I am a trustee of some life interest trusts, but on a non-beneficial basis. I have no pecuniary interest.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's response was not so much a red herring, as my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) said, but elegantly parcelled pink herrings. The phrase that she used time and again was "the rational rate structure". The Government are trying to impose the rationality of a single rate structure, but on that basis it would be wholly rational to set income tax rates at 50 per cent. It would be more rational to set all capital gains tax rates at a specific rate. That is incongruous with the no fewer than 18 separate levels at which CGT will be set as a result of the taper reliefs. It is completely out of sorts with what the Government are doing in other clauses on capital gains tax, which we will debate shortly.
<P>
What is rational about penalising the disabled and the less well off? Let us consider the absurd scenario of a young person, who earns a modest wage and pays basic rate tax, and who has the misfortune to be permanently disabled as a result of a serious accident. As a consequence of a compensation claim or a law suit, a sum of money is paid to that disabled person and, for straightforward and obvious reasons, the money is put into a trust to provide living expenses throughout the rest of that person's life. The trust will be taxed at a higher rate than the person was paying as a non-disabled person before the accident.
<P>
It is absolutely absurd that someone who becomes disabled through no fault of his own ends up being penalised because of the clauses. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention. The amendments would address the problem because certain people deserve to be excluded from these harsh, broad-brush harmonisation measures.
<P>
What is rational about reducing the higher rate of tax for the more affluent trusts and beneficiaries? The Economic Secretary had to admit that that is the case, although she completely failed to come up with the number of trusts and beneficiaries that are susceptible to tax at the 40 per cent. rate. It is yet another example of Government and Treasury officials not knowing the extent of a problem created by their legislation. They do not know how many trusts and people will be affected or how much money will be involved.
<P>
What is the rationale? The Economic Secretary came up with another red herring point. She said that it was terribly generous that prices of assets are uplifted to probate values at the date of death. We all know that. It is perfectly obvious. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) said, it is to prevent double taxation. We have had nothing but red herrings from the Economic Secretary.
<P>
The thrust of the clause has nothing to do with rationalisation or harmonisation or any benefits that they may bring. We talked about producing a mean rate of tax for the trusts that fall between the basic and upper rates, but we do not have even that because 34 per cent. is higher than the average of 33 per cent. and 40 per cent. If the Economic Secretary was going to use that case, she might have reduced the trust tax rate to the mean rate.
<P>
This is another backdoor tax-raising exercise despite the consequences that it may have on those whom it affects, which in this case are the more vulnerable in our society. Yet again, we have a half-baked harmonisation without purposes and fairness.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I did make it clear that the debate has gone wide of the amendments and that I was prepared to allow that to continue. However, I shall begin to apply Standing Orders if there is repetition.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall be brief. As you have expanded the scope of the debate, Mrs. Dunwoody 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that the Chairman expanded the scope of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I stand corrected.
<P>
Although I have no interest to declare in a disabled trust or an estate, I have an interest in a fixed interest trust. However, I will not be affected materially by what is decided this morning.
<P>
The final argument in favour of the amendments is that at least they mitigate the effects of the clause. Although I know that my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham believes that it is a worthy idea to bring trusts into line, that begs the question whether trusts should be brought into line at the higher rate of 34 per cent. or at the basic rate. We do not have time today to debate whether it is right for any higher rate to apply to capital gains, but we should not forget that capital gains tax is in many ways an invidious tax and that there are strong arguments for applying it only at the lower basic rate of tax across the board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I fear that I should have declared an interest. The declaration of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham jogged my memory. I am a senior partner in a law firm and I am a trustee of a number of interest-in-possession settlements. I have no beneficial interest in any of those trusts.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie </B>(Kirkcaldy): Apart from the huge fees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Just to get that on the record if that is recorded.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Does the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds want to withdraw his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In the light of the unsatisfactory response, we will press the amendment to a vote.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for your guidance. I do not intend to speak to amendments Nos. 221 and 222. I understand that, for technical reasons, they were tabled as amendments to the schedule but that they will be retabled as new clauses.
<P>
Throughout our consideration of the Bill the Opposition have been concerned about the gap between the rhetoric of the Budget speech and the reality of the Bill's provisions. I am delighted that we have at last reached the provisions dealing with capital gains tax. Nowhere is the gap that I mentioned perhaps I should call it a yawning chasm as wide as it is in those provisons.
<P>
The Chancellor's statements in the Budget speech about capital gains tax are not reflected in the Bill's provisions. If the Government do not accept amendments to those provisions, either in Committee or on Report, they will have to come back to them in future Finance Bills to ensure that the Chancellor's rhetoric is delivered to taxpayers. I do not want to offend the Economic Secretary or any Scottish Labour Member, or to rub their noses in it, but this part of the Bill is something of an own goal.
<P>
Schedules 20 and 21 give detailed effect to the provisions of clause 119, which was debated on the Floor of the House. I shall not, of course, rehearse those arguments. In relation to the amendments, and the next 20-odd clauses, we want to show that the Government's capital gains tax proposals are bogus, unfair and, in many cases, economically illiterate. What was characterised in the Chancellor's speech as tax cutting is in fact tax raising. The proposals were offered to the public as a way of simplifying capital gains tax legislation, but they will increase its complexity.
<P>
The problem came about because when the Government were in opposition they boxed themselves into a dogmatic corner. They decided that short-term capital gains were bad and that people who make them should be punished, and that long-term capital gains were good. That position is, frankly, economically illiterate. The Government have got into a corner and had to argue that to make an investment that doubles in value in five years is bad, but that to make the same investment that doubles in value over 10 years is good. That cannot be in Britain's long-term economic interests, as it encourages people to stay locked into unsatisfactory investments because they would suffer a penal rate of tax if they realised gains in the medium term.
<P>
In his Budget speech, the Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In a low-inflation environment a complex system of indexation is no longer necessary." [Official Report, 17 March 1998; Vol. 308, c.110.] <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That bald statement does not bear scrutiny. The Bill will tax illusory inflationary gains, but that was why the system of indexation was introduced. The Chancellor spoke of a "complex system of indexation", and he scrapped it. The new system of taper reliefs is much more complex, and even those with day-to-day involvement find it mind boggling.
<P>
The Chancellor's demonstrably untrue proposition that a low-inflation environment renders a system of indexation no longer necessary makes me wonder whether we can expect to be in a low-inflation environment over the medium term. The Government have missed their inflation targets in 11 out of their first 12 months in office. That does not inspire much confidence among taxpayers who will now be exposed to taxation on illusory, inflationary gains that exist only on paper.
<P>
Not for the first time in our tax system, people will pay tax on gains that are neither real nor tangible. In the income tax system, for example, there is the annual uprating indexation of thresholds and reliefs to ensure that people are not taxed and that the fiscal drag effect is reduced and controlled, yet the Chancellor is reintroducing that fiscal drag by removing the indexation provisions.
<P>
The measure is flawed in principle. It is a concealed tax increase and introduces much additional complexity into the tax system. The amendments to the schedule tackle specific matters of concern. They would reduce the damage caused by the general thrust of this part of the Bill and ameliorate the effect on taxpayers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> May I infer from the hon. Gentleman's comments he disagrees with tapering and prefers indexation that his views are in sharp contrast to those of the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden, the former shadow Chancellor? The right hon. Gentleman floated the idea of tapering instead of indexation on the grounds that it would be simpler to administer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will know, the proposals that were floated were for a tapering to zero over a shorter period. Conservative Members would have much sympathy with that proposition. I said earlier that the Government would return to the matter in future Finance Bills, and it may be their plan to make this one of the regular annual carrots to be offered to the taxpayer. However, at present the proposals are unacceptable.
<P>
Before I speak to the amendment, I should like to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He is not here this morning, but although the amendments are in my name as well, a lot of the hard work of preparing them was his.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is a gracious tribute, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will talk about the amendments soon, no matter who drafted them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman will indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. Perhaps I can speak briefly to each of the four amendments in turn.
<P>
Amendment No. 228 relates to situations in which the use of an asset changes from business to non-business use. Where an asset has been used for both business and non-business purposes, only the last 10 years of ownership of the asset are considered in determining the proportion of the gain that is to be attributed to business use and that which is to be attributed to non-business use.
<P>
There is no logic in looking at only the previous 10 years. It is not uncommon for someone who has built up and been involved in a business to retire from that business but to continue to hold the asset as a non-business asset. If a large part of the gain has been made during the period when the asset was held as a business asset, it does not seem fair that the person should be subject only to the lower rate of taper relief that is applicable to non-business assets merely because he has continued to hold the asset for 10 years after it ceased to be a business asset.
<P>
The amendment would time-apportion the gain on the basis of the whole period of ownership. The taper would still be restricted to a maximum of 10 years, but it would allow the overall apportionment of the asset between business and non-business use over the whole period of ownership to be taken into account. We believe that the amendment would remove a significant disadvantage from many people who held assets as business assets and continue to hold them after retirement as non-business assets.
<P>
Amendment No. 225 deals with holdover relief and the position of family companies. If a claim is made under section 165 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, it will be made before taper relief. However, when the transferee sells the asset, he will get taper relief for only the period for which he has held it. No credit is given for any period during which the asset was held by another person prior to the transfer. That will mean either that taper relief is lost or gone, which would be a significant sacrifice on the part of the person concerned, or that relief is not claimed and tax has to be paid, although in this case, there would be no receipt of cash from a third party to enable the taxpayer to make that payment. Perhaps more likely, it may mean that the transfer will not be made.
<P>
We are concerned that people who find themselves in ownership of assets in family companies will be induced to continue to hold them for tax-driven reasons when it would be economically sensible and in their own interests to dispose of those assets. The solution that we propose in amendment No. 225 is a provision similar to that which applies to comparable transfers between husbands and wives, so that the qualifying holding period would be defined as the combined period of ownership of the asset.
<P>
Amendment No. 226 concerns rollover relief. When a trader rolls over a gain against the base cost of an asset with an expected useful life of more than 60 years, the rolled-over gain is rolled over before taper relief. Thus, when the second asset typically a building used for the purposes of the trade is disposed of, the whole gain, including the rolled-over gain, will be subject to the taper relief applicable to the second asset. That could lead to an unequitable situation. Effectively, the gain on the first asset would be tapered according to how long the second asset was held for. We suggest that that does not make economic sense.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Under indexation, the way in which rollover relief operates is to put the taxpayer in the same position as he would have been in had he held a single asset for the combined period of ownership of the two assets. The provision departs from that established principle, reduces the value of the relief and is, therefore, yet another hidden tax increase.
<P>
The solution that we propose is simple. It would make the qualifying period for the part of the gain that[Mr. Hammond]was rolled over equal to the combined period of ownership of both the assets. It would, therefore, recreate the equitable situation that exists under the present indexation system.
<P>
Amendment No. 227 relates to schedule 21 of the transitional provisions. The new taper provision recognises only periods of ownership after 6 April 1998. We recognise that the additional year makes a small impact on the provision. An individual who makes a disposal shortly after the provisions come into effect may be significantly worse off than he would have been under indexation. While we do not approve of the Government's motives in introducing the changes to capital gains tax, we recognise that they seek to encourage the long-term holding of assets. A person who has, however, held an asset for a long period before 6 April 1998 may be significantly disadvantaged when he disposes of it next year or the year after.
<P>
In amendment No. 227, we propose to allow anyone who holds an asset on Budget day 1998 to elect indexation rather than taper relief. In the early years, it is likely that a taxpayer in that position will elect to have indexation available to him. That is the basis on which he would have expected to be taxed when he acquired the asset.
<P>
The amendment would go some way towards removing the inequitable outcomes of the changes during the early years of the transition from indexation to full taper relief. Assets held on Budget day in nine years' time will finally be recognised as assets that have been held for 10 years and will enjoy the full taper relief. [Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members must rise if they have something to say; if they want to remain seated, I will accept that with equanimity, but they must not crouch because that is confusing.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I would not want to disappoint you, Mrs. Dunwoody, by crouching.
<P>
I want to speak to amendment No. 227 and to recall for the Committee the previous Government's introduction of their new system of indexation relief in the 1980s. They may have made the tax system less simple and added an element of complexity, but they took particular care to ensure that those who relied on the old system of taper relief for assets held before 1965 could continue to elect to have their tax charge calculated on the old, rather than the new basis of relief under the indexation rules.
<P>
If the Goverment want to be consistent with that spirit of fairness to taxpayers, they should allow taxpayers to elect what will now become known as the old system of indexation relief. The additional element of complexity results merely from computing the table. Many thousands of accountats could do the job for the Revenue at a modest cost. I should have thought that the issue was simply one of fairness.
<P>
It is worth comparing the old indexation system with the new tapering system, and asking which will bring in more revenue. The new system will bring in less in a period of high growth and low inflation. In such circumstances, many real gains would be made, and the new system would tax them at a lower rate.
<P>
The Government will receive more tax revenue if we are entering a period of high inflation and low growth. In those circumstances, many more nominal gains would be made. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge pointed out, such gains will be caught by the new rules. That will not be offset by the level of real gains, because the economy is not growing at a real level.
<P>
It is a sobering thought that under every previous Labour Administration in my recollection, Britain has gone from periods of relatively high growth and low inflation to periods of low growth and high inflation. Unless the Financial Secretary accepts the amendment, the Committee can assume that the Government quietly admit to themselves that yet again we are due to suffer high inflation and low growth under a Labour Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I wish to speak specifically to amendment No. 226, which relates to the interaction between taper relief and rollover relief in connection with replacement of assets. Let us imagine a business man who has owned assets for 20 years, and who, on the face of it, would be eligible under the schedule for 75 per cent. taper relief. That business man could, however, decide not to elect taper relief. He could be inspired by the new Government's desire for more investment in small business, opt for rollover relief under section 152 and decide to roll over the gains into a newly purchased asset. He would lose the benefit of the taper relief set out in the schedule. The qualifying period of ownership would start to run on the date on which he bought the replacement asset. If he then wished to dispose of his business within a short time, say a couple of years, after buying the replacement asset, he would be hit by a significant charge under the provisions. The full value of the rollover gains to which such a business man should legitimately be entitled, would not be taken into account. He would pay more capital gains tax then he would have expected.
<P>
That would occur because the provisions fail to take account of the fact that the ownership period for the original and replacement asset should be linked for the purposes of claiming taper relief. That view is supported by comments that have reached Opposition Members and, perhaps, Labour Members. They suggest that this technical problem is due to a feeling that the consequential technical amendments would be far too difficult to draft or to implement in legislation. For that reason, individual entrepreneurs who want to do nothing more than reinvest in replacement assets are unfairly penalised for seeking to do no more than the Government are encouraging small business men to do.
<P>
I would appreciate some explanation of why amendment No. 226 cannot be accepted. The Committee should be given some description and explanation of the reasons why it should be so technically difficult, as is supposedly alleged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I rise because of two big issues in Croydon the world cup and the tapering of CGT. The Committee will be glad to hear that I wish to address primarly the second issue. Before turning to amendments Nos. 228, 225, 226 and 227, perhaps I could briefly paint a general context to the introduction of the measure.
<P>
Until now, we faced a situation in which, for the purposes of capital gains tax, long-term and short-term gains were treated as the same. The Government want to move away from that. We also want to differentiate between business and non-business assets so as to encourage long-term investment and entrepreneurial activity.
<P>
It is within that context, and with the broader objective of providing a simple system, that we should evaluate the Bill and the amendments. The rate is moving from 23 per cent. to 34 per cent. to avoid various distortions between higher and lower rates of inflation. The tapering system will mean, in real terms, that the actual tax incidence on business assets may be as low as 8.5 per cent. that is, 25 per cent. of 34 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Is this an arithmetical intervention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that that will be 8.5 per cent. of a purely inflationary, illusory gain?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman appears not to support the former shadow Chancellor. The tapering system is replacing an indexation system. The incident rate will be 8.5 per cent. In the case of non-business assets, it is 60 per cent. and 10 years on 34 per cent., which is 20.4 per cent. That is less than the 23 per cent. that we were talking about before.
<P>
The amendments would remove [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should not bring their noisy gadgets into the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mr. Davies is on his feet. You cannot intervene on an intervention, Mr. Hammond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am confused about the hon. Gentleman's figure of 34 per cent. Where has he got if from?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was setting CGT in the wider context before moving on specifically to the amendments. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. An official record must be taken of the Committee's proceedings, and there will be confusion if hon. Members make comments from sedentary positions. Hon. Members should try to ensure that the Official Report can record what is being discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for much longer.
<P>
Amendment No. 228 proposes that, in calculating the balance between business and non-business assets in terms of applying the correct tapering, the Government should use a longer period than 10 years. I point out to the hon. Members who have tabled the amendment that the primary thrust of the legislation is to incorporate the concept of business and non-business differentiation. It also aims to create a simple and understandable system that can be administered effectively and is seen to be fair. Extending the period beyond 10 years, as suggested by the amendment, would drastically increase complexity, would be impractical and costly, and would contradict some of the Bill's underlying objectives. At the same time, it would produce only marginally the benefits that are intended. I therefore call on Committee members to oppose amendment No. 228.
<P>
Amendments No. 225 and 226 propose a rolling over of business assets by which a taper applies only to the second asset. Conservative Members are trying to build unacceptable complexities into a system that is meant to be simple.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If I must.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way with typical grace. He referred to the complexity of the amendment. An issue of fairness is involved for entrepreneurs who want to do nothing more than invest in replacement assets. Why should they be penalised for that by paying capital gains tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As I said, the issue has several themes, including complexity and short-termism the problem of continually changing the asset basis with a view to making short-term gains. An attempt to stop that is implicit in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall move on, as other hon. Members want to speak and we have to have lunch. I shall respond to several points rather than dwelling on one matter at length, as Opposition Members have done.
<P>
Amendment No. 227 appears to propose that businesses should have the option of choosing between two alterantive tax regimes with their accountants, to maximise their benefits. That would be unacceptable because of the complexity of the system for the management of the Inland Revenue and the workings of Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment. Was it ever suggested that customers could, for example, choose between the poll tax, when it was introduced, or rates or council tax? Such a take-your-pick management of taxation is absurd. Perhaps the hon. Member for Guildford is about to recommend such absurdity.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I rise to save us from more absurdity from the mouth of the hon. Gentleman. The council tax was a service charge; we are discussing a tax on capital, on assets that have been held for a long time. That is why there should be a choice. Will the hon. Gentleman explain why it will be more complex for the Inland[Mr. St. Aubyn]Revenue to calculate the future indexation table? Why does that make the Revenue's life more complex than it is already?

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Opposition members of the Committee and their eminent colleagues have said that the indexation system is complicated and that they would prefer a system that tapers down to a low level in a given period. If that is true, it stands to reason that having that system on top of the system that is designed to replace it, would nake it doubly complex. The cost of administration would be enormous and the confusion within the market place would obviously be difficut to cope with. I realise that administering council tax or poll tax is different from administering capital tax, but my point is simply that if two tax systems are running concurrently, it is bound to create complexities, with people bopping and weaving and asking the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who cannot be present today, to give expensive advice. That is not the sort of system that we want. Our proposals are based on simplicity, openness and fairness. The Opposition appear to be suggesting a pea-souper fog in which they can manipulate their own financial arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Can we therefore take it that the hon. Gentleman will be voting against his own Government? They are introducing a system so complex that software specialists say that they cannot write programmes to cope with it, in which indexation will run alongside the new tapering relief? Will the hon. Gentleman vote against that proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No. It does not follow logically from my desire to reduce complexity that there will be no complexity. Transitions cause problems; the Government are trying to reduce those problems and to create a fairer, clearer system.
<P>
I hoped, because the hon. Member for Guildford has intervened so frequently, that he woud declare more specifically his interests in the issue, but it is obvious that he does not intend to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have been on my feet for long enough. The debate has been enjoyable for everyone, so I shall sit down.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the hon. Gentleman has named another hon. Member, perhaps he will give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Of course I will take an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If I were conscious of having any interest in amendment No. 227, I would have declared it. I resent the implication that I would not have done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I was referring to the declaration on amendment No. 119 [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee has moved on from that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I rise to support amendment No. 226, which is important and contributes to a more flexible economy. Business men will be locked into assets and prevented from re-investing simply for tax reasons. It will be a mistake if the Government do not recognise that.
<P>
The benefit of a crude taper relief should be transferred at the rollover stage. To do otherwise is unfair; it stifles the economy and leads to a less flexible economy, which is not the aim enunciated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The amendment should be accepted.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I shall begin with amendment No. 225. It proposes adding the holding period of the person who gives the business asset to that of the recipient for the purpose of computing the recipient's gain on the eventual sale where a claim to gifts relief, under section 165, was made at the time of the gift. We do not accept that the periods should be added together in that way, which is a kind of inheritance of the holding period of an asset. The gain is effectively transferred to the donee with the benefit of tax deferral. It would be inappropriate to allow the donee to have the benefit of the donor's holding period in addition to the benefit of tax deferral. The purpose of section 165 is to defer the tax liability despite the fact that there has been a real change of ownership. We believe it right that the taper holding period for the recipient of the asset should begin when that person acquired the asset.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I would like to respond now on the other amendments we are rapidly approaching lunchtime, but there will be plenty of time to return to them.
<P>
Amendment No. 226 proposes adding holding periods where business asset rollover relief has been given. In our view, the amendment would have an inappropriate result and would be unmanageable.
<P>
I shall take the simplest case first the gain on one asset being rolled over into another asset, and the second asset being sold without further rollover relief. For the full relief to be given, the whole of the proceeds of the sale of the first asset have to be applied in acquiring the second asset. The second asset will invariably cost more than the proceeds from the sale of the first asset. When the second asset is sold, it would be wrong to add the holding period of the first asset before the additional capital entered the business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have made it clear that I will not give way at this stage. There is plenty of time, and I am responding directly to the amendments.
<P>
The amendment does not tackle that issue, but allows the full holding period of the first asset to be added in all circumstances.
<P>
The more complex case is where the gain on two or more assets has been rolled over into one asset, or the gain on one asset has been rolled over into two or more assets. Such a case would lead to a further tracing problem that the amendment attempts to tackle by a "just and reasonable" apportionment. However, it does not attempt to say how that apportionment should be approached, particularly where two or more assets have overlapping holding periods. It is not at all clear what would be a just and reasonable result, or how that should be arrived at.
<P>
Not only would the amendment create a deal of uncertainty; the record keeping required to implement the rule would be a considerable compliance burden on the taxpayer. All records relating to earlier sales, acquisitions and holding periods would need to be retained so that future gains could be broken down into their constituent parts. None of that is necessary under our approach. That is why the Government are committed to the taper.
<P>
Not only is the amendment wrong in principle; the tracing and identification involved would make it difficult if not impossible to work in practice. It would create exactly the complexities that the hon. Members claim to wish to avoid. It is for those reasons that roll-over relief operates in the way suggested in schedule 20. That approach is much simpler and may actually encourage investment in long-term assets because there will be a clear advantage if a gain from a short-held asset is rolled over into a longer-held asset. Effectively, both gains are tapered at the rate applicable to the longer-held asset.
<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 227, to which the hon. Member for Guildford spoke. He said that he does not want complexity, but in fact he spoke in favour of adding a significant layer of complexity to the Bill.
<P>
For assets held on Budget day, 17 March, amendment No. 227 seeks to restore the existing CGT system for those who wish it to apply to a subsequent disposal of the asset. To accept the amendment would be to permit indexation allowance to apply from April 1998 to the date of disposal of the asset, in place of taper relief. That would cut across and undermine the Government's objective. Indexation allowance would also apply toassets treated as held at Budget day under paragraph 15 of schedule 20, or under the two new paragraphs that amendments Nos. 225 and 226 would add to the schedule.
<P>
The amendment would undermine what we seek to achieve through the taper, and I therefore ask the Committee to reject it. That applies as much to assets held at the commencement of the reforms as to those acquired subsequently. Allowing a taxpayer to substitute indexation at the time that the asset is disposed of would remove the taxpayer's incentive to retain that asset for a longer period, until the taper has outweighed the loss of indexation after April 1998.
<P>
In addition, the amendment would greatly complicate the CGT system for all assets held, or treated as held, after Budget day. For those assets two calculations which the taxpayer would have to make would be necessary. The first calculation would have to be made on the basis of the provisions as drafted in the Bill. Those provisions allow for indexation to April 1998, and for the taper from April 1998 to the date of disposal. The second calculation would have to be made on the basis of indexation over the whole period of ownership to the date of disposal.
<P>
It is not realistic to suggest that the two calculations would not be necessary, because the operation of the amendment would be dependent on an election by the taxpayer. In practice, the taxpayer would want to do both calculations to decide which produced the smaller tax bill. I presume that this is why the hon. Members tabled the amendment.
<P>
We want the new system to have a beneficial effect as soon as possible, both for existing assets and for new assets purchased after 5 April 1998.
<P>
