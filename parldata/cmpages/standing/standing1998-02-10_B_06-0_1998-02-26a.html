<B>Mr. Cecil Walker </B>(Belfast, North): I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 4, line 31, leave out `public' and insert `Community Police Liaison Committees'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 66, in page 4, line 31, after `public', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and Community Police Liaison Committee'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 36, in page 4, line 32, leave out `public' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Community Police Liaison Committees, local government authorities and such other representative bodies as may be appropriate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 67, in page 4, line 32, after `public', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`district councils and other agencies'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 37, in page 4, line 32, after `preventing', insert `and reducing'.
<P>
No. 38, in page 4, leave out lines 37 and 38.
<P>
No. 69, in page 5, line 8, leave out `reasonable' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`not less than one month's'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> The Bill states that the views of the public should be obtained, but those views may differ. If one consulted a working men's club and a women's bridge club one would hear very different opinions, and the views expressed in a drinking club might be a trifle derogatory. One could not go to north Belfast and ask for people's view of the police without coming up against some serious opposition. How can one get a comprehensive account of the public's views? The term is ambiguous.
<P>
We propose to replace the clause's reference to the public with a reference to community police liaison committees because those committees are composed of people with a genuine interest in policing. They include trade unionists, locally elected representatives, ministers of religion, members of various political parties, senior citizens and other responsible members of the community. The CPLCs have an excellent rapport with the police, which was built up over a long period. Their members are more aware than most of the problems in their areas, and they can offer sound advice to the police on all matters that affect the community. The CPLC is the obvious place in which to sound opinion.
<P>
Is amendment No. 37, which would alter clause 7(1)(b), grouped with amendment No. 35?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendments Nos. 66, 36, 67, 37, 38 and 69 are included. I made that clear at the start of our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> I apologise, Mr. Jones.
<P>
We felt that adding the phrase ``and reducing'' would make clause 7(1)(b) more sensitive to local circumstances, and that local authorities and other representatives bodies would be appropriate in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 66, 67, 37 and 69, one of which is supported by Ulster Unionist Members.
<P>
Clause 7 refers to the need for the Police Authority to represent not only the views of the wider community and the public, but to set that against certain requirements and to consider ways of obtaining that information from the general public. It is a two-way process and subsection (1) places a duty on the Police Authority to make arrangements for obtaining the views of the public on policing matters. Furthermore, subsection (1)(b) requires
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the co-operation of the public with the police in preventing crime.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have no basic argument against the thrust of clause 7, nor with the requirement on the Police Authortity to seek the views of the public and their co-operation, but amendments Nos. 66, 67 and 37, which pertain to subsection (1)(a) and (b), would define more clearly the role of the Police Authority, give it more teeth and convey to the public that it has an important role in the two-way process. It is widely acknowledged that the fight against crime is best accomplished when the various parties are seen to be working together. Those parties include the police, local communities and other agencies. The security and safety of individuals and communities, as well as crime prevention, are best delivered through partnerships between the public and the police.
<P>
The Government have published a consultative document, ``Getting to Grips with Crime: A New Framework for Local Action'', which was presumably published by the Home Office. It may not relate to Northern Ireland at the moment, but no doubt it will do so in due course. In that document the Government propose that local authorities and the police service be given new duties to develop statutory partnerships to help prevent and, just as importantly, reduce crime. How soon will it be before the Government enshrine those ideas in legislation? The document is out for consultation but I do not know how long it will be before the ideas within it will be put into legislation. Is there not an opportunity here to anticipate some of those ideas?
<P>
In Northern Ireland the current close working relationship between the Police Authority and the Royal Ulster Constabulary to promote and develop the network of community police liaison committees provides an excellent opportunity for them to play an important part in the development of local crime prevention strategies. That is exactly what clause 7(1)(b) seeks to achieve. No doubt, the development of the local policing plan under clauses 16 and 17, which we shall debate later, will provide opportunities for a more co-ordinated approach to the development of local crime prevention strategies throughout Northern Ireland. That is not specific to those two clauses, but they represent an opportunity to encompass some of the proposals contained in clause 7, and carry them forward into the policing plan.
<P>
Amendment No. 66 would insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and Community Police Liaison Committee''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
after the word ``public'' in subsection 1(a), so that the subsection would state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall make arrangements for obtaining . . . the views of the public and Community Police Liaison Committee about matters concerning policing''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to nominate CPLCs as important sources of consultation, and the amendment would give them the right to be consulted. If the Police Authority fails, or is seen to fail, in its duty to consult properly and listen to the public on the policing matters that concern them, those involved in CPLCs could tell the authority that it is neither consulting nor listening to them enough. The amendment would enshrine in legislation their right to be consulted.
<P>
The clause would use the words ``shall make arrangements'', not ``may'', so the draftsmen who have been asked to put the Government's ideas into the right wording are clear in what they mean. I do not want this to be a ``take it or leave it'' requirement. The clause tells the Police Authority that it shall make those arrangements. The omission to which I have referred could be put right easily, and accepting the amendment would cause the Government no pain.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 would insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``district councils and other agencies''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
after the word ``public'', so that subsection (1)(b) would state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the co-operation of the public, district councils and other agencies with the police''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the Police Authority is required to consult each district council in Northern Ireland under subsection (2)(b), including that requirement in subsection (1) would strengthen the position of district councils and link them with the co-operation of the public.
<P>
We want the Police Authority not only to consult and listen to each district council, but to make arrangements to effect co-operation with the district councils--a very different requirement on the Police Authority than just asking it to consult. With the best will in the world, we all know that the word ``consult'' can be used or abused. It is an easy word to include in legislation and to bandy about.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Consultation is not simply about sitting around a table and listening. It requires those who listen to take serious note of people's comments and to change what needs to be changed. Amendment No. 67 seeks to enforce the point that the Police Authority will have to arrange co-operation with district councils.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 relates to preventing crime. It is important to have machinery in place, either through committees or consultation groups, or through access to public opinion, to prevent crime, but we must also be more pro-active by stating clearly in legislation that as well as being serious about preventing crime, we are serious about reducing it. I doubt that anyone would be satisfied with the status quo. Crime has risen inexorably for many years in some areas of the United Kingdom. There is now some sign of that trend slowing, if not tailing off, but it is too early to say whether major inroads have been made into reducing crime.
<P>
Statistical measurements of crime in Northern Ireland show that the rate is much lower than in the rest of the United Kingdom. That is probably a reflection of the ratio of RUC members to total population. A police force of more than 13,000 to 1.5 million people is about three times the police manpower for a similar population area in England and Wales. The large police presence in the community not only curbs terrorist activities--crimes of violence and other crimes against society--but means that the ordinary criminal is likely to meet a policeman more frequently than would be the case in England and Wales, especially in major cities such as Belfast and Londonderry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that statistics show that the crime rate in the Republic of Ireland is also much lower than in Great Britain? Might not this be because the Irish have a peaceful nature that is occasionally disturbed by ideological differences, and that, apart from that, they have much less of a tendency towards more base forms of criminal activity than the hon. Gentleman and I might have?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman can speak for himself. If he wishes me to endorse the view that the Irish are lovely people, I am more than happy to do so. Of course, southern Ireland is a largely rural society with strong family links. Also, people tend not to move around too much. But crime statistics for Dublin, especially on some estates, show a massive problem, especially with drugs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I am prompted to ask my hon. Friend to mention also the fact that what is termed organised crime is increasing faster than in the United Kingdom. That is a particular threat in an urbanised Republic of Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am surprised, Mr. Jones, that you have not intervened to say that we are out of order. I suddenly wondered whether we were debating a Northern Ireland Bill or a southern Ireland Bill.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend. In cities, and especially in Dublin, serious crime is increasing to an extent that is causing concern to southern Irish Ministers in the Health and Home Departments.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 is the one other that relates to subsection (7), which is about the amount of notice that a district council must give to the Police Authority to enable it to attend council meetings. Of course the word ``reasonable'' appears in virtually every clause in many Bills, but in this instance, the wording needs tightening up. That is why we need a specific time limit instead of reasonable notice. One month's notice would be adequate for the Police Authority to respond and discharge its duty to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``nominate one or more of its members to attend the meeting to answer . . . questions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a harmless and constructive amendment that would enable both sides to know the appropriate time. If a district council is concerned about policing in its area, it will want to speak to the Police Authority about it. A month's notice is fair and adequate to achieve the purpose.
<P>
If the policing problems in a district council's area are serious, the council will want less to talk to the Police Authority than to get a message through the usual channels to senior officers of the RUC and the Chief Constable to enable them to deal with those serious problems. In that context, discussions with the Police Authority would be irrelevant and untimely.
<P>
Community safety is a growth sector in public policing policy, not only in Northern Ireland but throughout the United Kingdom--and doubtless elsewhere. It seems logical to place a statutory duty on the Police Authority, in conjuction with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, to develop local crime prevention and reduction strategies.
<P>
We accept the thrust of the clause and the amendments are intended to be helpful and constructive. Community safety is particularly important in Northern Ireland because of the antipathy of one part of the community to the RUC and the difficulties that police authorities have faced hitherto. It is the reason that we are here debating the Bill.
<P>
Major changes are afoot, many of which will be helpful. The Bill is important, but we acknowledge that it seeks to legislate in a contentious area of great difficulty where great sensitivity is required. We want to be constructive and we hope that the Minister will accept, after taking due and considered advice from his officials, that the amendments are reasonable and helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> There seems to be a common theme to the conglomeration of amendments, which is worth scrutinising carefully. Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 have been tabled by my hon. Friends in the Ulster Unionist party; amendments Nos. 66, 67 and 69 were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss); and amendment No. 37 was tabled by the combined forces of the Ulster Unionists and the Conservative party, which is always a happy state of affairs.
<P>
The intention and effect of the amendments can be expressed simply. They are not designed to undermine the Government's intentions in clause 7, but have been tabled to help to expand and clarify what the Government are trying to achieve. They are meant to be helpful. The clause deals with the Police Authority's arrangements for obtaining the public's views on policing. We cannot seriously quarrel with that objective; it is essential to good policing and it is highly desirable for the Police Authority to know the public's views.
<P>
As I said, the amendments are designed to expand, clarify and further define how that desirable objective can be achieved. They are based on two propositions. First, we would be well advised to ensure that the process whereby the Police Authority obtains the public's views is the best available and most appropriate practice. Secondly, if such a process can be identified, it would be beneficial and desirable for it to be incorporated in the Bill, so that it becomes a statutory obligation. Why should that not be the case?
<P>
Amendments Nos. 35, 66, 36 and 37 would provide that clear, precise definition that I believe is desirable. They would give the Police Authority a statutory obligation to obtain the views of the community police liaison committees. Inevitably, the emergence of such committees in recent years has generated debate, but I believe that the basic principle that there should be such committees is right.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is sensible, right and proper that the role of the community police liaison committees should be enhanced and encouraged by the Bill. They have an important role and it follows, therefore, that such a role should be statutory. That is a reasonable argument, which is consistent with the Government's intentions.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 36 and 67 go further. They would give the Police Authority a statutory obligation to obtain the views of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Community Police Liaison Committees, local government authorities and such other representative bodies as may be appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can accelerate my argument because my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made the point in some detail. In preparing the Bill, the Government have chosen not to give the Police Authority a statutory obligation to consult those bodies, so we are entitled to ask the Minister to explain why they have not been specified in the Bill. The amendments would give flesh to the Government's intentions. They want full consultation, so those agencies and organisations should be specified. I hope that the Government will accept a combination of amendments Nos. 35, 66, 36 and 67. Amendment No. 38 follows logically from the previous ones--it is not a consequential amendment. If the theme of the earlier amendments is accepted, lines 37 and 38 will be redundant.
<P>
That brings me to amendment No. 37. It may seem somewhat academic, in a pejorative sense, and pedantic, but it is not necessarily so. Inserting the words ``and reducing'' after ``preventing'', will give a more complete definition of the reality of what the Police Authority is instructed to do. In an ideal world, all crime could be prevented, but that is wishful thinking. A realistic objective would be to reduce the level of criminal activity, which would be expressed by inserting the words ``and reducing''. It would insert a degree of reality that is currently missing from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that preventing crime is a way of reducing it? If 20 crimes are prevented, that will reduce the number to 80 for every 100 that might have been committed. I cannot see that the amendment would add anything to the clause as it stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> That intervention was addressed to you, Mr. Jones, and I am sure that you are most anxious to prevent all crime. It is a common theme. I was arguing on pragmatic, practical grounds. Perhaps we tabled the wrong amendment, and should have inserted in our proposal the word ``some''. However, the intervention reinforces my point rather than detracting from it.
<P>
In the same way as amendments Nos. 35, 66, 36 and 67 seek to clarify and expand the Government's intentions, so does amendment No. 69. The Bill refers to ``reasonable notice'', which begs the question of what is meant by ``reasonable''. I know from other legislation that that word can be a lawyer's paradise. Amendment No. 69 would provide a reasonable answer to the question of what is meant by reasonable and the definition would improve the Bill.
<P>
I shall conclude with the sentiment with which I began. The amendments are intended to be helpful and to bring out the Government's aim. I hope that the Minister will respond to my argument even if he does not accept our proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): The clause is one of the most important in the Bill. It deals with obtaining the views of the public on the type of policing that they want. I do not like the word ``public'', because that could mean three fellows standing in the corner of a bar philosophising at midnight each with a pint of Guinness. As you know, Mr. Jones, pubs are supposed to shut at 11 o'clock.
<P>
I prefer the word ``society''. When determining how we direct and require our police to carry out their responsibilities, we must consider the entire society in Northern Ireland. If we can consider the problem in terms of society, that will get us away from concentrating today on this tradition, tomorrow on another tradition and the day after on a third tradition--if we can find one--and perhaps going back to the first. We can help to bring people together by addressing policing in terms of society and we can create confidence across the traditional divides in Northern Ireland. That is why we have tabled amendments and why we welcome Tory support for amendment No. 37.
<P>
I shall address the issues one at a time. When we tabled amendment No. 35, we hoped to encourage the Government to do more to promote the concept of a society in Northern Ireland into which representatives from both traditions would be drawn. Every section of society could be brought together in community and police liaison committees; for example, professional people, business people, trades unionists and artisans.
<P>
I have seen how that concept of society works in practice. From 1981 until 1993, I was a member of a district council and when community and police liaison committees were set up, I was one of the first to be involved. At that time they were intended to relate directly to the Police Authority and we spent many long and arduous sessions dealing with the authority.
<P>
The CPLCs brought together people in Northern Ireland who did not normally meet. They had the opportunity to discuss law and order and matters pertaining to the police. Each tradition experienced particular difficulties over the ways in which they were policed, and they would not usually have been able to interface to discuss those matters. Much of the difficulty within the Unionist tradition arose from the belief that those involved in IRA violence were treated more favourably because they had a better propaganda machine, than those who would claim--I stress the word ``claim''--that their violence was reactive. The awful thing about violence is that it may start as reactive, but it becomes self-perpetuating. We have seen that again and again in Northern Ireland.
<P>
In the CPLCs, representatives from both traditions compared and discussed matters. They had to devise constructive relationships with those senior RUC officers who attended the committees. The officers were able to hear how they might better serve society or the local communities.
<P>
I am particularly worried about the structured bodies, drawn from every section of society, which will be set up instead of CPLCs. They will be so vague that the liaison process will be manipulated by people who call themselves the public, but who have at heart neither the good of society nor the good of the police. The three fellows at the end of the bar who finish their pints of Guinness at 12 o'clock could walk out into the street and decide that they represent the public. Who will dispute with them?
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I exaggerate--although the Minister knows that I am not given to exaggeration--but I want to make a serious point about that sort of manipulation. I concentrate on the IRA because it is the most proficient terrorist organisation in Europe, perhaps the world. In the past two or three years, the IRA carefully crafted a process of taking over concerned citizens' groups. It did not only take over genuine groups, but it created others, which it called concerned citizens' groups. It did that not only in Northern Ireland, but in that land of peace to which the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) refered: the law-abiding Irish Republic.
<P>
There are many peaceful areas in the Irish Republic--as there are in Northern Ireland--but there are also many areas where we would be at considerable risk if we ventured into them during, or even before the hours of darkness. Much organised crime occurs in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Galway and other places. Such organised crime is confronted or taken over by people who call themselves members of Sinn Fein, but are backed by the power of the IRA.
<P>
Estates such as Tallaght show that the Garda Siochana finds it increasingly difficult to operate because Sinn Fein members, posturing as concerned citizens against drugs, organise crime. I make the qualification that not all concerned citizens' groups in Dublin any more than in Belfast are run by the IRA, such groups are vulnerable to terrorist organisations. In Belfast, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Ulster Defence Association, the Loyalist Volunteer Force and the Irish National Liberation Army also operate. God knows how many different groups exist, but they all try to create their own little niche to manipulate events.
<P>
I caution the Government against vagueness in the Bill. That is why amendment No. 35 would replace ``public''--that ill defined word that covers a multitude of sins--with ``Community Police Liaison Committees''.
<P>
For the same reason, amendment No. 36 would replace ``public'' with,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Community Police Liaison Committees, local government authorities and such other representative bodies as may be appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may say that that is not good drafting--I am open to correction if it is not--but I understand representative bodies to include trades union organisations, business organisations, professional organisations and the like.
<P>
With amendment No. 36, we are seeking to put local government authorities in their proper place, so that they can participate in the process on an on-going basis and are not, as the Government have it in clause 7(2)(b), a detached group who will be consulted. One of the sad realities of life in Northern Ireland is that local government has not had vested in it the sort of responsibility that is allowed in other parts of the United Kingdom. Hence, local Government is eager for real and responsible work. Local government is keen to claw responsibiilty to itself. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire will remember that local Government felt complimented when it was decided that it should participate in business and industrial promotion.
<P>
Will the Minister assure me that local government will not be ``consulted''--which means visited once a year, if fortunate by a Minister, if less than fortunate by a senior civil servant or a member of the police authority. That would be rather like the annual visits that we all make at Christmas time to areas that we shall probably not visit again until the next Christmas. We do not want the Minister to make an annual pre-Christmas visit to district councils, asking them what they think of local policing, allowing everyone to let off steam and then going away, shaking the dust off his shoes and saying, ``That is it for another year.'' We want local government to be involved. I believe that local government should be included in clause 7(1)(b), along with CPLCs and other representative bodies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman leaves amendment No. 36, does he recall the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) arguing at a previous sitting that one of the deficiencies of the redefined police authority is that it lacks authority? Is it not the case that the authority of the police authority would be much augmented if it had a statutory obligation to consult district councils?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I agree, but it goes deeper than that for the Ulster Unionist party. We envisage CPLCs being given the responsibility and the opportunity to participate side by side with district councils. Initially, of course, CPLCs were comprised almost exclusively or district councillors, but no one believed then, and no one believes now, that that is the way forward.
<P>
I know that this is a young Parliament, but those of us who are old enough to remember the emergency in Malaya know that the police in Malaya made an effort to get in touch with people at grass roots level--those who needed their protection--and that that was successful in the campaign against communism, which was then a worldwide phenomenon. That huge task was successful because of the co-operation between society and the police.
<P>
The membership of CPLCs should be carefully selected from among representative bodies of all sorts, including district councils. If that were done, a wealth of knowledge, information and helpfulness could be drawn on. People would deal with their local areas and would understand not only what was required but the benefits of achieving it.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) for reminding me that the right sort of people would be involved--those who showed their personal interest in their community and who could be recruited upwards into the Police Authority to take a panoramic view of policing in Northern Ireland. That would provide the training and participation that is needed--I make no apology for saying that again--and it would bring together those people who do not normally interface in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I was surprised that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead-who was, I believe, a philosopher and logician in a previous incarnation--did not understand the difference between prevention and reduction. He said that they were the same and explained that if we prevented 20 per cent. of crime we would be reducing crime. I am only a simple village schoolmaster, but I know that if crime were on the increase and 20 per cent. of it were prevented from occurring, we would not be doing half as well as if crime were decreasing and 20 per cent. of it were prevented from occurring.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is important that we seek through co-operation between a society that wants to be policed and recognises the benefits of being policed, and the police themselves, first to prevent crime and, when we have succeeded on that basis, to reduce the overall level of crime. Reducing crime is not just about policing but about education, social conditions, the interface with social opportunities, standards of housing, health care, nursery education and giving mothers the opportunity to go out to work. All those issues affect crime.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead will agree with me, as he has been to Northern Ireland and seen the RUC in training, that an awareness of the needs of society is being inculcated in the police. That aspect of police work must be complemented by those who are either elected to local government or represent a community interest through a bona fide body. Let us get rid of public bodies which are open to exploitation. I hope and believe that the Government will concur with what I say and give the matter a great deal of thought.
<P>
Let us get down to structures: the structures of society in Northern Ireland have been removed and destroyed. The relationship between traditions has been damaged for almost three decades, and there is a terrible need for re-education to restore it. People must learn to use the structures at their disposal; as well as giving them authority and influence we must expect a degree of responsibility, which can only come through structuring society as society decides that it should be structured. That should not be left to this or that maverick group, to be exploited by those who are least interested in helping Northern Ireland to claw and work its way back to being a region of the United Kingdom that we can be proud of.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I have commented many times on the pressures in society, apart from terrorism. An unneighbourliness is beginning to emerge in some of our housing estates that I have not experienced before. It did not exist 15 years ago when I was first elected to the House, although at that time Northern Ireland was suffering greatly from inter-community violence and other tensions.
<P>
The ``nuisance neighbour'' syndrome is beginning to emerge, at a level that is causing my colleagues and me tremendous disquiet. It is not a matter for this Committee; none the less it is one that can be alluded to. I do not suggest that simply by legislating, we can make a problem go away. But we must find a way of legislating so that it becomes an offence when elderly widows are driven out of their homes by noisy young families who are determined to make their lives a complete misery.
<P>
	I have just dealt with two such cases this afternoon. I had discussions with the police and with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive on the issue. We must find a way to deal with the problem. It is difficult for anyone to say that the noisy family with the music turned up at 3 o'clock in the morning--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman is going to get to the point of talking about how a police authority consults.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Indeed I will. I will talk about how that prevents crime, and I will refer again to clause 7(1)(b). I have made the point that I wish to make and I hope that the Minister is taking on board the need for co-operation in society at every level, working as a cohesive unit, and the police. We are content with subsections (3) to (6), and believe that the Government have sought to address the question of arrangements for obtaining the views of society on policing.
<P>
	I conclude by suggesting to the Minister of State, who I know has been busy in another Committee and has just arrived, that he should not lightly discard this sincere proposal from the Ulster Unionists and others. Its aim is to define more carefully a structure whereby society will understand that policing is for society, that it should reflect the needs of society, and that the Government are determined that that should be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I indicated that I wanted to speak before I was brought into the argument by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis). I will resist the ``preventing'' versus ``reducing'' debate arising from amendment No. 37. I do not think that much hangs on that. The matter of substance here is amendment No. 35. It should be resisted. As it stands at present, subsection (1)(a) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall make arrangements for obtaining--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	 (a)the views of the public about matters concerning policing''.
<P>
Whether one refers to the public or to society, that is a difficult job, and the Police Authority must make up its mind how to do it. It should consult a large number of organisations to ensure that its obligations are carried out appropriately.
<P>
The Opposition have constantly talked about their desire for the Police Authority to have significant responsibility. That is reasonable, and I have often agreed with them. However, the effect of amendment No. 35 would be to replace the original sentence with:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall make arrangements for obtaining...the views of the Community Police Liaison Committees about matters concerning policing''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Instead of having a difficult job, the Police Authority would have an extremely easy one, requiring only the minutes of the Community Police Liaison Committees--and that would be the lot. I cannot believe that it is the intention of the Ulster Unionists to contract the scope for exercising the Police Authority's judgment in that way. Such a contraction of its responsibilities would be inappropriate.
<P>
I understand the desire to include somewhere in the Bill the words ``Community Police Liaison Committees''. At the risk of sounding heterodox, it seems to me that the Conservative amendment No. 66 is more effective, although I am still unsure whether the Bill as drafted does not remain better than that, on the grounds that it would be unreasonable for the Police Authority not to consult such Committees properly. It would be reasonable for the Secretary of State to regard the Police Authority as remiss if it did not consult them.
<P>
I understand the draft of what is being said in the amendment, but as I said, it would contract the powers of the Police Authority in a manner that neither the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone nor myself would wish. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will think again about the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): This has been an interesting and measured debate, but not all the points that have been raised in it affect primary legislation. We are currently consulting on the issues. The discussion document ``Your Voice, Your Choice'' asks how consultation should occur in order to take into account the sort of views that have been expressed today.
<P>
I shall start with the points raised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Clause 7 is not, in the hon. Gentleman's words, about consulting three men in a bar when they have finished drinking their Guinness at midnight. Clause 7 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall make arrangements''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for obtaining the views of the public. ``Before making any arrangements'', moreover, the Police Authority shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consult the Chief Constable as to the arrangements that would be appropriate''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so the wisdom of the Chief Constable is expressly sought--and it must also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consult each district council in Northern Ireland as to the arrangements that would be appropriate for its district.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That represents a considerable safeguard, and there is a further safeguard in subsection (4):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If it appears to the Secretary of State that arrangements. . . are not adequate . . . he may require the Police Authority to review arrangements''--<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the Minister give way? Briefly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> For the first time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who makes an important point, but comes to the wrong conclusion. He said that there was an opportunity to consult the Chief Constable, who has a specific agenda to consult local authorities, which he is entitled to do. However, because of the nature of politics in Northern Ireland, local authorities are not--let me put it this way--omnipotent. His argument would stand up if there were more community and police liaison committees. We all know how representative they can be, and how they allow interfacing between traditions.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is true that during my first 30 seconds I did not manage to make all the points that I want to make. It would be false to imply that there are no safeguards concerning the quality of consultation that is required. Of course the Chief Constable should be consulted--the requirement is not that he may consult but that he has an obligation to consult--and district councils should be consulted about the form of consultation to be established in their area. That system provides considerable safeguards, and the Secretary of State represents another.
<P>
There is no difference between the parties over the necessity to consult or over the need to find the right form of consultation. I pay tribute to the CPLCs for their sterling work. We said in our consultation paper that they were one of the beacons of hope in Northern Ireland. We are grateful to them, and we need to build on their involvement. However, I shall later explain why it is presently not possible to include them in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 would require the authority to consult only CPLCs about policing, and amendment No. 36 would change the group with which the authority is required to seek co-operation in the prevention of crime--it would replace ``public'' with the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Community Police Liaison Committees, local government authorities and such other representative bodies as may be appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 66 would require the authority to consult the public and CPLCs. I shall deal with those amendments first, and discuss amendments Nos. 37, 38, 67 and 69 later.
<P>
The Bill's wording matches that used in the Police Act 1996, which applies to England and Wales. Amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 66 would change that. As presently drafted, the amendments are defective because they do not define the term ``CPLC'', which does not have a statutory meaning. Opposition Members might ask, ``Why not give those committees a statutory meaning and include them in the Bill?'' ``CPLC'' is a generic term for a group of local people who meet regularly on a formal basis with the police. The committees--they do not exist everywhere, but that is another matter--can be based on district council areas, police sub-divisions, police station areas or on local needs and problems. To give those bodies, which differ from one another and which reflect local circumstances, a statutory basis might be beneficial, but it might be destructive. It might change the system from one that works to one that is much more rigid.
<P>
Before drafting the Bill, we consulted the RUC community affairs branch and the Police Authority about whether statutory provision should be made for CPLCs. They both felt that that would be unhelpful in developing the CPLC network. We do not, however, rule out the possibility. If they became statutory bodies we should impose rigidity on how they should be set up and in what form, so that they were recognisable as CPLCs.
<P>
Views were expressed by the Police Authority and representatives of the Chief Constable that that would be premature, but it is an option for the future. We are considering the matter, but there are difficulties. CPLCs do not exist in every place, and misplaced hostility of the police in some places makes it difficult for CPLCs to become representative bodies. We want to move step by step, taking the advice of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. We do not want to give up the flexibility in the groupings and procedures, and I recommend that the Committee rejects the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 would require consultation only with the CPLCS, but that is only one of the ways in which the Police Authority currently consults the community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am following carefully what the Minister is saying, and I do not dissent from that. I draw his attention to subsection (2)(b), which requires each district council to be consulted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as to the arrangements that would be appropriate for its district.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With the qualification of ``would be appropriate'', surely the liaison committees could be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I feel confident that when CPLCs are working well they will be a major component in the consultation mechanism, and that will be reinforced by the consultation with the Chief Constable and district councils. We believe that this is not the time to create CPLCs as statutory bodies in what would probably be a fairly rigid structure, because their composition would have to be specified. That would be unwelcome at the moment.
<P>
I also invite the Committee to reject amendment No. 37. We sometimes came close to philosophy when discussing the meaning of ``preventing'' and ``reducing''. My ruling is that when one says ``preventing'' one is also saying ''reducing'', because it is impossible to prevent without also reducing. The amendment is unnecessary because the responsibility to prevent crime encompasses the responsibility to reduce crime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do not agree. If there is a rising graph of crime and some is prevented, the amount that is prevented may be less than the increase that is accruing. Crime would not be reduced because the graph would still be rising.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> If a crime has been committed, it cannot be reduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am not saying that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> If one is seeking to prevent crime and is successful in that, one is, by definition, also reducing it.
<P>
I agree that the Police Authority should consult district councils and other bodies as appropriate, but amendment No. 67 would move away from a form of words that has proved successful in English and Welsh legislation. The word ``public'' encompasses district councils and other agencies, so the amendment is unnecessary and it is possible that it would narrow the range of consultation that the authority was permitted to undertake.
<P>
There is a danger that specifying
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``district councils and other agencies''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could be interpreted as excluding some organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The Minister must be logical and consistent. His argument against amendments Nos. 66 and 67 is that ``public'' includes district councils. If that is the case, subsection (2)(b) is superfluous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Under subsection (2)(b), the Police Authority will consult each district council. Under subsection (6), district councils may make arrangements.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for enabling questions on the discharge of the functions of the Police Authority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those provisions cover the need to involve district councils.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire spoke about amendment No. 69, which would provide for at last a month's notice of the sort of district council meeting that subsection (7) describes. I appreciate the reasons for the amendment, but circumstances may arise in which a meeting needs to be set up much more quickly. The amendment is too rigid. A requirement for a month's notice could imply that any meeting that was convened without such notice would not be proper. The inclusion of word ``reasonable'' is better than any other proposal that has been made. It is not appropriate to include a specific time limit in the Bill. With good will, which is always needed, a provision for reasonableness is sufficient.
<P>
Clause 7 encourages local accountability in policing, develops the relationship between PANI and district councils, and strengthens PANI's accountability to locally elected representatives. Extensive consultation is currently taking place on points that hon. Members have raised. We encourage everyone to contribute to the discussion ``Your Voice, Your Choice''.
<P>
We have listened to the points that hon. Members have made in the debate. We believe that we have got it right, but if we decide that we can improve the provision, we will do so. Aims have to be achieved in line with the charter standards that the Police Authority will devise for its consultation process. We believe that the clause is a good provision, and we ask the Committee to support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. We have had a good debate. The amendments were tabled in good faith to improve the measure and the Minister presented powerful and telling arguments against some of them. I accept his response to the points about community police liaison committees, that if they were not based on statute and did not cover all areas, some areas would find favour, whereas others would not. However, I think that the Minister implied that he would consider the matter further.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A suggestion was made by the Committee on the Administration of Justice, a group with which the Minister is familiar. In terms of consultation with the public, it considers that clause 7 is not as strong as it should be. The Committee's idea is to make provision in the Bill for consultation with the local community in a slightly different way from that which we suggested for community police liaison committees. It suggested that the Police Authority shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consult with any bodies specifically established at local level to liaise between the police and the local community.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not prescriptive; it refers to local organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is prescriptive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Is it? It is certainly looser than defining a body.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> To save time later, I shall explain now why I think that such a proposal is prescriptive. There is a danger of small unrepresentative groups setting themselves up and deeming themselves to be police liaison committees. A body should not have a statutory duty to consult an organisation that is not representative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It does not look as though we are getting very far, does it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is no good the Minister simply saying no because he is told by officials not to give any ground on this, that or the other. There is a case to be made. Another organisation has said that clause 7 should be strengthened a little. If consultation means anything, the Police Authority should listen to other views. There is a need to strengthen the consultation process not only with the public, but with organisations that represent specifically the views of the community on policing matters.
<P>
I accept the Minister's arguments about amendment No. 67, although I still think that amendment No. 37 is not unhelpful. Prevention and reduction of crime is mentioned in the Labour party's document, to which I referred earlier. I have forgotten its title but it will be in Hansard. More thought should be given to that. The Police Authority would certainly like the consultation process to be strengthened. If such issues are contained in the Labour party's own documentation, the Government should honour them in the Bill.
<P>
I do not want to press amendment No. 69 to a Division, although there could be a need for a meeting in less than a month's time but, knowing Northern Ireland as I do, ``reasonable notice'' can be open to all sorts of interpretations. If the Police Authority is under pressure and no one turns up for two or three weeks, people will not be happy. I accept the Minister's arguments, but I ask him to reconsider amendment No. 37.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is amendment No. 35 being withdrawn?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am deeply worried about the undefined word ``public''. I do not want to hold up the Committee unduly, but I would prefer to press ahead with the amendments. The Minister was not as forthcoming as I had hoped he would be. I encouraged him to be forthcoming and to say that he did not completely dismiss the need for a more structured approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the value of including a role for community liaison in the Bill, but his amendment is arguably deficient in that it lacks the words ``where appropriate''. I ask him to consider returning to the matter on Report, when the words that I suggest could be included in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman speaks, I advise him that only the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker) can withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That lets me off the hook. I was going to say that I accept what the Minister says about community police liaison committees not being defined in law at this stage. Although I feel that we should press ahead, I will leave it to my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North to decide.
<P>
The Bill should not contain ill-defined words such as ``public'' as that will lead to the sort of complications that the Minister and the Secretary of State have had to endure in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend and others, specifically about the word ``public'' but I understand what the Minister said in that connection and, taking all the views into account, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall be brief. I prefaced my earlier remarks by saying that this is a vital part of the Bill. It is important that the Police Authority discovers the public's true attitude to policing and effective mechanisms are needed to achieve that. Although the clause is not specific about how it could be done, it requires the Police Authority to ensure that it tests that opinion properly. I think that this is the first time that such a requirement has been included in legislation.
<P>
The clause represents progress; public opinion surveys have been used in the recent past and I understand that the authority has now taken to holding public meetings. Matters are progressing in an important way. In the past, the sampling techniques were inadequate and the opinion polls unsatisfactory, but there are, nevertheless, conflicting views about the public's attitudes to policing. It is a serious problem in Northern Ireland and it is important for the Police Authority to be able to identify key attitudes which may vary not just between the Unionist and nationalist sides of the community, but among those in urban and rural environments and among those of different ages and gender.
<P>
I hope that when the clause becomes law the Police Authority will take seriously its requirement to obtain the best information on attitudes to policing. That will obviously govern not only what it does but will guide the Chief Constable in setting up policing plans and will also, hopefully, influence the Secretary of State's thinking on strategic policing.
<P>
We will not return to our amendments on Report. The Minister has reasonably argued that the clause as it stands achieves its objectives. I simply return to the phrase ``and reducing''. I will not go to the wall for it but I still believe it would help the overall meaning of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I regret that the Minister did not make an opening speech in the stand part debate because many serious issues are raised by this important clause. The principle of arrangements for obtaining the views of the public on policing is essential. The Opposition feel that the clause is weak and woolly and deserves finer definition. I am sorry that the Government seem not to have taken that sufficiently on board. My hon. Friend said that we will not return to our amendments on Report but I wish to put down a marker that I believe this is an inadequate area of the Bill, important though the principle is.
<P>
I urge the Minister in due course to give further consideration to a tighter statutory obligation that will specify more definitively how the Police Authority should respond. Policing in Northern Ireland is vastly different from policing in any other part of the United Kingdom. It is totally irrelevant merely to draw on legislation prevailing in other parts of the United Kingdom. The specific and unique requirements of Northern Ireland need to be taken into account. If the community police liaison committees are the way forward as many of us believe, and the Minister shares that belief, there is a case for finding a statutory role for them even though they are in a relatively embryonic state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> We have had a long debate on the clause in which everyone said just how important it is.
<P>
It is crucial to the success of the Bill and policing. No Government could have paid more attention to this. I draw the Committee's attention once again to our consultation document, ``Your Voice, Your Choice''. The difficulties that are specific to Northern Ireland make it hard to lay down fixed formulae that are appropriate to every locality. But no Government could take more seriously the importance of the Police Authority consulting with local groups, including the CPLCs, and ensuring that their views are taken on board in the development of policing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I intend out of necessity to be brief. I thank the Government Whip for recognising that when we make arrangements on a Tuesday those arrangements should stand on a Thursday. I am grateful to him and acknowledge that he has sought to facilitate Opposition Members and me in particular. My only concern with clause 8 is about the powers conferred on the Police Authority to make arrangements for members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to serve with other bodies as appropriate to their duties. Does that mean that a member of the RUC could be detailed to serve with the Garda Siochana?
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before I pursue that issue, I want to make it patently clear that I have the greatest respect and regard for the Garda Siochana. The Garda are an excellent and professional police service and I would not want anything that I say to detract from my admiration for them. It is appropriate to acknowledge their good work within the past 48 hours when they prevented a huge bomb from being delivered to the heart of my constituency.
<P>
My difficulty is with the constitution of the Irish Republic and its territorial claim to the region of the United Kingdom within which I work. It would be unconstitutional to require a constable of the RUC to serve within that jurisdiction, even on a secondment that would achieve benefits for the RUC or for the Garda Siochana.
<P>
There has always been some co-operation between the two police forces. I experienced that as long ago as 1958, when I was a young member of the Ulster special constabulary. The local sergeant and the Garda Siochana across the frontier where I served would frequently co-operate to deal with terrorism. The co-operation that exists is ideal and I encourage it.
<P>
However, if the clause means what I think it means, there will be a constitutional difficulty in the requirement that a constable of the RUC should serve within the jurisdiction of the Irish Republic. That constable would then be subject to the laws of the Republic, which has a territorial claim over my region of the United Kingdom.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I too will be brief. I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 70 and 71. The amendments relate to subsection (3) of the clause, in which the power conferred by subsection (1)--that is the power to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provide advice and assistance to | an international organisation or institution . . . shall not be exercised''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would delete
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``except with the consent of the Secretary of State''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``without first consulting with the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Police Act 1996, section 26, subsections (3) and (4) makes similar provisions. Subsection (3) states that the power conferred by subsection (1)--that is the same power that is conferred by clause 8(1) of the Bill--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall not be exercised except with the consent of the Secretary of State or in accordance with a general authorisation given by him.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A consent or authorisation under subsection (3) may be given subject to such conditions as appear to the Secretary of State to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder why that wording was not transferred across. It seems that the Police Authority is not to be trusted and must go cap in hand to the Secretary of State for consent for everything. That approach undermines the Police Authority. It is no use saying that we are building it up and giving it extra powers if in reality the Secretary of State stands over it wishing to dominate proceedings. The Bill gives the Secretary of State every possible opportunity to enforce his or her ideas and literally dictate what the Police Authority may or may not do.
<P>
Our proposal is harmless. It would send people from the Police Authority, or the RUC, on--dare I say it?--secondment elsewhere in the world. What is so dangerous about that? Why does the Secretary of State have to give consent? My amendments simply say that of course the Police Authority shall consult the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 71 would delete the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which may be given subject to''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and add the words ``who may set''. The Secretary of State would thus be empowered to set
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such conditions as appear to him to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am happy about the Secretary of State having an input and being able to say, ``This is a difficult situation, so these are the conditions that I set.'' He could, of course, lay down such conditions that the project would be aborted, or never begun, because it would not be viable if such conditions were set by him. That is not the same as saying that the Police Authority must go cap in hand to the Secretary of State each time it wishes to do something.
<P>
That is a milder form of proposal which at least would enable the Police Authority to carry out functions that, as I have said, have been lifted from the 1996 Act, but do so with at least a little autonomy to prevent its having to go to the Secretary of State for consent on each occasion. I accept that the authority must consult and that the Secretary of State must have power to set certain conditions. I just think that our wording would be more helpful to the Police Authority, as well as bolstering its position and standing in the community.
<P>
The other question is why, if most of the wording of the Bill has been taken from the 1996 Act, has someone--not the Minister, but someone--decided that certain phrases are inappropriate to Northern Ireland, and omitted them? Why does section 26(3) of the 1996 Act for England and Wales include the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or in accordance with a general authorisation given by him.''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears to be a softening of the rule that police authorities must go to the Secretary of State each time they wish to act. It states that the Secretary of State will take an overview, and will then send out a general directive to which everyone will work without having to go back to him each time for a yes or a no. That generalisation in the 1996 Act is good enough for England and Wales. One must therefore ask why it was not deemed good enough for Northern Ireland. It is a reasonable question to ask, because I cannot think why that was not included in the Bill.
<P>
I do not wish to speak on amendment No. 39. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone takes a particular view. I understand where he is coming from but, from my experience as a Minister, I know that cross-border co-operation in all its forms is beneficial, and I would always work towards it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> With respect, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman needs to tell me that. I have made it patently clear that I and my party not only approve of co-operation but encourage it. The amendment has nothing to do with my faith in the Garda Siochana, whom I meet regularly on a friendly basis; it is to do with a constitutional issue. Without the amendment, we would be asking policemen to serve within a jurisdiction which has enshrined in its constitution an irredentist, aggressive view towards the region of the United Kingdom in which I live.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am more than happy to apologise to the hon. Gentleman if I misrepresented his views in any way--certainly, I had no intention of doing so. As I said earlier, I understand where he is coming from and the basis for the line that he has taken. We beg to differ on the form of co-operation that there might be between the RUC and the Garda Siochana.
<P>
The provision has been transposed from England and Wales not because it was thought that it should be dumped in, but because it contains opportunities for the Police Authority and especially the RUC to use their considerable skill and expertise in policing in other parts of the world, not only in Europe or Eire.
<P>
Although clause 8 will allow charges to be made for the service provided by secondees, it is perhaps unseemly to talk about making profit in the tragic situation in Northern Ireland, which has enabled the RUC and others associated with policing to learn and hone special skills, especially in the policing of terrorism and of a society at serious odds with itself. However, the clause will allow the Police Authority to make such secondments, and there is no reason why sensible charges should not be made for that. I simply ask the Minister to explain why the wording from the 1996 Act has been partly dropped, and why he cannot accept my sensible amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I shall not speak to amendments Nos. 71 and 72, simply because my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has presented the arguments for them and I entirely endorse what he says. For the brevity's sake, I shall say no more about those amendments.
<P>
I looked very closely at amendment No. 39, which was moved by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiments that underlie his reasoning and the reasons why he tabled the amendment. I do not share his interpretation and apprehension, because the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Police Authority may provide advice and assistance to''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an entirely different matter from being ``seconded to''. I have been advised that ``seconded to'' means accepting the authority of another police force. Regardless of the rights or wrongs of the matter--although I have strong views on that--it would be unreasonable to expect an officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to accept the authority of a police force of a State that laid claim to the territory of Northern Ireland.
<P>
	I dissent from the hon. Gentleman's view because providing advice and assistance is an entirely different matter, and I agree with my hon. Friend that the greater the cross-border co-operation the better. The Police Authority and the Royal Ulster Constabulary have a great deal of accumulated experience and knowledge, from which the Garda could learn a great deal.

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The Bill gives to the RUC something that is already available to other police forces but not to the RUC--the ability to offer its services overseas. We are seeking to put that omission right. It seems strange that the RUC, having acquired expertise and being a highly professional force, should not be able to offer that advice and expertise abroad. I hope that both sides of the Committee see that as a step forward.
<P>
	I shall deal first with amendment No. 39, which we intend to resist. It would prevent the RUC from providing advice and assistance to the Garda. The Chief Constable tells us that there are no plans to use the provision to second officers to the Garda Siochana to provide advice and assistance. That would give the wrong message; it seems to be in conflict with much of what is often argued by Unionists and others.
<P>
	We need maximum co-operation between the forces, not only to combat terrorism but to deal with society's other perils. For instance, it would make abundant sense to pool our knowledge on drugs. The most effective way to pool that knowledge would be through an interchange of personnel and expertise, which would be achieved through teamwork. I do not see why the Garda Siochana should be denied the benefit of the RUC's expertise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am more than happy with what the Minister says. I echo every word. He had only to tell me that the seconding of police from the RUC to the Garda Siochana would not infringe the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. That being so, the Minister has my whole-hearted agreement for co-operation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> As I said, the Chief Constable has no plans to second officers. We seek merely to stimulate co-operation between forces and to allow the RUC's expertise to be used elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Will the Minister therefore confirm my understanding that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may provide advice and assistance to''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
exclude secondment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I cannot agree. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The power conferred on the Police Authority by subsection (1) includes a power to make arrangements under which a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is engaged for a period of temporary service with a body or persons within paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems clear-cut. It answers the point.
<P>
	With amendments Nos. 70 and 71, the Opposition are quibbling with the need to get the Secretary of State's consent for providing advice and assistance to foreign Governments. If one is engaged in something as sensitive as providing police assistance and advice to other countries, that is a necessary safeguard. There should always be Foreign Office involvement to ensure that all considerations, and not just those that may seem important to a local police force, are taken into account. It should be standard practice, because of the sensitivities when providing advice and assistance to foreign governments, for the matter to go through central Government and the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In the light of the Minister's assurance that the Chief Constable will not attempt to second members of the RUC to the Garda Siochana, and hence that there will be no infringement of the constitutional position, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn
