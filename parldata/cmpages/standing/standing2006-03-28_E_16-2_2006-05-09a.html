<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000494"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I was pleased to hear the Under-Secretary say that

he shares our aspiration to increase opportunities for the study of

science. I was therefore surprised by some of what he said in response

to the amendments. In particular, he implied that amendment No. 81

would remove the entitlement to study for a double award of science,

which it would not. It would not delete anything from the Bill; it

would simply add a new subsection (5A) to proposed section 85 of the

Education Act 2002, creating an entitlement to study biology, chemistry

and physics separately. It is therefore an addition to existing

entitlements.</div> <a name="06050972000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">When

the hon. Gentleman said that pupils could do either one science plus

the additional science or the three GCSEs, he skipped over the fact

that those options are available to students only if the governing body

says that the school can provide that entitlement. My hon. Friends and

I strongly believe that all pupils in secondary schools should be

entitled to study three separate sciences. We will wish to press

amendment No. 81 to a Division when we reach that point.</div>

<a name="06050972000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the Under-Secretary

denied that creationism is in the national curriculum, but I have a

copy of the OCR gateway science suite biology B syllabus. Under the

heading &#147;Assessable learning outcomes Higher Tier only: high

demand&#148; it

states:</div><a name="06050972000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Explain

that the fossil record has been interpreted differently over time (e.g.

creationist

interpretation).&#148;</div><a name="06050972000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Creation

is now in this country&#146;s science

curriculum.</div>

<a name="06050972000018"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000495"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> Let me make it clear that creationism is not being

taught under the OCR syllabus or the awarding body as a scientific

explanation of evolution or of how we all got here or how the world

began. The hon. Gentleman can point to the document as much as he

likes, but that is not the case; he misrepresents what is in

it.</div>

<a name="06050972000019"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000496"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I read from the document. It

states:</div><a name="06050972000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Explain

that the fossil record has been interpreted differently over

time&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not

necessarily saying that creationism is true, but it is making it a

debating point. That is all that I am saying. It means that creationism

will be discussed and analysed in the science curriculum rather than in

the religious education curriculum, which is where it 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column777" />Column number: 778</div>belongs, as a result of the OCR biology B gateway science suite. That is

not an appropriate place in the curriculum.</div>

<a name="06050972000021"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000497"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> Has my hon. Friend considered that there might

be a simple misunderstanding on the part of the Under-Secretary, which

could be put right if my hon. Friend were to reread the title of the

document? There could then be no doubt about what appears in the OCR

document.</div>

<a name="06050972000022"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000498"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Yes. It is the OCR GCSE biology B gateway science

suite. I am not making a big thing of it, but creationism ought to be

in the religious component of the curriculum rather than

thescience section. I look forward to voting on amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000519"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 258, in clause 61, page

43, line 24, at end

insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(8) In relation to

the teaching of each core subject for the fourth key stage, a

maintained school shall make provision

for&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) accelerated or

enriched course of study designed to stretch higher ability pupils

within the school;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) courses

of study for pupils of lower ability designed to reduce differences

between the attainment of lower and average ability

pupils.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(9) The National

Curriculum for England may specify programmes of study in relation to

the courses of study under subsection

(8).'.</div><a name="06050972000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment provides for accelerated or enriched courses of study that

are designed to stretch higher ability pupils, and courses of study for

pupils of lower ability that are designed to reduce differences between

attainment levels of lower and average ability pupils. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column778" />Column number: 779</div>The amendment was inspired by the White Paper, which stated on page 9

that there will be</div>

<a name="06050972000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;targeted one-to-one tuition in

English and maths in the schools with the most underperforming pupils,

to help those falling behind to catch up with their

peers&#148;</div>

<a name="06050972000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="06050972000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;more

stretching lessons and opportunities for gifted and talented

pupils&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

therefore reflects commitments both parties have made to extend the use

of setting. Labour&#146;s 1997 manifesto

stated:</div><a name="06050972000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

must modernise comprehensive schools. Children are not all of the same

ability, nor do they learn at the same speed. That means

&#145;setting&#146; children in classes to maximise

progress&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sentiment

was also expressed in the 1997 White Paper, &#147;Excellence in

Schools&#148;, which

stated:</div><a name="06050972000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Setting

should be the norm in secondary schools.&#148;</div>

<a name="06050972000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite that commitment and

widespread support among parents for setting, the proportion of lessons

set by ability has hardly increased since 1997&#151;from about 37 per

cent. of lessons to 40 per cent. of lessons, which means that 60 per

cent. of academic lessons in comprehensive schools take place in

mixed-ability classes. In English 49 per cent. and in history and

geography about 65 per cent. of classes are mixed ability. Even in

maths, which has the most setting of all subjects, one in 10 lessons

take place in mixed-ability classes.</div>

<a name="06050972000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The resistance to setting is

ideological. There is a deep strand of opinion within the education

establishment that setting is anti-egalitarian. The leading academic

opposed to ability grouping is the American Robert Slavin, who says

that</div><a name="06050972000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;decisions about

whether or not to ability group must be made on bases other than likely

effects on achievement. Given the antidemocratic, antiegalitarian

nature of ability grouping, the burden of proof should be on those who

would group rather than those who favour heterogeneous grouping, and in

the absence of evidence that grouping is beneficial, it is hard to

justify continuation of the

practice.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another

argument advanced to explain why only60 per cent. of lessons

take place in mixed-ability classes is that many secondary schools,

particularly those in rural areas, are too small to enable setting in

all subjects, but that is false. To have a minimum level of

setting&#151;set one and set two&#151;all that is needed is a

two-form entry. Although each of the sets will contain a wide range of

abilities, the range will be half that of a single mixed-ability group

at that school.</div> <a name="06050972000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most

secondary schools have four or five forms in each year. Last week I

visited a comprehensive school in Milton Keynes that has a five-form

entry, and from next year it will have setting in every academic

subject. I asked the assistant head, who is in charge of timetabling,

how it was possible to do that for all subjects. I told him that some

schools had told me that they could not set in, for example, the

humanities, because the complexities of the timetable made that

impossible unless extra teachers were employed. He said that that was

nonsense&#151;that what had to be done was to divide the timetable

and all the sets into four blocks. He lost me on the mathematics of it

all; suffice it to say that all the subjects will be set by ability.

Therefore, if an average size comprehensive school does not set all its

academic subjects by ability, it is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column779" />Column number: 780</div>either engaged in poor timetabling techniques or it is maintaining

mixed-ability teaching for ideological reasons.</div>

<a name="06050972000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view is that if we genuinely

want to create a more equal society, we shall do so by raising the

quality of education for all and one of the key ways to achieve that,

particularly in schools with the most demanding challenges, is to

eliminate mixed-ability teaching in academic subjects, stretching the

most able and giving the least able the time and space to learn. As

children develop, particularly those who are late developers or for

whom the subject suddenly clicks, they can move up the sets.</div>

<a name="06050972000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next line of argument is

whether the research shows that setting raises educational attainment.

I believe that it does, but the problem with so much educational

research is that it is bedevilled by non-scientific methodologies and

is usually agenda-driven&#151;in other words, it is carried out by

people who have already reached a conclusion and design their studies

to demonstrate it. Science-based research with control group

methodologies makes that much more difficult, but such research is rare

in the field of

education.</div><a name="06050972000060"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000520"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Far be it from me to undermine the importance of

scientific research, given my background, but surely all sorts of

research methods are applicable. Qualitative research might be just as

important in obtaining information, but it is not always possible to

have proper control groups and it is certainly not possible to do a

double-blind experiment.

</div><a name="06050972000061"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000521"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> It is difficult, but it can be done. Situations are

created inadvertently, such as in the Chicago school district&#151;if

one reads the book &#147;Freakonomics&#148;, one sees that all

sorts of data analysis is done after the event. The Chicago school

district has lottery-based selection procedures in some areas, so a

blind test can be carried out. There are control groups in such large

school districts.</div> <a name="06050972000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Department for Education and Skills is as guilty, if not more so, as

others in this respect. A compendium of literature on setting prepared

by the National Foundation for Educational Research selectively quoted

Jim Kulik, leaving readers with the impression that Professor Kulik

opposed setting when in fact he is one of the leading proponents of

tracking, or ability grouping as they call it in the United States. His

research shows that if children are separated into ability groups and

each class is taught the same curriculum, it results in no significant

increase in educational attainment. That was the bit quoted in the NFER

compendium; but Professor Kulik went on to say that if the curriculum

were tailored to each set&#146;s ability range, a huge rise in

attainment would be seen at the top level and no fall in attainment at

the lower ability level. He also demonstrated that self-esteem in the

lower ability sets rises rather than falls because, for the first time,

those pupils are given the time and space to learn without suffering

the daily humiliation of seeing impatient, brighter pupils elsewhere in

the class. Kulik also shows a small decrease in self-esteem at the top

levels, as bright students face competition for the first

time.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column780" />Column number: 781</div><a name="06050972000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is important in setting is

not merely that pupils are divided into classes of different ability,

but that the curriculum is tailored to the ability groups. Our

amendment places a clear expectation that effective setting techniques

should be used in schools. New subsection (8)(a) proposed in the

amendment would ensure that schools would provide the enriched and

accelerated classes that research has shown to be most effective, and

new subsection (8)(b) would focus on the lowest attainers. It is

essential that the ethos of all schools is centred around effort and

academic progress and that pupils of all abilities are pushed to learn

as much as they can. An effective system of ability grouping must

ensure that pupils move out of the lowest ability groups as soon as

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000522"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The hon. Gentleman is nothing if not consistent in

his pursuit not only of encouraging schools to use setting as a form of

teaching, but of imposing it on every school, whatever the

circumstances. He might be consistent in that respect, but his argument

is rather inconsistent with the views that he expressed earlier that

schools should be allowed to determine their own futures&#151;but

then, we do not expect a full degree of consistency from the

Conservatives.</div>

<a name="06050972000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ensuring that the teaching of

pupils fits their individual abilities is, of course, important, but I

do not think that the amendment catches the diversity of pupils&#146;

abilities and the flexibility required to teach them all effectively.

The national curriculum prescribes the essential teaching required to

meet the needs of all pupils but deliberately leaves the question how

subjects should be taught to the professionalism of teachers. The

amendment, although I understand that it is well intentioned, would

constrain the flexibility that teachers need to deliver courses to meet

the whole range of their pupils&#146; abilities. Legislating to

impose categories of pupil ability might also hamper schools when they

need to adapt provision in response to pupils&#146;

progress.</div>

<a name="06050972000456"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.15

pm</div><a name="06050972000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our preferred

approach is to personalise education, so that schools respond flexibly

to the differing needs of all their pupils. Our national strategies,

including the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth, are

driving support for that personalisation. As part of the recent schools

White Paper, we will ensure that every school has access to expert

teachers in maths and English catch-up, and an expert teacher for

gifted and talented education. We are also considering what further

guidance should be made available to help schools to provide stretch

and catch-up in the light of the review of the key stage 3 curriculum

that is now under way.</div>

<a name="06050972000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">In key stage 4, pupils are

working to qualification outcomes, which can be selected according to

pupils&#146; abilities: GCSE exams have tiered papers and candidates

are entered either for the higher tier, covering grades A* to D, or the

foundation tier, covering grades C to G, according to their abilities.

A range of qualifications other than GCSEs can be selected for higher

and lower ability pupils, including 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column781" />Column number: 782</div>early entry to AS levels for those of higher

ability, or entry and foundation-level qualifications for those of

lower ability.</div> <a name="06050972000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

shall say one or two words about setting, given that the hon. Gentleman

spoke about it at length. We know that grouping pupils by ability can

support effective personalisation and raise standards. Since 1997 we

have encouraged schools to use setting by ability and other forms of

pupil grouping, and we will continue to do so, as outlined in the

Schools White Paper. Ofsted monitoring shows that setting in English

and maths in secondary schools has increased: 86 per cent. of maths

lessons are now set, which is a very high percentage. However, we trust

schools to decide how and when to group and set pupils by ability, as

they are best placed to know and to meet the learning needs of their

pupils. That is the only practical

approach.</div><a name="06050972000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis

of my arguments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to

withdraw the amendments.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000523"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The Minister talks about consistency, but education

was a key part of the 1997 manifesto on which his party was elected,

and it stated:</div>

<a name="06050972000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That means

&#145;setting&#146; children in classes to maximise progress, for

the benefit of high-fliers and slow learners alike. The focus must be

on levelling up, not levelling down.&#148;</div>

<a name="06050972000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was translated into the first

education White Paper. There has not been a big increase in setting

since 1997: it has gone up from 37 to 40 per cent. overall. The

Minister is right: 86 per cent. of maths classes are set, but the rate

was always high in that subject, and that figure implies that 14 per

cent. of lessons in maths, which is a linear subject, are still taught

in mixed-ability classes. Maths is a core subject&#151;all children

study it&#151;and there is no reason why any maths lesson in a

comprehensive school should not be taught in setted

classes.</div><a name="06050972000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an

important issue which goes to the root of the underperformance of many

comprehensives and the fact that many children are not being stretched

as much as they might be. I shall divide the Committee on the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000568"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 503, in clause 61, page

43, line 33, at end

insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) Where a course

of study within an entitlement area specified by the Secretary of State

under section 85A(1)(b) is to be introduced, all relevant teaching

materials must be circulated to schools one full academic year before

their

introduction.&#146;.</div><a name="06050972000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister became uncharacteristically prickly earlier. For the sake of

effect, I think, he suggested that I was not as committed as he is to

the progress of all children in our schools, particularly those

children who are being failed by the system. I do not wish in any way

to understate the achievements in our schools, the good work of

teachers and the good work taking place across schools in Britain. We

have paid tribute to that before in Committee, but it is important to

put it on the record again. However, under successive Governments there

have been problems in vocational education. That is not to say that

there have not been successes: good work has been done with GNVQs and

NVQs and many young people have benefited from that work. But there is

still a considerable way to go in terms of parity of esteem, employer

engagement, ensuring that work that we do on vocational education

across schools and further education is synergic, and making sure that

the supply of vocational education matches the demands of the world of

work.</div><a name="06050972000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">To that end, as

the Committee will know, the Government have decided to introduce a

series of diplomas. As I said earlier, we broadly support that

development. It is critical that we look again at accreditation and

qualifications to deal with parity of esteem. Governments of all

colours have tried before but have not really tackled the problem, and

it is not certain that we will tackle it this time: to be frank, it is

a big mountain to climb. The preoccupation in our culture with what I

described earlier as a literary education&#151;I might have called it

more simply an academic education&#151;has led to vocational

education being deemed to be the preserve of those who cannot make the

grade academically. We need to elevate our sights beyond that. I know

that the Government feel strongly about that, as do Members on both

sides the Committee. However, it is critical that measures are

introduced in a practical, common-sense way, so that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column783" />Column number: 784</div>they can and will succeed. My determination that they should succeed us

what lies behind the

amendment.</div><a name="06050972000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

danger that the introduction of the first four or five sets of

diplomas&#151;I will explain why I mention four or five&#151;in

2008 is being rushed. The minutes of the Qualifications and Curriculum

Authority board meeting considering the time line for implementing new

diplomas

recorded:</div><a name="06050972000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There

is a tension between trialling proposed changes properly and the need

to have them in place by a certain

date.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The QCA has also

warned that the changes will place unprecedented pressure on schools.

The changes will take place at the same time as an overhaul of the

curriculum for 11 to 14-year-olds. Steve Sinnott, general secretary of

the National Union of Teachers, has accused the Government of

having</div><a name="06050972000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;'no coherent and

resourced plan for training teachers to implement the

reforms.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do

not wish to be unnecessarily partisan as that is not my habit, but

there are also worries that the Government&#146;s pedigree in this

respect is not what it might be. There were widespread complaints about

the changes to A-levels six years ago, and the introduction of AS

levels and A2s was also rushed. The then Education Secretary, now Lady

Morris, said after ordering an

inquiry:</div><a name="06050972000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They

weren't the best implemented set of curriculum reforms that have ever

happened.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">She told

MPs:</div> <a name="06050972000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the introduction

of the AS-level reforms last year did not do credit to anybody who had

responsibility for their implementation.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report</i>, 12 July 2001; Vol. 371,c.

954.]</div><a name="06050972000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to learn

from that experience. I do not think that there was any ill

will&#151;the intentions were positive and good. The difficulties

came in getting the context right&#151;getting schools ready and

getting in place all the components necessary for change on such a

scale. What is important is competence and confidence: making sure that

people understand what is expected of them and then giving them the

confidence to deliver. Summing up the lessons to be learnt from the

A-level regrading disappointment&#151;I put it no stronger than

that&#151;of 2002, Sir Mike Tomlinson, the former chief inspector of

schools,

said:</div><a name="06050972000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In my

view, major changes to the qualifications system should have a lead-in

time of at least five

years.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Teachers

frequently say to us&#151;and to MPs of all political parties, I

imagine&#151;&#147;For heaven&#146;s sake, don&#146;t change

anything more. Don&#146;t throw more at us. We are already struggling

to cope with what we&#146;ve got.&#148; Yet the competing

imperative, as I said at the beginning, is that we want to get the

system right. We know that change is necessary to deal with the parity

of esteem issue and to give vocational education the kind of boost that

it needs to overcome some of the preoccupations and prejudices that I

outlined.</div><a name="06050972000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">The</i>

<i class="I">Times Educational Supplement</i> reported that the schedule for the

introduction of

diplomas</div><a name="06050972000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;looks

eye-wateringly tight. To meet their deadline of a September 2008

launch, full details of the new diplomas in the first five subject

areas&#151;a fifth &#145;early&#146; diploma in construction has

been added since the white paper&#146;s publication&#151;will need

to be with schools by September 2007.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column784" />Column number: 785</div><a name="06050972000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that to happen it is understood that

exam boards need an outline of the new qualification from the

partnerships, which the Ministers mentioned earlier when we were

talking about the development of the new diplomas, so that they work

out the detail by June 2006. That is a very tight timetable, which

leaves little time for the partnerships to consult employers and to

come up with a design for the new diplomas within the broad framework

set by the QCA.</div><a name="06050972000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the

timetable on course? That is a question that the Minister needs to

answer. Are the necessary components in place? Will the exam boards

have the outlines they require by next month? Some have argued,

although I do not agree, that the diplomas represent a wasted

opportunity. Sir Mike Tomlinson, the chief architect of the original

plan has argued that diplomas are a &#147;missed chance&#148;; he

fears that vocational options will still be regarded as a second best

for those who cannot do anything better. I disagree. We must get behind

the diplomas because they represent our best chance. I believe that we

can achieve a reasonable degree of cross-party co-operation on

diplomas, but if we are to get them right, the sort of probing

questions that I have put need to be answered convincingly. The worse

thing in the world would be to have something that went of at half-cock

and that

disappointed.</div><a name="06050972000457"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30

pm</div><a name="06050972000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,

one in five comprehensives currently offer vocational courses only for

children with special educational needs&#151;that is not my figure;

it comes from the QCA. That is not acceptable or appropriate and it is

certainly not what young people or employers want. I hope that the

amendment, which suggests that all the necessary information has to be

in place before proceeding, will at least give us a chance to explore

these serious matters, and I look forward to hearing the Minister

respond in that vein.</div>

<a name="06050972000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050972000569"></a><b class="B">Mary

Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): I must apologise to my

colleagues for breaching our self-denying ordinance. I am less worried

about criticism from my Whip than about that from my internal whip

about keeping us all here until a late hour. Nevertheless, I want to

speak to the amendment because it raises a couple of issues that

resonate deeply with me.</div>

<a name="06050972000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the amendment covers the

exact point that was made to me by a prison officer at Wakefield

prison, which I visited during the Easter recess. It might seem a long

way from this Committee to Wakefield prison, one of the most

high-security establishments in the United Kingdom, but I ask hon.

Members to come with me on a journey. The prison officer raised the

matter because he runs the prison&#146;s Braille workshop, where its

lifers translate school textbooks and learning materials into Braille

for children in secondary schools for the blind. His big

complaint&#151;it is the one thing that he wanted to impress upon me,

and I should like to raise it with Ministers this evening&#151;was

about late provision, or the difficulty of publishing textbooks later

to give such workshops, wherever they might be, the chance to do the

huge amount of translation into Braille and the voluminous work

involved in checking 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column785" />Column number: 786</div>and also translating items such as photographs. When we consider

vocational education and practical subjects in which there might be a

greater need for design and illustration, we will see that the

translation into Braille of photographs and models from school

textbooks and diagrams is even more difficult than translating

text.</div><a name="06050972000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I want

to mention the involvement of outside learning providers in the

14-to-19 curriculum. I was a trustee of Rathbone, which is primarily a

learning provider for 16 to 25-year-olds, but which now works in

schools on the 14-to-19 agenda. I know from my experience in that

context that we have to bring in the third sector if we want it to be

involved inthe 14-to-19 curriculum. It will take time and

experimentation to address some of the differences between the ways in

which outside learning providers and schools would offer a curriculum

in the vocational area if we are to narrow the gap and make the

curriculum as good as it can

be.</div><a name="06050972000142"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000570"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Lady is making a useful contribution to

the debate. I am also concerned about employers, many of whom have some

way to go before they really understand the potential on offer. I know

that the Minister is anxious that they should be much more heavily

involved in course design. Like the learning providers and others, I

think that the timetable is tight if employers are to do

that.</div>

<a name="06050972000143"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000571"></a>Mary

Creagh:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution.

The Rathbone experience of dealing with disadvantaged young people

shows the difficulties that arise. Employers may be reluctant to take

on children whom they see as school refusers or people whom they

perceive to be disruptive, so the work-based learning element of the

course is incredibly difficult to get. It takes a long time to build

relationships with employers who are not just going to have young

people stacking shelves, but progress them on to more meaningful and

life-changing work experience.</div>

<a name="06050972000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">That takes me on neatly to my

third point, which is about a report published by Ofsted on the design

and food technology side of the secondary schools curriculum. It

carried out a two-year study. It is important to remember the history

of food technology. I deliberately did not table any amendments on the

matter because I thought that clause 61 would spiral out of control,

but I wanted to refer to food in this context.</div>

<a name="06050972000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Food technology began to be

introduced in elementary schools in the 19th century to prepare working

class girls for a lifetime of domestic servitude in big houses or to

keep house and cook for their families. Over the 20th century, it

developed into home economics, and with the national curriculum in 1992

food technology emerged as part of the design and technology

curriculum. It is important that the review of this area of the

curriculum looks into access to funding for ingredients and so on. The

general Ofsted report said that parental contributions towards the cost

of ingredients and schools&#146; desire to keep the cost of

ingredients down mean that children are limited to cooking cakes, buns

and pizzas rather than healthier alternatives.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column786" />Column number: 787</div><a name="06050972000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an issue about

reforming of the key stage 3 and 4 curriculums as to what we teach

young people about food design and technologies. Children will not get

far in the world of work if all they can cook is cakes, buns and

pizzas. We need to equip them more, not for McJobs, but for jobs in

which they can perhaps emulate Jamie Oliver and become celebrity

chefs.</div><a name="06050972000147"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000572"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> We have had a short but important debate about the

diplomas. The introduction of the specialised diplomas is one of the

most exciting changes to the curriculum and to the qualifications

system of this country. I wholeheartedly endorse every word that the

hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings said in that regard.

Diplomas will provide young people with new opportunities for practical

learning and introduce the high quality, high status&#151;an

important point on which he and I agree&#151;vocational learning

routes that this country has historically

lacked.</div><a name="06050972000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are as

insistent as the hon. Gentleman is that the diplomas should be

introduced with as much support for providers as possible. The 14-to-19

implementation plan that we published last December set out in

considerable detail the timetable for support. The plan includes

details of a pilot process for rolling out those specialised diplomas.

Those interested in delivering a specialised diploma from 2008 will

have to pass through a gateway process to assess their readiness to do

so. They will have to demonstrate among other things that they have the

capacity to deliver high-quality applied and practical teaching and

learning and that they have the capacity and commitment to provide the

necessary work force and work force development to deliver the

diplomas.</div>

<a name="06050972000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will

certainly ensure that teaching materials, the subject of the amendment,

will be available to providers involved in the pilots. For the first

five diplomas to be available for teaching from September 2008,

teaching materials will be available by September 2007. I am grateful

to my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) for drawing

the Committee&#146;s attention to a particular aspect of preparing

those materials. She referred to learners who are blind or unable to

use ordinary material, and the need to translate them through Braille

is important, as is the experience that she brings to the Committee. I

shall certainly take away that contribution and ensure that we do not

miss out on that opportunity and that that need is not

overlooked.</div><a name="06050972000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those

teaching materials will be reviewed throughout the pilot phase, ready

to support the delivery of the full entitlement from 2013. The last

four diplomas will be introduced in 2010, which will give a three-year

evaluation period before full entitlement is available. Clearly,

subsequent phases of the diplomas over the next few years will also

ensure that teaching materials are available to providers at least 12

months in advance of first teaching. I think that that provides the

assurances that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings

wanted.</div><a name="06050972000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman did not mention the work force, but I think that preparing

the work force is also crucial to the success of the diplomas. That is

happening through enhanced training and development for existing staff,

leaders and managers, which is focused on preparing them for the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column787" />Column number: 788</div>introduction of the diplomas, and we are bringing more staff into the

system to teach vocational subjects, including the specialised

diplomas.</div><a name="06050972000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise

that we are working in partnership. Employers, through the sector

skills councils&#146; diploma development partnerships, which we

mentioned earlier in relation to other amendments, are heavily

involved. The qualification is employer-led and employer-designed, so

it is vital that when young people achieve the qualification it will

have a high currency among employers and further and higher education

institutions. To get through the gateway of quality that I described,

providers must have collaborative partnerships with a range of other

providers, including employers and voluntary organisations. Rathbone,

which was mentioned, is a high-quality organisation; I have been to

many of its events and met its young participants, who do a fantastic

job, sometimes with very challenging

individuals.</div><a name="06050972000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would

be inappropriate to legislate for the support that I have been

describing, but I hope that I have provided the assurances that the

hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings requested. The first

five diplomas are on track and on time, and the development

partnerships are working closely together to ensure that those

concerned can expect them to be of high quality&#151;an aspiration

that the hon. Gentleman and I

share.</div><a name="06050972000154"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000573"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister has, I think, shown his absolute

commitment to getting the matter right. I know that our views on it are

similar and that he appreciates what a mountain there is to climb. I

shall not repeat what he or I have already said, but it is worth

mentioning the remarks of the hon. Member for Wakefield, who set out

some of the worries that I, much less competently, tried to

articulate.</div><a name="06050972000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may not

be that legislation is the right way to deal with the issue. It is not

because I do not believe that the Minister&#146;s intentions are

right that I am inclined to press the matter to a vote. I am inclined

to do so because I think it important that the Bill should be seen to

emphasise the proper preparation, diligence and commitment that we all

have to making the arrangement work. That is why I shall seek to vote

on our amendment and to divide the Committee, but I do so in the spirit

of my remarks about the Minister&#146;s comments on the

amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000622"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Amendments Nos. 241 and 242 would add the words

&#147;to a suitable standard&#148; to the curriculum entitlement

parts of the clause. Amendment No. 243 proposes a definition of

&#147;suitable standard&#148;. The amendments introduce a

requirement that in order for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column789" />Column number: 790</div>the entitlement to be satisfied under the clause, it is not sufficient

for the school merely to offer the course specified. It must also

ensure that the courses are taught to a suitable standard. The

proposals are probing ones. Such a safeguard would ensure that schools

take their duty to deliver the entitlements seriously. It would also

ensure that where schools collaborate with other educational

institutions for the provision of the entitlement, they have regard to

the quality of education offered at that school.</div>

<a name="06050972000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 259 would enable

the IGCSE to be taught in state schools. Currently, it is the most

popular international qualification for 14 to 16-year-olds and is taken

by more than 100,000 pupils in more than 100 countries. It can be

offered only by independent schools, because they are not part of the

national qualification framework. Increasingly, such schools are moving

towards the IGCSE as concerns rise about the quality of the normal

GCSE. In particular, there are concerns that GCSEs in the core subjects

of science and maths do not offer a sufficiently rigorous preparation

for study following the GCSE level.</div>

<a name="06050972000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">In September 2005, the high

master of St. Paul&#146;s school in London, Dr Martin Stephen,

announced his intention to drop the GCSE science course. He argued that

there was general confusion over the purpose of GCSE and was quoted on

BBC News as asking:</div>

<a name="06050972000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Is it a leaving

certificate representing a guarantee of minimum competence? Is it a

qualifier for further and higher education? By trying to do both, it

has managed not to do either terribly well&#148;.</div>

<a name="06050972000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The move away from the standard GCSE has,

ironically, been provoked and expedited by the introduction of the new

20th century science courses that were supposed to remedy that

dilemma.</div> <a name="06050972000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Science

and Technology Committee criticised the existing science curriculum in

its 2002 report &#147;Science Education From 14 to 19&#148;. It

said:</div> <a name="06050972000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;'The

science curriculum at 14 to 16 aims to engage all students with science

as a preparation for life. At the same time it aims to inspire and

prepare some pupils to continue with science post 16. In practice it

does neither of these

well.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument

against the new GCSE course is made on precisely on those grounds. Dr.

Stephen argues forcefully that the new programmes of study in science,

to which the Minister referred, have been dumbed down and lack the

rigorous mathematical content that is necessary to proceed to A-level.

In doing that, we risk endangering the quality of A-levels. Dr. Stephen

has also said:</div><a name="06050972000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;you

cannot sustain an A-level on these new GCSEs.&#148;</div>

<a name="06050972000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">By focusing on ideas about science rather

than the traditional in-depth study of it, we have made the curriculum

less relevant to those who wish to studythe subject

post-16.</div> <a name="06050972000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such things

are happening not just in science. Manchester grammar school said that

it was dropping GCSE maths. The high master

said:</div><a name="06050972000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some

GCSEs do not appear to be appropriate for the most

able.&#148;</div> <a name="06050972000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

will offer maintained schools access to the same high-quality

qualifications demanded by the independent sector. It will offer

academically inclined 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column790" />Column number: 791</div>young people in those schools good preparation for further study, and we

hope that the Minister will accept our

amendments.</div>

<a name="06050972000224"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000623"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> In relation to amendments Nos. 241 to 243, we

already have robust systems for checking the quality of courses and

teaching. By prescribing in legislation the grades that pupils ought to

achieve, the amendments would place an excessive and unnecessary burden

on schools.</div> <a name="06050972000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

student&#146;s success is a product of the combined efforts of

students and their teachers, and we would be unwise to introduce a

provision that could lead pupils and parents to think that schools have

a legal responsibility for the achievement of particular grades. The

notion that schools are legally accountable in that way may prompt some

students to do less work and then seek legal remedies against the

school that they blame when they subsequently underachieve in their

exams.</div> <a name="06050972000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said

that, we must ensure that we get the quality of qualifications in

schools and the standard of teaching that we expect. The best way to do

that is through the work of the Qualifications and Curriculum

Authority, Ofsted and others. It is the role of the QCA and its

regulatory partners in Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure that

qualifications are fair, standards are secure and public confidence in

the examinations system is sustained. The QCA regulates awarding

bodies, qualifications, examinations and national curriculum

assessments. I am confident that the QCA as regulator will ensure that

high standards are established and maintained for the diploma as they

continue to be for GCSE and A-level qualifications.</div>

<a name="06050972000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new inspection regime for

schools was introduced in September 2005. Schools are now inspected

every three years rather than every six, and they are given very little

notice of inspections. Additionally, we have raised the bar in terms

ofwhat is satisfactory. What was acceptable as a standard 10

years ago is not acceptable now. Every school should strive to be a

good school.</div>

<a name="06050972000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 259 seeks to

approve international GCSEs. We debated the issue under another

amendment, so I shall not repeat my earlier points. We understand the

concerns that have been raised, and I informed the Committee of a

process under way that may go some way towards resolving some of the

dilemmas that the hon. Gentleman raised. However, I repeat that those

awarding bodies have not put forward their qualifications through the

QCA system. The QCA system is vital to ensure that qualifications and

learners are protected.</div>

<a name="06050972000229"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000624"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> But surely the reason why they have not presented

those courses is because they do not contain coursework, so they would

automatically be turned down. The Government must reassess the

coursework content requirement before international GCSEs can be

considered acceptable to the maintained

sector.</div>

<a name="06050972000230"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000625"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> That will be a matter for those involved in the

discussions to consider. However, we have a system in place that has

proven its worth in ensuring that qualifications are to a standard and

quality that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column791" />Column number: 792</div>we expect, learners are protected, and providers know what and how they

have to deliver to meet those standards. I understand the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s point, but those bodies must debate the issues to

resolve them and find a way forward.</div>

<a name="06050972000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the international GCSEs and

the comparison in standards, I regret the words that the hon. Gentleman

used&#151;again&#151;to suggest that the new science GCSEs were not

fit for purpose. Having had that debate once, I think he was trying to

provoke me again into claiming that he does not take the interests of

young people to heart. The young people taking those science courses

are taking qualifications of a high standard, and to a breadth and

depth that will ensure that they can study A-levels in the three

separate sciences.</div>

<a name="06050972000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief executive of the

Association for Science Education said:</div>

<a name="06050972000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These new courses will

challenge students to think and engage in the processes of science

rather than simply: &#145;learn by

rote&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

rigour. That is what forms good scientists in our country. That is the

sort of investment we shall see in the future development of our

economy, as young people leaving the education system are better

equipped to provide a positive contribution to the work

force.</div><a name="06050972000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not go

any further on the amendments relating to the IGCSE; I have made my

point. In the light of my comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will

withdraw his amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000626"></a>Mr.

are very clear.</div> <a name="06050972000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">No

one in my party is criticising young people in schools. We are trying

to create a better curriculum for all children in schools. That is what

the debate has been about. It has been a healthy and important debate,

and I hope that we shall have many more. The amendments were probing

ones that raised some important issues. I heard what the Minister said,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000629"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Subsection (2)(c)

says:</div><a name="06050972000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An order

under this section may make such amendments of this Act as appear to

the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient in connection with

the provision made by virtue of subsection

(1).&#148;</div><a name="06050972000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power allows

the Secretary of State by order to amend any part of the Education Act

2002 that appears to be necessary or expedient to him in connection

with an order amending the requirements for key stage 4. That seems a

huge extension of the Secretary of State&#146;s power and I believe

that the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column792" />Column number: 793</div>Under-Secretary needs to justify it. The purpose of these probing

amendments is to seek a justification for such large

powers.</div>

<a name="06050972000242"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000630"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The hon. Gentleman accurately describes the effect

of the clause, and his amendment would prevent the Secretary of State

from making amendments to the 2002 Act. I shall explain why the power

is important.</div> <a name="06050972000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

in the process of altering the key stage 4 curriculum requirements by

amending section 85 and inserting proposed new section 85A into the

2002 Act. At present, we do not have plans to use the order-making

power in section 86. However, it is very possible that at some point in

the future it will prove necessary to use the power to alter the

curriculum requirements for the fourth key stage, which now include the

entitlement to a specialised diploma. In those circumstances, the power

in proposed new section 86(2) is likely to prove useful in enabling

necessary consequential amendments to the 2002 Act. In that respect, it

is a power limited only to amending that Act. Furthermore, any order

that makes use of the power must be laid before and approved by a

resolution of each House of Parliament. We believe that this is a

prudent and sensible power for the Secretary of State to

have.</div>

require the local education authority, the governing body and the head

teacher to secure courses of study within each of the entitlement

areas, unless the local education authority determine that the making

of a course of study within a particular entitlement area would involve

disproportionate expenditure. Clause 62 makes a similar amendment to

the Learning and Skills Act 2000. AmendmentsNos. 245 and 251

would remove that qualifier from both places in which it

appears.</div><a name="06050972000459"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9

Nos. 246 and 252 are probing amendments, to seek clarification, and

would delete proposed new section 88(3) of the Education Act 2002 and

proposed new section 3D(3) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000

respectively. We would like to know why those provisions are necessary.

Proposed new section 88(3) of the 2002 Act

states:</div><a name="06050972000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing

in subsection (2) entitles a pupil who elects as mentioned in section

different specified entitlement areas (provision as to the entitlement

of individual pupils being made by section

85A(4)(b)).&#148;</div><a name="06050972000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new

section 85A(4)(b) of that Act says that entitlement is not satisfied

unless the school makes available the course of study within the

entitlement area, so the provision does not make sense. I have read it

several times, but I still do not understand it, so perhaps the

Under-Secretary could enlighten us as to what it

means.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000635"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> We share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s vision of

ensuring that young people in every part of the country are offered the

full range of diplomas&#151;and, moreover, that they are allowed to

specify which diploma subject they wish to study, how many diplomas

they wish to study and the local learning and skills area in which they

will study them. At the heart of our 14-to-19 reform is the aim of

enabling young people to choose a qualification pathway that suits

them.</div> <a name="06050972000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not think

it necessary to amend the Bill in the way the hon. Gentleman suggests

to make that happen, however. The duty that we are placing on the

learning and skills council and the local authority will ensure that

they deliver the full entitlement to the 14 specialised diplomas in

each area. That will apply unless the learning and skills council or

the local authority determines that the provision of a particular

diploma would involve disproportionate expenditure. I shall return to

that issue when we discuss later amendments.</div>

<a name="06050972000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me be clear: we have never

guaranteed that pupils at key stage 4 would be able to pursue their

first choice of subject within an entitlement area. The diploma

entitlement simply reflects current practice in that regard. We are

committed to giving young people a choice and we shall therefore offer

them their first choice, unless that would not be in the interests of a

child or where capacity does not allow.</div>

<a name="06050972000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amount of time that the

specialised diplomas take up means that young people will be able to

study only one at any one time, rather than as many as they want to.

Young people who choose to study for a diploma at key stage 4 will also

be required to take the core national curriculum

subjects&#151;English, maths, science and the foundation subjects of

ICT, physical education and citizenship. At level 3, the diploma will

take the same curriculum time as three A-levels. The diploma includes

an element of generic learning as 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column794" />Column number: 795</div>well, which can constitute up to 26 per cent. Because of that generic

component, students would end up repeating up to one quarter of their

studies, should they be allowed to take more than one diploma. That

would not be beneficial to their development, so we intend to introduce

sufficient flexibility into the diploma system to make it unnecessary

for students to take more than

one.</div><a name="06050972000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to be

aware of the practicalities for the institutions delivering those

diplomas. Allowing students to take more than one diploma would make

the timetabling of diplomas around the core national curriculum

difficult. We also expect students to study outside their home school,

in colleges or the working environment. Students taking more than one

diploma would therefore need to spend a large amount of time outside

school.</div><a name="06050972000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention

of the clause is to give flexibility in specifying the geographical

area in which students wish to study. The LSC can commission courses

from other local LSCs, which will give young people the best possible

choice. We expect young people aged 16 to 19 to be more independent and

mobile, and therefore more able to travel to courses. We would

certainly not want them to be unable to access their full entitlement

from their normal place of residence. I assure hon. Members that the

Bill will provide full access by making provision of the diploma

entitlements available across an LSC area. We shall issue guidance to

LSCs to emphasise further the accessibility of the

entitlement.</div><a name="06050972000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

provisions place a specific duty on schools, local authorities and the

LSC to ensure that all diplomasare made available to young

people. However, the provisions are also about offering the diplomas

inthe most efficient way possible. Local authorities and the

LSC will need to plan jointly across an area to ensure that the

entitlement is met. They will need to engage with schools, colleges and

other providers so that, through collaboration, all the diplomas are

offered.</div><a name="06050972000262"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000636"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Will the Under-Secretary define disproportionate

expenditure? Who would decide whether expenditure was

disproportionate?</div><a name="06050972000263"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000637"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> We expect local providers and local collaborations

to come to sensible judgments about what makes for value for money and

disproportionate expenditure. It would be unwise of me to give specific

examples now that might set precedents or a benchmark that would reduce

opportunities for young people. It will be for local partnerships to

work together to ensure that the choices that should be available to

young people are available, but they will also have to recognise that

value for money must be taken into account when they are collaborating

to ensure that the diplomas on offer meet the needs, priorities and

aspirations of individual young

people.</div><a name="06050972000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local

authorities are being asked to draw up prospectuses for their area,

which will set out the courses and programmes that each school, college

or other provider will offer young people. That will take account of

cross-border movement so that programmes in neighbouring areas are

included. Working in that way will ensure best value for money. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column795" />Column number: 796</div>As part of the system, good information, advice and guidance for young

people will be crucial, so we are introducing new quality standards to

ensure that young people receive comprehensive impartial information

and advice on all the opportunities available to

them.</div><a name="06050972000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be for

local authorities and the LSC to determine whether it would be an

inefficient or uneconomic use of taxpayers&#146; money to provide,

say, facilities and teaching staff for only one pupil. That must be

right, and it is what the disproportionate expenditure provision

achieves. It is also right and proper that local authorities and the

LSC are accountable for discharging the entitlement duty properly and

effectively. We are taking several steps to ensure that the decisions

are taken sensibly and prudently and achieve the outcomes that we want.

I hope that, with those clarifications, I have explained what we might

mean by disproportionate expenditure without limiting the options

locally for being creative and innovative in meeting needs, and that I

have addressed the concerns expressed through the

amendments.</div><a name="06050972000266"></a>

valid point that older young people are more able to travel than

younger pupils who are still at school. I am reassured by that and, in

view of the debate and clarification that we have had on the

expenditure issue in general, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000643"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am not entirely sure whether my amendment should

be proceeded with, but I wonder whether the Under-Secretary can confirm

that schools will be expected to offer the full range of academic

subjects and will not be able to enter into collaborative arrangements

to offer subjects such as history, geography and modern languages. That

is the purpose of the amendment, although it is probably technically

flawed. It is important when delivering the new curriculum offer that

schools do not forget their fundamental role as centres of learning by

failing to offer important academic

subjects.</div><a name="06050972000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 249 and 250 refer to collaboration arrangements with further

education colleges. At present, local education authorities can make

arrangements with FE colleges to provide a course of study within one

of the entitlement areas. That is clearly a good idea because FE

colleges have the specialist facilities that many of those entitlement

areas entail. The amendments would allow the governing bodies of

schools to make those arrangements as well, so that they do not have to

rely just on local authorities. I do not see why local authorities

should have the exclusive right to make such arrangements. There may be

circumstances in which it would be easier for a school to make such

arrangements, perhaps with an FE college in its immediate locality,

instead of having to go through the local authority in all

circumstances.</div><a name="06050972000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the

Under-Secretary could clarify those two issues, that would deal with

these probing

amendments.</div><a name="06050972000281"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000644"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The amendment is indeed flawed, as the hon.

Gentleman said, but I shall address the point that I think he was

referring to: whether young people who choose to study geography,

history and modern foreign languages can do so with their home

institution.</div><a name="06050972000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

implicit that institutions working together can offer more choice and

flexibility to their students. Just as now, schools and colleges will

have the freedom to decide which courses they will provide themselves

and which, if any, they will offer to students on the rolls of other

institutions. That happens now and there are good examples throughout

the country. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that that freedom

applies not just to the delivery of new diplomas, but to all courses of

study at key stage 4, including the four entitlement areas of the arts,

humanities, design and technology, and modern foreign

languages.</div> <a name="06050972000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

issued guidance which recognises that some schools may wish to offer,

for example, more than one course of study in the arts to pupils on

their school roll. By collaborating with other providers, they can

offer greater choice to young people because they can deliver those

choices to viable class sizes. Through 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column797" />Column number: 798</div>collaboration young people have more opportunities to study the very

subjects that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are concerned

about. It also allows specialist schools with, for example, expertise

in language teaching to share their knowledge and skills with young

people from other institutions. It is vital to allow schools to

continue their collaborative arrangements in the delivery of the

curriculum to key stage 4 pupils.</div>

<a name="06050972000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Governing bodies already have

the power to make arrangements with further education institutions. The

Teather:</b> With your indulgence, Mr. Cook, I want to make a

few comments about clauses 61 and 62. The hon. Member for South Holland

and The Deepings said that he hoped that the diplomas would be welcomed

across all parties, and indeed they are. However, people at a party who

are offered canap(c)s are often very grateful to eat them, but

that is not to say that they would not be happier if they were offered

a full meal.</div> <a name="06050972000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo

Mike Tomlinson&#146;s comments. It is a great disappointment to me

and my party that the Government did not take this opportunity to

implement the Tomlinson reforms in full. Rather than to cherry-pick the

themes, it would have been better to have delivered them as a package.

Mike Tomlinson said that the

reforms</div><a name="06050972000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may only

emphasise the difference between the vocational and the academic rather

than bringing them

together&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">He

continued:</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column798" />Column number: 799</div><a name="06050972000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Not having them under a

common framework, you do risk the fact that one is seen as better than

the other...And the sad fact is that we need many more young

people to go into the vocational route and to regard them as high

quality and leading to high-quality jobs&#151;and the risk is that we

will fail to do that...My greatest fear is that vocational will

continue to be seen as second best and available and taken by those who

&#145;can't do anything better&#146;, as the phrase

goes&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bill

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000648"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Lady will have heard in the debate that we

had a few moments ago profound concerns expressed by the official

Opposition and by Members from the governing party about the

difficulties that exist in introducing a reform as radical as the one

proposed by the Government. To introduce the Tomlinson reforms, even if

one thought that they were right, would be an extremely big task. What

kind of time frame does she envisage and what hurdles does she imagine

that we would have to

overcome?</div><a name="06050972000298"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000649"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. There

needs to be a lead-in time to implement that kind of reform, but that

does not mean to say that we should stop before we have begun. It would

have been far better for the Government to state clearly their

direction of travel and, if they are willing to implement the Tomlinson

reforms, to state that as their final destination.</div>

<a name="06050972000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not what has happened.

Instead, we have had a rather lukewarm response. The official

Opposition have stated clearly that they do not want the Tomlinson

reforms implemented. I am less clear about the direction in which the

Government wish to go. They say that they have taken the essence of

Tomlinson&#146;s reforms without going the whole hog and implementing

the package. Each year, 16,000 young people leave school with no

qualifications at all. We also have one of the worst staying-on rates

post-16 in the developed world. What is more, truancy rates are very

high because students are basically voting with their feet on the

curriculum.</div> <a name="06050972000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key

to ensuring satisfaction is to ensure that we have a wide range of

choice so that students can choose a curriculum that suits their needs

and interests. They must also be offered courses that are in high

esteem and are not considered inferior to other courses. For that

reason, it is a shame that the Government did not adopt the Tomlinson

reforms and offer a single diploma rather than continuing to offer a

two-tier system. Since the late John Smith&#146;s commission on

social justice, people have been 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column799" />Column number: 800</div>advising the Government that that is the way to break down the class

divide and two-tier structure in education. As welcome as the diplomas

are, on their own they will not do anything to really break down that

two-tier system, which is what the Liberal Democrats

want.</div><a name="06050972000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservative

Members have debated at length this afternoon the need to stretch the

brightest. If we had the full implementation of the Tomlinson proposals

we would have far more flexibility to do that in order to allow pupils

to pursue those different courses. Although the options in the Bill

offer some flexibility, they will constrain students, as we debated

earlier, so that it will not be possible to mix within the same group

of entitlements. That seems a nonsense. We really want to do what

Tomlinson was arguing for: place the student at the centre and ensure

that they can pursue a set of courses suitable to their needs, and

exercise choice and responsibility with respect to their futures,

beginning at 14.</div><a name="06050972000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

have heard a lot about choice, but, for me, choice is not just about

choosing schools at 11. There should be choice right the way through

the education system and for students as well as for parents and

schools. That is what choice means to me, and I am sorry that the

Government have failed to implement

it.</div><a name="06050972000303"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000650"></a>Ms

Smith:</b> I agree with quite a few of the hon. Lady&#146;s

comments. I, too, was disappointed that Tomlinson was not included in

the Bill in full, and I believe that the single diploma is a missed

opportunity. However, the way in which Tomlinson is implemented in the

Bill offers us the best chance we have had in a long time to work

towards achieving parity of esteem between vocational and academic

curricula. I look forward to the Under-Secretary&#146;s comments on

why we did not get Tomlinson in full, and on the long-term prospects

for achieving something closer to its full implementation.</div>

<a name="06050972000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is far too much in the

Bill about the 14-to-19 curriculum. I echo entirely the comments of the

hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings about the need to ensure

that the implementation of the curriculum is well thought out. That is

the main point of the debate this afternoon: what is important is no

longer what is in the Bill, but how we implement it, because the

futures of our young people are at stake.</div>

<a name="06050972000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Brent, East

pointed out that the staying-on rate is too low in this country; it is

29th out of the 31 OECD countries. The issue is far too important for

us to play politics with it by suggesting that the 14-to-19 elements of

the Bill should be abandoned, or by voting against the Bill in its

entirety simply because it does not implement the Tomlinson reforms in

full. On that basis, I ask all hon. Members to vote for the Bill in

full on Third Reading, and I ask the Liberal Democrats to abandon their

opposition to the Bill on the grounds that it fails to implement

Tomlinson in

full.</div><a name="06050972000306"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000651"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> It is a shame that we are still looking backwards;

we have moved beyond the debates on the White Paper. I understand the

comments of the hon. Member for Brent, East, some of which were echoed

by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column800" />Column number: 801</div>Hillsborough, but Mike Tomlinson himself has said that the debate should

move on. Although I understand the desire to go back to such issues, a

huge amount has happened since then about which he is extremely

pleased. As our debates this evening have demonstrated, it is going to

transform the lives of young people in this country.</div>

<a name="06050972000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have built on the Tomlinson

working group&#146;s analysis of the weaknesses and strengths of the

existing system, and are implementing some 90 per cent. of its

recommendations. Indeed, implementing specialised diplomas in full was

a central plank of Tomlinson&#146;s recommendations, but we have done

more than that. We recognised and responded to his recommendation on

the need for a strong core to all young people&#146;s learning.

Through the diplomas, we have introduced a radical transformation of

the vocational pathways available to young people, which, importantly,

allow them greater choice and flexibility so that as they change,

develop, grow and achieve their potential, they can find vocational or

academic pathways and routes by which to progress.</div>

<a name="06050972000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">At key stage 3, we have gone

much further forward than Tomlinson and the working group suggested in

terms of reviewing that part of the curriculum to ensure that young

people receive preparation for their choices at the age of 14. As we

know from our earlier debates, new measures are being introduced to

help those who are most disengaged.</div>

<a name="06050972000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for

Sheffield, Hillsborough was right to say that the issue now is about

implementation and delivering on our commitment. There is a huge

challenge in front of us all: to do that and do it well, so that the

qualifications on offer engage, motivate, excite and inspire young

people into learning. It is important that employers recognise that

those qualifications have high status and currency in the marketplace,

that further and higher education institutions value them, and that

they are seen as providing young people with ways to enter higher

education that did not exist before. They would not exist now had we

not introduced the

diplomas.</div><a name="06050972000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not

just about transforming what goes on in the classroom and the

experience of young people. It will alter the relationships between

schools, colleges, employers and other providers in a way that no

change in the secondary school system has done since 1944. It will

dramatically transform the way in which institutions, individual

teachers and head teachers across the education system work together,

both among themselves and with external partners. I am very excited by

the possibilities that the diplomas will open up as they begin to be

implemented. That is why we have to get it absolutely right.</div>

<a name="06050972000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the desire of the

hon. Member for Brent, East to make a political point about Tomlinson.

However, I think that we have moved on. What we have in front of us is

transformational, dramatic, exciting&#151;something that all of us

can get behind. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough

is right: on Report we should all put our hands up and say yes to

transforming the lives of some of the most disadvantaged young people

in our communities.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000654"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> We do not wish to press amendments Nos. 536 to

538, but I should like to speak briefly to amendment No. 539. The

Under-Secretary touched in the previous debate on some of the issues

that it raises. We are trying to get clarity about how collaborative

arrangements can be made for young people to attend a course in another

area if the course that they want to attend is considered to be

disproportionately expensive by their local council or LSC. On Second

Reading, the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills

said:</div> <a name="06050972000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

Bill will ensure that every young person, wherever they live, can take

any of the 14 lines of the specialised diploma that we are developing

as part of our radical reforms&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,

15 March 2006; Vol. 443, c.

1472.]</div><a name="06050972000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that

does not reflect the wording of clause 62, as the hon. Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton stated earlier.</div>

<a name="06050972000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise the potential

difficulties of providing all the options in one area. However, we are

seeking to ensure that that collaboration can occur across

areas&#151;and that it will be encouraged, particularly if a young

person lives on a boundary, and there is a relatively close specialist

college or further education establishment that provides the course

that he requires&#151;and to encourage young people to take up their

opportunities and express their choices regardless of whether their

council or LSC wishes to provide a course in its

area.</div>

<a name="06050972000322"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000655"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I think that I can give the hon. Lady the kind of

assurances that she requires. Where there is already cross-border

movement of young people, it is sensible to consider offering diploma

courses in neighbouring LSC areas. The development of the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column802" />Column number: 803</div>prospectuses will address that issue. The draft prospectus guidance says

that</div><a name="06050972000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is for local

partnerships to decide the geographical coverage of their area

Prospectus. Some learners will inevitably travel across district and

county boundaries to access suitable courses. It will be valuable and

cost-effective for neighbouring partnerships to work together to

develop coherent

prospectuses&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

do not think that we need to make the requirement statutory, because it

duplicates action that we are already taking. Of course we would not

want, as a consequence, young people to be expected to travel to

neighbouring areas many miles away, which could be an unintended

consequence of the hon. Lady&#146;s suggestion, if the provision is

wrongly worded. I hope, if that is the specific issue about which she

was concerned, that I have managed to assuage her fears, and that she

will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000659"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> The amendment is basically intended to ensure that

school travel is managed in partnership with the local education

authority and the local transport authority. The reason for suggesting

that the extra words may be needed is that in some circumstances the

local education authority may not be coterminous with the local

transport authority, or not identically so. Equally, local transport

plans may be formulated by more than one local authority, so there

could be a case for making things clear.</div>

<a name="06050972000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to be a two-way

relationship between the local transport plans and the local education

authority role, in that some of what is in the local transport plan

will dictate what the LEA can do, and as a result of the Bill what

happens at the LEA will 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column803" />Column number: 804</div>have a further impact on the local transport plan. I hope that I am

making myself clear. I am convinced that, even when there is not a

separate local transport authority, the two-way relationship will

exist. We should consider the matter carefully, because the

relationships need to work really well, and perhaps stronger

relationships need to be built if there are to be separate transport

authorities.</div>

<a name="06050972000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 541 deals with

the same state of affairs at national level, and focuses on the need

for close working with the Secretary of State for Transport and

consistency with what the Secretary of State for Education and Skills

says on the matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000660"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I agree that a joined-up approach to school travel

is essential. The hon. Lady will be pleased to know that the matter is

clearly covered in the draft guidance to local authorities on school

travel, which we have made available to the Committee. The guidance

states that local authorities must adopt a strategic approach when they

are planning school travel, as well as ensuring thorough integration

with the local travel plan. The specific wording in the draft that has

been made available to the Committee is:</div>

<a name="06050972000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The strategy should be

a statement of the authority&#146;s overall vision...and should

build on, and be developed in the context of the authority&#146;s

community strategies, and local transport plan...including its

accessibility plan and bus

strategy.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome

suggestions that she might make for changes to the draft guidance, but

because the guidance has been prepared, and we can ensure that it goes

out to all local authorities, it is unnecessary to deal with the matter

in the Bill. We have taken on board her specific

concern.</div><a name="06050972000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed

subsection (7B) in amendmentNo. 541 is intended to ensure

that the Bill would place no further burden on local authorities,

duplicating duties under the Transport Act 2000. I acknowledge that

additional duties should be kept to a minimum, but I want it to be

noted that the school travel strategy and the information to be made

available to parents are not requirements under either the local

transport plan or the Transport Act 2000, which is why we need to

include them in the guidance. The information will of course be of use

to parents when they decide what schools they want to express a

preference for.</div> <a name="06050972000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

hope that the hon. Lady will understand why the additional duties are

in the Bill. The Department is providing an additional &#163;4

million a year to local authorities to build the capacity to carry out

the additional duties on information for parents. Both the need to

include the matter in the guidance and the resources for local

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000664"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Robert Louis Stevenson, whom we have not heard

mentioned thus far in our considerations,

said:</div><a name="06050972000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For my

part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for

travel&#146;s sake. The great affair is to

move.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">That cannot be

said of school children, who travel for a particular purpose. Francis

Bacon

said:</div><a name="06050972000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Travel,

in the younger sort, is a part of

education&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">At an

altogether more mundane level, paragraph 15 on page 182 of the

regulatory impact assessment states that school transport arrangements

are intended to</div><a name="06050972000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;extend

the role of local authorities in supporting access to schools through

improved travel and transport arrangements, particularly for children

from the most disadvantaged

families.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also

suggests that the Bill

will</div><a name="06050972000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;encourage local

authorities to adopt a more strategic approach to travel and transport

arrangements on the journey to

school&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet in defining

travel arrangements, the Bill makes no mention of travelling to

workplace learning or to any other learning provider such as further

education colleges. We know from what the Government have

said&#151;it is an ambition that the Opposition share&#151;that

that is very much part of what they hope to achieve through greater

collaboration, particularly to deliver the diplomas that we have just

debated at some

length.</div><a name="06050972000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for

the amendments is clear. It is absolutely certain that children

increasingly need to travel to places other than school to achieve what

we all hope that they might in their education.</div>

<a name="06050972000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s record

on school transport is patchy. From 1996 to 1998, 36 per cent. of

primary school children and 21 per cent. of secondary school children

were driven to school. By 2004, the figures were 41 per cent. and 22

per cent. respectively. I call the record patchy because I make the

assumption that we are all keen for children to be able to get to

school without being driven there. We want children to walk to school

or use buses where appropriate, because we know the environmental

impact of the school run. I do not entirely blame the Government for

the trend; in my own village I see people who live within a

stone&#146;s throw of a school driving their children to

it.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column805" />Column number: 806</div><a name="06050972000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been a cultural shift

in assumptions about the drive to school. Having said that, I should

say also that parents cite safety as a key consideration; children are

allowed to walk or cycle to school only if their parents are convinced

that it is safe for them to do so. Some of those concerns may be

unrealistic, but some are rooted in real fears and we should not be too

quick to dismiss them.</div>

<a name="06050972000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, 15 per cent. of people

said that they did not feel safe walking in their local streets, and 33

per cent. said that they were fairly or very concerned about crime on

public transport. Arrangements for school transport are confused and

often difficult to understand. In substantial measure, the Bill puts in

place proposals that were in the Bill whose progress was interrupted by

the general election.</div>

<a name="06050972000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it looked into these

matters for its 2004 report on school transport, the Transport

Committee was not entirely happy with the Government&#146;s thinking.

For example, it

stated:</div><a name="06050972000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any

new system should ensure that expenditure savings on school transport

can be taken into account when investment decisions on infrastructure

measures, such as providing safe footpaths or cycle routes, are

made...If people&#146;s habits are going to be changed, there

must be clear limits to walking distance based on age combined with a

legal definition of a safe route which is sufficiently flexible to

reflect the range of different conditions that children face on their

journey to school.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">More

disturbingly, it said

that</div><a name="06050972000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

current system produces some school buses which are demonstrably

dangerous. This should not be allowed...It is unacceptable for

school children to be forced to use the oldest buses on the

road...the Department for Transport should, as a matter of

urgency, establish a working group to consider how services could be

integrated&#148;.</div><a name="06050972000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a bigger

section, it complained about the lack of integration. It was also

disappointed that the Government were not allowing more</div>

<a name="06050972000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;freedom to experiment with new

ways of specifying and providing school transport as part of a wider

transport system.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

supported the principle of pilot schemes, but felt that</div>

<a name="06050972000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government&#146;s leisurely

approach is an

indulgence.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect

that it would take a similar view now, given that much of this Bill

reflects those original proposals.

</div><a name="06050972000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Transport

Committee claimed

that</div><a name="06050972000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;school transport is

in crisis now and the effects of this crisis are felt by everyone who

needs to travel at peak

hours.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was</div>

<a name="06050972000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disappointed that the Government

has not provided for the pilot schemes to be far more

radical.&#148;</div><a name="06050972000358"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000665"></a>Mary

Creagh:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the survey

published last week by Cycling England? It says that parents of 11 to

18-year-olds could collectively save &#163;500 million a year if

their children cycled to school. Less than 2 per cent. of young people

of between 11 and 18 cycle to school. The charity says that young

people could save 40 minutes a day and &#163;4 each by cycling to

school each day.</div> <a name="06050972000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does

the hon. Gentleman agree that any campaign to get children on their

bikes must ensure that adequate panniers are provided so that they can

carry 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column806" />Column number: 807</div>their shoes and school books on their bikes, and not have their mothers

coming behind them in their Lexuses carrying

them?</div><a name="06050972000360"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000666"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> We do not have a Lexus, and my son walks to and

from school. I agree that it is very important that we encourage more

children to cycle or walk to school. The many who cannot, for all kinds

of reasons, should be encouraged to use school transport. To do that,

we have to face the fact that the delivery on school transport&#151;I

do not entirely blame the Government, as the problem goes back a long

time&#151;is patchy. I concur with the Transport Committee: we need

to be more radical in our reappraisal of school

transport.</div><a name="06050972000462"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000667"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he is indeed

speaking to amendments Nos. 260 and 261? It is just that I seem to be

losing the plot.</div>

<a name="06050972000362"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000668"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> If I were more cruel than I am, I would say two

things, and I shall rehearse them with the Committee to decide whether

they are too cruel for me to repeat. The first is that my observation

of the hon. Lady&#146;s contributions over several days suggests that

she lost the plot long ago. The second is that when I last looked, you

were in the Chair, Mr. Cook, and she was not. However, those comments

would perhaps be ungracious, so I shall not repeat

them.</div>

<a name="06050972000363"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000669"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. Amendment No. 260 please.

Concentrate.</div>

<a name="06050972000364"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000670"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The amendments would broaden the scope of the Bill

for the reasons that I gave at the outset. As I said, we must

appreciate the fact that many children who need to access learning will

not do so at school. In discussing the amendments in a slightly broader

way than they might have demanded, I hope that I have highlighted our

profound concerns about school transport and our desire that the

Government seek radical solutions to deal with what their Select

Committee&#151;or, at least, a Select Committee dominated by Labour

Members&#151;regarded as a crisis.</div>

<a name="06050972000365"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000671"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I support the amendments. They suggest an

excellent way of promoting collaboration, although they do not seem to

have much to do with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech. I shall be

interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response, and it is difficult

to know whether to vote for the amendments, because we cannot quite see

how they match up with the speech we have just heard, but in principle

we believe that they are sound.</div>

<a name="06050972000366"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000672"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I cannot remember who said that it was better to

travel than to arrive, but that is true neither of children at school,

nor of this Committee&#151;if it were, we would never get to bed

tonight.</div> <a name="06050972000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments raise drafting questions, and I am not absolutely certain

that they are as accurate as we would need them to be. Rather than

going into details about the appropriateness of the drafting, however,

let me make it clear that the Education Act 1996 requires 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column807" />Column number: 808</div>that education during school hours&#151;this is the point about which

the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) was

concerned&#151;must be provided free. That includes materials and

equipment, as well as transport provided by the local authority or the

school to carry pupils between the school and an activity. Therefore,

if children and pupils of sixth form age are registered at schools, any

transport between institutions during the school day must already be

provided free of charge.</div>

<a name="06050972000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall try to narrow my

remarks down now because of the lateness of the hour. Under current

arrangements, responsibility for home-to-school transport and for

transport arrangements between institutions or other places where

education and training are provided falls to different bodies. Local

authorities have responsibility to provide home-to-school transport for

children of compulsory school age and transport policy statements for

pupils over the age of 16. Responsibility for the transport

arrangements involved in education or training received away from a

school lies with the school itself, rather than the local authority. In

most areas, the various arrangements will continue, with local

authorities retaining responsibility for getting the kids to

school&#151;that is the shorthand&#151;while the schools at which

children are registered retain responsibility for ensuring that any

transport needs during the school day are catered for.</div>

<a name="06050972000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">On FE, the 2002 Act places a

duty on local authorities to plan and publish annual transport policy

statements for young people of sixth form age who are attending an FE

institution. They are required to follow clear criteria about the

transport support that they offer FE students aged 16 to 19 to ensure

that no student is prevented from accessing or participating in further

education because of the lack of transport services or support. Where

student support is assessed as necessary to enable them to access or

complete their courses, it could be made available by way of discounts,

subsidies, travelcards, bus passes, or indeed cash.</div>

<a name="06050972000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">A point was raised about young

people out at work who embark on entry to employment funded by learning

and skills councils, or on programme-led pathways in work-based

learning, and who do not pursue their course at a school or further

education institution. When necessary, support for their travel costs

can be provided by the training provider, the learning and skills

council providing funds for that training provider to cover the

transport costs. We also have education maintenance allowances to help

with day-to-day costs when young people stay on at

school.</div><a name="06050972000371"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000673"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I want to be clear. Is the Minister saying that the

money is ring-fenced, that the learning and skills council would

allocate money based on real demand, and that the money would go

straight to the students? How would it work in

practice?</div><a name="06050972000372"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000674"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The nature of those relationships and funding

arrangements are a matter for the contract between the learning and

skills council and the training provider. There is a negotiation to

determine whether funds are required, depending on where the student

lives and so on. The situation varies between students 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column808" />Column number: 809</div>and providers, but the LSC provides such funds to training providers to

enable access.</div><a name="06050972000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given

the local authorities&#146; duties relating to home-to-school

transport, it has been suggested that the local authority might be best

placed to organise the necessary travel between education institutions

during the school day, but that does not follow logically, because the

local authority&#146;s role could be small or large, depending on the

nature of the service required. Travel between institutions might be by

minibus from one school to the next, or to an FE

institution&#151;that is best organised by the institutions

themselves. It is not a good idea to place a duty on local authorities

to make arrangements when they are not in the best position to do

so.</div><a name="06050972000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am conscious of

the hour. I said that there are lots of different examples of different

relationships that are being piloted to enable travel between

institutions, such as in the travel pathfinders that we established, as

well as in respect of the 14-to-19 pathfinders&#151;the

collaborations that we discussed earlier. Nevertheless, the Government

recognise that it could be beneficial for local authorities to have a

role in providing innovative solutions to travel needs, so we have

included transport arrangements that support pupils receiving education

at more than one institution as part of our delivery of the 14-to-19

strategy. That is going on as we speak, and we shall pilot innovative

options and approaches, monitor progress, and learn the lessons. Some

of the school travel pathfinders starting in September 2009 will be

evaluated before 2012, so that we can learn all the

lessons.</div><a name="06050972000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe

that I have explained our approach. Much more will come from the

learning that derives from developing local collaborations and

partnerships. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will

withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06050972000376"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050972000675"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Under-Secretary has answered some of the points

that I raised and that were amplified by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset

and North Poole, but I remain concerned about the capacity to provide

transport for children engaged in all types of learning, because I

suspect that over time and through collaboration, as the hon. Lady

mentioned, learning will increasingly take place in different

locations. The Under-Secretary will know that one of the principal

parental concerns about school travel is safety. Given that many 14 and

15-year-olds will be travelling to different locations, such as

workplace learning 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column809" />Column number: 810</div>locations, external learning providers and FE colleges, I am worried

that we have not yet got this right. I should like to see it covered by

the Bill, if for no other reason than to highlight the significance and

importance of transport as a potential disincentive to the success of

collaboration.</div><a name="06050972000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

represent a rural constituency, so I am well aware that some 14 or

15-year-olds will travel 10, 15 or even 20 miles to get to the best

possible source of learning. I know that many parents and students

identify transport issues as one of the principal
