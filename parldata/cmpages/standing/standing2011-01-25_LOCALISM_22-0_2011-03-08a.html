clause relates to the courts making orders for possession on a flexible
tenancy of no less than two years. In principle that is welcome, but
what assessment has the Minister’s Department made of the
potential backlog in the courts considering such cases, as a result of
changes in policy elsewhere? Does the Minister have any concern, given
the growing number of delayed cases and existing pressures on the court
system, that some cases will be so delayed that the tenant may well be
left living in a property which the registered social landlord wants to
take possession of, for longer than the six-month notice period? There
are also concerns about the cost implications of the changes
included  in the clause, with a potential additional £5
million in court fees. Will the Minister please confirm that
figure?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000048">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 137, as the hon. Lady
said, provides that a court cannot make an order for possession of a
dwelling-house let by a housing association with a fixed term of at
least two years, unless the landlord has given the tenant at least six
months’ notice in writing, stating that they do not intend to
grant another tenancy and informing the tenant how they can obtain help
and advice. During the fixed term of an assured tenancy, the tenant
will enjoy the same protections from eviction as an assured tenant. The
landlord would need to demonstrate to the court both that one or more
of the grounds for possession is proven and that they are acting
reasonably in seeking possession.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also want
to ensure that when the fixed term of an assured shorthold tenancy
approaches its end, appropriate protections are in place. We would
expect landlords to discuss options with tenants well in advance of the
fixed term of their tenancy coming to an end. In many cases, we would
expect the tenancy to be renewed, and we debated aspects of that this
morning in considerable detail. When the landlord decides that the
tenancy should not be extended, it is essential that the tenant is
given time to find alternative accommodation and is supported by their
landlord in doing so. The six-month notice period before a possession
order can be granted provides the tenant with a reasonable time in
which to find a new home. Our proposals for the tenancy standard make
it clear that social landlords will be required to grant general needs
tenancies with a fixed term of  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 864<a class="bkMark" name="Column864">&#160;</a>
                           </div>at least two years, so that that protection will always be applicable.
As we discussed this morning, two years is the shortest period for
exceptional circumstances and the Government regard a five-year period
as a realistic minimum, especially for vulnerable families and those
with children.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
proposals for the tenancy standard also make it clear that a tenant
must have the right to challenge the landlord’s initial decision
not to renew a tenancy. We propose that a landlord be required to
provide advice and assistance to the tenant in finding new
accommodation when a decision not to renew a tenancy is confirmed. The
hon. Lady was seeking assurance that the potential costs of
implementing the clause as stated in the impact assessment are correct.
Let me assure her that all impact assessments are subject to a rigorous

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I
will reiterate what I said earlier about security of tenure. Our
commitment to protect and respect the rights of existing tenants
extends to guaranteeing that they will receive a new secure and assured
tenancy if they are required to move because, for example, their
existing home is demolished as part of a regeneration programme, or if
they choose to move to another social-rent property. Clauses 132 and
133, which we debated this morning, specifically make provision to
ensure that even where an existing secure or assured tenancy exchanges
with a flexible tenant, their security is retained, subject to any
exceptions made in regulations. The large majority of available
properties to which existing tenants could choose to move will continue
to be at social rent.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In light of
this morning’s debate, I will reflect further on the case for
extending the guarantee of continued security where existing tenants
choose to move to an affordable-rent tenancy. That is, rightly, part of
the debate about what should be included in our direction to the
regulator on the content of a tenancy standard. We want to ensure that
disincentives for existing tenants to move are minimised. Equally, we
must ensure that we do not prejudice the delivery of new affordable
homes by limiting the flexibility of providers to generate new
supply.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000053">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I welcome
the move to clarify the position, as there was considerable worry this
morning. However, the Minister’s last remarks, implying that the
measures guarantee that existing secure tenants can keep their secure
tenancy if they move to a new tenancy, even if that is not designated
as a secure tenancy, fit very uncomfortably with what the Minister is
saying, especially his remarks about giving the landlord the
opportunity to develop new affordable-rent homes, because that would be
a direct incentive to develop homes in which security did not apply if
there was no clear guarantee that tenants moving into such
accommodation would keep their secure tenancy, if they previously
enjoyed one.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000054">&#160;</a>

grateful if the Minister will clarify his intentions. Is he still
saying, as he was this morning, that if tenants choose to move into an
affordable-rent tenancy, they will not be guaranteed to keep their
security? Or is he saying that the matter is being reconsidered and
that the Government will try to maintain security of tenure to all
existing tenants of secure tenancies, as has been
promised?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000055">&#160;</a>

Amess, your colleague, Mr Bayley, commented on the need to not veer off
the path of any clause being discussed. In light of that, it is
interesting that the Minister seems so nervous about what he has said
in relation to earlier clauses that he has had to re-explain himself at
the beginning of this afternoon’s sitting. I am still far from
happy with his response, which is very much out of kilter with the
statements made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing and
Local Government. I am interested to hear that he will look again at
the issue, but it certainly does not fit with everything that has been
said prior to today’s Committee sittings. I shall not, however,

not want the Minister to get too carried away with that response. A
great deal of effort has gone into getting to the point where this
running sore for local authorities can be dealt with. It was no mean
feat to pick a way through the complex nature of the HRA and ensure
that the outcome was seen as fair by the different authorities. I
believe that the former Housing Minister, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey), departmental officials
and local government representatives deserve credit for advancing the
issue, as do the present Government for picking up the baton and
running with

measures introduced by Labour were widely praised, including by the
then chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, Sir Bob
Kerslake, who is now the Department’s permanent secretary, and
by the Campaign for Fair and Local Housing Finance and the Local
Government Association. All councils were to have 10% more each year to
spend on management and maintenance and there would be a one-off
redistribution and allocation of debt between authorities. It was
assumed that rental income in the proposed allocation of housing debt
was based on the current rental policy, and that an additional 7%
discount rate would enable councils to build or fund about 10,000 new
homes each year after 2014-15. The coalition’s proposals mirror
much of my right hon. Friend’s plan,

of concerns about that, and we may return to them later. Maximising the
control that local authorities have over their housing finance will be
welcome, but concerns remain about the Government’s final
scheme, not least about some of the ongoing central control. However,
the clause has our support and I hope that the Minister will continue

probe the Government on clause 141 with new clause 20, which was tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East and me. It is clear that
there is agreement across the House that the reforms to the housing
revenue account are welcome and that we must deliver more financial
autonomy to local authorities, with the hope that that will lead to
further investment in social housing.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000077">&#160;</a>

context, the clause stands out slightly as continuing Whitehall
interference in local authorities’ ability to manage their own
budgets and revenue flows and ensure appropriate investment in social
housing. It is at odds with the general localist approach of the
Government and the Bill. We will not effectively give local communities
the autonomy that we seek to give them if we continue to leave them
dependent on Whitehall. I am keen to ask Ministers the rationale behind
ensuring, as the Bill does, that the Treasury can still come and take
75% of net receipts from any right to buy sales, in a kind of grab and
run on local authorities. How do they square that with the
Bill’s overall intention of delivering greater autonomy and
local decision making?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000078">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Bradford East and I are usually supportive of the
right to buy. It has extended to hundreds of thousands of people the
ability to enjoy their own home. However, the scheme has failed to
ensure that replacement housing stock was made available. As I
understand it, over the past 10 years, almost 500,000 homes have been
sold off under the right to buy scheme. That has benefited the people
who availed themselves of that opportunity, but in the same 10-year
period we have had only 200,000 new homes built. We

have no intention of pressing new clause 20 to a Division, but I am
curious to see what the Minister’s thinking is on this. Perhaps
he can tell us the number of homes that have been sold off under right
to buy during the past few years and the amount that that has been
worth to the Treasury in revenue from the grab back on the right to buy
receipts. Will he tell us what the Department projects for future right
to buy sales and what that amount of revenue for the Treasury will be?
If, as I suspect, the amount of revenue that the Treasury anticipates
receiving from the 75% grab back of the right to buy receipts has gone
down significantly, how does he square that with the localist approach
that seems to embody the rest of the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000080">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree with many of the comments made by the
hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay, particularly on the issue of
Whitehall’s interference. Under the clause, the Secretary of
State has the power to set the framework that will be used for
calculating the value of different payments. Local authorities have
expressed concerns that the right to buy receipts should not be set at
75%. Local authorities should be able to retain a significantly larger
proportion of the receipts, and some feel that 100% of those receipts
should be retained locally to encourage the building of new homes. I
understand that there is a concession that takes account of property
losses so that local authorities take on less debt. However, there
appears to be a very strong view from those same local authorities that
that is not their preferred option. The pooling principle runs counter
to the localist agenda. Can the Minister explain why the Government
have opted to retain all but a quarter of the capital
receipts?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000081">&#160;</a>

remarks made by the hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay
about the assumptions that the Minister may have made in relation to
potential future right to buy receipts. I will be interested to hear
the Minister’s answer to the figures that the hon. Gentleman
requested. Does the Minister have any worry that retention on the
current scale reduces the impact of local asset management in an area?
How many homes does he expect local authorities to be able to build as
a result of the proposed changes? What modelling has been done on the
revenue stream for each local authority moving forward, and at what
point does the Minister expect to see local authorities looking at net
gains in council housing in their area as a result of the potential
that they might have to build—or even five or 10 years down the

141 sets out the framework for the valuation or determination of each
council’s housing business and the resulting settlement payment
that comes as a consequence of that. The level of each settlement
payment and who pays who will be calculated in three stages. In the
first stage, each council with housing stock will have

                           </div>the value of their business calculated over 30 years. That will be based
on a formula that takes account of expected rental income from the
local authority’s housing and their expected expenditure on
management, maintenance and repair of the housing, which includes
disabled adaptations.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000084">&#160;</a>

step is that that 30-year cash flow of income and expenditure is
converted into a capital sum or valuation, using a standard discounted
cash-flow technique and a discount rate of 6.5%. The third step is that
the capital valuation is compared with the housing debt currently held
by a council to calculate the settlement payment between central
Government and each council. The outcome for each council is different,
and again, I have papers which I would be happy to circulate for the
Committee, which show the projected impact on councils. This is the
information that was circulated to councils in the most recent stage of

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay asked some practical
questions about the progress on the right to buy. In the period between
1979 and 1997, there were 1.3 million sales of right to buy property.
In the period between 1997 and 2010, there were just over 600,000 sales
under right to buy. In the most recent years, in 2007, there were just
under 12,000, but there was a very steep decline in 2008 to 2,800
sales, and in 2009-10, to 2,200 sales. That is clearly a product of the
changing economic environment. It is also a reflection of the fact that
the available stock—or, at least, the available marketable
stock—is declining. We have not made any specific projections of
the right to buy sales, but it would seem realistic to assume that that
low level of right to buy sales will continue for a significant part of
the next four years, for the same reasons: shortage of mortgage
finance, the preference given to more marketable properties, and the
capacity of tenants to become purchasers in the current economic
environment.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That has a
direct consequence on the impact of the 75% retention. In 2006-07, the
amount of money that was retained or surrendered to central
Government by local government as a result of right to buy
was £831 million. By 2009-10 that had fallen to just
£133 million, a reflection of the very much reduced
level of sales. I therefore want to say to friends and colleagues on
the Committee that whatever the merits or otherwise of this retention,
it will have a small effect—certainly as compared with previous
years—on the spending power or capital-raising power of local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In an ideal
world I would agree with colleagues in local government who sought a
100% retention of receipts. However, for exactly the reason to which I
alluded before—the reason that the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich, when he was standing on this side of the
Committee, found it difficult to get his reforms a hearing—one
has to arrange these matters so that there is a consensus that allows
the reform to be delivered. This is part of the consensus-building in
order to achieve that.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000088">&#160;</a>

take the figure for 2006-07 of about £831 million being recouped
by the Treasury and extrapolate that over the years that right to buy
has been operating, we have lost literally billions of pounds from
local authorities that they could have invested in social housing. If
they had done so, perhaps we would not be in quite the predicament that

Councils and the Local Government Association are extremely anxious
about the clear message that they say that clause 142 sends.
“Once and for all” and self-financing, which were so well
trailed by the Minister for Housing and Local Government—he is
quite good at trailing things—appears not to be “once and
for all” but something that can be reopened at any time. Will
the Minister explain why the Secretary of State needs the power to
reopen the buy-out figure after the council has made the settlement
payment? That potentially means that some councils would have to pay
more. It provides significant new uncertainty for local authorities at
a time when they are already struggling with front-loaded cuts to their
budgets.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000096">&#160;</a>

provides, as the hon. Lady has said, for further payments between a
local authority and central Government under certain circumstances.
Those circumstances are arranged so that we are limiting payments to
cases where there has been a change in one of the matters that was
taken into consideration in calculating the previous payment, including
rental income, expenditure needs and existing debt. By contrast, no
assumptions about efficiency gains that could be achieved by councils
under self-financing will be made in determining the settlement
payments, so they cannot be a possible trigger to reopen the
settlement.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000101">&#160;</a>

exercising the power in this clause, central Government would have to
issue a further determination and consult on it. Exercising this power
would represent a major change in policy and would entail a new and
significant programme of work for both local and central Government.
The purpose of the clause is to protect both parties to the
agreement—both central Government and local
authorities—from being locked into a deal that, because of
changes in policy affecting either a landlord’s income or cost,
no longer reflected a fair valuation and might have a material impact
on viability. For instance, if the Government were to introduce a major
change to national rental policy, or perhaps a significant increase in
the environmental standards expected of council housing, that could
upset the arithmetic of the equation. In those cases, it would be right
for there to be an option for the reconsideration of the payment
regime. I understand that councils may be concerned about that
possibility, because they think that it may introduce instability and
prevent effective long-term planning.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000102">&#160;</a>

political complexions feel that self-financing was a good start and
that the Secretary of State therefore did not need to impose limits on
the borrowing. If the Government can intervene and set unqualified
arbitrary limits on how local councils run their local housing
business, that freedom to think and act imaginatively is taken away.
That is extremely centrist. If councils are already bound by a
prudential code, which is effectively managed borrowing, this provision
is wholly unnecessary. Can the Minister tell us what evidence there is
that councils behave
irresponsibly?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000109">&#160;</a>

Government to control the amount of overall borrowing held by local
authorities in relation to their housing revenue account. That is the
debt and the interest that relates to their landlord role.
Self-financing will give local authorities direct control over a large
income stream. Prudential borrowing rules have been effective in
ensuring that local authority borrowing is affordable locally, but our
reforms must also support the coalition’s first priority of
reducing the national deficit, so borrowing under self-financing must
be affordable within national fiscal policies, not just within local
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000112">&#160;</a>

authorities, the borrowing cap will be set at the self-financing
valuation. That will mean that local authorities whose notional
borrowing for housing revenue account subsidy purposes is the same as
their actual borrowing, will have a cap which is set at the level of
their opening debt under self-financing. Our recently published policy
document, “Implementing self-financing for council
housing,” states that any council whose opening debt is above
its self-financing valuation at the start will have its cap set at the
higher level.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000113">&#160;</a>

summarise the chart, there are 171 councils that have stock, and

have that headway. The names of those and their amounts, in both of
those categories, are on the sheet that I will circulate to the

about that. The number of winners certainly exceeds the number of
non-winners, but even the non-winners are not losers, because where
there is a cap that would otherwise be below their notional spending,
that spending will be protected. I am not sure that I mentioned this,

and advise people of the benefits of moving to another area and offer
them quite a lot of detail about the options available to
them. Over the years we have seen schemes come and

appears to have been found, but there seems to be another little local
difficulty: there appears to be a bit of a challenge with the Greater
London authority, where the Mayor seems to want to commission a
separate pan-London mobility project. I am not sure how that will sit
alongside what is proposed in the Bill and whether it is necessary for
the Mayor to go to these lengths. It would be helpful to know what
discussions the Department have had with the Mayor about the different
schemes and his logic in going ahead on his
own.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000125">&#160;</a>

effective use of this service, ensuring that sharing databases offers a
smooth service, could potentially help to reduce the almost 60,000
under-occupied bedrooms—perhaps not on a massive scale, but to
some degree. Our casework tells us that we all have people who would
like to downsize but are reluctant to do so because they are worried
about moving out of area, moving into the unknown. Clearly, with better
communications and better data, some of those fears might be allayed
and we might encourage a few more

reply, which is that it does not surprise me to hear that. On a more
serious note, in many cases, of course, that is as a result of changes
in relationships and often represents significant problems for families
and I do not dismiss that lightly. Obviously, the scheme that we
propose will be as accessible to female as to male tenants, or, indeed,
to members of households who live in social accommodation and think
that it might be a reasonable prospect to change—to downsize, to
relocate or whatever it might be. I think that we have agreement across
the Committee that there is a good scheme here which will benefit
tenants. As the hon. Lady says, it is a modest improvement; we do not
expect it to have a dramatic impact, but it will have a real impact
which will improve the lives of a good number of social tenants

discussions on the question of entitlement to retain a secure tenancy
in the context of a move of tenure. Clearly, if the Minister is not
able to give the kind of satisfactory assurance that we were seeking,
that would be an inhibitor on the potential effectiveness of any such
scheme. Rather more importantly, I have been ruminating on a situation
that could apply, where the local authority or landlord is in a
position to choose whether or not to extend security on the part of a
tenant who moves into another accommodation. If that discretion were to
exist, different rules would apply in different areas. The likelihood
of tenants being able to understand the likely implications of a move
would be seriously prejudiced. This is a very serious point about
measures that will not impede the effectiveness of a mobility scheme,

of London to other parts of the country. There have  not been
any formal discussions between the Mayor and the Department on the

emerge, there will be the opportunity to do so. But they are not in

                           </strong> I agree with the hon. Lady that it is important
to get it right. My understanding is that we are very far along the

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall pick up the less contentious point made by the right hon. Member
for Greenwich and Woolwich. Existing secure tenants retain security of
tenure if they move, even if they swap with a flexible tenant. I hope
that reassures him on the specific point. There is a more general
point. For the foreseeable future, the number of affordable-rent
tenancies available, in proportion to the total number of social-rent
tenancies, will be very small. So the large majority of new tenancies
offered to people on the waiting list or people who are seeking to
transfer will continue to be social tenancies, rather than
affordable-rent
tenancies.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000136">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that comment. If it is
emphatically the case that tenants who are moving under a mobility
scheme of this nature, from a secure tenancy into another—such
as an affordable rent tenancy—retain their security of tenure,
that is a very helpful commitment. However, it does not sit terribly
well with what the Minister said this morning about tenants who opt for
an affordable rent tenancy, not necessarily retaining their security. I
press him to tell us whether he envisages that those tenants who
transfer under a mobility scheme would enjoy a greater benefit than
those tenants who wish to move within the same area, from a secure
tenancy to an affordable rent tenancy. If so, what is the reason for
the different treatment of tenants moving under the two different
mechanisms?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000137">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The clause requires only a brief mention now as
it is linked to schedule 16 on which we shall have a wider debate. We
have some worries about the movement of the Tenant Services Authority
in the Government’s much publicised bonfire of the quangos. The
watering down of the body that represents tenants in social housing is
to be regretted. We have 50 years of evidence that there is a need for
the legal rights of tenants, representation of tenants and support for
tenants so that they can be involved fully in the management of their
housing. It took more than 20 years until, interestingly, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 877<a class="bkMark" name="Column877">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a Conservative Government recognised the rights of social housing
tenants to be consulted. Indeed, it was not until the TSA was set up
that tenants had the right themselves to hold their landlords to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have seen that, by ensuring effective monitoring and enforcement of
tenants’ rights alongside legislation for their rights, that has
offered the best protection. Neither approach has worked on its own.
Failure to involve properly and consult tenants has a cost—a
cost that research shows has led to costly design failures and
management mistakes. General alienation from housing will not be helped
by a high turnover in the social sector as a result of some of the
Government’s policies. It does not lead to successful
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Overall,
performance did improve between 1998 and 2008, and the need for
inspections diminished. The reorganisation of the Housing Corporation
into two bodies, the Homes and Communities Agency and the TSA, offered
the opportunity to continue and, indeed, to develop the tenant focus.
It gave opportunities for tenants themselves to draw attention to any
failure of agreed standards of delivery. Under the Bill, the rights of
tenants are being reduced, their ability to build and form strong
communities weakened and now the specific body to represent and respond
to tenants’ rights issues and worries is being effectively
abolished. Unless the Minister says something reassuring, we intend to
vote against the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000145">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Lady says, the clause introduces
schedule 16, which transfers the regulatory functions of the Tenant
Services Authority to the Homes and Communities Agency, acting through
an independent regulation committee. The Housing and Regeneration Act
2008 created the TSA as a stand-alone regulator when regulation had
previously been delivered within the Housing Corporation alongside its
other functions. The TSA delivered a new regulatory framework, which is
being amended under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Last
October, we published a review of social housing regulation and that
report recommended that the Tenant Services Authority be abolished and
its functions transferred to the HCA in line with the
Government’s overall objective of reducing the number and cost
of quangos. To maintain lender confidence, the review recommended that
regulation be discharged by an independent regulation committee within
the HCA with that independence enshrined in statute. That is exactly
what we are doing under clause 150 and schedule 16. We are giving
effect to the recommendations in that review on the transfer of the
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
changes are given effect by several amendments to the 2008 Act, which
are set out under schedule 16. They include making it an objective of
the HCA to support the discharge of the regulatory functions by the
regulation committee and making it clear that the HCA must discharge
those functions through the regulatory
committee.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000148">&#160;</a>

regulatory regime. I therefore beg to move the clause and the

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
285 is fairly self-explanatory. It brings in a requirement for the HCA
to provide a support team of regulatory staff should the regulation
committee of the HCA request one. That will be necessary for the
committee’s smooth running and efficiency, and I hope that the
Minister will consider it. There could be unexpected pressures, and
that additional capacity to ensure that co-regulation works and
provides a good service could well be necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
286 might sound a bit familiar to anyone who has knowledge of the Bank
of England Act 1998, which I am sure is bedtime reading for Government
Members. They all look a bit sleepy, so they were probably up last
night reading it. I do not know whether any members of this Committee
had the pleasure of sitting on that Committee, but this amendment is
modelled on the language used to set up the Monetary Policy Committee.
It would ensure that members are appointed for a set period of three
years and that appointments take place by rotation to ensure some
continuity while allowing for the committee to be refreshed with new
members. It is good enough for the Bank of England, so I would suggest
to the Minister that it is probably a rigorous enough structure for the
HCA.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
287 removes the word “unsuitable” from proposed new
section 92D(7)(d) of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. I am unsure
what the Minister believes the legal definition of
“unsuitable” to be, but I am sure there is one. I am sure
it would be of benefit to the Committee if he could explain it to us in
due course. Who would be the judge of that unsuitability? The other
disqualifications listed in proposed new paragraph (d), being either
“unfit” or “unable”, ought to be strong
enough and we would have some worries about the use of
“unsuitable” unless the Minister can convince us of its
necessity. Once again this amendment is modelled on the legislation
underpinning membership of the MPC. I do not believe the Secretary of
State needs greater powers to step in and remove someone from the
regulation committee than the Chancellor of the Exchequer needs with
regard to the Bank of
England.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000191">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
288 ties in with amendment 285 and would ensure that the regulation
committee’s powers may be delegated only to specific regulatory
staff within

			Column number: 880<a class="bkMark" name="Column880">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the HCA. That is a principle of good governance, and without it the Bill
would permit those powers to be delegated to any staff within the
HCA, including the chief executive. We feel the
powers should be reserved for a specific category of staff, and I hope
the Minister understands the reasons for this
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000192">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendments relate to schedule 16,
which transfers the regulatory functions currently performed by the
TSA, the regulator of social housing, to the HCA acting through an
independent regulation committee. It is, of course, important for
maintaining lender confidence in the social housing sector and for
ensuring continued protection for tenants that the new regulation
committee is strong, independent and properly supported, which will
enable it to discharge its functions effectively. The legislation is
designed to ensure that the committee is effective and independent and
that all regulatory decisions are for the committee
only.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
285 and 288 are intended to ensure that the committee is properly
staffed and supported, but the details of how the committee will
operate are surely for the chair of the committee, once he or she has
been appointed in consultation with the HCA and the Department for
Communities and Local Government. The legislation sets a requirement in
section 2 of the 2008 Act on the HCA to facilitate the regulatory work
of the committee. That means ensuring that it has the resources to
deliver its objectives, which would, of course, include appropriate
staff, but I do not see the need to specify precise details about
staffing in the legislation. To do so would prevent flexible, efficient
and effective working across the agency. It might, for example, prevent
the sharing of common corporate
services.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
286 addresses the terms of appointment and, again, the Government agree
that it would clearly be sensible for appointments to the committee to
expire at different times to ensure continuity and avoid all members
leaving at the same time. But such detail is not appropriate in the
Bill and would add to the complexity of the provisions. Our preference
is that the terms and timing of appointments can best be handled
through the advertising and appointment process, following best
practice guidance set by the Office of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
287 relates to the power to remove regulation committee members on the
grounds that they are unsuitable. It is important that the committee is
able to function effectively, to retain the confidence of investors and
the social housing sector, and the power allows the Secretary of State
to intervene where necessary, if a member is considered unsuitable to
carry out the necessary work of the
committee.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asks for a legal definition, but perhaps it would help if I
just gave an example. A member might still be able to carry out his or
her functions without being suitable to exercise them, and that might
arise from an irretrievable breakdown in the relationship between the
member and the committee. Perhaps the member so disagrees with a
decision made by the committee that he or she engages in activities
such as filibustering—thankfully we are never subject to that in
this place—that deliberately disrupt the committee’s work
but nevertheless fall short of qualifying the member as
unfit.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Proposed
new section 92D(7)(d) of the 2008 Act gives the Secretary of State
reasonable scope, in allowing him to remove a member when he thinks
that that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 881<a class="bkMark" name="Column881">&#160;</a>
                           </div>member is unable, unfit or unsuitable to exercise his or her functions,
and the formulation is much more likely to be workable in practice than
if we sought to draw up an exhaustive list of occasions on which the
power may be used. However exhaustive such a list were, one can be
certain that the first situation that arose would
not be on the list, which would have been written into primary
legislation. The Secretary of State could only ever exercise the power
reasonably; indeed, we would not expect it to be used other than in
exceptional
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
a nearly identical statutory provision already exists for the
membership of the social housing regulator. Section 83(4)(e) of the

hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich got there before us, because the
wording in the 2008 Act is designed to ensure that income from fees can
be used only for regulatory purposes, and so the amendment would simply
duplicate an existing provision. We will look further at the details
for the fees regime, and will consult on them in due course. I hope,

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will be aware that there is a long history of debate about how
the social housing sector should be regulated and the possible tensions
between the promotional role of the former Housing Corporation in
funding housing associations, and its role in maintaining the integrity
of the sector and looking after tenants’ interests. Given
worries about a possible conflict of interest, the separation of the
Housing Corporation’s funding and regulatory functions was at
the core of the creation of two separate bodies: the Homes and
Communities Agency, which took over the promotional role; and the
Tenant Services Authority, which took over the regulatory role. That is
now coming to an end. Although I might have doubts about the wisdom of
what the Government are doing, I do not intend to challenge it in my
comments. However, I want to try to get the Minister’s take on
how the possible tension between those different responsibilities will
be resolved in the current framework, as one body will once again
perform those two functions.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I accept
entirely that the Government have chosen a framework that establishes a
quasi-independent role for the body that will have tenants’
interests at heart and manage regulatory rather than promotional
responsibilities. That is fine as far as it goes, but the fundamental
objective in proposed new section 92K of the Housing and Regeneration
Act 2008 is a clear statement of the two separate responsibilities. The
first is the economic regulation objective, which is landlord-focused
and deals with ensuring that landlords are viable and develop more
social housing cost-effectively, and without imposing unreasonable
burdens on public funds—to put it crudely, those are the
objectives. The consumer regulation objectives, which take a tenant
perspective, are to support the provision of social housing that is
well-managed and of appropriate quality, to ensure that tenants have
choice, protection, and the opportunity to participate and hold their
landlords to account, and to encourage registered providers of social
housing to contribute to the wider well-being of the areas in which
they operate. How will the tensions and possible conflicts between
those two sets of objectives be managed when they will essentially be
handled by the same
body?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me set out three scenarios, the first of which involves rents. Under
the Government’s policy, we know that new tenancies called
affordable rent tenancies will be created—there is some irony in
that choice of words, but I will let it pass for the moment—that
could involve very high rents in some parts of the country. How will
the promotion of that type of tenure, which would clearly be part of
the role of the Homes and Communities Agency, be reconciled with the
social objective to ensure that tenants of social housing have an
appropriate degree of choice and protection?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I note that
the word “affordability” does not feature at all in the
definition of the consumer objectives. How will the body decide whether
the kind of tenancies being created are producing rent levels that are
genuinely 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 883<a class="bkMark" name="Column883">&#160;</a>
                           </div>affordable for tenants? That must be part of the remit of the consumer
objective if that objective is anything more than a figment. Clearly,
whether people can afford their tenancies is a fundamental question.
However, in the absence of any mention of affordability in the Bill,
how will the body judge whether the tenancies being created are
affordable? How will it look after the interest of the consumer, which
it will be supposed to do under the consumer regulatory
objectives?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, we
come on to the question of security, about which there has been a lot
of debate, so I shall not take a lot of time. The protection of
tenants’ interests is explicit in proposed new section
92K(3)(b), which states that the objective
is<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“to
ensure that actual or potential tenants of social housing have an
appropriate degree of choice and
protection”.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000493">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is clearly germane to our debate about whether tenants might lose
security by transferring from an existing secure tenancy to a new
affordable rent tenancy. I would welcome the Minister’s view on
how that tension, if it arises, is to be resolved.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
proposed new subsection (3)(c) sets out the
objective<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“to
ensure that tenants of social housing have the opportunity to be
involved in its management and to hold their landlords to
account”,<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000494">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>which
I am sure we would all say was broadly sensible. However, we live in a
world in which many social landlords are expanding rapidly, both in
size and in geographical remit. While it may be possible for tenants to
play an active role in supporting the management with their landlord in
one area, that may be difficult if that landlord operates across a much
wider area. I understand that there are tensions within the existing
framework, but they are likely to intensify in the years ahead simply
because of the financial pressures that will push many landlords into
going for growth and expanding the areas in which they operate. Again,
how will the objectives of encouraging economic efficiency and
cost-effective provision of social housing under the economic
regulatory objectives be reconciled if there is tension and conflict
with the consumer support objectives in the second fundamental
objective?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is not a great deal of clarity in the Bill about how conflicts between
the objectives are to be handled. Will there be any machinery to ensure
that the respective weight to be afforded to one objective against
another is considered? Will that be a matter for the board? If so, how
will it deal with the quasi-independence of the body that will deal
with the social regulatory responsibilities taken from the TSA? Again,
I cannot see evidence of how those tensions will be handled. If there
was to be mediation between the two, it would be quite difficult to
operate Chinese wall-type independence so that the regulator was not
part of the same process that operates throughout the rest of the
HCA.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
issues are complex, and the Minister may, as in our earlier exchange,
choose to write to me rather than respond immediately. However, I would
welcome some idea of how he envisages that the new arrangements will
work. Such tensions and conflicts are not imaginary; they have been
around for a long time, and have prompted the creation of two separate
bodies—the HCA and the TSA—to avoid the risk of conflicts
of interest. Now 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>that the two are being put back together again in a new agency, those
tensions are likely to resurface, so I would welcome an indication from
the Minister of how the conflicts and tensions will
be

                           <strong> </strong>I hope that I am able to reassure the
right hon. Gentleman. First, the two objectives of economic regulation
and consumer regulation are, contrary to what he indicated, already
performed by the Tenant Services Authority, so there is already
experience of how such things are handled by one body. I hope that its
good practice will be available to the new regulation committee and
transferred through to the Homes and Communities Agency’s
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are not creating a new situation. We are transferring two regulatory
functions from one body to another, so we can dispose of some of the
straw men that the right hon. Gentleman erected without any difficulty.
In addition, these objectives are regulatory, not investment ones. This
is about setting a regulatory framework, not making a judgment about
investments on the one hand and rents on the
other.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Such
matters are, of course, for the regulator to decide. Most statutory
regulatory bodies have a number of different objectives, and their job
is to take a balanced view of them. Not only is this different, but
there are two broad areas in which there are objectives: one, as the
right hon. Gentleman said, is economic regulation, while the other is
consumer regulation. It is for the regulator to balance those
objectives in the social housing
sphere.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

would say to the right hon. Gentleman that we have not in fact done
anything that is new or different in respect of the issues that he has
brought to the Committee’s attention, and we expect that the
existing mechanism will be as applicable in the new circumstances as it
is
now.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000224">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am surprised that the Minister takes such a
line because clearly the Government are doing something new. Under the
previous arrangement, the Tenant Services Authority had a regulatory
function. He is right to say that it considered the viability of
landlords as well as the interest of tenants, but it did not have the
role of promoting new development. The investment objective was not
part of its remit, and one of the consequences of such an
imperative—to get more homes built by pushing rents up, which
seems to be very much part of the Government’s
objective—is in conflict with most people’s view of what
a responsible regulator should do about the affordability of housing
for
tenants.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000225">&#160;</a>

note that the Minister did not refer to affordability or the judgment
of affordability in his comments, so I do not find his answer at all
convincing. I suspect that in the years ahead we will see a number of
conflicts of the kind that I have described. They will not be straw
men, as the Minister inappropriately referred to them, but genuine
issues that affect real people, housing associations and social
landlords. When those problems arise, I hope that the mechanisms in
place will be adequate to cope with them, but I do not feel reassured

2008 Housing &amp; Regeneration Act introduced a new test for voluntary
deregistration, namely that the body in question is subject to
regulation by another authority whose control is likely to be
sufficient. This is a confusing provision that, in practice, has made
deregistration much more difficult even for very small organisations
with little outstanding grant who have fully consulted their residents
about the implications of deregistration. The amendment does not affect
the power of the regulator to set criteria for

                           </strong> This is obviously a technical amendment, but the
subject is important: the circumstances in which a regulator may
approve a request from a private registered provider—a
registered social landlord in old language—to deregister and
thereby no longer be subject to regulation. It is right that there
should be such a mechanism, and it needs to be appropriate and
proportionate to the circumstances. It is crucial that there are also
adequate protections for both tenants and public
investment.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000233">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would remove one of the grounds on which the regulator may
comply with the request for voluntary deregistration, which is that the
provider is subject to regulation by another authority whose control is
likely to be sufficient. As the hon. Lady said, that is particularly
appropriate for smaller registered social landlords—or private
registered providers, as we will gradually learn to call
them.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According
to the National Housing Federation, the aim of the amendment is to make
voluntary deregistration easier, but it is hard to understand how that
could be the case when it would remove one of the grounds on which the
regulator may approve a request to deregister. In other words, it would
take away some of the regulator’s capacity to grant a request to
be deregistered. From the point of view of the Government, it seems
entirely sensible that the regulator should be able to approve an
application for deregistration on the grounds that there are sufficient
protections in another form via a different regulatory regime. None the
less, it does not make any sense, if that is the objective, to remove
one of the grounds on which that approval can be given. The amendment,
while well-intentioned, therefore misses the target that is being
aiming
for.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000235">&#160;</a>

The word “control” in amendment 279 has raised
real concerns about the operational independence of housing
associations. I am sure that the Minister does not want to risk their
being seen as not operationally separate from the Government, and I
would welcome his comments on that. He may well be able to reassure the

280 would bring standards rules for the housing association sector in
line with those in the charitable sector. A move from the word
“rules” to “guidance” would be welcomed by
the sector. We are all acutely aware of how important confidence is for
lenders and investors. All the comments that I have seen, whether from
the Council for Mortgage Lenders or others, suggest that we cannot risk
weakening the financial monitoring. Most lenders do not want the
existing intervention and enforcement powers changed, but we are where
we are, and I hope that the Minister can offer us some reassurance on
those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000243">&#160;</a>

                           </div>and it might be said, perhaps unkindly, that this is the
landlords’ agenda. One consequence of the amendments would be to
weaken protection for tenants, and I do not believe that we should go
in that direction. Schedule 17 makes important changes to the statutory
framework within which social housing is regulated, and those reforms
were recommended by the review of social housing regulation that we
published, to which I have referred.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
280 would appear to make the standards into optional guidance, but we
do not believe that that should happen. They are minimum requirements
that social landlords must meet for the protection of tenants and
public investment. It is important that tenants of social landlords
know what standards of service they can expect, and know that they can
challenge their landlords to provide it. That is a crucial ingredient
of landlord accountability, and describing consumer-related standards
as being for the guidance of social landlords risks undermining the
ability of tenants to hold their landlord to account for breaches of
those standards. The amendment might not make any significant
difference to the regulator’s powers, but it certainly would sow
a great deal of unhelpful confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
amendment 279, which would amend section 192 of the Housing
and Regeneration Act 2008, probably would not have any legal effect,
because the purpose of section 192 is to summarise the
regulatory powers; the powers themselves would not be changed by the
amendment. The only result would be to cause unnecessary and unhelpful
confusion for the sector over whether substantive change had been
made.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000248">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
282 relates to the Secretary of State’s powers. The Secretary of
State has two levels of intervention under the 2008 Act. The
Opposition, having introduced those powers, will understand that there
is a top-level power to direct what will happen, and a power of lesser
strength to set objectives to which the regulator must have regard. The
amendment would not affect the Secretary of State’s capacity to
direct the regulator. If the aim of the amendment is to reduce the
Secretary of State’s powers, it is targeted at the wrong
provision, because it is directed at removing the Secretary of
State’s existing power to set objectives to which the regulator
must have regard. That does not seem a logical progression of the case
that the hon. Lady is making, and on some specific issues such as rents
it may well be right for the Government to be able to direct on the
content of standards. The amendment is therefore not necessary, and I
hope that she will not press it to a vote.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000249">&#160;</a>

providers’ governing bodies, and it allows it to appoint up to
four additional members even if no vacancies exist. The logic behind
that is to ensure that good governance can be maintained by the

The amendment would also remove the existing provision that allows the
regulator to appoint as many additional board members as it likes, as
long as they remain a minority. The amendment puts a specific figure on

changing the existing situation, in which there cannot be a majority,

four members appointed. The simple problem is that if the board
concerned happened to have only seven members, it would be possible to
breach the current no majority rule simply by appointing the maximum of
four. I think the hon. Lady would agree that it would be rather
perverse if the protection given by existing legislation and the
provisions could be undermined by specifying a number. In the case of
small organisations, I understand that it is not unknown for there to
be quite a small board, so the situation could arise. I understand the

the Bill that allow tenants to make applications to the housing
ombudsman only through an elected representative or a designated tenant
panel member. There is broad support for the position that we are
taking. We believe that what is proposed will act as a barrier to
people coming forward, and create a process that it is difficult for

we receive fully before signing our name at the bottom. I do not
understand why the Minister thinks that tenants are not capable of
going to the ombudsman themselves, or why he believes that

Chartered Institute of Housing has the view that local representatives
can certainly be involved prior to the approach to the ombudsman, in an
advisory capacity, but they should not be the final arbiter. In my
view, we may not have the technical expertise to make a sound decision
and could inadvertently either disadvantage our constituent or send
papers to the ombudsman when that is not the best place for them to go.
I am sure that we have all referred constituents to the ombudsman, only
to have the ombudsman refer the complaint back because he or she
believes that the complaints process has not been fully exhausted, and
it has to come back through us to the constituent. We are piggy in the
middle. The ombudsman is perfectly capable of sending that message
directly to the tenant.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000264">&#160;</a>

three amendments have broad support. Even housing associations want
their tenants to be able to make direct complaints about them to an
ombudsman. Removing the filter if necessary will allow people to make a
quicker move to the ombudsman. As long as they understand the process
that they must go through to get to that stage, they do not necessarily
need to come through a Member of Parliament. The impact assessment
suggested that there would be some additional pressure on councillors
and MPs as a result of the measures. Our casework is already increasing
as a result of some of the concerns arising from the
Government’s measures, and I can certainly see the potential for
further work. As it stands, the Bill has the potential to slow down and
frustrate people’s access to the ombudsman, so the measures are
not necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000265">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady correctly described the system as a
democratic filter. It is intended to promote greater local decision
making and give a stronger role in the complaints process to local
councillors, MPs and tenant panels. She is right that cases come to us,
but many people’s first stop will be either the tenant panel for
their estate or neighbourhood or their local councillor. Our aim is to
bring about quick, effective, local resolution of complaints.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000266">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In my 13 or
14 years’ experience as a Member of Parliament, I have had
occasion to refer complaints about my local council to the ombudsman,
but no housing complaints so far. I have a good housing authority, so I
do not have a huge number of complaints, but it is surprising how often
tenants come to me with housing complaints because communications have
broken down or there has been some failure of service delivery or
understanding. It is surprising that some of those tenants see their
route as going to the ombudsman. Perhaps they had poor awareness of the
Tenant Services Authority, in terms of where complaints might
go.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000267">&#160;</a>

it is possible to resolve things locally, it is surely right that that
should happen. I sometimes think that if public services were delivered
to the standard to which we aspire, we would not have much casework,
because the cases would be solved when the tenant or service recipient
first complained to the authority. We are a long way from that, even in
the best areas of service delivery.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000268">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will in a moment. I want to develop my case. We
are trying to promote local accountability. If councillors are getting
complaints from tenants who cannot get resolution from their housing
authority, surely that is the right place to lodge those complaints
first. If the tenant panel is getting plenty of complaints, that is an
important safety net and gives a clear signal that something is wrong
with service delivery at the local level. If the matter gets as far as
a Member of Parliament, how much better is it for the hon. Lady to
become aware of deficiencies in service delivery in her authority than
for the ombudsman to deal with the case?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
clearly right that there should be an opportunity for local resolution
when things break down, not just between tenants and the local
authority but between tenants’ local representatives and the
local authority, and things can be taken further forward if necessary.
The Government’s view is that the filter that we have
established is the best way to ensure that disputes are resolved
locally and that the ombudsman focuses on addressing cases where
effective local resolution is not possible. Intervention from the
centre, whether by the Government or the ombudsman, should be the last
resort and not the first port of call.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000271">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Lady is advocating a dual-track approach, where tenants can make either
a direct or an indirect approach. We want to promote complaint
resolution at the local level as far as possible, and to encourage a
system where, ideally, the ombudsman is only brought in when local
resolution is completely impossible. We are giving tenants more power.
Local tenant panels will have the opportunity to resolve complaints
before they reach the ombudsman. Tenants understand the issues that
matter to them locally, and tenant panels are well placed to offer
solutions and to recognise tenants’ interests and
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000272">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister makes a strong case for issues
being resolved locally, and he mentioned the local MP being a vehicle.
However, if he looks at the legislation, he will see that it does not
say that the designated person must be the Member of Parliament for the
constituency in which the property is located. It does say that the
local councillor has to be<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000273">&#160;</a>

clearly leaves the door open for any dissatisfied tenant. The Minister
shakes his head, but he will have received as many letters as I have
from people in areas completely unrelated to our constituencies, asking
us to get involved when they feel dissatisfied with the answer that
they have had locally. He cannot have it both ways. He is either making
the measures local and restricting the wording to democratically
elected representatives of the relevant area, or he is opening them up,
in which case he is simply inviting dissatisfied tenants to write to
any MP. Frankly, that is a totally unworkable solution. The Minister
can surely recognise that the wording is
defective.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000275">&#160;</a>

jump through certain hoops—there could be an appeal process or
something similar—before the ombudsman can consider their case.
Labour Members have taken soundings from a range of people, and we
cannot see why—tenants certainly cannot—that should not
be possible. If tenants and landlords are saying, “There
isn’t a problem with this,” I do not understand why the
Government have one. I know that it is late in the day, but I am minded
to press the amendment to a Division.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000285">&#160;</a>

the sentiment behind what the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View seeks
to achieve. I have spent a good chunk of my political life seeking one
way or another to improve relations between the varying tiers of London
government at various points in time. However, her amendment is
unnecessary and I will explain why. Section 42 of the Greater London
Authority Act 1999, as amended, already provides that the Mayor shall
consult each London borough council. Section 43 requires that he send a
copy of the strategy to each council at each stage of its development.
So there is already a clear requirement to consult. It is worth saying
that the Mayor’s consultation report on his current housing
strategy states that London boroughs played a particularly active role
in the consultation, with virtually all submitting a written response.
For that reason, the legitimate points made by the hon. Lady are
already
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000323">&#160;</a>

about the clause and how it affects the transfer of assets. I can
understand why assets might be transferred to the Greater London
authority, and likewise to a functional body, a London borough council
and even the common council of the City of London, although they are
not exactly cash or asset strapped. Will the Minister explain the
circumstances in which London assets might be transferred to the
Secretary of State? Should London assets not be retained for the use of
economic development in
London?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000331">&#160;</a>

on their equivalent of Damien Traille for these purposes. I take on
board entirely the sentiment of the hon. Gentleman’s remarks.
The whole of this part of the Bill is a testament to the maturity of
London government and the way it has developed in the past 10 years,
and that is why we are able to proceed, in large measure, by consensus.
Broadly and as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, the clause
seeks to bring London into a position that reflects its circumstances
in light of the abolition of the regional development agencies outside
London, and the moving of the London Development Agency’s
functions from a separate body into the mainstream of the Greater
London authority itself, and therefore not accountable to
Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
does not just relate to the transfer of assets. There are also various
rights and liabilities that can include contractual liabilities, too.
That is why a raft of people are included, with whom the LGA had, and
continues to have, dealings in the course of its existence. For
example, the LGA has, in its lifetime so far, acquired considerable
land holdings, properly, as part of its site acquisition and
consolidation roles. Sometimes those come from a raft of public
agencies, as well as private bodies. There may be instances when it is
appropriate, as part of the winding down or finalising of a project
that LDA has worked on, that small areas could be transferred back to
central Government, as much as they might be transferred, let us say,
to the London
borough.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000333">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The LDA is expected to close by March 2012. The
Mayor will take a view on what activities are transferred across in the
light of the spending review. There will be an
inheritance of the regeneration portfolio and it will also become
responsible for the management of the European regional development
fund in London. It is conceivable that there might be occasions,
because of the accounting arrangements, in which balancing payments
need to be made. The bulk of the issue, as the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington rightly says, is not going to be to the Secretary
of State. It is likely to be to other public bodies, and predominantly
the boroughs, where we might get to the situation where the site has
been resolved and there are bits of land that, conveniently enough, can
be returned to the boroughs, as the hon. Gentleman will
appreciate.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000335">&#160;</a>

probably covers the sorts of issues that we are dealing with. The power
is very much seen as a residuary one, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman accepts that that is the case. The presumption is that the
LDA’s assets will transfer to the Greater London authority by
order of the Secretary of State but, equally, liabilities might
transfer in the other direction in certain circumstances. The clause
enables the transfer of liabilities as well as of assets, so
there could be circumstances in which a residual liability as part of
an agreement for the winding-down of a particular project might very
properly be returned to the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000336">&#160;</a>

proposal. Generally I anticipate that the transfer scheme will give
effect to negotiations that have taken place and resulted in a
voluntary agreement on the winding-down and ending of the process. It
is unlikely, therefore, to be contentious, but I understand the point.
We will come on to some broader points about consultation with the
boroughs, and we could perhaps deal with the matter then. I think that

                           </strong> I am interested in pursuing the matter, because we
have been having a discussion with Ministers about the assets of the
regional development agency in the north-east of England. We have
written to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, asking what
would happen to the assets of One NorthEast. On Monday, I had a letter
from the Chancellor that clearly said that no decision had yet been
made. In the north-east context, the regional development agency that
is winding itself down has come to the conclusion that assets over
liabilities comes to about £8 million or £9 million per
year, being rental income from properties that have been developed as
part of the property portfolio. So I just wonder whether the approach
being taken with the London Development Agency is different to that
being taken with regional development agencies in the other parts of
the country.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000339">&#160;</a>

simple reality is a practical one, and there is no hidden difference.
The RDAs outside London are being abolished through a different
legislative route, and it is right that there will
be a netting-off process, which I anticipate will apply within London
as well. It just happens that because of the different governance
system in London, where there will be a direct transfer of the LDA into
an existing democratically accountable body, it is appropriate to use
this route. The proposal does nothing more than give the enabling power
for those transfers to take place: it does nothing about the quantum,

                           <strong> </strong>Perhaps I can clarify my comment. It may
be the case that the boroughs and the Mayor of London are happy with
the proposals in principle, but that is not to say that there might not
be one-off circumstances in which there is some controversy and
disagreement about how assets are transferred and to whom they are
transferred.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000346">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is theoretically possible. Remember that we are
dealing not with ongoing circumstances, nor with future bodies that
might be established, but with the one-off abolition of the London
Development Agency and its folding into the mainstream of the GLA. So I
do not think ongoing dispute is particularly
likely.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000347">&#160;</a>

                           </div>Mayor, who has the democratic, London-wide legitimacy to make such
schemes. The objective is to ensure that the
agency’s ongoing activities may be transferred effectively. The
bulk of those activities will go into the mainstream of the Greater
London authority, which seems to be the intention. We are, however,
giving flexibility for the Mayor to transfer some of those rights to
other bodies, which could include a London borough or, as the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Erdington has mentioned, a functional
body.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000348">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
can see that, in some cases, it may be appropriate to transfer a parcel
of land, to Transport for London, for example, because there is a
logical use for it. It may be appropriate to transfer to a London
borough a parcel of land that has some housing, recreational or
educational use because, say, it abuts a school. It is in such
circumstances that it is envisaged such a transfer would
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000349">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope the hon. Member for Lewisham East would accept that this clause
deals with a one-off issue on which there has to be consultation. The
Mayor has to act rationally, and the Secretary of State, having seen
the Mayor’s proposal and the results of the Mayor’s
consultation, would himself need to act rationally on it. I have no
doubt, were there to be any significant dispute, that it would become
apparent in the consultation. We do not want to impose and it is
logical that we do not need to legislate for the bit of common sense
that should see an agreement between the parties. It is worth stressing
that this has not been raised as a potential obstacle by the boroughs
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000350">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> These powers are welcome. The requirements on the
Mayor to conduct an assessment of London’s economic conditions
and to prepare proposals for the economic development and regeneration
of London are welcome. So, too, is the requirement to consult
representatives of both employers and employees; so, too, is the
requirement on functional bodies to have regard to the strategy laid
down by the Mayor in the exercise of their functions; and so, too, is
the specific reference made to skills being one of the areas of
concern. Enhancing the development of skills in London for the purposes
of economic development is, therefore, a key objective of the plan that
the Mayor will be charged with
preparing.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000354">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
wish to make two points. First, the proposals are welcome, going as
they do to the heart of the need for sensible, regional, strategic
planning in our capital city. It is also welcome that skills strategy
is one of the areas for which the Mayor will have responsibility. I
hope therefore that, when it comes to the next stage of welcome
discussions that Ministers committed themselves to earlier about MEPs,
their functions more generally and their inclusion under the Bill,
there will be something of a read-across in that debate.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000355">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
powers have immense potential. I have a long personal association with
economic development in London. I was one of the founder members of the
Greater London enterprise board in the 1980s, and served on the board
for several years. It was a good model of public-private partnerships
working to rebuild the economy of London. It is welcome that we have
now moved on with a high degree of consensus with such ambitious powers
being put forward. There is no question therefore that, properly
exercised with ambition and vision, the powers have the capacity to
make a real difference to the people of London. I hope that the
Committee will join me in wishing Mayor Livingstone well in the
exercise of
them<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000356">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I welcome the hon. Gentleman’s support for
the powers, but the Bill is not retrospective. I agree about the
importance of a strategy. There was an LGA strategy, and the Mayor
himself wants another. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington is
right to refer to spatial areas and the importance of skills and, of
course, the Mayor has also taken an ongoing interest in skills. I also
agree with the need to make sure that the dialogue takes that
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000357">&#160;</a>

is perhaps significant that the Mayor’s role as co-chair of the
new local enterprise partnership, which will include not only business
leaders from right across the sectors, but it seems as though the
interim board is intended to have representatives of the skills sector

hon. Gentleman and I are in favour. There is nothing between us and the

technical. The amendments would not change the substantive legislative
provisions that relate to the granting of housing and regeneration
functions to the Greater London authority, but they are important to
ensure that the GLA can exercise those functions flexibly and as the
Bill intended. The first amendment would remove a superfluous
provision. The Land Compensation Act 1961 already applies to the GLA,
so deleting the provisions would simply remove a legislative anomaly.
The consequential amendments would ensure that the GLA’s housing
and regeneration functions and that its new town and urban development
functions that it is acquiring historically are captured. They would
ensure that the references to the GLA cover both the new town and urban
development functions, and the

cover the whole of the GLA’s relevant
activity, which equates to the treatment of the Homes and Communities

development corporations will be powerful bodies. The other clauses

in the Olympic park area, which is widely supported and is not why I am
rising to move these amendments. The Minister will be aware, however,
that the legislation does not limit the scope of the Mayor in
designating an MDC to only the Olympic park. It gives the Mayor carte
blanche to come forward with proposals for an MDC in any area in
London. I am not sure how compatible that is with the localist thrust
of the Bill. There is not any provision for what happens if the Mayor
proposes an MDC in an area where the local authority does not like the
idea, and where a local neighbourhood forum has come into existence,
and says, “We do not like the idea either.” That is
unresolved and there is no mechanism for it. That is a curious omission
in a Bill that is supposed to have a well worked out theory of
localism. We shall let that pass for the

reason—or at least he thought it was a good one; we did
not—as to why there should not be a designation of the area
represented by an MP who would be in a position to make a referral to
the housing ombudsman. He said, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 901<a class="bkMark" name="Column901">&#160;</a>
                           </div>“No, no. Let us leave it to common sense and leave it
open.” It is interesting that his colleagues
think that only MPs representing the area in which an MDC is proposed
should be able to make representations. I am sure that others will do
so, but that is an interesting but obscure feature of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000386">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Mayor would then have to have regard to the views expressed by the
people he has consulted, but he would not have to go along with them.
Even if the assembly said that it did not agree with him by a
two-thirds majority—the Minister, the hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst, will be aware of the significance of that
threshold—as far as I can see in my reading of the Bill, the
Mayor would simply have to set out a statement in writing saying why he
did not agree with it. It would not be able to override him, even with
a two-thirds majority. If I am wrong, I welcome a correction from the
Minister. The Mayor would simply have to set out the reasons for not
agreeing. If the Mayor then decided that he wanted to proceed, the Bill
as drafted would require the Government to do as the Mayor
requested.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000387">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East presciently anticipated,
that could result in a new Mayor of London—Mayor
Livingstone—who has a track record in his relations with the
London borough of Bromley, and who has a well-known concern for
increasing housing output, presenting proposals for designating the
bulk of the borough of Bromley as an MDC area. If that were to happen,
the Mayor would of course have to consult. He would undoubtedly consult
the people he is required to—the London assembly, the
constituency members, the MPs for the area and the borough council. I
do not think the common council for the City of London or the treasurer
of the Middle Temple would be involved because the designation would
not cover their areas. Then the Mayor would see
clause 168(4)(h), which states that he should
consult<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000388">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There
might then be an extensive consultation with the homeless and with
organisations representing those in housing need throughout London,
who, let us assume, were in favour of more urgent action to deal with
the problems of housing. Even if the constituency members, the local
MPs and the borough council for Bromley all said, “No, we do not
like the idea,” and even if a plethora of neighbourhood forums
sprung up in the area saying, “No, we do not want it,”
the Mayor would only have to have regard to their view and not be bound
by
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000389">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us assume that the assembly, which would have been elected at the same
time as the Mayor, shared his view about the importance of housing
numbers. In that scenario, we could have a situation where the Mayor
would not even have to give reasons for going against the
assembly’s view because the assembly agreed with it. Here is the
interesting point. At that stage, having completed his consultation and
deciding to proceed, he would send a letter to the Secretary of State
to say, “I want you to designate a certain part of the London
borough of Bromley as an MDC area.” As I read the
legislation—I invite the Minister to tell me if I am
wrong—it
states:<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000390">&#160;</a>

understand it, the Secretary of State, who is a busy man, will not
personally want to handle this and he is likely to delegate the
responsibility of preparing the order to a relevant member of his team.
Who better placed to do it than the Under-Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government, the
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst? Here we have the delicious
scenario of the hon. Gentleman who, as a constituency Member of
Parliament, has sent in a very strong letter, saying, “I
disagree strongly with you Mayor Livingstone. You should not designate
a large part of my constituency as a mayoral development corporation
area.” Because Mayor Livingstone has decided to proceed, and the
Secretary of State has delegated it to the hon. Gentleman, he would
have to bring forward the order to give effect to
this.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000392">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Hazel Grove, who has not been let off the hook and who
will not be able to have a brief relax after all the burdens that he
has carried over the past two weeks, once again put to work to prepare
an order to give effect to the Mayor’s aspirations. Just to rub
salt in the wounds, he would look down the legislation and see
subsection (5), which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000394">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>It
does not say from Bromley borough council,
the Member of Parliament from Bromley, or any
neighbourhood body that has been set up in the area. It just says any
relevant representations received from the Mayor. One can imagine what

convention is that the Secretary of State should have a proper degree
of discretion in such matters. To bind or fetter the Secretary of
State’s discretion in this way seems extraordinary. Surely this
Bill should be amended as I proposed by substituting the word
“may” for “must”. It is like that in most
other references to the Secretary of State’s powers. Surely
there should be an amendment that says that in carrying out these
responsibilities, the Secretary of State should also have regard to
representations from other people, specifically those whom the Mayor
has had to consult about the proposition. These are fairly common-sense
amendments. I hope that they will commend themselves to the Minister
and I hope that the Minister accepts them. I certainly think that it is
in his interests to do so. If he does not, I look forward to seeing the
scenario developing some time in 2012-13 when Mayor Livingstone could
have a great deal of fun at his
expense.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000396">&#160;</a>

wish to speak in support of the spirit, although not necessarily of the
exact wording, of the amendments tabled by the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich. When I heard him make this point on Second
Reading, I was rather torn, because on one level, looking forward to
the 2012 mayoral election, I could think of nothing that would make the
people of Croydon turn out in greater numbers than the prospect of a
future Mayor Livingstone having the power to take over the planning
powers of the London borough of Croydon. I am sure that the same
argument would apply in the London borough of Bromley and a great many
other London boroughs. On the issue of substance, however, the
arguments are exactly as the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich set out. It cannot be in keeping with a localism Bill that the
Mayor is allowed to ride roughshod over the opinion of local
councillors, local Members of Parliament, London assembly members and
public opinion in the affected
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000398">&#160;</a>

reason why I support the spirit of the right hon. Gentleman’s
amendments rather than their exact wording is that I am not sure
whether his proposed solution is particularly localist either.
Amendment 126 would essentially give the Secretary of State discretion
over whether he or she designates a particular mayoral development
corporation. One can envisage a scenario in which the Secretary of
State was of a different political persuasion from the Mayor of London
and there was support for what the Mayor wanted to do, but the
Government of the day did not want to give  the Mayor the
powers. I am not sure whether giving the Secretary of State discretion
is a localist solution to the problem identified by the right hon.

Ministers to consider whether there is a better solution. I know that
the original legislation setting up the Mayor and the assembly allowed
the assembly to block some mayoral powers with a two-thirds vote. Given
the political balance in London, might an arrangement requiring the
support of a certain percentage of the assembly be another way to
ensure that we do not get into a situation where the Mayor has the
power to ride roughshod over opinion?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000400">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have come
to chapters 2 and 3 of part 7 of the Bill. I welcome the principle of
devolving greater powers to the London boroughs, and I welcome the
proposals that build on the Greater London Authority Act 1999—a
Bill on which my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich spent a great deal of time—strengthen London’s
devolution settlement, secure the legacy of the 2012 Olympic games,
streamline the approach to mayoral strategies and increase the power of
the Greater London assembly to scrutinise such strategies, as well as
applying local government transparency requirements to Transport for
London and its committees.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000403">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Croydon Central asked for better solutions, so let us hope
that we can come up with some in this short debate. As we have heard,
these chapters of the Bill address mayoral development corporations,
which will have substantial powers over the
relevant area of mayoral development, whatever it is. We support the
important principle of tackling regeneration, as we have already
argued. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich said, the Bill gives the Mayor new powers to designate any
area of land in Greater London as a mayoral development area. That is
the tricky thing. The planning powers would be significant and would
include making plans for an area, granting planning permission,
compulsorily purchasing land, offering financial assistance in various
forms and carrying on any business. We need much greater
clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000404">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have heard about some of the issues, but I want  to touch on
the important issue of local oversight.  We believe that the
governing arrangements for a  mayoral development corporation
must include borough representation, which amendment 269 would
introduce by ensuring that at least one sixth of the board members of a
mayoral development corporation were borough council representatives.
As we have said, a mayoral development corporation will have
substantial powers, so we need a way to make that body accountable to
local people. The best way to do so is through borough representation,
as specified in the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000405">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Mayor of
London has laid out proposals to use the Bill’s provisions to
create an Olympic park legacy corporation for the Olympic park in east
London to replace the existing Olympic park legacy company, which we
support. The Labour Government were committed to ensuring that the
Olympic games led to long-term benefits for not only east London, but
the UK. Under Labour, 75p in every pound spent by the Olympic Delivery
Authority was an investment in the long-term regeneration of east
London, and we want such work to
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000406">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Mayor, however, has already acknowledged the possible conflicts that
might come from overlap with existing local plans. His proposals for a
mayoral development area for the Olympic park suggest he would exclude
Stratford town centre. The consultation document published by the GLA
states that the success of the Olympic<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000407">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>we
would agree. However, the
Mayor<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000409">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
welcome the fact that the Mayor is apparently minded to allow Newham to
continue its plan for the regeneration of Stratford town centre. The
existing scheme is the result of a long period of planning and
widespread consultation with local people. It is supported not only by
Newham’s democratically elected councillors, but by local
communities, which is important and in the spirit of the Bill. Any
change now would be disruptive, and it would be against the spirit of
localism. It is important that there is an attempt to come up with a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 905<a class="bkMark" name="Column905">&#160;</a>
                           </div>localist solution. Some decision making and
oversight must stay with local councillors and the local community,
because they have shaped that current
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000410">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Mayor recognises that fact in the case of Stratford, but there is
nothing in the Bill—these are great
weaknesses —to ensure that he or future Mayors must take
similar action if there were any similar cases. The Mayor has said that
he wishes to improve the accountability of the regeneration of the
Olympic park, which he intends to do by ensuring that “primary
accountability” is through the elected Mayor. He says that the
board of the new mayoral development corporation is<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000411">&#160;</a>

that is far from a strong commitment. There is no guarantee that that
would include borough representation on the board established under the
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000412">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
seems like many weeks since our evidence sessions, but during one of
them, Andy Sawford, the chief executive of the Local Government
Information Unit, told the Committee that the “big

vision

                        </p>
                        <p>That is
the important point in our debate. Our argument is that the best way of
ensuring that local residents have a say in plans to shape their
neighbourhoods is to ensure borough representation on the board of the
mayoral development corporation, and the amendment would put that in
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000414">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall also speak to amendment 270. The creation of a mayoral
development corporation—let us hope it is limited to
this—is a targeted response to dealing with the particular
strategic challenges of securing the legacy of the 2012 Olympic games.
However, there is a worry, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich referred. Once an MDC has been established for
that purpose, there should be no other reason for  the Mayor to
seek to create additional development corporations, wherever they may
be, because London boroughs are the authorities responsible for
planning and shaping their areas. Amendment 270 would put a time limit
on the Mayor’s power to set up a development corporation of two
years from the date on which this chapter of the Bill comes into force.
As my colleagues have said, without the amendment, there would be
nothing to stop a future Mayor from establishing a new mayoral
development corporation in Bromley, Westminster or many other parts of
London, and then proceeding to act without regard to the plans and
ambitions of locally elected representatives, which would not be within
the spirit of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000415">&#160;</a>

270, about which I would also be interested to hear the views of the
hon. Member for Lewisham East? There might be other areas of London for
which a case could be made for such an approach. Crystal Palace is at
the borders of my borough. It has a very defined centre, but it
straddles five different London boroughs and presents many of the
problems that have drawn the Mayor to his conclusion on the Olympic
park. If there are sufficient safeguards on how the corporations could
be set up, I am not convinced that there is such a case for the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000416">&#160;</a>

enjoyed the right hon. Gentleman’s contribution, and he raised a
legitimate point. With every respect, however, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon Central pointed out, his proposed solution is not
appropriate. It is a bit rich that the right hon. Gentleman has set out
such a proposal, given that Opposition Members have complained greatly
throughout our consideration of the Bill about the number of powers
that are being given to the Secretary of State. If there is a problem
to be resolved, giving power to the Secretary of State is not exactly
consistent with being localist.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000422">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I accept
that there is potential for tension when there are two layers of
governance in a city, both with democratic legitimacy, and when there
might be differences of party control. However, I do not believe that
that potential is as great as has been presumed for the purposes of
debate, though I accept it exists. However, that does not mean that the
localist solution to resolve that, within a mature system of devolved
government—for which the right hon. Gentleman should take more
credit than anyone in the room—is to bring in a centralist
interlocutor, who might have a political view and with whom there might
be just as much political tension as with one or other of the
layers.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000423">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding
the background as to why the power is cast as it is, it was made clear
in evidence by Sir Simon Milton, the deputy Mayor, that Mayor Johnson
has no intention of going beyond the mayoral development corporation
for the Olympic park. That has been broadly accepted and welcomed, and
there has been a sensible and mature dialogue between the Mayor and
borough leaders from different parties to find a sensible way forward,
as was referred to by the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South in
relation to Stratford town centre. I do not think that different
political colours mean that there need be a destructive tension as
opposed to a creative one. Equally, however, to have limited the
proposal in the Bill to simply the Olympic park legacy corporation
would have created all manner of technical and legal problems, which
would prevent the timely setting up of a body that I know the right
hon. Gentleman and I, as well as everyone in the room, would like to
see. That is the reason why the provision is cast in such  a
way.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000424">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If there is a
concern, it seems to me, after listening to the point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Croydon Central, that there is a
better and more devolutionist route than to use the
Secretary of State as the person who has the final say, which would be
the ultimate effect of the amendments because they would limit the
Mayor’s power to the view of the Secretary of State. There is no
guarantee that the Secretary of State would not act in an arbitrary and
partisan manner. It would be better to say that if we are going to
address this point, let us examine the possibility of strengthening the
checks and balances within the system of devolved London governance,
which the right hon. Gentleman put in place, and in which I and others
here had a practical involvement. The system that was set up under the
1999 Act gave the Mayor responsibility for economic development and
economic strategy in London. That was initially exercised through the
London Development Agency, and it will now be exercised directly
through the strategy that we have just agreed to include in the Bill.
It is therefore not unreasonable that the Mayor should be the
democratically elected person who is in the driving seat in both the
development of the strategy and of the appropriate delivery
vehicles.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000425">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is fair to say that we recognise that the London assembly has an
important and sometimes underestimated role in providing checks and
balances. The right hon. Gentleman proposed—or referred in
passing to—the concept that there should be a weighted majority
in  the assembly. He will see that clause 199 will give the
assembly heightened powers whereby it can, in effect, veto or reject
the Mayor’s strategies by qualified majority, which is right,
because it has matured as a body and a player in the London
system.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000426">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the spirit of attempting to find a constructive way forward, I want to
reflect on the matter. Having made his point and hearing what was said
by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central, the right hon.
Gentleman might think it appropriate to withdraw the amendment. My
right hon. and hon. Friends and I will reflect on the means whereby we
might find a proposal that is consistent with keeping the safeguard
within the devolved London governance system—I think that I have
indicated the way in which my mind is thinking. Such a safeguard would
mean that it would be necessary for there to be a considerable
groundswell of support in the democratically elected assembly for a
Mayor to take a proposal forward. That might prevent any abuse of the
system, while still ensuring that the decision would be taken by
London’s representatives. Reflection on the issue on that basis
might be a constructive way to deal with the right hon.

269 relates to the composition of mayoral development corporations.
With respect, the proposal is not terribly localist. Under a two-tier
set-up, I understand the importance of ensuring that the London
boroughs are involved. As somebody who spent 16 years on a London
borough and who comes from a party that has 
<div class="columnNumber">

resile from their value. The danger, however, is that the hon. Lady has
over-engineered a solution. The proposal is too centralist. It would be
very prescriptive about the number of borough representatives on every
development corporation. It is not localist to give power to central
Government to dictate the composition of the board in such fine detail.
The amendment would defeat the overriding
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000431">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister might say that, but he should know
that London Councils want greater borough representation. It is okay
for the Minister to say, “Let’s not be centralising;
let’s just leave it,” but I do not believe that London
Councils would be happy with that, so he might want to find another way
forward. In the important matter of planning and regeneration,
it is understandable, given all the powers of mayoral
development corporations, that there is demand for a decent amount of
borough
representation.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000432">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a fair point, but the answer is not
prescription of the kind suggested in amendment 269. It important to
bear in mind that both Sir Simon and Mayor Pipe from Hackney thought
that there were sensible ways in which such problems could be resolved.
To go down the route of prescribing exact numbers misses two points.
First, it misses the point that more than one potential model for a
mayoral development corporation can be envisaged under the Bill. The
Olympic park development corporation is a substantial piece of work. It
is anticipated, according to the consultation document, that it could
take on planning powers and all that goes with that. It is conceivable,
however, that we could have lighter-touch mayoral development
corporations that might not be so extensive in scope, or might not take
on all or part of the planning powers that are exercised by the London
boroughs, so the argument about borough representation might be very
different. Different circumstances could apply, but the hon.
Lady’s amendment would place the situation into a
straitjacket.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000433">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the configuration of the mayoral development corporations, if there
were others, might vary. The composition and size of board that would
be appropriate in the Olympic park might be wholly different from that
which would be appropriate in the suggestion that my hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon Central has made. Again, a number of boroughs might
be involved.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000434">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, if
we were to start prescribing the representation of the boroughs, given
that we are, rightly, looking to work in partnership with other bodies,
other bodies with public sector interests might feel that they were
entitled to a degree of representation as well. With respect, the
solution might create more difficulties than it removes. Perhaps we
will return to the point that I have made to the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich. The view that the assembly might
take—that it would take even under existing
legislation—regarding its support for a proposal for a
corporation would be coloured by the extent to which the proposed
membership reflected the legitimate interests of the communities and
their democratic members. Again, I think that ours is a better route to
achieve that.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000435">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, on
amendment 70, localism does not have a two-year duration. We do not
know what circumstances may develop in the future, in which mayoral
development corporations might be appropriate. It would be wrong to
close off opportunities for the future, when I think that most people
accept that this is a potentially valuable tool. Similarly, we do not
want that degree of prescription. It must be remembered that, however
they are configured, the board members have a corporate
responsibility—a responsibility to the corporation—as
well as a responsibility to wherever they may have been appointed or
selected to represent. Getting that balance right is important, so both
the unduly prescriptive nature of amendment 269 and the arbitrary time
limit in amendment 270 go against the spirit of what we seek to achieve
rather than helping it.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000436">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The main
concerns seem to be the issue that the right hon. Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich has raised and the points that my hon. Friend the Member
for Croydon Central has made. Given my undertakings to reflect on
those, I hope that the Opposition will withdraw the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000437">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for his
constructive response to our amendments. I have three points to make.
First, centralism and prescription are always in the eye of the
beholder. The Minister accuses us of being centralist by giving the
Government discretion not to accept a flawed proposal from the Mayor.
We thought that was a safeguard, but he sees it as centralist. When it
comes to numbers, he has criticised my hon. Friend the Member for
Worsley and Eccles South for specifying the number of people who might
be appointed by a borough to serve on the MDC. The Minister regards
that as prescriptive, but when it comes down to specifying the number
of people that can trigger a local referendum, the Government are
extremely prescriptive. I do not buy his argument that we are pursuing
a centralist line.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000438">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
alternative checks and balances, I support the proposal from the hon.
Member for Croydon Central, to which the Minister is clearly
sympathetic, to look at alternatives. It is more than simply a question
of whether the assembly takes a view, because this involves different
tiers of government and it is important that the views of boroughs are
also taken into account. I urge the Minister to think further about
that. My hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South has also
made that important point about the need for boroughs to be included in
the process.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000439">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With that
safeguard, and the safeguard of not only mayoral representations but
representations from other bodies being taken into account in the
process, as outlined in amendment 127, I would be happy to withdraw,
but it is, of course, up to my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and
Eccles South whether she wants to eat the cake and withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000440">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Safeguards
are needed. As in other parts of the Bill, the Minister might not be
happy with the safeguards that we have proposed, but as we keep saying,
we do not have the benefit of parliamentary draftsmen and whole

In their response to the Bill, the Mayor and the
assembly said that they are sensitive to boroughs’ concerns. I
have not heard the Minister being as sensitive to boroughs’
concerns as the Mayor and assembly have said they want to be.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000442">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
two issues, not one. The boroughs should have some right of veto,
perhaps by a two-thirds majority, over proposals to establish new
mayoral development areas and corporations. Clearly, that could cut
across what local authorities do. London Councils has made it clear
that it wants some settlement to the issue of borough representation on
the boards of mayoral development corporations, and I do not blame
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000443">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have
accused other Ministers on the Bill team of saying, “Trust me,
it’ll be okay because I say it’ll be okay,” but
this part of the Bill is better than many others for having been
through lots of consultation. It is a credit to the Minister that he
has done that work and achieved as much consensus as he has, but given
that, and given that we will not debate this part of the Bill much for
those reasons, we should take seriously the concerns about these
matters, because they are the sticking points. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000444">&#160;</a>

local authorities. The ability of Ministers to delegate functions to

would be against the spirit of localism. It would also focus power at
the regional level in London, which does not seem to have been the

                           </strong> My concern about the amendment is that it would
have the effect of giving boroughs what, to all intents and purposes,
would be a right of veto over all proposed delegations, which goes too
far. I can understand why boroughs may be concerned about the power of
delegation and the superficial attraction of it, but I do not think it
is either appropriate or necessary. I will deal with the reasons for
that
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000461">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
it is worth pointing out that the power for Ministers to delegate
functions to the Mayor is not new. Clause 194 replicates a similar
power that exists under section 6A of the Regional Development Agencies
Act 1998. That enables Ministers to delegate functions to either the
London Development Agency or the Mayor. As Labour Members will recall,
that power was used by the previous Government to delegate the
administration of a range of national regeneration and business support
programmes to the London Development Agency to enable the Mayor to
shape the programme to reflect London’s circumstances.
Interestingly and crucially, when the previous Government used the
provisions, there was no power for any veto by the boroughs.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000462">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the only functions that can be delegated by Ministers to the Mayor
under this power will be those that the Secretary of State considers
can be appropriately exercised by the Mayor. In making that decision,
the Secretary of State has to consider whether the proposed delegation
is suitable for a city-wide authority, such as the Greater London
authority, which has a strategic remit. It is not, therefore, in
reality, or in past precedent, a power that can readily be used to
delegate functions that would better sit with the boroughs. That makes
two practical reasons why the amendment is not
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000463">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
it would be inappropriate for London boroughs to have the power to veto
an agreement between a Minister and the Mayor to delegate a particular
function, because not all functions would necessarily have anything 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 912<a class="bkMark" name="Column912">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to do with the boroughs. A raft of matters could be delegated that would
not directly impinge upon all, a majority of, or indeed any, London
boroughs. Although we have created an effective and successful
constitutional settlement for London, with checks and balances and a
recognition of different levels of competence and democratic
legitimacy, it has never been suggested that one level of government
should have a constitutional veto over the transfer of powers to
another.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000464">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be equally alarming for boroughs if we were to adopt the proposal
that logically and intellectually follows from the amendment, which is
that there should be circumstances in which the Mayor is given a veto
over the transfer of powers by the Secretary of State to the boroughs.
That would entrench a system of conflict that none of us would want to
see.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000465">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
decision and action is that of the Secretary of State, and
the correct forum, therefore, for oversight of the Secretary of
State’s action and the scrutiny of delegation is here in
Parliament, but I have already said that we are prepared to look at
means whereby more safeguards can be put in place within the London
context. That combination of considering the safeguards within the
London devolution settlement and parliamentary oversight of the
Secretary of State’s actions would, I hope, be a proper means of
scrutiny, and I trust that the hon. Lady will reflect on that and
withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000466">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am pleased that the Minister ended with that
more conciliatory approach, because although I agree that there were
devolution powers in the previous Government’s legislation, and
that it is right and proper that there should be scope for devolution,
he must recognise that there is a complicated series of relationships
in the case of London that has to be handled
sensitively.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000467">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have within me a very long speech reviewing the history of London
government from the mid-19th century onwards, and I could give the
Committee the benefit of that speech, which would go on for a long
time. I hope that the Government Whip will have regard to that in his
discussions with my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South
about an appropriate moment at which to bring this evening’s
proceedings to an end. However, rather than giving a foretaste of the
interesting speech that I have in my back pocket, I want to make a
serious point about the need to have regard to the balance between the
different tiers of government in London, and the need not to make moves
that, perhaps inadvertently, unhelpfully shift that
balance.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000468">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall now give the compressed version of the speech. When we created
the Greater London authority, we had careful regard to ensuring that
the Mayor was able to act effectively as an executive with the ability
to make a difference—history has demonstrated that there has
been a real advance—but could not trample all over the boroughs.
There was a careful separation of powers to try to maintain areas that
were exclusively the preserve of the borough, and others that were
exclusively the preserve of the Mayor. That thinking needs to be
maintained. We have some important issues coming up in a couple of
clauses’ time, when I believe we should have more time to
consider precisely the right balance between the Mayor, the assembly
and the London boroughs. The issue will come up again at that point,
and I might 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 913<a class="bkMark" name="Column913">&#160;</a>
                           </div>expand on the matter rather more then. In the meantime, I would just
like to say that I welcome the Minister’s approach. I hope that
he can think about appropriate safeguards to ensure a balance in the
relationship between the Mayor, the boroughs and
other parties in London, and to ensure that we do
not inadvertently create problems that we will
regret.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000469">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Members will be glad to hear that I will not make
a very long speech. The delegation of functions to the Mayor from
Ministers requires oversight. Such decisions require scrutiny. We are
changing a balance that has been carefully arrived at, after being
worked up over a number of years; because of his long experience, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich probably put
that much better than I did. I said at the start of the debate that we
greatly welcomed the changes to the devolution settlement in London,
but we have some worries. I hope that the Minister recognises them and
is willing to think again. We will return to some of the issues on
Report if we are not happy, but for the moment, I beg to ask leave to

has been a long day, Mr Amess. Clause 195 inserts into the Greater
London Authority Act 1999 a new section that requires the Mayor to
prepare a London environment strategy. Proposed new section 351A(3)
lists six matters on which there should be policies and proposals. The
amendment would add a seventh—open air, recreation and
enjoyment. We show signs of being a group of people who have been
spending a lot of time together. Are we all getting cabin fever? We
have spent many hours in this room since 1 February, so we perhaps need
reminding for a few seconds about the notion of open
air.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000477">&#160;</a>

is keen on protection for open spaces that local people enjoy for

worthy cause that she has put forward. I am sure that all Mayors of
London would be committed to open-air enjoyment and recreation, among
other forms of enjoyment

                           </div>and recreation, and that they would want to make sure that their
environmental strategies reflect that. In passing, Mr Amess, I must say
that your chairmanship has been impeccable
throughout our proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000479">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps it
is worth reminding the Committee that we are responding to the view,
shared by the Mayor, the assembly and the boroughs, that it is not
necessary to have six separate environmental strategies. That does not
diminish the importance of environmental issues; it is just better to
band them together into one environmental strategy. There is ample
opportunity for that environmental strategy to include issues that go
beyond the six that existed, and those specified in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000480">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is absolutely no reason why open spaces and their importance to
London—a matter that has been the subject of London assembly
scrutiny reports, to which Mayors of both parties have responded
positively—cannot be included without spelling out the need to
do so. The objectives of the amendment are desirable, and I have no
reason to doubt that a Mayor of London would want to achieve those
objectives, but it is not necessary to spell them out in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000481">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, I shall not make a long speech, but I ask
the Minister to reflect on the issue. In its written submission, the
Open Spaces Society said that it finds it hard to work with local
authorities to protect green open spaces. That is something that we all
say we want to do, but do we do it? Not many years ago, we would not
have been looking at provisions on climate change and mitigation of
energy use in a Bill. We would not have been specific about such things
not too long ago. The Open Spaces Society warns us that given the
encroachment of the built environment, if we do not start to include
provisions on the protection of open space, we will soon find that we
have not done enough to protect it. We are very aware of our climate
change responsibilities, but are we aware of the need to protect open
space?<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000482">&#160;</a>

point. I am sure that she recognises that very often the open spaces
issue is addressed more effectively, and on a larger scale, through the
competence of the boroughs. This might be a case in which further
discussion between the Mayor and the boroughs, which I do not think
were involved in the consultation, results in a way forward by
agreement. Such an agreement does not require a change to the
legislative framework and can be reached as a matter of good practice
in the drawing up of the
strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="110308103000483">&#160;</a>
