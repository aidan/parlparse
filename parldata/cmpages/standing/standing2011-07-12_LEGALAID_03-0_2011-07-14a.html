the beginning of Tuesday’s proceedings the hon. Member for

given time. I want to correct that. I understand that in fact the
council was invited, but declined the invitation, as it felt that it is
for politicians to decide such things, and not for the council to
comment. It passed on its thanks for being invited to give oral
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000036">&#160;</a>

                  </em> We are really clear that there is going to be
a disproportionate effect on women. We know that women make up a
significantly greater proportion of those who receive civil legal aid,
particularly around family and immigration law, which are the areas we
are particularly concerned about.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We, as an
organisation, provide legal advice to women, and we speak to women on
our telephone helplines on a daily basis. Those women come to us not
just with one particular issue resulting from a relationship breakdown;
they come to us wanting advice about child contact proceedings,
financial relief proceedings, welfare benefits, debt and immigration
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000046">&#160;</a>

are a whole range of issues that women need advice on. We are very,
very concerned that removing legal aid for those issues will
significantly disadvantage women. Our particular concern is around
domestic violence. Our concern is that the definition of domestic
violence in the Bill will not allow all women who experience violence
to have access to family law legal aid, and that that will put women at
risk.</p>

vast raft of research that we have conducted on this subject. I think
it does disproportionately, shall we say, outlaw women, because they

                  </strong> On the sentencing provisions, the Government are
exempting domestic violence cases from the new rules on bail. In other
words, if a person has been accused of domestic violence, that is a
reason for remanding them in custody. The definition used in that part
of the Bill is, “physical and mental violence”. Are you
content with that as a specific enough test? Have you thought about
that part of the Bill as
well?<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000048">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 75<a class="bkMark" name="Column75">&#160;</a>
                  </div>domestic violence, there needs to be a unified definition of violence.
In our view, it should be the definition that has been adopted by the
Government in their cross-Government strategy and action plan to tackle
violence against women and girls. That is the Association of Chief
Police Officers definition of domestic violence, which has been adopted
by many other Departments, the Crown Prosecution Service and the UK
Border Agency. The Ministry of Justice itself has adopted it in a
number of documents. There needs to be uniformity in any definition of
violence in any legislation. We are concerned that any provisions
relating to bail adequately protect women. We know from the cases of
Jane Clough and Clare Bernal that there are very significant risks when
perpetrators are released on bail—fatal risks to women.
Therefore, any provisions relating to bail in these kinds of cases need
to be as strong as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000049">&#160;</a>

                  </span> On the subject of legal
aid in general, Britain has one of the highest legal aid bills per
capita in the world. One of the reasons for that is that a lot of
issues, which would normally be dealt with in other countries through
standard appeals procedures or through non-legal advice, end up being
dealt with by lawyers. You mentioned the specific case of welfare. Is
it not the case that, in order to get welfare claims properly dealt
with, there are appeals procedures in the welfare system, there are
other sources of non-legal advice that women could go to, and, in fact,
all we are doing by involving lawyers is just ratcheting up costs and
not actually benefiting the end
recipients?<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000053">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I started to talk about that. You need to look
at the costs of not providing legal aid, particularly in the area that
we are concerned about: domestic violence. We know from evidence that
has been updated recently that the costs of domestic violence, when
women are not able to get support and advice to make safe arrangements,
for child contact for example, and resolve financial and property
disputes and become independent of those
relationships—<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000062">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Domestic violence is within the scope, and the
definition has been widened. It seems to me from what you are saying
that we could allocate almost an infinite amount of money to legal aid
because there are no areas that you think the money should not be spent
on. If you are saying that domestic violence is a priority—I
agree that it is, and we have widened the scope for it—let us
ensure that we spend the money on that. Those eligible for domestic
violence legal aid will also be eligible for things such as ancillary
support through the divorce proceedings. We are being more generous in
that area and less in some of those other areas where there seems to be
a rational reason to cut costs. I think that the case would be better
put if you focused on the areas you thought really ought to be
protected rather than just saying, “We need legal aid for
absolutely
everything.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000063">&#160;</a>

violence? I think that it is misleading at best to say that there has
been a concession on domestic violence in family law. The proposals as
they are set out do not adequately reflect women’s experience of
domestic violence and the way that they deal with it in their lives.
They set out criteria that require women to have been through statutory
routes to address the violence, to have obtained a criminal conviction,
to have applied for a non-molestation order or to have been referred to
a multi-agency risk assessment conference—MARAC—and we
know that that simply is not the experience of women affected by
domestic
violence.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
I may just draw your attention to the Women’s Aid annual survey
from last year, of the 17,500 women who had taken the very drastic step
of leaving their homes to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 77<a class="bkMark" name="Column77">&#160;</a>
                  </div>flee the violence they were experiencing—women who irrefutably
had been experiencing domestic violence—only
10% had obtained a criminal conviction for violence, only 20% had
applied for and obtained a non-molestation or an occupation order and
only 19% had been referred to a MARAC. Our own survey, which we carried
out in the run-up to our consultation response to the proposals, showed
that 53% of women responding had not reported the violence to the
police and had not applied to the court for a protective
injunction.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">We
are very clear that the proposals will not catch all the women who are
affected by domestic violence. Those who are greater experts in
domestic violence than we are will say that women do not report or
disclose violence. I know from my own experience as a family lawyer
that women very often do not talk about it until halfway through the
proceedings, and therefore we cannot assume that these proposals will
ensure that all women affected by violence will have the protection of
family law legal aid. As I say, it is misleading to say that they
will.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">We

National Federation of Women’s Institutes in response to the
initial consultation. You claim that the definition of domestic
violence included only physical harm, but that was never the case;
indeed, the scope has been widened. Do you acknowledge that it has been
widened?<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000071">&#160;</a>

never a good thing. That is true in some cases where there are other
issues, but certainly with domestic violence—no. It means that
you have to face the perpetrator, which can be very stressful. I think,
in all cases, no.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000076">&#160;</a>

at this that mediation is not appropriate in domestic violence cases.
As we have said, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 78<a class="bkMark" name="Column78">&#160;</a>
                  </div>it places victims at risk of further violence and abuse. It puts the
perpetrator back in control in terms of being in contact with the
victim. It can cause re-victimisation of the victim. We know that women
feel under huge pressure to seek agreement in family law cases. We also
know that they feel huge pressure to attend mediation and conciliation
appointments and that they feel pressured into reaching agreements that
simply are not safe for them and their children, or which are not in
their children’s interests. The 2005 inspection report by Her
Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary contains a clear
recommendation about seeking mediation agreements in domestic violence
cases, and HMIC was very concerned that women felt they were being put
in dangerous situations by being forced to mediate. So we absolutely
oppose mediation in domestic violence
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000077">&#160;</a>

process, there needs to be an objective assessment of domestic

it has taken place. I would regard bullying, for example, as mental
domestic violence. Somebody somewhere has to make an objective ruling,
so that it isn’t just one word against another and people do not
access it as a means

domestic violence is currently a factor, compulsory mediation with all
the requirement to seek it is excluded, and that is not due to change.
Nobody is going to force people into mediation, or force them to
explore mediation as an option, if domestic violence is a recognised
factor. That is what the situation is now and that is what will
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000100">&#160;</a>

                  </em> We have wider concerns about mediation beyond
legal aid, in terms of the family proceedings rules that have already
been introduced. Participants in family proceedings have to take part
in mediation information assessment meetings and we have real concerns
about identification of domestic violence in those cases. I think that
there has been research that shows that four minutes has been spent
addressing whether domestic violence is an issue in those cases and
that is really not adequate to explore the safety and appropriateness
of mediation. So we have wider concerns about the role of mediation in
family cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000101">&#160;</a>

14,600 cases in 2009-10 where mediation was started, publicly funded

agreement was reached. Mediation was a successful model for very many
people. It has worked at quite a high level in the last year, 2009-10.

it as a favoured route? It seems to be a route that has a very high
success rate and that is going in the right

organisations generally is probably a separate issue. We are the only
organisation that provides legal advice to women. We are seeing a huge
demand for the services that we offer as legal advice becomes scarcer
and scarcer up and down the country. And we know from our sister
organisations that they are facing really challenging times and that
women’s organisations are closing, so there are fewer and fewer
places for women to go, particularly regarding the proposals around the
domestic violence rule cases and immigration law cases. In those cases,
the Government are suggesting in their proposals that women can seek
advice from other agencies, but there simply will not be those agencies
to provide that support, even if that was appropriate. We would say
that it is very clear from the law that it is a criminal offence to
give immigration law advice if you are not regulated by the office of
the immigration services commissioner, or a solicitor or barrister, or
exempted. Therefore, the proposals put advisers at risk of committing
criminal offences, if they are going to be supporting women applying
under the domestic violence rule in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000110">&#160;</a>

us, they do not want to do it. When we surveyed women, again, in the
run-up to our consultation response, an overwhelming majority of women

was appropriate in domestic violence cases. All of them talked about
the dynamics of power and control within those relationships and how

significantly more litigants in person following changes to legal aid
and that<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000119">&#160;</a>

                  </em> Absolutely. We have seen more and more women
having to represent themselves as legal aid has been restricted, even
over the past 10 years. We know, again from our research with service
users, that women will be deterred from taking legal proceedings, which
can provide safety for them and their children, ensure that they have
financial settlements that ensure their independence and financial
security, and mean that they are not reliant on the state. We are very
concerned about women having to represent themselves in proceedings,
not least because they are incredibly complex. Ancillary relief
proceedings are very complex. Recently, our telephone helpline advised
a woman who was representing herself in proceedings and I could hear
the fear that she had about having to explain her situation to the
court and tackling the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Not only are there
complex legal issues that women face in representing themselves, but
there is also the potential that they will face the perpetrator
directly in court proceedings, again with the re-victimisation that
that brings.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000121">&#160;</a>

tier has helped and it is giving clarity. The further savings would
come through greater assimilation of the custodial and non-custodial
work. Not only would there be cost savings in that, but it would be a
more effective end-to-end system. Increasingly, that is work that I see
before people come into custody, once they are there—but
particularly when they come through the gate—and where any
mentoring-type opportunities exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000160">&#160;</a>

goes—given how long a full-time job allows one to study a Bill

of NOMS that would create savings. It is more about changes that might
result in lowering the prison population, which would create savings. I
think that the main savings made in the criminal justice system will be
through reducing reoffending, and nothing in the Bill would
particularly act against that. However, I do not see any particular
structural changes to NOMS or possibilities for that in the

incremental drive. Certainly our experience is that it is possible, and
it is right that prisoners and staff value it. It is particularly
valuable when we have links with external companies and organisations.
There are obviously risks in introducing it, but there has to be an
incremental spread to build the culture, because some establishments

but it is a big challenge and I do not underestimate that. In my mind,
the biggest thing that needs to happen is for there to be a culture of
businesses coming into prisons. I do not think that that has been
fostered yet. In some regards, there is still a stigma attached to
that—quite wrongly. That is the biggest thing in my mind that
needs to

                  </em> It will vary from establishment to
establishment and, indeed, in terms of culture. We have managed with a
very small increase in staff, but let me make it absolutely clear that
we are lucky in terms of some of the estate that we have. It is new or
relatively new. We have workshops that are built for the purpose as
opposed to converted. The real issue is that of a cultural mind change.
I have spent 29 years in prison management and people are very
reluctant to have prisoners unlocked in small pockets around the
establishment. We need to change that culture, and we have done. We
need to make a prisoner’s working life much more similar to the
working lives that we have. We introduced portakabins as canteens at
the place of work, for example. We have to make sure of security and
safety. The actual resource is about changing shift patterns and making
sure that we are maximising the usage of that as opposed to a large
scale increase in
numbers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000170">&#160;</a>

have got to be innovative in the approach. That is the type of work
that we are doing. We need external companies to be involved. To be
honest, we are seeing an increased number of people who are prepared to
take prisoners in employment, both within the establishment and, more
importantly, outside the establishment. Research shows that a prisoner

                  </em> There are two elements to that: the culture
inside the prison and the culture outside the prison. I have less
experience of public sector prisons, but to incentivise governors who
do not already have an incentive—many do—the Policy
Exchange report published recently suggested giving an overhead fee to
the prison out of the prisoner wage. That is one interesting idea.
Also, as I said before, it is a problem with flexibility in the public
sector, with the core day obviously making things difficult on a
Friday. So that is a real
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
bigger challenge is the external culture, and changing that is very
difficult, particularly at a time when unemployment is rising on the
outside and there are very careful political decisions to be made.
There is a lot of work being done by the Ministry of Justice behind the
scenes to engage employers and larger organisations, and I really
welcome that. I do not know if it would be possible to do that more
publicly and make more public pronouncements of the Government’s
championing of this, really doing something to change the reputation
that working in prisons is bad. Lots of big corporations do work inside
prisons but they hide it because it is somehow dirty. The biggest thing
that needs to be done is to change
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000175">&#160;</a>

scale or curve related to hours in a week and numbers of people

my experience, a busy prisoner is a safer prisoner and a happier
prisoner because they are engaged. If there are high levels of
inactivity in a prison, boredom comes from that and we have control
problems. I have experienced that various times in my own career. If
you make work attractive, from the training, rehabilitation or
financial point of view, there is buy-in from the prisoner and that
breeds
safety.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000182">&#160;</a>

refute any suggestion that, across the board, there are not sufficient
staff already in the system. There will be some locations where there
are not, and others where there are. You have to do that on an

international work, in Norway, people are curfewed the night before

of it. I spent a night back in December out with our field teams,
talking to people who were coming to the end of their tagging period. I
was amazed talking to them—it was an education for me—to
hear just how restrictive and successful they have found it. The
intelligent and more flexible use of it—the refining of it to
make sure that people turn up for unpaid work or whatever—will,
I think, change lives positively.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000203">&#160;</a>

think that the Bill touches in particular on women or has a particular
impact on them. There are some measures that could be seen to
strengthen community punishments and community sentences, which can
only be a good thing for instilling public confidence so that
sentencers feel able to hand down those sentences on more occasions.
That is, obviously, favourable to women who are carers for families.
Otherwise, I do not think that the Green Paper focuses particularly on
women.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000210">&#160;</a>

and how that is done is, to me, neither here nor there. It is
difficult, as a service provider, to comment on detail in sentencing
proposals, to be frank. My personal opinion is that I welcome the
recommendations of the Corston report. In a criminal justice system,
which in my view needs quite a lot of reform—the Bill and
Government policy go a long way to achieving that—it is really a
matter of where you focus your time and resources. Women are a very
important population group, I do not doubt that at all, but I
understand that they are also only a small proportion of the prison
population.</p>

how that can best be integrated with wider financial capability
programmes in prison—there seem to be some pilots, but it is a
little bit patchy—and also how you can integrate that to involve
mainstream financial services upon

explain to prisoners what it is for. Again, at Altcourse prison last
year we gave £4,500, which prisoners had donated from their
wages, to local victim support charities. We have created the
expectation that prisoners will both save some of their money—on
average, people in that group have been leaving with £250, which
may not seem a lot, but it is a start—and give money to
charities. So I 
<div class="columnNumber">

Hinds just asked. I think it is a very important question. When I came
to Peterborough, you very kindly showed me around, Kate. We came across
a story from one of the people who worked there about a woman with an
infant for whom housing had not been organised before the day of
release. I have since discovered that, for women leaving mother and
baby units across the system, that is quite a common practice. You have
said a lot about co-operating with the private sector, but I wonder how
you would feel about a duty to co-operate with public sector
agencies—local authorities, housing associations and primary
care trusts—to ensure the kind of seamless support that people
need, that Mr Hinds was really alluding to.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000217">&#160;</a>

Steadman:</strong>
                  </em> To clarify, if I may, if I understand
correctly, in that case the prison discovered that the local agencies
had not prepared housing for the offender who was being released, and
the prison intervened to ensure that it was done before she was
released. I do not think that there was any absence on our
part.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000218">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I personally
think that this great divide between the sectors in all areas of
governance, that existed historically, is out of date. We work very
closely with local agencies in the public sector. We work very closely
with voluntary sector organisations and we are a partner. I do not
think that any one prison or any one agency can exist on its own,
working in silos. We work extremely closely with all different local
agencies on release and pre-sentence to give offenders proper joined-up
care, as far as is

looking at prisons on one side and the community on the other. We have
to work through the gate. To do that, we must jointly create a very
effective and professional mentoring process through the gate. They are
trite words in many ways. People use them time and again, but the
transition from custody for any prisoner—male, female, adult or
youngster—back into the community is a real risk. I have seen it
time and again. It is where you actually have someone to whom that
individual can turn, to make the transition. The real problem is with
the under-12-month-sentence people, who do not have any statutory
supervision. In Wales, we have a transitional support scheme, which is
the professional mentoring scheme for any prisoner—prisoners
from any prison, whether they are male or female—going back to
south Wales. We see the impact of the mentors, some of whom are
ex-prisoners themselves who have had that experience of leaving
prison.</p>

prison for delivering the work programme. Mr Petherick, you said that
you were an experienced prison officer, so doubtless you have
experience of older prisons as well as new prisons. In your opinion,
how difficult will it be to deliver this more comprehensive work
programme in the older establishments, which have perhaps more than
1,000 prisoners, and what kind of investment do you think will be
needed to make them fit for purpose?<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000231">&#160;</a>

Petherick:</strong>
                  </em> First, it is not necessarily a function of
size. It is more about old gate lodges, etc, admitting lorries and so
forth that are of the requisite size. Again, it is very difficult to
give a complete figure across the board, but I remember that when I was
the area manager for the south-west, Exeter prison had an incredibly
narrow gate lodge, which caused problems for any vehicles entering. I
had Channings Wood prison, which was much more modern, and we did not
have that problem there. So some of it is purely about access issues
and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 94<a class="bkMark" name="Column94">&#160;</a>
                  </div>some of it has to be about scale. I believe that in any prison you could
find something to encourage the 40-hour working week and then you scale
up from there. So it is very hard to give a generic answer because it
is related to individual establishments, but the culture is such that
you can start the process.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000232">&#160;</a>

to have this view that most people in prison are inherently evil and
incurable, and I think that in most cases they are in there due to some
social problem—drugs and alcohol make up a huge proportion of
that. On average, only about 5% of orders in the community are drug and
alcohol-related and the proportion of offenders suffering from such
problems is much higher than that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000242">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to ask about payment by results and social
impact bonds, which touch on some of the issues that have come up, such
as drug and alcohol rehabilitation and the work programme, as well as
overall rehabilitation. They are new areas with which everyone is
trying to come to terms. There are six challenges with PBR and social
impact bonds: defining the audience; isolating the impact of
interventions; defining a control group; having measures of success;
the fact that savings will come from different budgets in the public
sector and that there is a danger of double counting; and finally, that
positive cash flows may happen over a very long time during which there
may be two, three or four changes of Government. It strikes me that
with stopping reoffending, you have the most perfect model to deal with
those six challenges, but even within that challenge, how big a
potential do you see ultimately for payment by results and social
impact
bonds?<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000259">&#160;</a>

Steadman:</strong>
                  </em> There are two slightly different questions.
With payment by results, the logic is, to a degree, flawless. You can
argue that if it works, you get paid and if it does not, you do not.
Obviously, at one of our prisons in Peterborough we are piloting a
social impact bond, which is going very well—it has also been a
learning process. However, I think payment by results has a positive
future, but the devil will be in the detail in a lot of these cases,
and we have to see how it goes. I cannot pretend it will be the
solution to everything.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000260">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Kate
Steadman:</strong>
                  </em> That is a different question. My second
answer was going to be about social impact bonds versus payment by
results, because they are two different things. A social impact bond,
as far as I am aware, is when the money comes from social investors in
the community, as opposed to private finance and other things like
that. I do not know to what degree there is—at the moment,
anyway—an appetite for social investment to the extent to which
you can meet every offender coming out of a prison in England and Wales
at the gate. I do not know whether that will change when proof of the
concept is there, but I think it will be interesting to see how social
investment goes. PBR is more general and it is different; I think it is
much more promising, if that makes
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000262">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> To a degree. To be fair, social impact bonds are
kind of a subset of payment by results. You can have lots of
payment-by-results programmes, of which some are suitable for social
impact bonds. In fact, in the list of six challenges that I gave, I
think the first four apply to all payment-by-results programmes, and
two more apply particularly to social impact bonds. I am just trying to
get a sense—I know it is impossible to say accurately—of
how big this could grow. The pilot in Peterborough seems encouraging.
How far can it go, and what percentage of the ex-offender population
could be covered?<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000263">&#160;</a>

scalability, and that is implicit in the other points. The real issue
is about the pace and scalability of the pilots, and so forth.
Certainly, we are up for payment by results; it is the way forward, and
we are getting experience of that through the welfare to work
programme. We will take a lot of learning from it into the criminal
justice sector. At the moment, we are conducting a type of
“lessons learnt” survey from our initial work, which
again, I would be very happy to provide to the Committee when it has
been completed. The appetite is there, but as Kate says, the devil will
be in the detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000265">&#160;</a>

hear your response to the earlier question on your relationship with
the public sector, and specifically, about the woman who was

exact details of that case. I am not based at that prison. It was
during the visit of the shadow Minister, when a member of staff relayed
an anecdote about how the prison intervened to ensure that there was
housing. To be frank, I cannot remember whose fault it was, and who
failed to do what in the process.<a class="bkMark" name="11071457000267">&#160;</a>

prisons are designed towards achieving that. There is no doubt that,
for years and years, that has been the cliff edge. No matter what you
do to prisoners while they are inside, if you let them

what you indicated, which does not seem to be addressed in the Bill,

together of the probation service, youth offending teams, and so on, in
a way that is likely to lead to stopping people from reoffending in
