<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 7, line 4, after `is' insert `required'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 30 to 34.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The amendments deal with subsection (2). Clause 8—the second half of the heart of the Bill—enables us to update the statute book. Subsection (2) contains a list of the type of barriers to doing things electronically that the clause can modify. The purpose of the six Government amendments, which are extremely straightforward, is simply to clarify the range of existing requirements to which the clause applies. We all agree on the need for clear drafting, and although the amendments add a few words to the clause, they also add to its clarity. My right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor is exploring, with the assistance of the Law Commission and the Land Registry, what is necessary to allow conveyancing in particular to be done electronically, in the context of a comprehensive reorganisation of the land registration system. I am sure that that change will be widely welcomed; we must be sure to get it right before acting. The amendments are the first result of ongoing work to ensure that the power proposed in the clause can be used to, among other things, facilitate electronic conveyancing. It might be helpful if I explained why we have concluded that we need the amendments.
<P>
The Law of Property Act 1925, with which I am sure all hon. Members are intimately familiar, says in section 53(1)(b) that a declaration of trust of land
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must be manifested and proved by some writing''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is one of those 40,000 references to writing, paper and so on that we find in statute law. That is important because any transfer of registered land to two or more people will contain a declaration of the trust on which the land is held. I tabled amendment No. 30 to make it absolutely clear that the powers conferred by the clause can apply to that and to similar requirements for things to be evidenced in writing. In a similar vein, I also tabled amendments Nos. 29, 31, 32 and 34, which broaden the phrase ``is to be'' by substituting ``is required to be''. That clarifies the provision that the clause can operate on something that, although it does not have to be done, must be done in a particular way if it is done. Under the Law of Property Act 1925, a valid trust of land can be declared orally but is unenforceable unless it is evidenced in writing. The addition of the word ``required'', taken with amendment No.30, makes it clear that the clause can apply to such cases. Amendments Nos. 31, 32 and 34 make a similar clarification regarding statutory requirements for post or other specified means of delivery or for authorisation by a person's signature or seal and the making of a payment.
<P>
Secondly, there are requirements for things to be delivered as deeds, for example in section 1 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989—again, I am sure that members of the Committee are intimately familiar with that legislation. In those cases, when the person delivers the deed, he is acknowledging that he intends to be bound by it. In such cases, the kind of delivery is different from that referred to in subsection (2) (b), which deals with sending and posting. That is why I tabled amendment No. 33. I used the example of conveyancing to illustrate why the amendments were necessary. Our lawyers recognised the need for them when they examined conveyancing, but they will apply more broadly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): We have no objection to the amendments, which tidy up the language and make it more precise. We tend to look on a series of Government amendments with suspicion in case they change the nature of the Bill, but in this case, they do not. In the spirit of Christmas, I give the amendments our blessing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): We, too, welcome the amendments, as far as they go. Amendment No. 30 raises the issue of what is done ``or evidenced'' in writing. What exactly is meant by ``in writing'' in this context, and to what extent does the Minister intend to broaden the provision? That concern was raised with me by the Law Society, which was worried about how the term ``in writing'' would be used to decide whether a particular circumstance fell within the provisions of the subsection. How will it be applied to a particular sector of Government business?
<P>
The Law Society pointed out that the Copyright Designs and Patent Act 1988 makes it clear that writing includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any form of notation or code, whether by hand or otherwise and regardless of the method by which, or medium in or on which, it is recorded''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provides a broader definition. Does the Minister's new phrasing in amendment No. 30 represent a broadening out of the way in which we can apply a definition to catch more areas of Government business so that electronic signatures can be substituted more comprehensively? As I said, there was initially concern about the relatively narrow area of business that was covered. We need a comprehensive substitution of electronic signatures for any form of notation that was previously used as an ``in writing'' form of signature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): May I ask whether clause 8 will require a series of statutory instruments? My hon. Friend said that statutory instruments will be necessary to aid property transactions with respect to the Lord Chancellor's Department, but what of other sectors? Will my hon. Friend's amendments facilitate the process or will there still need to be a statutory instrument, as mentioned at the beginning of the clause? I am not entirely clear about that. If the answer is yes, at what pace is the change likely to happen? Some external observers are keen to see the Bill driven forward as quickly as possible because of the benefits that it will bring to Great Britain plc, and they believe that any such statutory instruments should be on the statute book at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> On the point that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) made, the Bill will apply to provisions in existing legislation in which the phrase ``in writing'' appears, enabling us to substitute the electronic equivalent. Subsection (2) has deliberately been widely drafted to cover not only statutory requirements for something to be done or evidence to be given in writing, but requirements that something be delivered by post, authorised by signature or under seal, for example. It covers a range of hard-copy requirements for which we now need electronic equivalents. The phrase ``in writing'' may appear as part of a wider phrase or be defined differently in different statutes, but clause 8 will apply whenever the phrase appears.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) made an important point. I am keen for the powers provided under clause 8 to be used extensively to modernise the statute book as quickly as possible. As I said on Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office, who is responsible for e-government, is already working with other Government departments to ensure that each Department examines the statutes for which it is responsible in order to ascertain in which cases it can move rapidly to introduce electronic equivalents. A timetable for completing that has not yet been specified, but I am drawing to the attention of my colleagues in different Departments the need to move with considerable urgency. We are leading by example in my own Department, which is already preparing under clause 8 a draft order that relates to company law, to enable us to consult on it early in the new year and have it ready for introduction as soon as the Bill becomes law and clause 8 comes into effect.
<P>
On electronic conveyancing, the Law Commission is currently considering conveyancing and land registration for the 21st century, and examining what needs to be done to implement electronic conveyancing, but a firm date cannot yet be given for its introduction. I believe that my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor will want to consult fairly widely on the matter. However, we have been considering with officials in the Lord Chancellor's Department and with the Law Commission the possibility of using clause 8 powers to facilitate at least some necessary statutory modernisation and in turn enable electronic conveyancing. Further information will be given to the House as soon as the timetable for that becomes clearer. It was in the course of that consideration that we realised that these amendments were necessary.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 7, leave out lines 42 and 43.
<P>
Clause 8(4) lists several provisions that may be included when the Secretary of State exercises his power to make an order. The first half of paragraph (d) reads rather well, referring to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provision, in connection with anything so authorised, for a person to be able to refuse to accept receipt of something in electronic form'',
<P>
but in my view a full stop is missing at that point. Up to that point, it makes good sense, and should appear in the Bill. However, what follows is:
<P>
``except in such circumstances as may be specified in or determined under the order''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am concerned that that constitutes an open-ended stipulation, which will allow the Secretary of State to compel people to use electronic signatures for the electronic storage of such transactions. The Bill should be permissive—people should be allowed to do all those things; they should not be compelled to do so because that would create a form of apartheid between those who could and those who could not use electronic signatures. We enjoy a world of variety, and some people may want to keep up with the times at the leading edge of technology and modernity, as the Labour party pretends to be, while others prefer to live in the sticks.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Like the Tory party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I set them up and the hon. Gentleman can be relied on to deliver them.
<P>
We should accept that, however advanced the world becomes, some people do not want to share the same practices. They should be allowed to conduct their business however they choose; they should not be subject to legislation that compels them to behave differently. I am concerned that the catch-all second part of subsection (4)(d) will allow the Government in particular to say that they are entitled in law not to do business with people unless they meet certain standards or criteria in conducting their business electronically.
<P>
A subliminal power will be granted to the Government. They will be able to say that people can be excluded from tendering for Government business if they do not present the tender by electronic means. Perhaps the Government will say that they will not accept tax returns or do business with anyone who does not use a trust service provider that they like. The provision does not simply mean that they can refuse to do business with people if it is not done electronically, but that those people will not be entitled to communicate with the Government unless they use a trust service provider that complies with the statutory voluntary scheme that the Minister has so often mentioned.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): Why should the Government not adopt that attitude; big business does so all the time? I can give the hon. Gentleman a list of companies that insist on their suppliers being able to trade electronically. Those companies do not do business with suppliers who cannot trade electronically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It would be an abuse for the Government to adopt that attitude, because they are responsible to all citizens—I could use the word ``subjects''. Some companies may have such conditions of business, but people can go elsewhere. They cannot go elsewhere when dealing with the Government because only one exists and, sadly, power is going to their head.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): Does my hon. Gentleman agree that if a business abused a monopoly position it could be referred to the Government, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission or another regulator who would deal with it, but that is not the case with the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for amplifying my argument. I am concerned that we shall enshrine in law a power that will allow the Government to set certain terms. That is not intended to happen under the Bill. As so often in legislation, good intentions make bad law. Good posturing, propaganda and publicity do not necessarily translate into good enduring rules. I am worried that, through the backdoor, the Government will be able to set the terms by which people must do business with them, and that certain people will not be able to do business with the Government or others unless they do so through a registered trust service provider.
<P>
The Government might say that people are off the map unless they are e-compatible. No one should be compelled to do anything under the Bill; it should allow business to be done electronically. Old-fashioned people—as Adam Smith might say, the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker—might find it very difficult to do business with the Government, whereas those who have nice bits of electronic kit will be able to do so. I seek an assurance that no one will be excluded from doing business in any form whatever under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> No. I am finishing my speech. What do those one and a half lines add to the first two lines of paragraph (d)?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I support the point ably made by my hon. Friend, and I should like to test a wider point to seek reassurance from the Minister. That said, I look forward to the clause stand part debate, because we have wider questions about the whole approach that the Government propose in the clause.
<P>
I am concerned that subsection (4) could lead to a back-door introduction of the intentions and thinking behind part I of the Bill. Such provisions could be introduced Department by Department into the conditions under which they will deal with electronic commerce, especially in areas in which they are major players That back-door regulation could stifle the development of e-commerce in this country. Where in the clause are the protections for the business world from such development, perhaps by individual Departments? What undertakings will the Minister give to provide additional protection to be granted now or perhaps on Report that could answer an important point which I gather is of some concern to those in the industry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I would like to add some examples that I hope the Minister can clarify for us. The issue may be of concern if we talk specifically about the impact on business, but I can envisage circumstances in which an order may require the taking of electronic form. An example from the sort of work that I have done is communication with GPs. In the health service, certain claims have historically been required to be submitted in writing on paper. I understand the public policy interest in saying that future business between GPs and the Government was to be switched to electronic means, and that therefore the orders coming through the national health service would suggest that that was the way for business to be done. In those circumstances, one may not want a provision to allow individual GPs to opt out of the system, because the cost benefit comes from the fact that it is a universal system.
<P>
Was the Minister thinking of circumstances such as those when the Government legitimately deal in their own sphere and, because GPs act as independent contractors in some senses in the system, in which there are contractors? She may have been thinking of small independent contractors, as other hon. Members have mentioned, who can no longer do business with the Government because they are excluded from processes in which they should legitimately be able to engage, without their necessarily having to accept the electronic media that the Government choose to use, and which they could reasonably be expected not to use at certain stages of their development.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Let me begin, unusually, by giving the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) precisely the assurance that he seeks. He need look no further than subsection (6). Although I think that his amendment is well intentioned—I think that they all are—I hope that I shall be able to persuade him to withdraw it.
<P>
At issue are the ability and the right to refuse the receipt of something in electronic form. All members of the Committee, with the possible exception on this occasion of my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), are at one in our enthusiasm to promote electronic commerce and exciting new ways to do business, but we should not forget that not everybody wants to or can communicate electronically. It would clearly be quite unacceptable for my bank to say that in future it would only send bank statements electronically and that, if I had no means to receive them, I would have to do without them. Equally, there would be an understandable outcry if the Government said that people had to acquire the necessary kit before applying for benefit, acquiring a television licence, communicating with their GP and so on.
<P>
<B>Dr, Ladyman:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The Government should not foist such an arrangement on people in the short term. However, outside the souvenir shop downstairs is an old-fashioned tally stick. At some point, the Government passed a law or a statutory order stating that people were no longer entitled to expect a tally stick to be used when conducting transactions with the Government. There will come a time when the Government will wish to make it clear that some things must be done electronically.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Indeed, one might also refer to the change from paying wages in cash to paying them by cheque or automatic bank transfer. No doubt, the time will come when electronic means of communication are so ubiquitous that there would be no difficulty in saying that a certain kind of communication is only to be done electronically. However, we are certainly not at that stage yet. Although it may be appropriate and commercially desirable for Ford and other companies to say that they will accept only electronic tenders, it would not be appropriate for the Government to make such a provision now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I hear what the Minister is saying about the inappropriateness of doing such things now. However, I am anxious about the moment when such action is deemed appropriate. There is a risk that certain people, such as traders, would be excluded from Government tenders if the Government were suddenly and unilaterally to say, without reason or notice: ``You cannot do business with the Government unless you do it electronically.''
<P>
What mechanism or hurdle is the Minister prepared to put in place? That might include notification of the House by order, and would ensure that people doing business with the Government could not be arbitrarily excluded by the Government deciding that such matters could only be conducted electronically.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We do not need to provide further reassurance or procedural safeguards beyond those provided for in subsection (6). Clause 8 deals with putting electronic communications and storage on an equal footing with traditional ways of doing things and is not designed to replace them. The clause provides an electronic option: it does not compel the use of electronic means Subsection (6) states that an order under clause 8
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall not . . . require the use of electronic communications or electronic storage for any purpose''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, there is an exemption. In dealing with it, I anticipate an intervention that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton may make. The exemption in subsection (6)(b) deals with the position that may arise when someone has chosen previously to use an electronic option. It envisages that, when someone wants to vary or withdraw that choice, a period of notice may be specified in the order. It does that to deal with the problem of people choosing to switch back and forth between electronic and paper transactions in an attempt to make life difficult for the other party to the communication or transaction.
<P>
However, the general principle holds. No one will be compelled to use electronic communications or storage by orders made under clause 8.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I hear what the Minister is saying about the matter not being done by order. However, regardless of that, will she give an assurance that the Government will not simply say that no one can do business with them unless they do so electronically?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point that is wholly outside the scope of his amendment and the Bill. I think that I am right in saying—although I will double-check—that there are no statutory provisions requiring procurement to be conducted in writing. In other words, regardless of clause 8, it would be possible today for the Government to insist on electronic communication for procurement. That is not what we are doing; nor is it our intention under clause 8 powers.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The clause borders on the realms of absurdity. If procurement is not conducted in writing, it can only be done verbally. Clearly, no tender for Government business would be done in that way. Stipulations in law state that certain tenders must be publicised and, more often than not, that is done in writing. To say that there is an option other than such action to be taken in writing is unrealistic. The Government would not buy millions of pounds' worth of equipment on the say-so on the telephone. We are concerned not with the existing state of the law, but with whether the Government can compel people to undertake transactions electronically and exclude people who want to do it only in writing, be it by fax or by letter. The Minister has been slightly disingenuous in suggesting that the law, as it stands, is different from that.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I fear that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands me, whether deliberately or not I am not sure. Procurement by the Government is a matter of contract. It is not a matter of statute. It does not fall, therefore, within clause 8. Clause 7 will enable electronic signatures and electronic contracts to have full legal effect, but clause 8, which deals with statutory instruments to amend the statute book and allows for the electronic equivalent to actions done in writing or in other forms of hard copy, does not apply to procurement because that is not a matter of statute, but of contract. I hope that I made the position clear. [Hon. Members: ``Spot on.''] I thank my hon. Friends.
<P>
We are considering the provision that allows the appropriate Minister to put in place an electronic process, which will allow something to be done electronically that, by statute, could only have been done previously by traditional means. Subsection (4) provides the tools with which that new process can be constructed. Not all of them will always be required. Subsection (4)(d) allows the order to make provision for someone
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to refuse to accept something in electronic form except in such circumstances specified in, or determined under, the order''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I have already said, we are considering the case of people carrying out a transaction who have already agreed that they want to undertake it electronically. If one party did not agree to that, subsection (6) would apply and that party could not be compelled to use electronic means. We are dealing with a situation in which both parties—let us say, the Government and the citizen—have agreed to umdertake a transaction electronically. There will still be circumstances in which it is right that someone can refuse to accept receipt of something in electronic form, for example, if it were not in the electronic form that had been agreed.
<P>
As for a transaction with the Government, that is no different from saying that a person's application for a driving licence has to be on the prescribed form. A person cannot provide the same information on a scrap of paper and demand that the Government accept it. We are trying to achieve the equivalent results in the electronic world. Subsection (4)(a) provides that the electronic form may be specified The provision to which the amendment refers provides, in part, that such requirements may be enforced by refusing to accept receipt if those requirements are not met.
<P>
The amendment would mean that such requirements could not be enforced by such provisions. Instead, an order could only contain provisions allowing someone to refuse something in electronic form arbitrarily, even though that person had already agreed to electronic communication or storage. I certainly do not want Government Departments that have undertaken to offer an electronic service then to turn round and refuse to accept electronic receipt. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton does not provide additional protection for the citizen who does not want to be compelled to use electronic communication; subsection (6) already deals with the issue of compulsion.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt with the various issues that have been raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I was hoping that the Minister would address herself to our concerns about the Part I provisions which are being introduced in the clause, especially subsection (4)(d), via the back door.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman I was so carried away with the issue of compulsion that I quite forgot his question.
<P>
Clause 8 could be used to specify, for instance, the use of an approved trust service provider. It might be helpful if we were to return to the issue on clause stand part. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that, when the Government are party to the transaction, they have a direct interest in specifying the form of the electronic transaction, just as they have an interest in specifying the form of the off-line transaction. When a form needs to be signed, or when evidence of identity needs to be provided, it would be proper—indeed, essential—for the Government to set standards that may differ, depending on the nature of the communication and the type of electronic signature that is required. We are working with the Alliance for Electronic Business to ensure that its approval profile for certain types of electronic signature will be consistent with the levels of trust and confidence that the Government require, for instance, for a passport application.
<P>
That answers the point made by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) but I stress that clause 8 could not be used to reintroduce the terrible spectre of mandatory key escrow through the back door—that phrase reminded me of fears that are sometimes expressed on that issue. I hope that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton will agree to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I think that, by a whisker, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 8, line 11, after `storage', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except that no provision may be made for any institution or person to charge for the electronic storage of a record which heretofore has carried no charge'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is simple. If someone enters into an agreement or contract, say an air time contract for a mobile phone, or a direct debit contract with a bank, each party keeps a record. There is no fee or charge for keeping such record of either side of the transaction. The amendment would ensure that, if a contract or agreement is entered into electronically, no fee will arbitrarily be charged for storing the record. Individuals cannot be charged a fee for a current service that is free. A bank cannot charge a customer for keeping a record of his direct debit, nor can a telephone company charge for keeping a record of someone's air time contract.
<P>
Those who wish to trade electronically, whether for a purchase or an agreement, should not find that they are arbitrarily charged a fee for the electronic storage of that agreement. An existing agreement, however Dickensian it may be, can lie in a file gathering dust. However, electronic storage might be deemed to incur a cost, simply, say, for back-up electricity. Electronic transactions should not be abused by people in their charging of a fee pretending that storage is expensive and that there is an additional charge for so keeping the record. The amendment would draw a line, stating that electronic storage should not be deemed to be more expensive than paper storage. It is just a simple cap on the existing arrangements in an attempt to facilitate e-commerce.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I understand what he attempts to achieve. Is not the truth of it that the wording he proposes would mean that, if an entrepreneur identified a way of improving the service to his customers by storing authenticated documents, he would not be able to choose a fee for so improving his service? That would be an extraordinary position for a Conservative amendment to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is very annoying to have to be reasonable in this business, but the hon. Gentleman has a point This may be a rare moment in parliamentary procedure, in that an hon. Gentleman from one side of the Committee admits to someone on the other side that he has a point. The Minister may wish to consider that the amendment's purpose is to ensure that an institution dealing with the consumer is protected, while, essentially, the hon. Member for South Thanet has spoken of the wholesaler, the middleman, who will look at the business of storage and perhaps, as a third party, offer a service to something like a bank. I should not like to prelude the hon. Gentleman from charging a fee, because of course he would be in a legitimate business. Dammit! I have to admit that the hon. Gentleman made a good point. However, perhaps the Minister should consider whether it is reasonable to admit that some sort of cap should exist to ensure that those who go into electronic commerce do not pretend that it is much more expensive and try to diddle consumers by imposing charges that were unforeseen at the time they entered into a contract which they might otherwise have entered into on paper.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I support the main thrust of my hon. Friend's argument. The theoretical instance of an entrepreneur, with great ingenuity, coming up with a new system has to be considered. The practical problem today is that consumers who enter into contracts to get engaged in e-commerce have to sign contracts that are hundreds of pages long and may contain terms that they are not aware of and that hidden charges may be included that expose consumers to unreasonable fees and costs afterwards. Therefore it is better to protect the consumer than the budding entrepreneur in this instance, unless the Government can come up with something better.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I regret that I arrived late: I was in a Select Committee with the Chancellor of the Exchequer—[Interruption.<P>
] I do not wish to name drop, but that is the reason for my late arrival. However, I intend to speak fulsomely on clause stand part. I know that the Minister is interested in—[Interruption.<P>
] There is barracking from the cheapest seats at the back—and supportive of the Government's policy for tackling financial exclusion. [Interruption.<P>
] If the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston wishes to intervene rather than mutter from a sedentary position, I will be happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Oh, go on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is now attempting to be patronising from a sedentary position.
<P>
The hon. Lady is concerned about financial exclusion. I wonder whether she thinks that it would be in pursuance of her policy of tackling financial exclusion for her to oppose this sensible amendment. After all, are we not keen for all sections of society to engage in on-line activity and e-commerce, and so on? In this context, might this not assist the hon. Lady in her noble work—as she would see it—of tackling financial exclusion by putting a cap on these services, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton has argued, or keeping a zero fee for services that are at present free to users? For that reason, I invite the hon. Lady to welcome the amendment. If she does not, perhaps she can tell us how that fits in with her policy of tackling financial exclusion.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The motivation behind the amendment is a concern that fees might be increased for electronic media. Will the Minister clarify the words ``different fees or charges''? Will cost savings be passed on to the consumer? I have heard estimates that the Government could save as much as £6 billion a year by using electronic rather than paper means across all Departments. For example, a person who applied for his passport on-line might be entitled to a discount. We might see similar initiatives across the whole of Government. If the Minister can tell us that different means lower, that might remove some of the concerns behind the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Once again, I hope to persuade the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that his amendment is unnecessary. My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet has done my work for me on this occasion.
<P>
I should make it plain that clause 8 deals only with barriers to electronic commerce. If there is no power to charge a statutory fee in the paper world, a Government Department will be unable to impose a new fee or charge in the electronic world. Therefore, the amendment, which spells out almost exactly what I have just said, is unnecessary because there is no power in clause 8 to impose a fee. The power in clause 8 applies simply in cases in which fees or charges are or may be imposed, and allows a differential charge to be imposed for the electronic equivalent of a transaction.
<P>
I hope that that provides most, if not all, of the reassurances that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton sought. For the sake of completeness, I should add that there is a theoretical possibility of circumstances in which no fee is charged at present, but in which there is a statutory power to impose a fee. In that case, it would be possible under clause 8(4)(h) to impose a fee for the electronic transaction. However, I am unaware of any such example, and find it difficult to imagine a situation in which the appropriate Minister would want to levy a fee in the electronic world when one was not levied in the paper world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> My purpose is to examine the way in which the world of commerce conducts itself, not the way in which the Government conduct themselves. I want to establish the principle in the Bill and in our deliberations that there should be a measure of equity between those who want to do business on paper and those who want to do so electronically. Neither should be especially disadvantaged. I am trying to flush out from the Minister an assurance that we shall attempt in everything that we do to establish equity between the various ways of doing business and that we shall not establish in law the ability to charge for one way of doing business and not the other so that we disadvantage one group of people.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This part of the Bill is designed to ensure—and I believe it does—that there is a fair choice between the electronic option and the paper option. It will not be possible under the clause to impose a fee for the electronic option when there is no power to impose one for the paper option. An order could not impose such a fee.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hallam and my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet said, electronic transactions are generally much cheaper than the paper kind. Many commercial companies rightly seek to pass on those cost savings to their customers. The Government might, on occasion, also want to pass on such cost savings by having a lower charge or fee when the electronic option is chosen. However, that raises precisely the problem of financial exclusion to which the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) referred.
<P>
That is similar, if I can use an analogy, to energy companies giving a discount to customers paying by direct debit. The ability to use direct debit is not evenly spread across the population.
<P>
There are financial and social exclusion issues that the Government will certainly want to take into account in exercising their order-making powers under the clause. At this stage, it is sensible to take a power that allows for the flexibility of charging differential fees in situations where a fee can already be charged, or the paper equivalent, but then to decide on a case-by-case basis, whether it is appropriate to use that power to charge differential fees in order to pass on cost savings to the consumer or the citizen. I hope that that will give the hon. Gentleman the additional reassurance that he seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> In view of that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 8, line 26, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(m) provision for confirmation that no electronic signature has been transmitted under duress for such signatures as heretofore would have required witnessing'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 56, in page 8, line 48, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) No order under this section shall require an electronic signature to be certified by any person other than its maker unless (apart from this Act or any order made under it) a signature (not being an electronic signature) made for the same purpose is required to be notarised or otherwise authenticated by a person other than its maker. A requirement for a signature to be witnessed shall not be treated for this purpose as a requirement for it to be authenticated.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 57, in page 8, line 48, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) No order under this section shall make any provision inconsistent with the following provisions of this section.
<P>
(10) Unless otherwise agreed between the purported sender and the recipient of an electronic communication, the purported sender of the electronic communication is bound by that communication only if the communication was sent by the purported sender or with the authority of the purported sender.
<P>
(11) Unless otherwise agreed between the purported maker of an electronic signature and any person relying on it (or any person through or under whom the person relying on it claims), the purported maker of the electronic signature is bound by that signature only if the signature was made by the purported maker or with the authority of the purported maker.
<P>
(12) Subsections (10) and (11) are not intended to affect the operation of a law (whether written or unwritten) that makes provision for:
<P>
(a) conduct engaged in by a person within the scope of the person's actual or apparent authority to be attributed to another person; or
<P>
(b) a person to be bound by conduct engaged in by another person within the scope of the other person's actual or apparent authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> This group of amendments links with our earlier debate and the hon. Member for South Thanet may wish to add a few comments. At present, certain signatures have to be witnessed in law. That is an established practice which not only essentially says that a signature is valid and signed by the person purporting to sign the document, but implicitly says that the circumstances in which that signature has been put on the page are okay, that the person is not under duress and is of sound mind. When a signature is corroborated, the contract appears more secure, stands up better as a document and certainly stands up better in court.
<P>
As some legislation is amended, some provisions may change. It may no longer be necessary to witness some signatures that had to be witnessed in the past. New areas of contract law where one may have expected a witness to be needed may be deemed not to need one, as an electronic signature will suffice. Someone sitting at a desk tapping at a laptop need press only a few buttons to verify or send an electronic signature. At least on paper, one can look at something and see whether there is an unusual squiggle in the turn of the hand. We have all scribbled things down after a few noggins at night and it does not look quite the same in the morning.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Speak for yourself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I certainly speak for myself. The clarity of a written signature is visually exact. One can sometimes see differences in a signature, but one can read it. Something sent via a laptop is very precise. There is no such mark or pattern if one sends an electronic signature. An action could be taken under duress and there would be no tell-tale signs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that there is a problem with the witnessing of electronic signatures. But take the example of someone writing a document and then asking someone else to witness his signature. There is absolutely no difference between the scanned-inn signature of the first person and the scanned-in signature of the second person. They are exactly the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It may be that inadequacies in the existing system should not be replicated in the new system. I am arguing that thought should be given to how the law should treat an electronic signature that might have been sent under duress. If electronic signatures become increasingly admissible in court, and if they are used for the purposes of significant contracts such as a mortgage or, ultimately, even the purchase of a house or a company, it is important that there are safeguards about the authenticity of signatures and that the circumstances in which they are sent are fair and reasonable, and not criminal. The issue of duress, as distinct from fraud and other criminal acts, has not yet been addressed.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): The hon. Gentleman talks of duress, but I wonder whether he is being over-optimistic about what one can achieve by electronic means. A human witness is often unable to establish whether duress has taken place. For instance, if I were to threaten someone to sign a document by saying that I would shoot his dog, the fact that I was not present in the room when he does sign would not stop that being done under duress. Conversely, I have great difficulty in imagining what form of electronic confirmation one could obtain to be reassured that me dog was not under threat. It seems that the primary purpose of witnessing a signature is to confirm the identity of the person who signs. After all, no contract that is signed under duress will ever be upheld by the court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Luckily for me, my assets do not include a dog. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the witness to a signature is there mainly to confirm the identity of the person signing. All I am saying—it is a broad point—is that provision should be made. We are looking at a series of provisions. The amendments propose a number of new paragraphs and subsections. We believe that duress may arise as a new problem in the sending of electronic signatures. I am saying only that provision should be made. If the Committee ensures that the Bill specifically mentions duress, it can only help. At present, the Bill is restrictive.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve. I wonder whether he remembers that, in the film ``The Godfather'', the movie producer is made to sign a contract. A gun is put to his head and he is told that either his brains or his signature will be on the contract within five seconds, so he signs the contract. That would be a paper signature. It would be a legal document, but it would never be upheld in law. The law already includes provision for making contracts illegal if they are signed under duress or if there is an attempt at fraud.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The way in which the previous amendment went would make such a choice quite easy for me.
<P>
Someone can try to fake a written signature, but it has a certain shape and form that, by and large, can be reproduced by the person to be seen to be valid. The thing about an electronic signature is that once a person has the key, anyone can use it, and there are no tell-tale signs to lead someone to whomever might have done it. That is a crucial difference.
<P>
The whole of our debate on clause 7 was about authenticity, but if I have the right key, I can send the exact signature of the hon. Member for South Thanet. That is not so true of a written signature. I want the law to be able to accept that, even though a perfect signature has gone down the wires and through the ether, it might have been sent under duress. The exactitude of an electronic signature differs from that of a written signature, so the issue of duress becomes more important. There is no prospect of detecting duress from the look of an electronic signature as opposed to a written one.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> The hon. Gentleman is arguing a difference by degree between a physical and an electronic signature. He misses the fact that the issue of duress or fraud is the same in both and that there are existing legal safeguards for both. A master forger can easily do a handwritten signature, but I do not accept that it is much different for him to forge an electronic signature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Among many other distinctive qualities, the hon. Gentleman has a distinctive voice and accent. When what he said appears in script, it will seem no different from anything that I have said. One cannot detect an accent from what appears in script. An electronic signature is essentially script—not a sound, a look or a shape—so, once it has been sent, its clarity is exactly the same as if the real person had sent it. If a gun were placed to the hon. Gentleman's head, heaven forbid——
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument misses the distinction between the secrecy of an electronic key and a password or a pin number, for which there are safeguards. That is where the distinctiveness lies in the electronic system and it is effectively the same as the distinctiveness of a handwritten signature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is exactly that precision that proves my point, because it can be given away totally and exactly. If the hon. Gentleman were to give away the pin number of his credit or bank card, which might give access to enormous resources, the person to whom the pin number had been given would be able to use it. Apart from a photograph at the telling machine, no one would be able to discern whether the hon. Gentleman himself or someone else was raiding the millions from his Scottish bank. If someone presses a person to reveal the key to an electronic signature, when that signature is sent, it is exact, undeniable and no tell-tale traces of duress can be discernible. If I had a gun to my head, I might sign a contract, but I would put in a squiggle that was slightly different from my existing signature, to which I could refer later with the police by my side. I could say: ``Look, there is the tell-tale sign. You can tell that I was under duress when I made it.''
<P>
The key point is that the electronic signature is scientific, and pure and cannot be adulterated in the way that it is sent, whereas a written signature can. The issue of duress thus becomes much more important for an electronic than for a written signature. I am saying only that the Secretary of State should make provision for the possibility of someone sending an electronic signature under duress. It is a safeguard against injustice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> I am enjoying this exchange. The hon. Gentleman admitted that he did not major in logic. The issues of which he speaks are after the event, so are a matter of evidence. Should the hon. Gentleman, as he said, make an unusual sign when writing his signature, he could refer to that later as evidence under duress.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman saying to the police ``I did not do that'' is exactly the same as saying that there is a little squiggle in a handwritten exercise. The question, however, arises later and is a judicial matter. There are safeguards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The hon. Gentleman has helped me. He is right: the matter is one of evidence. However, many matters that may be regarded as matters of evidence or matters in criminal law are included in the list in subsection (4). For example, paragraph (i) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provision, in relation to any criminal or other liabilities that may arise''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraphs (a) to (m) refer to the area which the Bill is trying to define as that in which such matters should apply. I am simply trying to add a further matter which would make the courts realise that am electronic signature, if sent in the way (in which I have speculated, may require a proper understanding of whether it has been sent under duress.
<P>
That would not bind anyone or compel anything much. It would simply be a warning sign. I am flagging up the fact that an electronic signature is different from a written one. The extra provision that I am proposing would merely help the process of justice by ensuring that criminal activity has not taken place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Our exchanges are covered by the Bill. The hon. Gentleman knows full well that the assurances given by the Minister are recorded in Hansard and may be used in a court as evidence. That should satisfy those on the Opposition Front Bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The brilliance of exchanges in Committee—however well recorded in Hansard—is often lost in the mists of time. It certainly gets lost when Secretaries of State pass their files on to their successors. We are dealing with the exact letter of the law: that is our duty, job and purpose. Simply adding an innocuous paragraph would improve and add value to the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 56 and 57 are related to one another. Amendment No. 56 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A requirement for a signature to be witnessed shall not be treated for this purpose as a requirement for it to be authenticated.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At the moment, ordinary signatures are rarely required to be authenticated, even on important forms such as birth registrations or tax returns. Indeed, passport applications are a rare exception. Electronic signatures do not justify special treatment. An ordinary signature by an unknown person does not allow that person to be identified—although there means of attempting to do that—but enables a later signature to be recognised as belonging to the same person. An electronic signature may perform an identical function, without the need for third-party certification.
<P>
The Government should not be allowed to impose a condition that any electronic signature to be recognised in law must have been certified by a third party. Such a signature should also be admissible if both parties are content with the mutual recognition of uncertified signatures. That is very much what the hon. Member for South Thanet was talking about earlier. It is important for business-to-business transactions. If businesses are working through a portal, which brings together buyers and sellers perhaps for some sort of procurement—more often than not, one is dealing with people one knows. I used to find that when I was buying and selling in the oil business.
<P>
I used to accept a tested telex, or even an untested telex, on a page of A4 for a transaction worth £25 million because I knew the party with whom I was dealing. Similarly, with a business-to-business transaction, the various people involved will know each other from doing business regularly, and they will accept the signature. It will verify the contract, but there will be no need for it to be certified because they will know whom they are dealing with.
<P>
The amendment is designed to ensure that the Government cannot demand nor establish a condition that, to be recognised in law, signatures have to be certified by a third party. That is important for the promotion of electronic business, especially in the business-to-business sector.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> To illustrate the effect of his amendment, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman focus on documents for which witnesses are currently required, which is not usually the case in business-to-business transactions. If I want to make a codicil to my will to send to my solicitors, a witness is usually required. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that it should be illegal for the Government to make the same requirement for an electronic codicil?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> There should be no general requirement. Under specific Acts of Parliament, in which an amendment to an electronic signature will be allowed, some sort of witness may be required. The danger is that whenever there has to be a witness, the Government can step in and say that there is a requirement for the signature to be authenticated. The issue is authentication.
<P>
Amendment No. 56 follows corresponding provisions in recently passed electronic transactions legislation in Australia, which was recommended by members of the Australian electronic commerce experts group. It ensures that unless users of electronic signatures explicitly agree otherwise between themselves, the normal rule applies. Whoever relies on the signature must prove that it is genuine if it is disputed by the apparent maker. That rule protects someone whose signature key is stolen by hackers by clever technical means. Neither ordinary computers nor any available smart cards are sufficiently secure to justify reversing that rule.
<P>
Although new European standards are being proposed, the process is pretty secretive and does not justify proper public confidence in the security of the resulting products. Until secure products are available and have gained public confidence through exposure to open and transparent scrutiny, there should be no power to force users of electronic signatures to have responsibility for stolen signature keys. Without the amendment, clause 8(4)(g), along with clause 8(5)(d) and (e), will enable such a power to be exercised. The amendment would prevent the Secretary of State from reversing the well-established precedent that currently applies to a signature on a cheque. 
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The three amendments cover the same general area from different angles. The suggestion that we should introduce a specific provision to prevent electronic signatures from being transmitted under duress seems technically infeasible. The general rule of law, which makes contracts made under duress unenforceable, is sufficient—in so far as we are able to establish duress. If we are not able to establish duress, it will not assist matters to incorporate that requirement in the Bill because there is no particular electronic means by which to do so. I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's objective, but the amendment does not add anything material to the power of the Minister or the protection of the public.
<P>
Amendment No. 56 is risky in that it effectively abolishes the protection of witness requirements across the entire range of laws, which are modified by the provisions of the Bill. We have absolute confidence in the judgements of the Secretary of State and his earthly representative on the Front Bench, but a slightly less competent person may occupy that position in future and use the provisions of the Bill to allow the electronic equivalent of a commitment that is currently made only by paper and a witness. Under the amendment, that person would automatically be unable to require the authentication of the signature. The requirement would simply disappear and that would be dangerous; we should expect the Secretary of State to judge each case as it arises on its merits. There may be cases in which the witness requirement no longer applies others in which it applies on paper but not electronically and yet others in which it still applies electronically. I do not think that we should bind ourselves on that at this point.
<P>
Amendment No. 57 seems, technically defective in that it starts at subsection (9), although it would be added after subsection (7). The main content seems not to add substantially to the Bill, but I shall not go into that further.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton has ably put the case for the three amendments. On amendment No. 55, he made the clear case that we were providing for circumstances that might arise; just as we have provided for other circumstances that may arise, we should provide for this one. Indeed, in the example of the cash machine with an electronic eye, it is conceivable that in future some form of electronic camera will be used to validate signatures, in which case it might be handy to have the clause end where the amendment suggests so that that requirement could be built into the legislation.
<P>
As for amendment No. 56, it seems to me that a signature is a private act. If two individuals want to exchange signatures privately, we should allow them to do so and to use them for whatever purpose they see fit. Private arrangements should not normally be subject to public control. The limitations of amendment No. 56 would ensure that that was the case.
<P>
The Committee should adopt amendment No. 57 because the principles behind the system of validating cheques go right back into the common law of this country; those principles have been established over centuries and have proved most effective. It is a complete reversal of that system to require an individual to put an onus on the payer to prove that he did not sign something, rather than vice versa. I was talking about that to a senior banker the other day. He said that any Government who chose to exercise the powers under subsection (4)(g), coupled with subsection (5)(d) and (e), to reverse the historic system would be out of their tiny mind. Nevertheless, if that is a risk, we must ensure that it does not happen.
<P>
It would be wrong to ignore commercial pressures. Banks may press the Government to remove the commercial pressure by obliging payers to take the risk of their signatures being forged, because they do not want to be obliged to price that risk commercially, as under current law or with the protection that would be provided under the amendment. No doubt, in a fast developing world, the banks may be obliged to price that risk at a level below which they can recover the cost of running it. Frankly, that is a price that they may have to pay to enjoy the benefits of e-commerce.
<P>
Insurance companies might become involved in encryption services. The encryption companies will need to take on the burden of risk of such forgeries and, therefore, ease the debate between the payer and the payee about who should bear the costs of an act of fraud. It is healthy to allow a diverse system to develop, but we should not allow commercial pressures to be exerted on Ministers and Departments to change a law that is so fundamental that our friends in Australia have already recognised its importance by incorporating a similar provision into their legislation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I promise to be brief and not to go further into Boolean logic, especially as the cyber geeks of the world have already started to ping my e-„mail system with their views on it. For their sake, I should say that I am well aware of the definitions of the inclusive ``or'' and of the exclusive ``or''. I chose not to burden the Committee with that information; I thought that it would be more than it could stand.
<P>
The amendments are well meaning. I understand what the Opposition are trying to do. However, they are being too rigorous when a little more simplicity would be better. The Government's strategy is to offer people choice. People should be able to choose which signature to offer or accept. If any dispute about signatures arises, it will be fought out in the law courts and a jury will decide whether the contract should be honoured.
<P>
The courts and juries will consider whether someone was put under duress when signing a contract. People may claim that they did not issue their electronic signature but that someone used their computer when they left it unguarded while out of their office, or that somehow they lost control of their personal keys, just as people lose control of their personal identification numbers, but the courts will consider all those matters. It is better to leave such matters to the courts than to introduce complexity that might cause confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton might say this better than I can, but we want to introduce flexibility and protect the flexibility that exists in the Bill. The words in amendments No. 57 are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Unless otherwise agreed between the purported sender and the recipient of an electronic communication''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to protect the agreed position. The hon. Gentleman should consider the exercise by a Minister of powers that would exclude the range of options that exist today.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Redefining flexibility in several increasingly complex ways will not protect it. Trying to protect flexibility in that way will limit what can be offered. Flexibility is already provided in the Bill, as are the choices available. Indeed, it might even be argued that the amendments move away from technological neutrality, because in a year or two it may be perfectly possible to incorporate a retina scan in a personal signature to prove that the person was at the keyboard when the information was sent. That would not prove that he was not under duress or that someone had not pulled his eye out, stuck it on the end of a stick and held it up to the scanner—although I suppose that that would be fairly easy to prove when the person involved eventually went to court to try to establish that he had been under duress.
<P>
Technological advances are in progress. DNA matching, for example, could be incorporated into a future authenticity system. The Bill is therefore better left simple. Protection is already provided, as I am sure the Minister will clarify.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned flexibility. How is the Secretary of State's flexibility limited to prevent him from redefining matters to make them less flexible for users?
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point; that possibility remains. I may return to that matter when we debate whether the clause should stand part, because it is worth discussing. However, simplicity—allowing the courts to decide—
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Leaving it to the courts is not a simple matter but would introduce much vagueness. The judicial process involves the letter of the law, and the more precise legislation is the easier it is for judges to decide. The hon. Gentleman proposes retaining an element of vagueness, which would be an extraordinary gamble. By making the provision precise, our simple amendment would help judges make decisions in the event of a dispute.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman; we shall have to agree to differ. I believe that retaining such simplicity to enable the courts to decide is ultimately a better way to proceed.
<P>
An amendment similar to amendment No. 56 might have been appropriate. Amendment No. 56 seems not to require a witness to be involved in the authentication of a signature. One of the suggestions that the Minister might agree to consider and return to on Report is to take a step further and specify that in some cases the authentication of an electronic signature may take the place in law of a witness in existing legislation. In other words, if the witness were required simply to guarantee the identity of the person signing the document, perhaps an electronic signature could replace the need for a physical, personal witness for certain types of document. However, that is not my interpretation of what amendment No. 56 offers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I rise to support amendment No. 57, an important amendment that goes to the heart of what I hope all hon. Members are trying to achieve—to promote electronic commerce and encourage people to use it. The critical element is whether people cam have confidence in a signature system designed to verify a transaction.
<P>
It has been said that the Government favour a reputable presumption that an electronic signature was made by its apparent maker. Amendment No. 57 is designed to reverse that, requiring prior agreement that the signature is authentic, and putting more control in the hands of the purported maker of the signature in proving that he did not make the signature. That would be an important safeguard.
<P>
Two models could be used for such transactions. The first is the cheque model, and the second is the ATM, or cashpoint, model. As we all know, cheques are insecure. A written signature is worth very little, as chequebooks can be stolen and written signatures made, and presented cheques can bounce. But cheques are subject to good procedures for understanding that such fraud has taken place. However, banks will fight tooth and nail the suggestion that an ATM has gone wrong, because they assume, and in most cases can prove, that, for example, a member of the family was involved or the PIN number has been disclosed. Banks maintain that the ATM is, by definition, a secure system, and are therefore not prepared to cede ground when someone claims that there has been a problem with an ATM transaction. Banks are prepared to cede ground when the problem is with a transaction by cheque, because it is recognised that cheques are insecure. Other essential insecure transactions include giving credit card numbers over the telephone.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Those in the industry will assume that electronic signatures are on the ATM model and that they are secure. They will strongly defend the suggestion that the system has been defrauded. The use of such technology is sometimes a good thing and is encouraging from the merchants' point of view; they want to know that they will receive payment. Merchants have faced problems with credit card payments and have eventually lost out when fraud has taken place. However, there is huge risk from the users' point of view. It will not be adequate to tell people to take such matters to the courts. Ordinary people find it difficult to go to court and a case about whether a £50 transaction to buy some flowers or a few CDs on the internet involved a fraudulently used electronic signature, given the huge technical complexity and range of possible electronic signature solutions, will not be straightforward. It will be no substitute for the case law on written cheques, which has been established over many years. We are going into fairly new territory and it is important that we get the provisions right at the beginning.
<P>
There are some possible commercial solutions. People may underwrite the risks. Egg, the financial services organisation, is offering an internet credit card on which it guarantees the transactions. It has found a commercial solution to the problem and says that people can use its system with confidence because it guarantees security. Such practice will develop over time and banks will fill in some of the gaps in cases of potential problems and lack of confidence.
<P>
Without the initial safeguards proposed in the amendments, particularly in amendment No. 57, I can foresee hiccups. High-profile cases will come to light in which the individual trying to prove the fraud will find it extremely difficult to demonstrate that in court, because it will be presumed that the signature is correct. It will be difficult to prove otherwise. Something along the lines of amendment No. 57 or a clearer steer to the courts on how to treat such a problem will create a greater balance between merchants and users of the system, and favour users more, and will generate the confidence that we seek. I am sure that there will be financial solutions for the merchants. The line must be drawn somewhere and we do not want to reach the point at which users can be reckless about the use of their signatures because they know that the merchants will pick up the tab.
<P>
Credit card companies will insure against their fraudulent losses, while merchants will ensure against theirs, so there will be secondary backup. At present, the line is drawn too far on the side of suppliers and too far away from users. If one or two cases are brought to court or a batch of credit card numbers are stolen from a site and matched up to a raided key encryption service, people could develop a tremendous lack of confidence in the system. It would undo the work that we are all trying to achieve in electronic signatures. We want to move forward from what is essentially a grey area, with little case law, to something on which the courts will quickly have to generate case law. I side with the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton—more guidance is better than less when entering such a new area.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This has been an extremely thorough and interesting, if somewhat lengthy, debate. There is common ground between the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton and myself, which I shall come to in a minute. However, I must point out the massive inconsistency in his argument. In speaking to amendment No. 55, he argued eloquently that electronic signatures were inherently different from physical signatures. That is common ground between us. However, on amendment No. 56, the hon. Gentleman stood on his head and argued that electronic signatures should be treated in the same way as physical signatures, ignoring the fact that they were different.
<P>
I shall deal with the amendments in turn, but I want to emphasise that clause 8 deals with transactions to which the Government are a party, or that Parliament has in the past thought so important that they needed to take a written form set out in an Act. One business will normally trade with another by means of a contract, and clause 8 will not be relevant except in special cases such as property, when statutory provisions relate to a contract.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I would like the matter to be absolutely clear. Is my hon. Friend the Minister saying that the provision will apply when the Government are a party to a contract or when they determine that a contract ought to be conducted in a certain way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Clause 8 will apply when the Government are a party to the transaction under statutory provisions, or when there is a business-to-business contract that has to comply with the provisions of a statute. It is important for me to make that clear at the outset.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Under what circumstances would it be justified to require citizens to deal with the Government with only a third-party certified signature? Why should citizens be obliged to use, for example, the provisions under Part I in relation to a certified key? Should not citizens be able directly to supply to the Government the verification public key that they want to be used to verify their signatures? The difference is between third-party verification and direct information.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We started to deal with that in our previous debate. It will depend on the nature of the transaction with the Government and on the level of trust and confidence in the signature that the Government will require for each transaction.
<P>
Amendment No. 55 is, like all the others in the group, well intentioned but unnecessary. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton is concerned that the protection offered by a requirement for a signature to be witnessed in the paper world may be removed if that transaction is allowed electronically, and that that would give rise to the possibility of duress in transactions involving the use of electronic signatures.
<P>
Once again, I stress that the intended effect of the clause is to allow an electronic option and remove existing statutory barriers that force transactions to be made on paper. The clause is not designed to remove the underlying requirement that Parliament has seen fit to impose. Subsection (2)(c) already allows the power to operate on existing requirements for a transaction to be witnessed.
<P>
It will not be possible to use clause 8 to recast the parliamentary intention behind a statutory requirement for a specific signature to be witnessed. The clause will allow an electronic equivalent to be introduced. The appropriate Minister choosing to exercise his powers under the clause will need to consider what the purpose is behind a requirement for a witness, and then provide some suitable electronic alternative such as requiring a second person to add his own electronic signature to the underlying communication and incorporating that person's statement about the identity of the first signatory. That might be the appropriate electronic equivalent to a statutory requirement that a paper signature be witnessed.
<P>
Orders made under clause 8 would introduce the appropriate electronic equivalent to the requirement for a witness. However, if there is no provision for a witness in the statutory requirement that affects paper, why on earth introduce it into the electronic option? If the hon. Gentleman is worried that legislation on how documents are witnessed is not tight enough, he should raise his concerns in debates about the modernisation of such legislation, not in relation to introducing the electronic option.
<P>
As I have said before, we are trying to facilitate electronic ways of doing things. The effect of the hon. Gentleman's amendment would be the opposite of that, as it would allow clause 8 to make the electronic option more onerous than the paper equivalent. The amendment would not force the intended safeguard to apply in all cases, but would certainly allow the Minister responsible to make the electronic alternative more onerous than the paper one. I do not think that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention—it is certainly not the Government's intention—so the amendment is undesirable.
<P>
Amendment No. 56, too, is unnecessary. However, it is worse than amendment No. 55, as it would severely limit the usefulness of clause 8. In tabling it, hon. Members have misunderstood the nature of electronic signatures or are trying to frustrate the objective of allowing Government to update the statute book to allow an electronic option. Several hon. Friends have said that no one knows where the technology is taking us, which is why we must have a technology-neutral Bill. Clause 8 is necessary because so many Acts discriminate against what is now technologically possible, but was not possible when they were passed. Clause 8 is designed simply to remove the legal barriers that still force us to use paper.
<P>
We are true to technological neutrality in another sense. We should not rewrite the statute book based on the way in which electronic commerce works now What may be a perfectly sensible assumption today may become outdated very quickly indeed. The amendment would force the Government to rely on a certain conception of how the technology should be applied.
<P>
As we have discussed, one of the most promising ways of creating an electronic signature is by public-key cryptography. That is not the only way, but it is being used increasingly by several companies. Certainly, many companies believe that it is likely to be the best solution—in the medium term, at least—to the problem of how to do secure business over an insecure medium. Using public-key cryptography means that there is a mathematically unique and unbreakable link between the private key used to sign the document and the public key used to verify it.
<P>
However, as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton accepts, there is still a need to link the private key to an individual. That is usually done by a certification authority because electronic signatures are not the same as manual signatures. Indeed, the possibility of using electronic signatures to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of a document can make them much more useful. However, as the hon. Gentleman accepted, an electronic signature has no automatic link to the signatory in the way that a manual signature does. As he said, a handwritten signature carries some of its maker with it, and only a skilled forger can fool the handwriting expert. Certainly, if I were to sign a document in front of you, Mr. Maxton, you could be reasonably assured that you could enforce that signature in court if I was—heaven forbid—trying to cheat you.
<P>
However, an electronic signature, or one based on cryptography, has no intrinsic link to the signatory. Which individual is issued with which electronic signature is as arbitrary as our credit card or bank account number. What is important with those numbers is that the bank issues every customer with a different number and has some way of knowing who has been issued with what number. Of course, a bank is trusted to do that. An electronic signature is arbitrary in the same way and needs to be tied to someone by a trusted process carried out by a trusted third party. Therefore, electronic signatures would often need to be certified by someone other than their manufacturer and it is the reason why I am unable to accept the amendment.
<P>
I have talked of one type of electronic signature, but I am certainly not saying that it will be the only one available, let alone the only acceptable type. Electronic signatures based upon digitising the process of signing manually are already available and, as some of my hon. Friends have said, in future, electronic signatures may be linked to a property of the individual by some method such as the retina scan, although this will not necessarily mean that there is no need for certification. None of us knows how technology will develop. What I do know is that electronic signatures backed by certificates issued by certification authorities will be an important part of that future. I hope that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 57, on the face of it, seems uncontentious, although pretty detailed and lengthy. It relates to who should prove that a signature is genuine. In English law, it is generally for the party relying on the signature to prove that it is genuine. If I sue the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton for breach of contract and he denies having signed the document, I will have to prove that his signature is genuine; it is not for him to disprove it. Clause 7, which provides for the general possibility of electronic signatures, would not disturb that balance.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Guildford accurately pointed out, however, clause 8 would allow the appropriate Minister, through subsection (4)(g) and subsection (5), to lay down how it should be decided whether a person has signed a document, or how issues relating to the other matters mentioned in subsection (5) should be determined. That would certainly not force people to be bound by a forged electronic communication. But an order might specify that under certain circumstances it would be assumed that a communication was signed by the sender. That is no different from the paper contracts that underpin much electronic business and set out who will accept liability in certain circumstances. So this aspect of the power will allow the appropriate Minister to make similar provision in orders issued under the section. Clearly, the power will need to be used carefully and will be subject to clear guidance.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Minister seems to make two contradictory statements. First, she says that it is recognised that the common law rule should stand; that the onus is on the recipient to prove that the signature is made by the sender. Secondly, she says that it is all right for the Minister to introduce the new diktat that in certain circumstances the sender shall be deemed to have given his signature to the contract or whatever? Can the hon. Lady explain this contradiction?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman paraphrases me accurately. Clause 7, which relates to the generality of contracts, does not change the existing position under English law; someone relying on the signature must prove that it is genuine. Clause 8 deals with statute law; where the Government are a party to a transaction, or transactions between non-governmental parties of which the form is somewhere laid down by Act of Parliament. The clause allows the appropriate Minister to lay down how disputes should be decided. Therefore, it would be possible for a position different to the general one that I have described under Clause 7 to arise under clause 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am still confused. The title of the clause is ``Powers to modify legislation''. Bearing in mind the Minister's refusal to accept our amendment in respect of subsection (4)(d), which we said might give clause 8 very wide scope, is it not conceivable that the Minister could effectively change the common law rule in most practical instances, by the application of clause 8 and the changing of a few signatures?
<P>
So there might be a few arcane areas where the old rule still applied, but in practical terms the Minister would have moved the goalposts.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No, I do not think that that would arise because of the distinction between what clauses 7 and do, which I have clarified. If it will assist hon. Members, I am perfectly prepared to consider the matter further to see whether we can meet concerns about the over-wide use of the power that subsection (4)(g) confers. We might do that, for instance, by ensuring that that power was subject to an affirmative resolution if it were used. In the light of that assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister, but our amendment still raises valid issues. In particular, there is the matter of self-certification, which the Minister has not quite addressed. I should therefore like to press the three amendments to a Division.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</FONT>
</font>
<p><B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Clause 8 is the most important clause in the Bill after clause 7. It will allow the Government to free the pharmaceutical industry from the need to sign all its regulatory documents, and to free the defence industry from having to sign all its documents. It is a vital clause and it must clearly stand part of the Bill.
<P>
However, I ask the my hon. Friend the Minister to consider taking a braver step. Instead of requiring Ministers to use statutory instruments to say when electronic signatures can be used, she might consider building into the Bill the presumption that, by a certain date, electronic signatures will be used unless Ministers want paper to be retained. That would be brave, and there may be problems, but I ask my hon. Friend to give it some thought before Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying ``has to be used'' or ``may be used''?
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I am saying that it may be used. I suggest the presumption that, if an electronic signature is offered, it could be accepted as valid under all legislation unless Ministers say that, for the time being, a particular piece of legislation has to have a piece of paper. I ask the Minister to give the matter some thought before Report. I stress again the importance of clause 8; it will save British industry a fortune.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support the bold idea suggested by the hon. Member for South Thanet. Will the Minister respond on two points?
<P>
First, if she is not going to accept that sensible suggestion, what plans do the Government have to ensure that all Ministers properly consider the opportunities for electronic signature? How they will be held accountable for their choice? I hope that Parliament will receive detailed reports on how things are progressing. I know of the Government's grand scheme to make all Departments electronic; that will presumably form an important part of it, but it would be interesting to hear more.
<P>
Secondly, I hope that the hon. Lady can say briefly how the Government will ensure consistency of supply. I noticed the other day that Departments been offered guidance on how to make websites consistent. Anyone who uses departmental websites knows that, in their use of electronic media, the Departments have gone off at completely different tangents. A similar situation could apply here, and it would be interesting to know who in Government will ensure some technical consistency in how electronic communications are supplied and in the statutory instruments that will be needed.
<P>
I hope that we shall not see every Department reinvent the wheel, each time in a slightly different form. That would be most unhelpful and far more costly than centralised—as a Liberal Democrat, I hate that word—Government control to ensure a common way forward. We require common standards for electronic signature; we do not want every Department contracting with different security contractors. We want the parliamentary system to take a common approach to the statutory instruments that will be required to enable it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I support the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet that Ministers should seriously consider the possibility of carve out, rather than opt in, before Report stage. If that is not possible, will my hon. Friend the Minister have another look at the suggestion that I made on Second Reading, that Ministers should agree to report on progress to Parliament every three months or so, following the precedent that we had with the millennium bug preparations?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Does not the problem that the Minister faces from both sides of the Committee result from the fact that the clause assumes that Ministers will be proactive? Many hon. Members are concerned that Ministers will not be proactive.
<P>
Why does the clause not contain a specific provision that the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce or another Minister will make regular reports, either to Parliament or to the Department of Trade and Industry Committee?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I begin by reassuring my hon. Friends that the idea that we should turn clause 8 on its head and provide that electronic equivalents will be acceptable unless specifically ruled out was one of the first queries that I raised about the Bill when I took over responsibility for it. I reassure my hon. Friends that officials have been looking closely at the possibility of adopting the so called carve-out approach, rather than the carve-in approach that we have taken in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was persuaded that the difficulties of adopting that alternative approach were insuperable. It is interesting that Canada, which decided originally to adopt the approach suggested, has, on a closer look at the practicalities, now decided to adopt our approach. The difficulty arises for two reasons. First, clause 8 does not confine itself to the limited matter of written signatures and their electronic alternative as some legislation in other countries does. It deals more widely with documents being delivered by post, being sealed and so on. There are many more statutory provisions to which we must find the appropriate electronic alternative. There is a much greater danger of legal chaos arising if we take a scythe to the entire statute book and say that there should be an electronic equivalent unless an exception is provided for, without examining case by case those 40,000 references in the statute book for which the electronic equivalent would have to be devised.
<P>
The second difficulty is purely one of practicality. To provide the electronic equivalent to the paper-based transactions, Departments will sometimes have to ``re-engineer'' their business processes, and they will certainly have to have the necessary IT systems in place and working properly. As members of the Committee know, that may be easier said than done. There is no point having clause 8, which says that an electronic signature or an e-mail will be legally valid, if the Department does not have the means of receiving and handling the e-mail or the electronic signature.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I am sure that the Minister accepts as important the great variation in the enthusiasm of Departments for electronic means. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam said, the Home Office is not particularly wired up to it. Furthermore, the Lord Chancellor's Department is very suspicious of it. We are airing an area of grave concern.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am happy to say that my right hon. and hon. Friends in both those Departments are busy trying to sort out the situation, which, in part, they inherited from the previous Administration. They want to ensure that modern technology is properly available to citizens transacting business with the Home Office or the justice system. It is an important matter, which is why the Cabinet Office's central IT unit has been charged with a co-ordinating role to ensure that Departments get on with using their clause 8 powers. Before the Bill is discussed on Report, I shall publish a memorandum setting out how that will work. The Government are already reporting on a six-monthly basis, not only to Parliament, but via the Cabinet Office website, on our progress towards electronic government.
<P>
Tomorrow, I shall chair the first meeting of the
e-ministerial co-ordinating network, a network that in future will do a large part of its business through an on-line system on the Government's secure intranet dedicated to that purpose. It will be the first on-line ministerial meeting. I shall be drawing to the attention of my right hon. and hon. Friends the importance of clause 8, and the need for them to ensure that they and their officials move urgently to update their statute book using the powers under clause 8.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet rightly said, clause 8 is at the heart of the Bill. Along with clause 7, it will modernise the basis on which citizen to—Government transactions, Government-to-business transactions and business-to-business transactions can be done, so that the United Kingdom can, indeed, be the best place in the world for electronic commerce. I commend clause 8 to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Minister used the word ``urgently'' several times and I know that she will get back to us on Report, but will she answer the concern of the Alliance for Electronic Business that the work would not be done as quickly as we would hope? It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Industry would be disappointed if the deadline were set later than the end of 2000. This probably means that work must begin immediately, in anticipation of the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fine. This is the important bit:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Our member companies have a number of electronic commerce initiatives that depend upon a legal framework for electronic signatures being in place.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Unless the statutory instruments are laid quickly, those initiatives cannot be implemented, reducing the growth of electronic commerce in the UK and risking the leadership that our industry currently holds in European and global markets.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the Minister have a better deadline than 2000? If so, what month of the coming calendar year is it?
<P>
A huge regulatory burden—a stealth regulatory burden—is hidden in the clause. It does not set down a specific timetable by which each Department must list its priorities in the territorial area—for the DTI that will be the Companies Acts, for example—and there is no order of priorities that Departments have to set down and achieve by a set month or a set week. I call it a stealth regulatory burden because companies will have to look, almost weekly, to see what statutory requirements they can satisfy electronically and which they will have to satisfy in writing. They will not be sure which is which. People will have to be employed, or current employees will have to spend a portion of their working time, to comb through all the regulations and relevant laws to see what has and has not been upgraded in terms of the words ``in writing'' or ``writing''.
<P>
I therefore pose two questions. First, what is the specific date by which the 40,000 changes will be made, in the light of the comment by the Alliance for Electronic Business that it should be no later than 2000? Secondly, what about the regulatory burden on business?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall respond briefly to that. The admissibility of electronic signatures under clause 7 will come into effect soon after Royal Assent—in other words, well before the end of 2000. Removing the regulatory burden on having to transact business with Government on paper will take somewhat longer, for the reasons that I have given. We have to make sure that we check each bit of the statute book and that we put the IT systems in place. We will go as fast as we can and we are working closely with the industries on it.
<P>
On the Companies Acts, to which I referred earlier, the draft statutory instrument will be published in the new year. We will ensure that business gets the information that it needs very easily, not least on the Government website.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I do not wish to try the patience of the Committee, but I must press the Minister. Will the changes to 40,000 references to writing and signature, which need to be done by statutory instrument, be completed by end of 2000, or earlier? Can the Minister give us a date?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I have already said that I will report further on that in a memorandum before Report stage and that we will continue to report at six-monthly intervals to Parliament and the public on our progress. I cannot, for the reasons that I have already given, set a single deadline for the updating of decades, if not centuries, of statute. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 8, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in, page 9, leave out lines 27 to 29.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee long at this hour, when Opposition Members hear the gentle beckoning bubbles of gin and tonic and Labour Members the gentle gurgling of flat beer—[Hon. Members: ``Champagne.'']—or, these days, champagne. New Labour, new Beaujolais, it would appear.
<P>
Clause 9(5)(b) simply says that an order under clause 8 may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provide that any such condition or requirement is to be satisfied only where a person so specified or determined is satisfied as to specified matters''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What the hell does that mean?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not know that such language is entirely appropriate.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall try to clarify for the hon. Gentleman the reasoning behind subsection (5)(b), which he seeks to remove, and subsection (5)(a). The range of matters that may be covered by orders under clause 8 is enormous. Electronic forms of communication are likely to become the norm for subjects that at this stage we could imagine. That is why we wanted to allow Ministers maximum flexibility on the orders that they may make. Subsection (5)(a) allows Ministers to include a provision in am order under the clause allowing another specified person, such as a statutory body, to specify conditions or requirements that are to be met. That would, for example, enable the statutory body to specify that electronic communication should be made in a certain format, which seems reasonable enough.
<P>
The inclusion of subsection (5)(b) ensures that the specified person can decide whether the conditions or requirements in the clause 8 order have been met. Without subsection (5)(b), that decision could not be made by the specified person. We need to ensure that the decision on whether conditions or requirements have been met rests with the most appropriate person or persons.
<P>
The language may not be as elegant as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton would like, but the intention and effect are quite clear, and I therefore invite him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Having satisfactorily probed the Minister's views, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 9, line 40, leave out subsection (7) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) In the case of any matter which is not one of the reserved matters within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998 or in respect of which functions are, by virtue of section 63 of that Act, exercisable by the Scottish Ministers instead of by or concurrently with a Minister of the Crown, this section and section 8 shall apply to Scotland subject to the following modifications—
<P>
(a) subsections (1) and (2) of this section are omitted;
<P>
(b) any reference to the appropriate Minister is to be read as a reference to the Secretary of State;
<P>
(c) any power of the Secretary of State, by virtue of paragraph (b), to make an order under section 8 may also be exercised by the Scottish Ministers with the consent of the Secretary of State; and
<P>
(d) where the Scottish Ministers make an order under section 8—
<P>
(i) any reference to the Secretary of State (other than a reference in this subsection) shall be construed as a reference to the Scottish Ministers; and
<P>
(ii) any reference to Parliament or to a House of Parliament shall be construed as a reference to the Scottish Parliament.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment is designed solely to ensure that Scottish Ministers can properly exercise the order—making power in clause 8. It does not reflect any change in policy; it merely clarifies the way in which the policy will be effected.
<P>
The policy is that Scottish Ministers should be able to use the order—making power in clause 8 in relation to devolved issues. The exercise of the power in Scotland is complicated by the fact that, although its purpose—facilitating electronic communications and the use of encryption—is a reserved matter, the power could be used to modify an enactment that was within a wholly devolved area: for example, modifying Scots private law relating to requirements of writing, evidence and contract formation.
<P>
Because of the stated purpose of clause 8, however, it would not be possible for the Scottish Ministers to exercise the clause 8 power, even in contexts that were otherwise wholly devolved. Clause 9(7) seeks to overcome that restriction by making express, statutory provision to enable the Scottish Ministers to exercise the clause 8 power
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with the consent of the appropriate Minister''.<P>

<P>
The amendment is necessary and follows devolution to the Scottish Parliament and Executive.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
