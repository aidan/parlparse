<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000211"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> These proposals go to the heart of the
effectiveness and appropriateness of local flood risk management
strategies and whether they will receive effective overview or
scrutiny. There is provision for overview and scrutiny committees as
part of the local authority scrutiny system. Such committees are well
established in looking at local NHS decisions and the system is
effective. It would be useful for the local authority to scrutinise
risk management authorities, such as water companies, internal drainage
boards and even the Environment Agency, if the scope of local flood
strategies is comprehensive enough. The problem is that the lead local
authority for flood risk management is the local authority itself. So
there is some rather circular self-scrutiny. It seems that no one has
the role of checking the effectiveness, appropriateness or thoroughness
of local flood risk management strategies.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div><a name="10011440000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">A broader
issue raised by the National Flood Forum and others is whether the
national oversight role of the Environment Agency has enough teeth. It
is certainly not clear from the outline national strategy presented to
the Committee whether there will be a role of checking the
effectiveness and appropriateness of local flood risk management
strategies or whether attention will be paid to that. Perhaps the
Environment Agency could have a role of checking them. However, the
danger of over-centralisation in the Bill has also been highlighted by
many hon. Members, the Local Government Association and
others.</div><a name="10011440000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
solution that we suggest in the amendment and consequent proposals is
that the role could fall to the newly established regional flood and
coastal committees. They will have a local representative element and
will not be as unelected and unaccountable as the Environment Agency.
The Bill suggests that those committees will have a bit more local
knowledge and more specific knowledge of the flood issues in an area.
It therefore seems appropriate for those committees to approve local
flood risk management strategies. That would provide a check and
balance on the quality of such
strategies.</div><a name="10011440000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a crucial issue for our constituents; the practical application of
the strategies locally is something that people are most concerned
about. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury might agree that the single
biggest issue mentioned to us in the aftermath of the floods was the
application of local strategies, whether for clearing culverts,
maintaining watercourses, sorting out who was responsible for
preventing the collapse of a river bank or the obstruction of a
channel. Those are the critical issues for local people. It would seem
appropriate to have some kind of proper scrutiny of how good local
strategies
are.</div><a name="10011440000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the proposal outlined in the amendment was not used, I would welcome
the Minister&#146;s suggestions for an appropriate system of
scrutiny. I would have thought that the regional flood and coastal
committees could each look at a reasonable number of local strategies.
It would not be out of the realms of managerial possibility to do that.
They should have the right degree of expertise and local knowledge. I
have given our suggestion. I would welcome a debate on the issue of
scrutiny and will listen to the Minister&#146;s response with
interest.</div><a name="10011440000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000212"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> Good morning, Mr.
Chope. It is good to be serving under your stewardship again. I
understand the spirit in which the amendments have been made. Good
scrutiny and overview are important. The amendments, which are tabled
by the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and Radnorshire,
would require local flood-risk strategies effectively to be approved by
regional flood and coastal committees. We recognise the vital role that
such committees will need to play, not least to ensure that there is a
joined-up approach on the ground. Nevertheless, it is not appropriate
to give them the role of approving the strategies, because that would
go against two key principles in the Bill. The first principle is that
there is a clear allocation of responsibility to a particular
authority&#151;in effect, where the buck stops. The second principle
is that democratically elected local authorities should be clearly
leading at the local level.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div><a name="10011440000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
what the hon. Member for Cheltenham is saying, but we see the measure
as local democracy in action: put the accountability there and hand
over the scrutiny function. Within the local authority itself, the
overview and scrutiny committee will have a role to play, but the RFCCs
and the Environment Agency will provide peer support and
advice.</div><a name="10011440000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
note that the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee made some
recommendations as well. It suggested that the Bill
should</div><a name="10011440000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;require
decision making bodies to explain how they have taken into account any
advice from regional advisory bodies, or their reasons for rejecting
it.&#148;</div><a name="10011440000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
see the Bill as being consistent with that, not least because we fully
intend to clarify the situation through guidance. Therefore, the point
that the hon. Gentleman makes is right. We need to ensure that the
committees are fully inputting into the policy, but we want to see the
buck stopping firmly with locally elected members on those
authorities.</div>
<a name="10011440000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, we
expect the regional flood and coastal committees to have a role with
the Environment Agency in scrutinising local authority outputs under
the flood risk regulations that will implement the EU flood directive.
The outputs are preliminary flood risk assessments to identify
significant risk areas, risk and hazard maps showing the impact of
flooding in an area, and management plans. Those outputs will underlie
local authority strategies, but the role does not need to be reflected
in the
Bill.</div><a name="10011440000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the Environment Agency will help to put in place a joined-up
regional approach by addressing partnership working, which has been a
theme of much of our deliberations. Its national strategy and guidance
will put the matter clearly, showing how partnership working on the
ground will work. It will include disseminating information on best
practice at a local level for agencies and authorities working
together, and also for cross-border working. Therefore, the
accountability is there. We do not believe that the RFCCs should be
given the role of approving local flood-risk strategies; none the less,
they have a pivotal role to play.</div>
<a name="10011440000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000213"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am warming to the Minister&#146;s comments.
It is quite uncomfortable for me to be accused of being too centralist
by the Labour Government; I may well withdraw my amendments
judiciously. The Minister talks about peer support and advice from the
regional flood and coastal committees to local flood risk management
authorities, yet there is no mention of that function in the local
flood risk management section of the Bill or in clause 22 onwards,
where the regional flood risk committees are established. As far as I
can tell, nothing in the Bill puts such a situation in place, but the
Minister may correct
me.</div><a name="10011440000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000214"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right&#151;there
is nothing in the Bill in that regard, but we want to clarify the
matter through the guidance. We must get the balance right between what
we put in the Bill and what we bring through. We can make it clear that
we intend the matter to be brought forward in the guidance to the
Environment Agency, and in the guidance that accompanies the national
strategy.</div><a name="10011440000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011440000215"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Grogan</b> (Selby) (Lab): Will my hon. Friend clarify
that the amendments we are discussing are about the role that the RFCC
should have in either advising on or approving the flood risk
strategies of individual 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>local authorities, whereas later in our proceedings we will discuss
whether those committees should continue to have the function of
approving the strategy of the Environment Agency in a region? Is that
distinction
right?</div><a name="10011440000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000216"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes, my hon. Friend makes the right
distinction. These amendments are about local flood risk strategies for
which, as I think I made clear, we see RFCCs having a pivotal role, but
not in approving the
strategies.</div><a name="10011440000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
take up the point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, we can
clarify some of this through guidance but we want responsibility to be
clearly given to local elected members. They should take the decisions
and be scrutinised in doing so, get input from other authorities and
take other advice, including from the RFCCs. That is how we envisage
they will work. Rather than having over-complicated layers of
additional sign-off for strategies, we will put the buck clearly with
those individuals&#151;who are elected, as we are&#151;and say,
&#147;Get the decisions right, listen to the RFCCs and the
Environment Agency, put plans forward, make decisions and be
accountable.&#148;</div><a name="10011440000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011440000217"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): The Minister&#146;s
explanation is much to be preferred to that of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Oh!&#148;]
On this occasion.</div>
<a name="10011440000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned about one thing. Some unitary authorities are quite small
geographically. For example, the city of Southampton unitary authority
is entirely encircled by Hampshire county council. I accept that it
should have authority, but will it be expected to co-operate? In many
cases, it happens to be those people who are nearest to the boundaries
who are also nearest to the
floods.</div><a name="10011440000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000218"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That is a good point and I suspect we will
return to it in considering subsequent amendments, but it is worth
making it clear right now, in response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question, that we would expect authorities to co-operate of necessity.
Yes, there are localised flood sources such as surface water drainage
within a particular area, but co-ordination of flood risk management
across a water catchment area, from the top of the hills down to the
ingress of tidal flooding, needs to be done through co-operation. He is
absolutely right, and we shall come to duties to co-operate in
subsequent
amendments.</div><a name="10011440000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can clarify that we want accountability at a local level with local
authorities, and with the Environment Agency playing its strategic
role. That very much follows the Pitt recommendations, but it does not
mean that people should cut themselves off in silos. Of necessity,
there will have to be co-operation across boundaries because water
knows no
boundaries.</div><a name="10011440000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000219"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am persuaded that I may be putting Liberal
Democrat localist credentials at some risk with the amendment, so I am
happy to withdraw it, but there is still a legitimate concern from the
National Flood Forum and others that there may be a quality and
scrutiny deficit. I look forward to holding Conservative
Gloucestershire council to account in local Liberal Democrat
&#147;Focus&#148; leaflets. If Conservative leaflets in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>the area are to be believed, the world could come to an end if
Gloucestershire were ever to fall into Liberal Democrat
hands.</div><a name="10011440000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the local accountability function will be sufficient for whichever
political party happens to be in control of Gloucestershire&#151;or,
indeed, other authorities&#151;with this flood risk management
responsibility to hold itself to account, in effect, and that we will
not need some greater oversight role. I am reassured by what the
Minister said about the advice and support that could be given by
RFCCs, and I believe that that will happen in practice even though it
is not provided for in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011440000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000222"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The amendments go to the heart of what we have
talked about a number of times already in this Committee: the
difference between the vertical and horizontal split in
responsibilities. As I have said before, many of us took from the Pitt
report the implication that the national oversight role and the local
lead responsibility both cover all forms of flood risk, with the former
being national and strategic, looking at the best practice to address
different types of flood risk and how best to approach landscape
features and hard flood defences, and so on, but with the local
authority having an equal oversight role for conditions in its local
area.</div><a name="10011440000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Bill was published there was a slight drift back towards dividing
up different types of flood water and qualifying the overarching
responsibilities, which is dangerous for the national oversight role,
in that it implies that some kinds of flood water&#151;particularly
surface water, run-off, ground water and ordinary water courses, as set
out on page 6 of the Bill&#151;might be less of a responsibility for
the national strategy, even though those are critically important to
just as many people. Similarly, the Bill might limit the
responsibilities of local
authorities.</div><a name="10011440000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="10011440000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Flood Forum has said it is worried that there is a limiting of
responsibilities for surface water, for instance, which is critically
important. Given the approach to planning, which is often sadly taking
place regionally, it is not always clear what a local authority can do
to influence that process. In any case, in a two-tier authority it is
not the county council that is the planning authority. That is a
difficult issue to deal
with.</div><a name="10011440000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the strategy for monitoring the Environment Agency&#146;s work on
main rivers and principal flood defences be qualified by the clause,
which seems to narrow the boundaries of a local flood risk management
strategy? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>Will the water companies&#146; responsibility for maintaining sewers
be limited by the clause? At the very least, will there be a problem
when looking at particular local areas, which, for instance, bound on
main
watercourses?</div><a name="10011440000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give a couple of examples from my constituency. Little Bayshill
terrace in the centre of Cheltenham, which flooded in the floods of
2007, is bounded on two sides by the River Chelt, which is a main
river, although not a big one. Extensive flood defences were put in by
the residents&#151;sandbags, effective flood walls and flood defences
beside their houses&#151;but in the event a lot of the problem came
from ground water rising through their floorboards. In the College road
area, surface water run-off was the principal problem, but that was
exacerbated by complications from the main flood defence scheme at
Cox&#146;s meadow, which was the responsibility of the Environment
Agency. It is virtually impossible in practice for a local authority to
take responsibility for flooding locally, managing flood risk and
taking a lead responsibility for flood risk in their local area,
without looking, for example, at main rivers, principal flood defences
and the other things that other flood risk authorities seem to have
responsibility
for.</div><a name="10011440000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am worried about the narrowing of the clause. That is why we suggest
that, instead of having defined types of water&#151;it is nonsense to
try to separate them off&#151;we simply replace the three kinds of
specific floodwater with risk from any kind of
flood</div><a name="10011440000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
a defined geographical area such as a district or unitary authority
area&#148;,</div><a name="10011440000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">because
that is more in line with what most hon. Members expected from the Pitt
report and with practical common
sense.</div><a name="10011440000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011440000223"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): First, the hon.

the damage was considerable in some areas. The gardens of some houses

river.</div><a name="10011440000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
enormous job is still going on and, of course, major problems resulted
from the flooding in that
area.</div><a name="10011440000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from with the amendment,
but to remove the word &#147;groundwater&#148; worries me slightly
because if we go back to an earlier debate and consider clause 6, it
states:</div><a name="10011440000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Groundwater&#146;
means all water which is below the surface of the
ground&#148;.</div><a name="10011440000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we retain some reference to water below the surface
as well as to water on the surface for the reasons we gave in, I think,
the very first debate we had in
Committee.</div><a name="10011440000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000224"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am a little confused by what the hon. Member for
Cheltenham said. Does he mean that the responsibility should devolve
from the regional level to the lead local authority or does he mean
that it should start and end there? If he does not mean that, what is
he suggesting? I am a bit unclear about what he means. Secondly, what
is the position regarding places such as the Isle of Wight where there
is no problem&#151;no level outside the constituency or even beyond
the county council&#151;so there is no need to have anything that
belongs outside the Isle of
Wight?</div><a name="10011440000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000225"></a>Martin

briefly?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div><a name="10011440000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000226"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That was a speech rather than an intervention.
If the Minister speaks now, the hon. Gentleman will have the chance to
sum up the debate at the
end.</div><a name="10011440000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000227"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will respond to the comments made and
allow the hon. Gentleman to come back on the point that has
understandably been made. This is a matter concerning the clarity of
how we have structured the Bill. The effect of the amendments would be
to change the definition and scope of local flood risk management to
encompass all types of flooding, not just what is mentioned at the
moment, as the hon. Gentleman has said. So rather than just surface
water, ground water and ordinary watercourses and so on would be
covered. We think those types of flooding are appropriately dealt with
locally because of their overlap with issues relating to the highways,
planning and infrastructure.</div>
<a name="10011440000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would, in effect, give the lead local flood authority responsibility
for deciding the management of flood risks from main rivers and the
sea. The decision of any individual lead local authority can have a
significant effect on a neighbouring authority&#146;s area, whether
in relation to catchment or in a broader coastal area. That is not to
say in any way whatsoever that local authorities ever take a parochial
view of their responsibilities to local taxpayers and that they might
favour one scheme over another and so
on.</div><a name="10011440000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think we have got the split right, and I will explain why in relation
to Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s recommendations. When he undertook his
in-depth review of the causes of the 2007 flooding, he suggested that,
in line with our thinking in the Bill, local authorities are, indeed,
the most appropriate authorities to deal with the management of local
flood risk. That is because local authorities have the existing
responsibilities and the knowledge of highway drainage,
planning&#151;including emergency planning, as we have recently seen
in Cumbria&#151;and the management of ordinary
watercourses.</div>
<a name="10011440000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Michael
Pitt rightly identified what he called the place-shaping role of local
authorities in helping to manage flood risk in the future. The
Government accepted that recommendation, which is why the Bill has been
configured in this way. In addition, it was considered that the
Environment Agency is best placed and has that special role to provide
a strategic or linked overview of all forms of flooding on a national
scale&#151;nationally significant risks&#151;including from main
rivers and the sea. Looking at what has happened in Cumbria, and at
main flooding incidents from the Severn or the Wye, we can see that
they hit a number of local authorities, from the top of that catchment
all the way down to where it comes out in the Bristol channel, so the
EA view is appropriate, but with local authorities considering flood
risk at a local scale. Clarity in that regard is important, but that is
not to say that those bodies do not have to work together and
co-operate.</div><a name="10011440000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011440000228"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): We cannot control the
water, but we can control the structure of local authorities. Should we
not, in any reform of local authorities, take note of appropriate
flooding problems and reorganise local authorities
accordingly?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div><a name="10011440000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000229"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed, that is absolutely right. That is
why our clear intention is that neither the local lead authorities or
the EA work in isolation. The lead local authorities work alongside the
EA at catchment and coastal unit level. Partnership working along these
lines is central to the structure set out in the Bill and is supported
by the duty to co-operate in clause 13. The definition of local flood
risk as arising from the sources of flooding that have been specified
was intentional, as these sources predominantly have an impact on the
local area and are best managed on this spatial
scale.</div><a name="10011440000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee
members will note that in order to develop their local flood risk
strategy, local authorities will have to take into account&#151;this
is important&#151;interactions with other sources of flooding
including from main rivers, the sea and sewers, because if they do not
their strategy will be deficient. As Committee members can see, the
allocation of responsibility proposed by the amendment runs counter to
the clear allocation of powers between the EA and the other risk
management authorities that the Bill seeks to put in
place.</div><a name="10011440000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said clearly, to do anything other than to take account of the
potential impact of river flooding or coastal inundation, or of other
areas that the EA has primary responsibility for, would make its
strategy deficient. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011440000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000230"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Let me address some of the issues raised by the
hon. Members for Tewkesbury and for Isle of Wight. I am sympathetic to
the comments made by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, which underline
why it is so important to put ground water specifically in the earlier
clauses in the Bill, although I am not sure that we would tackle that
in this clause, because the broader issue is not to limit the
responsibilities of local authorities too
much.</div><a name="10011440000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Isle of Wight says that there are no outside influences
that would conflict with a local flood risk management strategy on the
Isle of Wight, but that is not quite so, because coastal erosion and
coastal flood risk are, by implication, under the clause, not a local
responsibility or a local flood risk, because local flood risk is
surface run-off, ground water and ordinary watercourses. So by
implication the local flood risk strategy on the Isle of Wight should
not really address coastal flood defences. I would expect the hon.
Gentleman to regard that as nonsense. In other geographical areas that
may be discrete there will also be interaction. The Minister seemed to
acknowledge that the intention behind the legislation is that local
authorities should take account of other sources of flooding and should
co-operate, and so on, but that is not what the Bill says. There is a
point at which the level of trust and faith that we are expected to
have in Ministers gets put to the test when the Bill says the precise
opposite of what they
do.</div><a name="10011440000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause
says:</div><a name="10011440000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
lead local flood authority for an area in England must develop,
maintain, apply and monitor a strategy for local flood risk
management&#148;.</div><a name="10011440000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">But
it then states that local flood risk only
means</div><a name="10011440000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;surface
runoff...groundwater, and...ordinary
watercourses&#148;.</div><a name="10011440000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is diametrically opposed to what is said in the Pitt report, which
emphasises that</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div><a name="10011440000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;local
authorities will need to be aware of all flood risk in their areas, as
surface water flooding is often an interaction between intense
rainfall, the river network, drainage systems and groundwater
levels...Local authorities already play a central role in response
and recovery activities during and after a flood. The Review believes
that local authorities&#146; roles should be enhanced to take on
responsibility for leading the coordination of surface water flood risk
management and improving knowledge of all local flood risk in their
areas.&#148;</div><a name="10011440000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
Sir Michael used the words &#147;local flood risk&#148;, he did not
mean it to be restricted just to the three categories that are in the
clause.</div><a name="10011440000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000231"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> With regard to the points the hon.
Gentleman is making, pulling together various parts of the Bill is
critical. I want to draw his attention to clause 13, which deals with
co-operation and arrangements, and which we shall discuss shortly.
Subsection (1) of that clause, in line with what I have just said,
clearly
states:</div><a name="10011440000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
relevant authority must co-operate with other relevant authorities in
the exercise of their flood and coastal erosion risk management
functions.&#148;</div><a name="10011440000174"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">He
does not have to take that from me, as the necessity and duty to
co-operate in the functions is clearly laid out in the Bill, including
across all the risks of flooding within the area. Although the local
authority has the primary responsibility for surface run-off and so on,
as rightly identified in clause 9, it has a duty to co-operate with
those others to maximise flood
prevention.</div><a name="10011440000185"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="10011440000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000232"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I hear what the Minister is saying, but
co-operation is not the same as having a strategic plan. The purpose of
clause 9 is to set out what a local flood risk management strategy is,
as requested by Sir Michael Pitt in his report and supported
by many people over the intervening months and years. The truth is that
clause 9 will limit local plans to those three kinds of flood risk.
That is not what Sir Michael Pitt asked for and is not common sense. It
would be nonsense. It would mean that, in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire
county council could get away with not addressing issues of flooding
relating to the River Chelt and the main river system or the brand new
&#163;23 million flood defence system for which the Environment
Agency has direct responsibility. It means that on the Isle of Wight
the local plan should not address coastal flood defences and that local
officers could quite happily quote the Bill and say, &#147;Sorry, but
that is really not our brief, because it is outside the definition of
local flood risk. We will of course co-operate with people on that, but
we will not cover it.&#148; Unless the Minister is prepared to
intervene to give an assurance that he will look at that wording and
perhaps return to it
later&#151;</div><a name="10011440000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000233"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The remarks I have already made on the
duty to co-operate in the Bill were clear and categorical, but of
course the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments are made in isolation from
what we have discussed previously. I have mentioned both the national
strategy, including the duty for local lead authorities to comply with
it, and the guidance that will come, but I also intervened to assist
him by clarifying the situation with regard to the Isle of Wight. The
district council there&#151;</div>

Irranca-Davies:</b> A district council&#151;not on the Isle
of Wight&#151;can deal with sea flooding with the Environment
Agency&#146;s consent. The Isle of Wight is unitary, so it is in
effect both a local flood authority and a district council for the
purposes of the provision. Therefore, it can combine those
roles.</div><a name="10011440000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000236"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Although I am grateful for that intervention, I
am not sure that it addresses even the issue on the Isle of Wight,
because as far as I can see it is still not the responsibility of the
Isle of Wight council to include coastal flood risk in its local flood
risk management plan. That seems absolutely clear from clause 9(1) and
(2). That is how I read it at the moment. I will keep talking now in
the hope that the Minister might be about to make a useful
intervention. He might like to undertake to look at that wording again
and seek clarification, because those provisions in the Bill are
certainly open to misinterpretation, if what he says is
right.</div>

that was not one of the better ones. Coastal erosion is not covered,

&#145;the&#146;, insert
&#145;revised&#146;.</div><a name="10011440000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Chope. I want to press
the Minister on something he said in response to an earlier amendment
and a clause stand part debate. We would like the opportunity to amend
the Flood Risk Regulations 2009, so will he confirm that he said that
there would be an opportunity to do so as part of the debate?</div>
<a name="10011440000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister also explain the relationship between the Flood Risk
Regulations 2009 No. 3042 and the Bill? Much of the content of the
regulations mirrors what is included in the Bill. What is the
relationship between the two and which will take precedence? Part 1 of
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>regulations sets out a number definitions, including that of risk, which
appears to be different from the one that is in the Bill. The Bill and
the regulations also vary in their definitions of flood. Parts 2, 3 and
4 of the regulations, which refer to a preliminary flood-risk
assessment, flood-hazard maps, flood-risk maps and flood-risk
management, are very similar to the Bill, but, on occasions, they are
slightly at variance with clauses 50 to 63. Part 5 of the
regulations relates to exemptions and part 6 to co-operation. That is
similar, but, on occasion, dissimilar to clauses 24 and 26. Part 7
relates to cross-border issues in Northumbria and Solway Tweed river
basin districts, which the Bill has not
covered.</div><a name="10011440000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware that profound concern has been expressed by many
who are as affected by the draft regulations as they will be by the
Bill, but they have not been given a chance to express their views.
Will he tell us whether he has opened a formal consultation period on
the flood regulations, and will he then respond to the points that I
have made? Moreover, will he confirm whether we can table amendments to
the regulations because I have always understood that we could not
amend a statutory instrument. On Tuesday, however, I clearly heard him
say that we could.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000250"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The amendment is interesting in that it
seeks to insert the word &#147;revised&#148; before the reference
to the Flood Risk Regulations 2009. To pick up on the hon.
Lady&#146;s initial point, I can confirm what I said about amending
the regulations. However, that is assuming that the intention of the
amendment is to ensure that the reference to the regulations will take
account of the fact that they may be amended from time to time. I can
give the assurance that the amendment is not necessary because sections
20 and 23 of the Interpretation Act 1978 provide that a reference in an
Act to subordinate legislation, such as the regulations, is to be taken
as a reference to that legislation, as amended. In effect, it is
possible to amend the flood risk regulations under section 2(2) of the
European Communities Act 1972. If necessary, that can be done after the
passage of the Bill, if that is what the hon. Lady wants to
do.</div><a name="10011440000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000251"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful. However, our wish would be
to amend the regulations as part of the Bill. That is why I tabled the
earlier amendment regarding the European Communities Act 1972. The
Minister is saying that he can amend the regulations, or that his
colleagues in the European Union can do so. However, we want to amend
them in the context of this Committee, as part of the Bill. That would
address the point that they have not been consulted on sufficiently and
the  fact that there is a great deal of unhappiness
with  them because the definitions are at variance with those
in the
Bill.</div><a name="10011440000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000252"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s point.
She wants the opportunity to amend the regulations during the passage
of the Bill. I do not think that that is possible. They can be amended
subsequently at any opportunity if it is considered
appropriate.</div><a name="10011440000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should explain the point we are at and what has already been done in
terms of scrutiny. I mentioned this point the other day. There was a
deadline for the transposition of the directive. We must bear it in
mind that any Government have a responsibility to minimise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>the risk of infraction for not transposing or implementing a directive.
The directive was transposed on 26 November. The use of the European
Communities Act 1972 manages the significant risk of infraction, which
would be inevitable if the directive were transposed at a later date
through the Bill. We therefore chose to proceed in this
way.</div><a name="10011440000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original directive was scrutinised by the European Scrutiny Committee.
Section 2(2) regulations are generally subject to the negative
resolution procedure. The regulations were made available for scrutiny
by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the House of Lords
Select Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments in the usual
way. As the flood risk regulations were laid at the same time as the
Bill was introduced, there were opportunities for Parliament to
consider them and to understand the links between them. The hon. Lady
is right that there are overlaps, but they have been designed to
complement each other. There was an opportunity to call for the
regulations to be debated in the usual way, but that did not
occur.</div><a name="10011440000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
approach used was appropriate because the regulations simply concern
the responsibilities for assessing and planning for risk management,
the allocation of which does not change significantly. The general
public are not affected, other than by benefiting from improved flood
risk
management.</div><a name="10011440000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
scrutiny, the main provisions of the regulations benefited from
pre-legislative scrutiny, which we took on board. They are based
closely on the provisions of clauses 50 to 63 of the draft
Bill.</div><a name="10011440000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, the regulations cannot be amended at this stage, but
they can be amended subsequently. I note that the regulations have been
prayed against in another place and that there will be a debate in the
other House later this month. We welcome that because parliamentary
scrutiny is always important. However, it is worth pointing out that,
for all the reasons I have given, the timely transposition and
implementation of the directive through the regulations were important
to minimise the risk of infraction proceedings and, more importantly,
because any delay&#151;which would be the effect of praying against
the regulations and stopping the provisions in their
tracks&#151;would cause uncertainty for the authorities affected by
the Bill, which want to get on with the work immediately. However, we
welcome scrutiny and the opportunity for
debate.</div><a name="10011440000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be the opportunity to amend the regulations subsequently, if
required. However, they complement the Bill so we hope that the hon.
Lady will explain to her noble colleagues in another place that the
debate is good, but ask them not to cause delay because we want to get
on with implementing the
measures.</div><a name="10011440000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000253"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I do not know that the Minister&#146;s
response is entirely satisfactory, but it would not be in our interests
to delay the implementation of the EU floods directive. Is it a common
procedure for a statutory instrument to be considered only in the other
place and not in this place? I understood that all statutory
instruments, as a matter of course, went through both
Houses.</div><a name="10011440000186"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

procedure could have been effected here as well, but I am not sure
whether the time for that has already gone. The other place has

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000255"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am not sure the Minister answered the point
about how long the consultation period with outside bodies would
be.</div><a name="10011440000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000256"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> As I explained, the proposal is
substantively the same as in the clauses of the original draft Bill to
which I alluded and, as such, we took comments about those on board,
because they had significant
feedback.</div><a name="10011440000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000257"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If the hon. Lady wishes to consider tabling a
new clause rather than an amendment, it might be considered. I cannot
guarantee it will be selected, but she would be able to discuss the
possible contents of the new clause. That may help
her.</div><a name="10011440000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000258"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> That is extremely helpful. On that basis, I
shall not press the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="10011440000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="10011440000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000259"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I beg to move amendment 32, in
clause 9, page 7, line 1, leave
out &#145;must be consistent with&#146; and insert &#145;must
have regard
to&#146;.</div><a name="10011440000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is straightforward, emphasising the point that we would like
the position of local authorities, internal drainage boards and local
landowners to be strengthened, so that local expertise will have the
final say on local flood risk management strategies. As the Minister is
aware, a charge was made against the Government that many aspects of
the Bill, particularly the earlier clause 7, are centralising in
nature. The amendment is trying to tease out of the Minister that the
Government will have regard to the local
aspects.</div><a name="10011440000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue appropriate to consider now involves catchment management areas.
One proposal that insurance companies in particular were concerned
about was how activities required by flood risk management strategies
would be funded. I wanted to press the Minister on that point. Will he
clarify the relationship between the local flood risk management
strategies and the national flood risk management strategy? Later we
shall consider the possibility of appealing, but the amendment presses
the Minister on what the relationship between the local and national
strategies would
be.</div><a name="10011440000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000260"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I welcome the probing and questioning
nature of the amendment. In effect, in place of the requirement that
local flood risk strategies be consistent with the national strategy,
the amendment would have a slightly weaker requirement for the local
strategies to &#147;have regard to&#148; the national
strategy.</div><a name="10011440000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are firmly committed to ensuring that local authorities have
considerable discretion with their flood management strategies.
However, we do not consider the amendment to be necessary or
appropriate for two reasons. First, on the whole, as we discussed, the
national strategy is intended to set out broad approaches and is not
overly prescriptive about flood management in any one area. That is
where the local discretion, knowledge and implementation come in. An
outline has already been given to the Committee, which I hope makes
that clear. Local authorities also have safeguards in that the national
strategy will be subject to consultation  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>and available for scrutiny, including by the EFRA Committee, before it
is approved by Ministers, who will be able to ensure that the strategy
is not too
prescriptive.</div><a name="10011440000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
it is vital that local strategies are consistent with the national
strategy. One example is the importance of the local authority
following the national strategy to avoid detrimental effects on other
areas with the same river catchment or further along the coast.
Although a decision to build, for example, certain defences may make
absolute sense at local level, in the wider picture it might not. It is
important, therefore, that local strategies are consistent with the
overall framework. Another example is in respect of consistency in risk
assessments and appraisals, which is essential to ensure that funding
is distributed systematically and equitably across the
country.</div>
<a name="10011440000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I conclude by
emphasising that the hon. Lady, members of the Committee, local
authorities and others will have ample opportunity to ensure that the
national strategy reflects local needs. We encourage everyone to
respond to that consultation, as their input will be vital. On that
basis, I ask the hon. Lady to consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="10011440000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000261"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> There is a difficult balance to be struck and I
am sympathetic to what I guess is the sense of the amendment&#151;to
allow local authorities a little more freedom. My continuing theme in
Committee is that we need effective scrutiny. An Environment Agency
power to investigate is not in the Bill, although we will discuss that
later. If we do not have the clear instruction under our amendment 94
that the local authority flood strategy should cover all forms of
flooding, which is still a matter of debate, and without the clear
signal that the national flood and coastal risk management strategy
should cover all forms of flooding, it may turn out that the local and
national strategies are covering different things. Consistency should
not be difficult to achieve and &#147;regard&#148; would not even
be
necessary.</div><a name="10011440000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us be optimistic. The thrust of what the Minister keeps telling us to
take on faith is that the national strategy will provide clear
leadership and advice on all forms of flooding, including those covered
by local flood risk management strategies. In that situation I cannot
understand why we would not want local strategies to be consistent with
it. That seems a bit basic to me.</div>
<a name="10011440000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am all for
localism. I am a great champion of localism in planning, in local
economics and local taxation. I withdrew my earlier amendment at the
risk of being seen to be too centralising even at a regional level, but
it does not seem too much to ask that a local strategy designed to
address, or&#151;as we were told a few minutes ago&#151;at least
have regard to all forms of flooding in the local area, even those that
are the responsibility of water companies or the Environment Agency,
must be consistent with the national strategy for those forms of
flooding. As I said, I am sympathetic to allowing local authorities a
bit more freedom. I merely think the proposal goes a bit too
far.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000265"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> To take the amendments in order, amendment 12
adds to the list of bodies that the lead local flood authority must
consult in connection with its local flood risk management strategy. We
believe that water companies have a key role to play.
Amendment 12 is a precursor to our subsequent amendment in
which we envisage a greater role for water companies with regard to
sustainable drainage
systems.</div><a name="10011440000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that it is the intention of the Minister and the Department
completely to end automatic connections, so it would make sense to
include water companies in the consultation on the local management
strategy. I would like to hear from the Minister whether they were
deliberately omitted, or whether it is meant to be implicit in the
clause that they would be included in any consultation, as well as the
relevant storage undertakers if they are different from the water
companies. It makes sense to extend the brief to
them.</div><a name="10011440000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also want landowners to be included&#151;a constant theme that we
have had and will have throughout the Bill. We discussed saturation and
waterlogging, and their impact on landowners who lose their crops and
are unable to obtain compensation for those losses. A flood risk
management strategy will have huge implications for landowners and
farmers, whether owners or tenants, and we believe that whoever farms
the land or their bodies representing should be
included.</div><a name="10011440000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, there is a slight difficulty in limiting inclusion to bodies
representing, because, as members of the Committee will know, many
farmers are so independent that they do not wish to be part of a body.
If we could possibly encompass individual farmers who wish to maintain
their independence and not be part of a body, that would be extremely
helpful. We have extended the inclusions to clauses 9 and 10, and will
be considering them and, if necessary, pressing them to a vote on
clause 10 as
well.</div><a name="10011440000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be interesting to hear from the Minister why in clause 9(6),
which is otherwise an all-encompassing subsection, water companies,
sewerage undertakers and farmers and landowners were excluded. I hope
that if their inclusion is not implicit, he will look favourably on the
amendments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div><a name="10011440000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000266"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I want briefly to consider Conservative
amendments 12 and 23 before moving on to amendment 116,
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. I
apologise that he is not here today. I am afraid that he has been taken
ill, which explains his absence. I shall endeavour to stand in his
shoes, which will be
difficult.</div><a name="10011440000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
12 and 23 address an important issue by making specific some of the
consultation that has to be carried out by lead local authorities. If
local strategies really cover all forms of flooding and their impact
will not be limited just to ground water, surface water and so on,
flooding from sewerage and drainage, and the fixtures and
infrastructure that are the responsibility of water companies will
clearly require
consultation.</div><a name="10011440000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I have a slight question for the Conservative Front Bench. As water
companies are defined as risk-management authorities in clause 6, I
believe that it is compulsory for them to be consulted anyway. The only
possibility is that the clause refers to the local water company only,
but that the amendment, in referring to water companies, implies more
than one. That would rarely be the case because water companies are
entirely geographic at present, Cave review notwithstanding, so I
cannot think why the authority would ever want to consult any water
company other than its local
one.</div><a name="10011440000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
counter-question to the Minister is whether there is any possibility
that one could fulfil the terms of the Bill without consulting the
local water company about the local flood risk management strategy. If
so, I would happily support the amendment in order to put the matter
absolutely beyond
doubt.</div><a name="10011440000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to support amendment 23 because it  is important that
we fill the possible loophole that  sewerage undertakers might
not be risk management authorities. The hon. Member for Vale of York
has already dealt with amendment 23 to some extent. I support it and
take the hon. Lady&#146;s point that farmers are not necessarily
members of bodies and that perhaps the provision might provide them
with an incentive to join some. I do not represent a rural
constituency, but my impression of Gloucestershire is that there is no
shortage of active and vocal bodies representing farmers and
landowners. I doubt whether there would be difficulty identifying
bodies that could offer an opinion. Obviously, I am in support of
amendment 116 and matching amendment
117.</div><a name="10011440000187"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10011440000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000267"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Farmers and landowners could join the
National Farmers Union, the Farmers Union of Wales or the Country Land
and Business Association. They could join the GMB, Unison or Unite. Who
knows? As the Committee can imagine, I am firmly in favour of people
coming together in federations to represent their interests. I almost
did not rise to speak because the hon. Member for Cheltenham rightly
made the connection with clause 6, but I shall clarify a few
matters.</div><a name="10011440000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would add water companies, relevant sewerage undertakers and
bodies that represent landowners and occupiers to the list of those
bodies under clauses 9 and 10 that lead local flood authorities must
consult about the risk management strategy. As the hon. Gentleman has
identified, the list currently includes risk management 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>authorities that might be affected by the strategy and water companies
in clause 6(11), thereby encompassing water and sewerage undertakers in
connection with chapter 1, part 2 of the Water Industry Act 1991. The
provision is written explicitly for that purpose. A licence under
chapter 1A of part 2 of the Act includes not only water companies, but
sewerage undertakers. They are already included within the definition
of risk management authorities under clause 6(13), so relevant water
and sewerage companies have to be consulted in any event. Amendments
12, 23 and 24 are therefore not necessary. Such matters are explicit in
the
Bill.</div><a name="10011440000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sympathetic to the issue about landowners. If they are doing their
job properly, local authorities in rural areas already engage as a
matter of course with representative bodies of landowners on a wide
range of issues&#151;the action suggested by amendments 116 and 117.
Such bodies also have the opportunity to respond to the public
consultation provided by the
clause.</div><a name="10011440000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State is likely to issue generic guidance to all local
authorities in England about how they should work in partnership with
other authorities to develop and implement the strategy. That guidance
can include a reference to the importance of consulting land managers
such as farmers. Standing here as the Minister, I think that that is
completely
logical.</div><a name="10011440000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Environment Agency can also provide guidance under its powers in clause
7, which local authorities will be obliged to follow. The Secretary of
State can provide guidance to the Environment Agency, too. I have great
sympathy with what the hon. Member for Vale of York wants to do, which
is to make sure that landowners and their organisations are part and
parcel of any consultation on the issues that will directly affect
them, but that does not need to be stipulated in the Bill because there
are two or three other ways in which we can deal with the matter. As I
am firmly saying, such an outcome makes absolute
sense.</div><a name="10011440000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000268"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> The Minister said that, if the local
authorities are doing their jobs properly, they will be in touch with
landowners. However, my experience of the flooding in 2007 was that
such discussions did not always take place. Many riparian owners were
not necessarily aware of their obligations and certainly not forced to
carry them out with regard to waterways. I am sure that the law as it
stands is not working so I am persuaded that the amendments tabled by
my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York might draw attention to the
problem and actually
help.</div><a name="10011440000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000269"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is
saying, but the law is right, and the duties are clear. We have local
scrutiny and accountability. Of course, the Secretary of State can also
issue directives to the Environment Agency, so that it can give
guidance. In respect of this particular aspect, through the Bill, as I
said, we can issue guidance that links to the strategy. So we are able
to make what the local authorities should be doing clear.</div>
<a name="10011440000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, it is for those involved in local scrutiny and for us as
parliamentarians to hold our local authorities to account and ensure
that they are consulting properly. If the local authority in my area
failed to consult with local landowners on the development of a
strategy, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>would certainly be holding them publicly to account and saying,
&#147;What the hell are you playing at?&#148; I understand the
spirit in which the hon. Lady has tabled the amendment, but there are
provisions in the Bill to deal with that. In terms of the sewerage and
water companies, those provisions are explicit within the Bill as
drafted.</div><a name="10011440000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000270"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Now that the Minister has explained the matter,
I understand the position with water companies and sewerage undertakers
much more clearly. In expressing my wish not to press my amendments
further, I would also like to say that, regarding landowners, although
the Minister is wedded to federation, I believe that one who stands
alone can also be strong. I hope he will have regard to the spirit of
the amendments dealing with the role of landowners in that regard. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011440000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000271"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I beg to move amendment 29, in clause 9,
page 7, line 16, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(10) The Minister
shall as soon as possible instigate, publish and have regard to a
review undertaken by a panel of independent persons pertaining to the
costs which will be incurred by local authorities in implementing the
provisions of this Clause before the Clause is
commenced.&#146;.</div><a name="10011440000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000272"></a>The

amendment 113, in
clause 9, page 7, line 16, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(10) The Secretary
of State shall as soon as possible instigate, publish and have regard
to a review undertaken by a panel of independent persons, including
representatives from local authorities, universities, professional
institutions and other bodies as the Secretary of State deems
appropriate, pertaining to the training that will be required for the
lead local flood authorities to undertake the functions conferred under
this section before this section is
commenced.&#146;.</div><a name="10011440000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000273"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Clause 9 relates to the proposals we have
discussed in considering other chapters, and the huge responsibilities
and implications for local authorities. Notwithstanding what I am going
to say about the amendment, I shall make some general points on
clause 9 stand part. We believe it would be appropriate for
the Minister to set up a review, the details of which should be
published, so that it is open to the public domain. The review should
be undertaken by a panel of independent persons and should pertain to
the costs that are incurred by local authorities in implementing the
provisions.</div><a name="10011440000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
Michael Pitt was clear about what resources will be required to
implement the measures that form those parts of the Bill on which all
are united. What is not clear&#151;there will be other opportunities
to discuss this&#151;is where those resources will come from. We
believe it is appropriate for the review to be independently
undertaken. I am mindful of the fact that the Conservatives tend to
enjoy a dominant position and have control of most of the councils.
That is a cause for great celebration, but it brings with it enormous
responsibilities. We do not want to have any questions raised about
councils not having the resources available.</div>
<a name="10011440000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I part
company with the hon. Member for Cheltenham on his amendment 113,
because it also mentions training. If the Liberal Democrats had
introduced an amendment that related exclusively to training, it would
have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>worthy of consideration in its own right. Through amendment 29, we want
to draw attention to the fact that the Bill has enormous resource
implications. It is not clear from where the resources for local
authorities will come.</div>
<a name="10011440000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in the
middle of a winter weather crisis. In my own county, the stocks of grit
are about to run out now, and the Government are intervening to say
when we can or cannot grit. Clearly, these are unprecedented weather
conditions, the like of which we have not seen for 20 or 30 years. Such
conditions were a regular occurrence 20 or 30 years ago, but I never
missed a day of school, and my father, who was a country GP, never
missed a visit to a patient because of the weather. Therefore, I hope
that that is not something to which we will have to become accustomed.
With those remarks, I hope that the Minister will look favourably on
the
amendment.</div><a name="10011440000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011440000274"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b><b class="B">:</b> I am a little surprised by the hon.
Lady&#146;s unwillingness to support amendment 113, since it was
drafted for us, I must confess, by the Local Government Association,
which, as she has pointed out, is heavily influenced by Conservative
Members. I suspect that it will be a little upset that she does not
support
it.</div><a name="10011440000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
amendments raise an important issue, which is why I am happy to support
both, of the real burden of responsibility being placed on local
authorities by the Bill. The Minister said bravely on Second Reading
that all additional responsibilities would be fully funded. We did not
have the chance to explore that in great detail at the time, but now is
his moment to explain exactly how that will work.</div>
<a name="10011440000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
general concern about the burden being put on local authorities. I have
a specific example from my constituency. Cheltenham borough council has
recently been successful in winning around &#163;700,000 of flood
defence funding for work that straddles the boundary between my
constituency and that of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury. In the Warden
Hill area there will be extensive flood defences, and that is a welcome
initiative. However, it took a huge amount of work by members of staff
at Cheltenham borough council&#151;all credit to Geoff Beer and his
team for pursuing it&#151;which comes at a cost.</div>
<a name="10011440000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
impact assessment, which I have tried to read, implies that flood
defence has various economic benefits that will off-set the cost and
that other responsibilities are being passed elsewhere, I cannot see
how any of those benefits, ultimately, will pay the salaries of the
people who will have to do the work on initiatives such as the Warden
Hill flood relief scheme and meet the wider responsibilities involved
in drawing up the flood risk management strategy when the Bill comes
into force.</div>
<a name="10011440000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to various provisions in the Bill, a nagging series of concerns has
been raised that some of that stuff might not work in practice if the
resources are not in place. If the resources are not available to allow
the Environment Agency to comprehensively address all forms of
flooding, including the ones that must be picked up in local flood risk
management strategies, if there is insufficient scrutiny to ensure that
we have local flood strategies of adequate quality, if local
authorities above all do not have the resources to carry out the
functions expected of them, and if that tangle of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>responsibilities is not sorted out, we may find, for all the time we
have spent in Committee, that we have not moved a great deal further
forward. I share the LGA&#146;s alarm about how that will work in
practice and, therefore, am happy to support amendment
29.</div><a name="10011440000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
113 seeks to address the obvious skills shortage. On that point, the
LGA has
stated:</div><a name="10011440000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is clear from speaking to our membership that many local authorities
are worried that they have severe skills and capacity shortages which
could affect their ability to deliver the functions of the lead role
effectively.&#148;</div><a name="10011440000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
concern has been raised by several different sources, including water
companies, which have identified what they see as a lack of skills in
water management in local authorities since the era of privatisation,
and local ecologists and hydrologists, who have said that reorganised
learning and skills councils are now neglecting such skills. There
seems to be a potential gap and a lack of people with the skills to do
those jobs available to local authorities. I think that that is a
serious issue to be addressed and look forward to some strong
reassurances from the Minister on the
amendments.</div><a name="10011440000159"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000275"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> There is a real problem here, but I come to a
different conclusion. It is fair to say, and my hon. neighbours will
confirm the point, that Gloucestershire, following the floods of 2007,
has been one of the pathfinder areas. Significant money has been
invested in that area to look at schemes that it may be necessary to
work up: not always hard technology schemes, but ones that would be
needed if we were to re-experience the terrible floods that we were
afflicted by in 2007. However, that does not take away from what I said
on Tuesday, about some of the more everyday floods that affect a number
of my
constituents.</div><a name="10011440000188"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="10011440000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is fair to say that, having raised expectations in looking at some of
the mapping and some of the planning that has come on the back of that,
people cannot then be told that it is unaffordable. I am keen that we
should look at cost-benefit analysis, which I have always adhered to in
terms of coastal flooding, given that my constituency abuts much of the
River Severn. I have always argued that it is pointless to keep
spending money on hard technology schemes that mean that other areas
will bear the consequences of those problems. He is not here, so I can
say that my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr.
Dhanda) knows that I spend all my time trying to argue against some of
the schemes that might come into Gloucester, if they mean that the
problem is just pushed downstream, not just to my constituency but
further
south.</div><a name="10011440000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right to recognise that, if local government is given the
responsibility, we should fund it. We have to be honest and open. If we
are not going fund it, we have to tell people, because that would be
the worst of all worlds. I do not want a panoply of independent bodies
doing that. I trust local government&#151;if we put the right people
in; I will mention skills in a minute&#151;to take responsibility for
that, to fund it and to carry out the work. I hope that central
Government do not believe that local government can do it itself. The
basis underwriting the Bill is that central Government are putting
their hand in their pocket. Once that happens, it is up to local
government to exercise its means to carry through the work or to make
it clear why it is not doing so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div><a name="10011440000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">On one hand,
if we release those expectations, we have to deliver, but on the other
hand we have to recognise that that is the responsibility of local
government. Of course, local government must confer, consult and get
the best brains to enable that to happen, but it must be the
responsible body. That is why I am uneasy with both amendments,
because, again, they seem to pass off the responsibility for doing it
to the great and the good, whereas I would much prefer local government
to be the responsible
agency.</div><a name="10011440000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
skills, I tabled new clause 26, following discussions with Unison,
which has a vested interest in this matter because its members, in the
main, will be taking on and taking forward the flood responsibilities.
There have been extensive discussions with the Minister. I want to
reserve my remarks until we discuss that new clause, although it looks
as though that may be the last thing we do, so I have some time to
wait. It is important that we recognise that there is a dearth of
skills in this area. I have talked to water engineers who seem to be
the same age as me: the professional people with the relevant skills
are ageing. We must consider how to bring people into the industry and
how to trust them to come forward with the type of schemes that we
want, and ensure that they have the means to do
that.</div><a name="10011440000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will say no more at this stage, but I hope that the Minister will have
a lot to say about that now, and perhaps in more detail later, because
we can have the money and the will, but if we do not have the people to
do the work it is all somewhat
hypothetical.</div><a name="10011440000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000276"></a>Mr.
Grogan:</b> Just as I have been inspired by my hon. Friend the
Member for Stroud on many occasions, he has inspired me on this
occasion to say a few words. Just as I am enjoying every minute of the
Bill and serving on the Committee, a few years ago I enjoyed serving on
the Licensing Bill, when similar concerns were raised about the costs
of liquor licensing for local authorities. In retrospect, some of those
concerns were proved right, but some were exaggerated. It is only with
the passage of time that one can make the account.</div>
<a name="10011440000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am worried
that if we set up an independent review of the costs involved, we will
park the issue. Central Government and local government will stand by
their positions and make representations and so on. I want the Bill to
be implemented from day one&#151;as soon as we pass it, which should
be in a few weeks. I know from my contacts in the Local Government
Association that there are already ad hoc discussions going on with the
Department. Clearly, cost is an issue, as are resources. It is not
until officers of local authorities get down to implementing the Bill
that we will be able to say what the balance will be. One suggestion
from local councillors is for the Department to commit to having
continual discussions with the Local Government Association&#151;I
think that they are ad hoc at the moment&#151;to look at the Bill
month by month and see how it is being implemented. That might be a
more practical way of going forward rather than setting up a review
that will report in months, or perhaps at the end of the year and into
next year. Local authorities, in partnership with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>central Government, must be able to get on with implementing the Bill. I
hope that we can formalise the matter in some
way.</div><a name="10011440000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011440000277"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I, too,
have been inspired by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud. We heard a
lot of concern in the evidence sessions last week. My hon. Friend
outlined perhaps a way forward. That might ease some of the anxiety
coming from the Local Government Association. That approach is to put
the ad hoc discussions on a more formal footing, so there is a formal
system, with which the LGA can actively engage, not only for monitoring
costs, but for overseeing a scheme to develop training&#151;that
would take on board the Liberal Democrats&#146;
amendment&#151;because we know that there is a need to extend
training opportunities in this area.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011440000278"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Given the number of hon. Members who have
spoken on the matter, it is clear that we have an issue to deal with.
We know that it has been an issue in the ongoing discussions on the
draft Bill. Even today, it continues to be an issue, which is not
surprising. In my previous role in the Wales Office, any allocation of
funding or transfer of consequential funding from England to Wales was
always a matter of great debate. The issue would always be, &#147;Was
there enough and does it cover every eventuality?&#148;</div>
<a name="10011440000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I applaud the
LGA for making the representations as strongly as it has, but let me
restate the position for the purposes of the Committee. If the hon.
Member for Cheltenham wants to hold me to what I said before, I can
confirm that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is
committed fully to fund net new burdens on local authorities, to keep
the cost and assumptions under review and to address any shortfalls
that may arise. There is a temptation in this debate to go through
every aspect of the funding, but I would be here for hours. I am
currently having those discussions with the LGA.</div>
<a name="10011440000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In broad
terms, our assessment of the new burdens is based on the upper end of
cost estimates, and the conservative end of savings
assumptions&#151;I made that clear in the evidence sessions as well.
That will provide the added confidence that the burdens will be fully
funded, but we will keep the costs and assumptions under review. We
will work with the LGA, and we will address any shortfalls that
arise.</div><a name="10011440000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree, without any reservation, about the need to ensure that the local
authorities have the capacity and funding to undertake the role, but
requiring a review to happen before commencement will be unduly
bureaucratic and, even worse, it could delay the management of flood
risk, which affects people, properties and businesses. It is in the
Government&#146;s interests to ensure that lead local authorities
have the funding that they
need&#151;</div><a name="10011440000189"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
