Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> I beg to
move,</div><a name="10012016000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">That
the programme order agreed by the Committee this morning be amended, to
add the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy to the list of

afternoon.</div><a name="10012016000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
light of what Mr. Gibb asked this morning, we have agreed to
amend the programme motion to allow a change of witness on Thursday
afternoon. It is my intention to run the Committee in as conciliatory
and reasonable a way as possible. It is a reasonable request, so we

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000374"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I welcome our two witnesses. Kindly introduce
yourselves, and perhaps you would comment briefly on the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10012016000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Lamb:</b></i> I am Brian Lamb, chair of the Special
Educational Consortium. I also chair the Lamb inquiry into parental
confidence in special educational needs. Although the Committee will
obviously want to go into some detail, both the SEC and I, in my role
as chairman of the inquiry, welcome the Bill.</div>
<a name="10012016000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
particularly heartening from the inquiry&#146;s point of view is that
the Bill legislates in two key areas in which we were keen to see the
Government take action. The first is the right of appeal against a
local authority&#146;s determination of a statement. Currently, when
the local authority&#146;s statement is reviewed, if the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>parent is not happy with something in it or wants to make amendments to
it, they cannot. The Bill will change that. Secondly, the Bill will
ensure that Ofsted does inspections specifically for the content of
special educational needs provision within schools, whereas that was
not part of the 2005 Act. On those two points, we particularly welcome
the Bill.</div>
<a name="10012016000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">More broadly,
we are interested in the concept of parent guarantees and how that
might interface with the SEN framework. We have questions that we would
like to discuss about how home agreements will work, especially in
relation to behaviour. We also have some concerns about home education,
but we broadly welcome the
Bill.</div><a name="10012016000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> Good afternoon. I suppose that I am one of the
two main people behind the idea of the 1993 reforms, which were
presented by Lord Campbell of Alloway and me on behalf of a large group
of education charities, producing the current system and reforming the
1981 Act. As you have probably read, I have a long association with the
field. I myself have a learning difficulty, as do all my children to
one degree or another. Some have statements, some do not. I can claim
that my eldest daughter is one of the few dyslexic educational
psychologists in the field. I practise in the field and am still a
trustee or governor of a number of charities.</div>
<a name="10012016000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, equally,
think that the Bill is a good idea. It could be far more extensive, but
reality must be considered. The proposals are good, but they have
substantial defects. They could result in a fiat for litigation, so I
would like to address some sensible suggestions&#151;I hope that they
are sensible; that is your decision, not mine&#151;as to how they
could be improved and tightened. The proposals were long needed. A
number of reforms are probably just as needed, but they are not capable
of being put through in a Bill such as this&#151;one must be
sensible. However, the proposals ought to work sensibly and
effectively, and I would like to talk about
that.</div><a name="10012016000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000375"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank
you.</div><a name="10012016000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5252</b><a name="10012016000376"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): The proposals
in the Bill are quite modest and cover just two clauses. They have
generally been met with a wide welcome, but given Brian Lamb&#146;s
very worthwhile study in your inquiry, and that we are limiting the
proposals in the Bill to seeing how well schools take account of
special educational needs and statements, are your comments about what
is not here, Mr. Friel, rather way down the line? What may
be required is better attention to how we provide statements of special
educational needs, how appropriate they are and how well they are
monitored by the parents and councils of the children involved. Will
the proposals, in your view, stand alone in bringing reasonable
improvement, or are they only scratching the surface? What specific
things could be added, notwithstanding your comments about how that
might take a Bill all on its own, Mr. Friel? What could
enhance the proposals we are considering in the
Bill?</div><a name="10012016000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> Well, I take the view that they are providing
much needed, additional effective methodology in the current
system&#151;without looking at the issues you have just
addressed&#151;namely: how local authorities monitor the
effectiveness of statements, whether statements are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>themselves appropriately subject to a decision-making process that is
fair and proper and whether the system itself needs a considerable
review. That is something Mr. Lamb looked at in his inquiry.
It has been looked at by the parliamentary Education Committee in much
more detail&#151;taking evidence from a much wider perspective, I
have to say&#151;and by Sir Robert Balchin. Both those conclusions
were in favour of greater change, but Mr. Lamb not so,
although he made a number of significant recommendations, many of which
have not been adopted. For the purposes of the Bill, one needs to say
that the fact that there are only two major statutory proposals does
not mean that the statutory reforms proposed in the Bill should not be
more
extensive.</div><a name="10012016000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
have talked about statements. I remind the Committee about the majority
of children with special needs&#151;there is great debate over the
percentage, but there are far more of them than the 2 per cent.
identified in the code of practice&#151;and I particularly agree with
Mr. Lamb, who produced slight, written bullet points on the
subject, that the home-school agreement provisions should include
reference to special educational needs and provision, and that the
omission of such a reference is a great defect in the system. However,
if you are going to do that, you need to think in my view&#151;purely
personal&#151;about the small Bill proposed in Mr.
Lamb&#146;s inquiry. That is a separate Bill, which includes
reconsideration of the exclusion of young persons with special
educational needs if they are about to be
excluded.</div><a name="10012016000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that section 317 of the current legislation, which is
unamended, requires the identification by the local authority of the
governing body of a school. After identification, there is a
&#147;let&#146;s hope we do something&#148; provision and then a
complete gap. If we are going to provide that we review the situation
on exclusion, my view is that the additional special needs Bill creates
one statutory provision that is out of step with the rest, and does not
link with identification, assessment and provision. There is a large
gap in the legislation dealing with those without a statement, which is
precisely on the issue of identification, assessment and provision.
While I welcome Mr. Lamb&#146;s proposal, because far too
many children with special needs are being excluded, we need to stop
getting to that point. Therefore, I suggest that the home-school
agreement provisions should require, under, I think, section 4, a
parental home-school agreement. I forget what it is called under
statute, but we want the provision to refer to the school&#146;s
intention to identify and deliver provision for a child with special
needs. In addition, after it has provided for the identification,
section 317 would need an amendment to review the reasonable
adjustments under the proposals based on Mr. Lamb&#146;s
inquiry and the making of provision for those with special needs. There
is a lamentable gap in the legislation in that area for those who do
not have a statement. There may be room for covering some of the
defects by looking at those
provisions.</div><a name="10012016000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000377"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Would Mr. Lamb like to say something
on his own
account?</div><a name="10012016000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Lamb:</b></i> Obviously, I could have recommended more
legislation. I thought that the key thing we needed to address,
whatever else happens to the system, was looking at the whole
statementing process. We have a lot of consensus about that, but what I
recommended. and what has been accepted, is that we look much more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>at how statements are actually written and produced, and much more at
specifying what outcomes we are trying to intend in statements rather
than, as at the moment, the inputs that go into them. In my view and
that of the inquiry, there has been too much argument over the amount
of learning support assistance time, for example, which has almost
become the currency of statements, rather than looking at the outcomes
we were trying to achieve for the child, and what provision therefore
needed to be put in place to achieve those
outcomes.</div><a name="10012016000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seemed to me that if we could get much better focus on how statements
were written and their specificity, it would go a long way to
addressing some of people&#146;s concerns about what parents do not
get from statements. Having acknowledged that, I also recommended
evaluation, which there will be, of local authorities that have put
assessment at arm&#146;s length from their provision of services.
During the inquiry, we identified a number of authorities that to
different extents have started to separate assessment from
provision.</div>
<a name="10012016000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
accusation has always been that some authorities actually skew or
fetter the statement in some way to match it to the available
provision. We found only anecdotal evidence of that, but it is very
difficult to get at because who would admit it if they were doing it?
We found what we called a settled culture of sometimes assessing
against what they knew the local authority already provided. There was
not enough evidence to legislate for some overturning of the framework
at that point, but we were very interested and recommended evaluating
whether splitting the two could actually lead to greater improvement.
Again, there is activity on that and if the evidence actually supported
it, there is certainly a lot of consensus that we should move more in
that direction, but until we have the evidence, it needs to  be
tested.</div><a name="10012016000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
Mr. Friel alluded to the other legislation that is going
through. The Government have accepted our recommendations that through
the Equality Bill we will move the exemption on auxiliary aids. That is
fundamentally significant in bringing together the SEN framework with
the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 framework, as was, and filling a
very big gap in the area that Mr. Friel was talking about,
which is auxiliary aids and early intervention in
schools.</div><a name="10012016000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
other key point, which was drummed home to us again and again in the
inquiry, is that parents do not want to avail themselves of the
framework unless they have to. They want as much provision delivered
as  early on in the process as possible, so that less and
less  they have to go up the system looking for the support
they
need.</div><a name="10012016000041"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000378"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> On the basis of the need to assess outcomes
rather than just processes, do you think that as the clauses are
framed, we could give Ofsted greater responsibilities and requirements,
but that it could still be inspecting the wrong things
effectively?</div><a name="10012016000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Lamb:</b></i> I hope not. We have been very involved with
Ofsted all the way through the process and, indeed, earlier on in the
inquiry we had a number of conversations about the new framework that
it introduced during the summer. A lot of that was the result of
conversations between Ofsted and the inquiry. A key point for us was to
achieve consensus with Ofsted that although the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>achievement and outcomes of a whole number of groups of disadvantaged
pupils are among the areas that it has to look at as part of the new
framework, SEN is key within that. The way in which Ofsted now
understands the framework means that it will be looking at outcomes in
its overall assessment of achievement in schools. Until now, we have
often not been able to have a good enough definition of what that looks
like, because we have been looking far too much at inputs across the
whole system, rather than at outcomes&#151;I am using that term more
broadly here. Obviously we want outcomes to go up in terms of the
standard measures for GCSEs and in terms of reaching level 4 by age 11.
I would absolutely want to focus on that, but for children with SEN, as
we well know, we often want to see a wider range of outcomes and we
want Ofsted to focus on how the school is delivering. We know that
children with SEN are now 20 per cent. of the school population, so
every teacher in every school has to be good in relation to
SEN.</div>
<a name="10012016000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result
of Ofsted having that additional responsibility and focus, I hope that
it will drive and change the culture in schools. The issue is not so
much the measures themselves; to use the now trendy jargon of nudges
and signals in the system, the inquiry saw the measures on Ofsted as
being very much about providing a big nudge to the system in terms of
what heads and school leaderships actually focus on. I have been very
encouraged to see how much school heads are coming back to the
voluntary sector and asking, &#147;What is good practice? What do we
need to do to become a good school on this
issue?&#148;</div>
<a name="10012016000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><a name="10012016000379"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Ann Cryer</b> (Keighley) (Lab): Over the past 30 years, many
parents have come to me about all sorts of disagreements. They may not
have got a statement or the statement may have been accurate; in one
case, the parents felt that there was nothing wrong with their child
and that she should not have been statemented. I have therefore worked
a great deal on such cases. Will anything in the Bill change things so
that it will be up to the MP to take such cases up, as I have in the
past? Other MPs may not have the time or initiative to do what I have
done, and that worries me. If it falls to  the MP to deal with
the problem, what will happen if the MP will not do that? Will anything
in the Bill protect people from the problems that I have had to sort
out for my constituents?</div>
<a name="10012016000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> No. I do not think that there will be a
substantial change in the situation that you describe. People always
have difficulty enforcing their rights. The point about the 1993
amendment is that it created the ability to get an independent view.
Mr. Lamb&#146;s inquiry is suggesting an increase in
appeal rights, which has been long needed. It should have been
introduced in 1993 and certainly by 1996, and the need for it has been
pointed out since then. There should be an extension in appeal
rights.</div>
<a name="10012016000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are some good organisations around, such as the one that I am a
trustee of&#151;SOS!SEN. There is also the Independent Panel for
Special Education Advice, as well as a number of other charities. The
British Dyslexia Association has a parental advisory service. There is
the National Autistic Society, the Vision Charity for those with visual
impairment and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, which
provides representation for those with hearing impairments. So 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>there are a large number of organisations, some of which are very good.
There are also people such as myself, who are in practice in law and
who are there to help people. However, it is generally the local
councillor, the local person who knows somebody or the MP who has to do
something. In my experience, MPs play an important role for those who
do not get access to the charities or to legal advice, and I cannot see
that the Bill will change life for MPs or those involved in politics
who represent people. It will slightly increase the potential amount of
appeals, so you might say that it is slightly lawyer-favoured, but I
should point out that the majority of appeals are not run by lawyers.
Mr. Lamb has made one necessary proposal, but they are not
proposals that will change.</div>
<a name="10012016000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a good
example, but my dyslexia is not significant. I have children with very
severe dyslexia indeed, but genetically you simply can&#146;t tell.
Many parents we meet are very clever people. One of my closest friends
is a judge in Australia and his wife is a consultant, but both their
children are significantly autistic and are not going to be anywhere
near as bright as their parents. But many parents have difficulties
with literacy and with handling pressure and stress. We are there to
help in whatever way we can those people that approach us. I cannot see
that changing.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><a name="10012016000380"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): May I backtrack
for a moment before coming to the main point? Like Tim, I picked up the
point, Brian, when you said that we need a really adequate reform, yet
the Bill makes only two proposals. Looking through the summary of your
recommendations, we can see a lot about culture and a lot of things
that one can do locally, but I focus on exclusions, noting the comments
made previously. Is there not a case for including something on
exclusions in the Bill? It is such a critical part of the
problem.</div>
<a name="10012016000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> Legally, yes. Exclusions are dealt with by
another Act. As I pointed out in my short note, SENDIST deals with
everything to do with exclusions apart from the final
exclusion.</div>
<a name="10012016000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
independent appeal panel deals with exclusions. Brian&#146;s point
about independent appeal panels or the school having to consider making
reasonable adjustments for the provision they are making is overall far
too late, as I have said. Also, it does not really belong as a separate
issue in a different Bill. It should be in this Bill. If people are
going to look at exclusions, they should be looking at preventing
exclusions, but there should be a consideration for exclusions in the
main Bill rather than in a satellite Bill, because it is a major
issue.</div>
<a name="10012016000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Lamb:</b></i> Could I wrap your question up with a previous
one? This is a debate about what you need to do in legislation and what
you don&#146;t. In the inquiry, we clearly considered that in some
detail. Sometimes it can be as radical trying to do things outside
legislation as it can doing them from within. I say that as someone who
has spent 25 years lobbying on getting more legislation. It is about
where you strike that balance.</div>
<a name="10012016000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In one sense,
it is not that we are short of legislation on SEN. We have the
framework, we have the Disability Discrimination Act, and we also have
the Every Child Matters framework. What we proposed in the inquiry in
other areas&#151;again, the Government have said that they will
implement it, and I look forward to the implementation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>plan&#151;is this. Taking first the issue of statements and needing to
get a statement and appeal, I agree with you that there is some
downward pressure on that in the Bill. Appeals should make that
function better, and therefore make it more attractive to get one to
some extent.</div>
<a name="10012016000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">But we come
back to the situation that, on the whole, it would be even better if
parents could get what they needed without having to go through the
whole statutory framework and process. There are a number of
recommendations in my inquiry to help achieve that, in terms of putting
a greater focus on SEN in schools.</div>
<a name="10012016000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
coming back to the Bill, I hope that the greater focus by Ofsted on
what makes a good school and what makes good outcomes will mean that
the support that parents need in school is much more routinely
available in the first place. When they do have to go for a statement,
I propose that there should be a national information service. That
should also help give the kind of support that you are looking for. If
there are problems with local authority provision on that, I would
encourage the Secretary of State to use his or her powers to look at
the information that the Government now have, holding local authorities
better to account if they are failing in relation to those
measures.</div>
<a name="10012016000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have also agreed, as a result of measures in the Education
and Skills Act that went through last year, that parents will now be
able to take complaints to the local government ombudsman, as they have
put more money into that. These are all measures that put more pressure
on sorting things out&#151;either getting the right provision in the
first place; or, if a statement of need is required, that there is more
support for parents. Mr. Friel referred to the organisations
that do that.</div>
<a name="10012016000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
national support for parents provided by, but independent of, the
Government. I have also made recommendations about an enhanced role for
parent partnerships, which makes it clear that they should be more
independent of local authorities that they have been until now, and
something that looks at the whole concept of
neutrality&#151;previously, neutrality seemed to be interpreted as
the role of the herald in Henry V, and you kept the score for both
sides. However, we need to be sure that neutrality is about operating
within the law and the
framework.</div><a name="10012016000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming
to your point about exclusions, we looked at it and agonised in some
depth. I partly take John&#146;s point that by looking at the role of
exclusion panels, we are only addressing part of the issue, which I
think is absolutely right. That is why I also made a recommendation,
which I believe was accepted, that when the statutory guidance comes
out on behaviour partnerships, there should be new statutory guidance
on local authorities and on schools about the measures that they need
to take to reduce differential exclusions between SEN and other
children. That will be a statutory measure that will also put a
downward pressure on exclusion.</div>
<a name="10012016000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
changing the culture in schools, to make them more welcoming to and
more focused on SEN and looking at the reasons why behavioural issues
occur and how much they are related to SEN, should also help
enormously. Again, it is a package&#151;some legislation, some good
practice.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="10012016000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> I think that there is a need for more
legislation and less attendance on practice. May I point out the
leading cases on specificity of statements on my responsibility? They
have been the law for many years, so a great deal of the system that is
going to be downward pressure has been known about.</div>
<a name="10012016000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some good proposals, and I am not here to attack any of them and say
that they are not good&#151;they are. However, one has to realise
that the proposals that have existed for a great deal of time have not
been effective and are not going to be any more effective because you
repeat yourself.</div>
<a name="10012016000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Twice after
winning those cases, guidance was re-issued by the Ministers when we
went to them&#151;Lord Adonis and Eric Forth&#151;and the effect
has been, as Mr. Lamb describes in his inquiry, relatively
innocuous or not at all. There is a much greater need for creating a
greater supervisory system and greater rights. On that, I am afraid
that we would respectfully disagree. In trying to make the Bill work
better, I believe that we both agree largely on the major
issues.</div><a name="10012016000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000381"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Annette, do you want to come
back?</div><a name="10012016000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000382"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I think that the right of appeal by the parent is
all important, but I am not clear on what grounds the parent might
appeal. I am worried that it would just end up with the local authority
essentially not providing something because it would be too
expensive&#151;that comes to the separation point&#151;and the
parent obviously wanting more resources. Should there be something
clearly set out?</div>
<a name="10012016000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> That is right because the annual review is
governed by regulation at the moment. There is a statutory provision in
subsection 5 of section 328&#151;I have the legislation here with me
if I make a mistake by memory&#151;there is no time limit on a
statement, nor is there one in the review. What the review regulations
do is make everyone else behave within a certain timeframe, but the
authority does not have to decide. That leaves an amendment by the
parliamentary draftsmen or yourselves, because the proposed provision
needs to have a time limit on it. I would suggest a maximum of eight
weeks, which is the maximum period the regulations allow for a proposed
statement. At the annual review, either the parents or the school must
recommend or ask for an amendment to the statement, because a right of
appeal being created when no one wants an appeal is
otiose.</div><a name="10012016000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
drafting of that particular section needs to set a time limit and
provide for either the parent or the school to request an amendment to
the annual review&#151;if the local authority considers that there
will an amendment, it will of course make it anyway. There needs to be
some tighter drafting on that particular clause, because at the moment,
as it is, there is a great deal of complaints to the Secretary of State
or the High Court about refusal to amend statements. The local
authorities answer, &#147;Well, there&#146;s no time limit.&#148;
I quite regularly see cases where it takes over a year. No decision is
made before lawyers threaten legal action, and then a decision is made.
I have seen cases where it has taken two
years.</div><a name="10012016000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something
needs to be in there. Mr. Lamb&#146;s
suggestion&#151;which, may I emphasise, is very much
needed&#151;needs to be firmed up in a sensible manner. It is
obviously not the role of the Lamb inquiry to do  the drafting,
but the drafting as such is not good at  the
moment.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="10012016000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000383"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I very much agree that it is not always
legislation, as both Mr. Lamb and Mr. Friel have
said. I just wondered while working on clauses 7 and 8 whether both of
you would like to comment on some of the points made about the pupil
and parent guarantees. They lay out specifically some of the
expectations that parents would have of a school in dealing with the
special educational needs of their son or daughter.</div>
<a name="10012016000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
the pupil guarantee lays out&#151;we were just discussing
exclusions&#151;what the expectation of a school would be, for
example, with respect to exclusions and special educational needs. What
is your view, given that the guarantees lay out specifically, although
not in legislation, what the expectation of a school is in terms of
what should be provided for the child and what the parent can
expect?</div><a name="10012016000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
redress from the local government ombudsman as a last resort if that is
not provided in a state school &#151;I emphasise &#147;last
resort&#148;&#151;do you have a view whether that is a good thing
and will be a good way forward in ensuring that schools&#146; special
educational needs provision is not so variable?</div>
<a name="10012016000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Lamb:</b></i> Certainly in terms of the inquiry, one of the
big themes was the level of variability that we found. Sometimes that
can be good, because it reflects local circumstances and local
populations. I do not think that we should necessarily expect all
schools or local authorities to have the same rates for things such as
the number of children statemented, because that will change depending
on populations.</div>
<a name="10012016000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
some types of variability are bad. The lack of focus on SEN in the past
has been bad when it has been about variability. In broad terms, we
very much welcome the guarantees and the attempt to put down a
framework in which parental expectations can work. What has been said
in the consultation document is also helpful. One of our key questions
was about the relationship between the guarantees around additional
support, especially, and SEN. Having seen the consultation documents, I
think that it is clear that nothing in the guarantee would in any way
cut across or undercut the commitments made in terms of the level of
provision that the SEN framework would
prescribe.</div><a name="10012016000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we will go further in looking at the guarantees as they are
worked up. One issue that we face as a nation is the growing
identification of children with SEN. Some of that clearly has to do
with trends in the population involving better identification of autism
and similar factors; some of it, as Sir Alan Steer pointed out in his
review, may be because when children fall behind there is an over-quick
reaching for the SEN label. It may well be that those children should
be identified with SEN; it may be that sometimes that label is reached
for more quickly. In a way, I do not care, and I do not think that
schools should care. The issue is whether a child is performing or
falling behind, whether we can identify the reasons and whether we can
address it. The school guarantee is a good way to begin to do
so.</div><a name="10012016000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of parental confidence and involvement, it is absolutely
excellent. Although you do not give it this title, in the inquiry, I
recommend something called a co-offer for parents of SEN children. It
involves a number of principles of transparency, involvement and,
wherever possible, face-to-face communication in the education of their
child. Although the school guarantee is not called that, some of its
requirements relating to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>the level of parental involvement very much exemplify what we were
looking at when we talked about the co-offer. We might want to dig a
bit deeper on how we can extend even further the richness of what is
going to be offered around the guarantee, especially for when children
fall behind and how that relates to parents&#146; involvement when
they have a child with SEN. I think broadly the framework is a really
good approach in delivering
that.</div><a name="10012016000074"></a>

59</b><a name="10012016000384"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): The
National Autistic Society and others have suggested that among
home-educated children, there will probably be a higher number of
autistic children, yet the impact assessment for the Bill makes no
mention of any negative impact on autistic children of visits by local
authority inspectors coming to see whether children need to be returned
to school. How bad an error do you think that
is?</div><a name="10012016000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> It is a case-by-case problem. It would be,
arguably, disability discrimination to put somebody under that stress.
It is a difficult situation. The criteria in the Bill for assessing
provision at home omit specific reference to special educational needs
and provision, and in relation to the test for harm, you could be
harming a child without delivering provision to them, so that is not at
all clear. The problem with the whole proposal is that it is a generic
proposal, not a specific proposal. Section 19, which has to do with
duties relating to home tuition imposed on local authorities, includes
a duty to provide for the special educational needs, so the National
Autistic Society&#146;s point would be perhaps cleared up to some
degree if the inspectors and the inspectorate provisions have to have
regard to that, but also the test in the Act itself in the
schedule&#151;it is quite curious to have a whole Act in a
schedule&#151;ought to have some regard to whether the parents are,
within the home education provision, making provision for the special
educational needs of the
child.</div><a name="10012016000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think there is a difference, as there is a difference between being
disabled under the Disability Discrimination Act and having special
educational needs. Most children with a disability do have special
needs, but not all. There is a need to look at those sections as well,
or those parts of schedule 1, and tighten them up on those
points.</div><a name="10012016000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000385"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The impact assessment says that it is reasonable
to assume that a child with SEN will often warrant more in-year
monitoring. Could you find any evidence in the impact assessment for
any funding or particular efforts to ensure a training package suitable
for local inspectors to be able to look after the interests of autistic
children when
visiting?</div><a name="10012016000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> The short answer to that is that at the
moment, I think, the funding is there, but there is nothing specific
offering it. This does require quite a considerable change in looking
at home education, which is not my primary interest, as you can gather,
but those provisions ought to take account of special needs in order to
take account of those who require particular care and attention to be
paid to
them.</div><a name="10012016000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000386"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> All education and child-based legislation for the

Friel:</b></i> Not in education they haven&#146;t. The
statutory provisions do not do so, and the court decisions at the
moment roundly challenge that. The best you will get, I think, is
section 13 of the 2002 Act, which is to reach the child&#146;s
potential. I may be wrong on the section, but I think you will find I
am right on the statutory provision. There is no legal consideration of
what that means, but there is a difference between the Children Act
requirement to act in the best interests of the child and the Education
Act requirements, which are to provide education suitable to age,
aptitude and ability and to deliver it with the efficient use of
resources. Currently, it is section 9 of  the Education Act
1996; previously, it was section 76  of the Education Act 1944,
and that is a

was.</div><a name="10012016000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> I think that you were asking about the
schedule 1 amendments and whether there was an overarching duty and a
test under the Children Act.</div>
<a name="10012016000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000388"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Or indeed whether there should be.</div>
<a name="10012016000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> Or whether there should be. Well, I have
strongly favoured the same test in relation to the child&#146;s
welfare as education. The limitation on this goes back to the original
European convention on human rights, when the same limitation was put
on. Regarding the current rider on section 9 of the Education Act 1996,
about the efficient use of resources, the House of Lords has said that
that means that budget is not relevant, but if you can do it cheaper
and effectively you can do it that way, whereas if it costs a fortune
the budget does not count. That is a case called T <i class="I">v.</i> E Sussex,
where Lord Wilberforce gave the judgment.</div>
<a name="10012016000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are very cases where budget does not count in reality and it
would help to look at the best interests or the welfare of a child as a
uniform test. All Departments are supposed to be joined-up in
decision-making processes now and that would be helpful.</div>
<a name="10012016000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is not
an overarching, individually enforceable right. There is a target duty
under the Education Acts and that has been held by the House of Lords
in GM <i class="I">v. </i>Barnet quite recently to be a target duty under the
Children Act, so there is no particular difference. It is only when you
get child James with no school that it becomes a duty to do something
about it. So the duty becomes individually enforceable and there are a
large number of statutory provisions that can only be looked at when
you get a crisis, if you like.</div>
<a name="10012016000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000389"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I apologise for interrupting. Do you find it odd
that not only is there no statutory duty on local authorities, for
instance in the home education provisions or in the application of
school attendance orders, to consider the best interests of the child
but there is a further problem specifically in relation to autistic
children? We have already established that there will be a larger
number than average of autistic children 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>in the home-educated community. There may be an autistic child whose
parents are providing exemplary, individualised home education who fail
to register with the local authority. Then, under the terms of this
Bill, the local authority is bound to impose a school attendance order
and is specifically barred from considering the quality of the
education provided. Do you find that odd?</div>
<a name="10012016000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> The answer to that is yes, but the monitoring
provisions are also difficult. If a child with autistic spectrum
disorder is normally being educated at home, they have not been able to
cope with a mainstream environment or a school environment. There may
have to be compromises made to educate and develop that child. That
means that, for example, if a child with ASD requires a speech therapy
intervention, because there is a language disorder and there is quite a
lot of research that says many children with ASD have language
disorders, new section 19E(2)(b) of the Education Act 1996 would
prevent approval of the education.</div>
<a name="10012016000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
I think that the provisions are far too tightly framed for a home
education situation. As you have already mentioned to us, there is also
the fact that the officer must hold a meeting with the child. I have
knowledge of many cases where that is simply not possible due to stress
and anxiety.</div>
<a name="10012016000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore
the provisions need to be looked at, particularly in the light of the
interests of the ASD child. However, there are many other children with
mental health disorders that are not classifiable as ASD. Also, some
children at the age of 16 may still have such severe needs that they
may not be able to communicate in an effective manner for an
assessment. So this really does not take into account the sophisticated
investigation and methodology required to look at these
issues.</div>
<a name="10012016000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000390"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have only 12 minutes left and a number of
colleagues want to ask questions, so I would be grateful if our
witnesses could try to give quite short
answers.</div>

63</b><a name="10012016000391"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): Regarding the legislation that
is already on the statute books  and the proposals that we are
discussing today, particularly the proposal for a right of appeal and
the proposal that the Ofsted inspection should incorporate an
assessment of special educational needs provision, how well does
existing legislation and prospective legislation work? I ask that
because I have often found that there is a mixed bag in terms of
support for parents whose children have disabilities or SEN. That is
partly because the capacity and understanding of the range of people
that they deal with, whether in school or through the local authority,
can vary enormously, given the wide range of different needs that often
have to be addressed.</div>
<a name="10012016000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">So my worry
about more legislation is always whether there is the capacity to
interpret that legislation and to look for specialist advice and
support, before delivering on the ground. That goes back to your point
about outcomes and statements. It seems that that issue is discussed
less than all the rigid legislation and technical processes that we
tend to like dreaming up.</div>
<a name="10012016000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Lamb:</b></i> This was absolutely fundamental to the inquiry.
As I said earlier, we can keep loading legislation onto the system, but
if we have not got the properly  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>qualified teachers focusing on the right things with the right culture
in schools to deal with that, it does not matter how much additional
legislation we put in place on local authorities and schools, and
therefore I think there has to be a balance. One of the things that was
recommended in the inquiry was additional training of teachers,
especially of what is called the second tier&#151;not first-tier
classroom teachers but specialist teachers who can come in and help
with that&#151;and also more focus on the more effective use of
learning support assistants and teaching assistants so that they can
support front-line teachers much better in being able to do that. That
is precisely what I wanted to see, in going back to my previous answer,
where the guarantees are particularly useful. Focusing on ensuring that
the system has the capacity to deal with the children is absolutely
crucial. That is not to say that legislation is not important. If we
have not got the capacity, it will not happen,
anyway.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><a name="10012016000393"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): One of the
other provisions in the Bill is for a school report card. How helpful
will that be to parents who have children with special educational
needs? Do you think there should be a specific provision in the report
card to deal with that issue?</div>
<a name="10012016000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Lamb:</b></i> To answer the second part of your question
first, if there are specific provisions within the report card where we
can get a much better measure of the success of schools around
SEN&#151;moving away from what has been at times a quite crude
interpretation of school league tables; it has often meant schools have
not wanted to address the SEN issue because they then get too good a
reputation for it and get too many children with SEN; we can get a very
balanced score card, to use the jargon again, across a number of
measures&#151;then the school report card is going to be incredibly
helpful. One of the major things that parents kept telling us through
the inquiry was the need to have better information about how their
schools are performing against SEN. It is very difficult for parents to
find out. If we get it right, it will be incredibly
helpful.</div><a name="10012016000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000394"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Clause 8 deals with the rights of appeal to the
tribunal. Do you think the tribunal system works well at the moment? Is
it sufficiently well informed and independent enough? Do you think more
could be done along the lines of some of the Balchin commission
proposals, for example, to use a mediation process, which means that
the tribunal would very much be a last resort rather than an instant
referral, which many parents have to use?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="10012016000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> The tribunal works well when it works, putting
it crudely. The current system where attempts are made at mediation is
wholly inefficient and does not work at all. It is not independent and
parental groups have no confidence in it. Although the mediator has
tried their best in mediations that I have seen, they have not shown a
degree of independence or clear thought, so I think there is a need for
a pre-appeal structure, or a structure within the appeal to offer clear
mediation, and this particular system calls out for it. Mediation can
be effective if it is independent, informed and able to make firm
decisions. As the current system stands, the tribunal is accessible to
those who can get the assistance to access it, or who get legal help or
are determined to access it. Those who act for themselves find it
extremely confusing, and the current reforms are very anti-parents and
anti-individual. I strongly disagree with the Lamb inquiry&#146;s
outcome on that. If you look at the evidential base on that, there is
one area where Mr. Lamb, his colleagues and I and many
others in the field&#151;virtually everyone in the field&#151;would
strongly disagree. The current system has become far too complicated
for a parent to operate and is not parent friendly. A mediation system
that is effective is urgently
needed.</div><a name="10012016000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Lamb:</b></i> Very briefly, if I could just come in on that,
I certainly agree with Mr. Friel&#146;s concerns about
mediation as we saw it, which does not mean that mediation cannot work,
but I did not see, on the whole, very good mediation schemes, although
there are one or two monitoring
areas.</div><a name="10012016000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the function of the tribunal, the evidence we
saw&#151;from the tribunal and from talking to parents&#151;was
that the pre-tribunal, telephone inquiry system was helping and
reducing the number of cases that had to go to tribunal. I agree with
Mr. Friel that the tribunal system has now become immensely
complex and it is not easy to go there, even for well-informed
middle-class parents, unless they are legally supported, which is why I
recommended that we look again at the exceptional cases scheme, which
helps parents who qualify for  legal aid to go there. At the
moment that is not working well and I would like to see more support
for parents before and at tribunal. Certainly the early feedback on the
reforms to the tribunal system was that it was functioning
better.</div><a name="10012016000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000395"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> Do you think that the new Bill has anything that
may help a situation that I found one  of my constituents in
quite a few years ago? The difficulty was physical: a young boy, 13 at
the time I think, had a growth deficiency. Part of the treatment was to
extend the length of his legs by about 3 inches &#151;a very
radical procedure&#151;which meant that for six months he had to have
his legs straight out in front of him and he could not bend them at
all. He either had to move schools, to a school that was all on ground
level, or stay at his present school, where a chair lift would not do,
because other children would have been falling over his legs, and have
a lift installed. Through pressure from myself, his family and the
local press&#151;with photographs and things,
unfortunately&#151;eventually we got a very small lift installed in
the school, so that he could carry on for the six months. Might
anything in the Bill address such a situation, so that we would not
have had to go public and go through all the fuss  that we
did?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div><a name="10012016000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> Mr. Lamb&#146;s point about the
change under the Equality Bill to the Disability Discrimination Act, on
ancillary aids, would have an effect on that to some degree, if it was
an ancillary aid. Even now, under the Disability Discrimination Act, a
large structural alteration in a building would not be discriminatory
but is exempted, so the amendments proposed as a result of the Lamb
inquiry, under the changes to the DDA, in the circumstances you
describe, probably would help in such a case, but not certainly. Do you
want to comment
further?</div><a name="10012016000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000397"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Could you comment on the provision within schedule
1 that allows parents to object to their home-educated child being seen
alone or to inspectors from the local authority wanting to come into
the home? Proposed new paragraph 19E(4) explicitly states that such
arrangements may take
place</div><a name="10012016000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless
the child or a parent of the child
objects&#148;.</div><a name="10012016000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
could you comment on what the Bill goes on to say? Proposed new
paragraph 19F(1)(e) says that someone objecting can be cause for the
revocation of licence to be allowed to home
educate:</div><a name="10012016000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
reason of a failure to co-operate with the authority in arrangements
made by them under section 19E, or an objection to a meeting as
mentioned in section 19E(4), the authority have not had an adequate
opportunity to ascertain the matters referred
to&#148;.</div><a name="10012016000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, there is a right to object but, if you do, you lose your
right to be home
educated.</div><a name="10012016000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Friel:</b></i> Well, you could change the parent&#146;s
objection under that provision to say, &#147;save when the parents
have given reasonable grounds for their objection.&#148; That would
be a minor amendment but
significant.</div><a name="10012016000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern about the whole of the schedule is that the matter goes to an
uneducated, independent panel set up by regulation. There is no rush in
such a case, as in exclusion, so we could consider sending it to the
SENDIST, which has the expertise. Both Mr. Lamb and myself
would consider that the majority of home-educated children&#151;not
the vast majority, but a lot of them&#151;would have a special need,
and the tribunal with expertise would be the SENDIST. If we set up a
panel locally, like an exclusion panel, we may have a chair without
legal experience in a complicated matter. The provisions are highly
complex and very litigious, and we may not have members with more than
general educational experience or, indeed, with no educational
experience. I urge you to think a bit about the regulatory power to set
up an appeal. It is questionable whether it ought to be as it
stands.</div><a name="10012016000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian

Gibb.</div><a name="10012016000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><a name="10012016000404"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): My
questions at this point are mainly to Graham Badman. What was the
principal problem that you were concerned about? Was it the issue of
safeguarding, with home education being a potential cover for abuse, or
were you more worried about the quality of education being received by
home-educated
children?</div><a name="10012016000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> On the basis of the quantum of evidence
submitted by local authorities, I think my first concern would be the
sufficiency and quality of the education received by a number of
students. I can give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>you some statistics if you wish. Alongside that was a secondary concern
that in a tiny minority of cases, there could be significant abuse of a
child or children within a family. Some notable cases are running
currently. I would not want to prioritise one over the other,
but  I have concerns on both
fronts.</div><a name="10012016000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000405"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I think that you must, really. We on the Committee
all need to know your main concern. Was it the quality of education, or
was it abuse? You seem to be telling us that your principal driving
force was concern about the quality of
education.</div><a name="10012016000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
I ask you about a recommendation in your report? You say, &#147;At
the time of registration parents...must provide a clear statement
of their educational approach, intent and desired/planned outcomes for
the child over the following twelve months.&#148; That contrasts with
page 2 of the policy statement just issued by the
Government, which says that parents will be able to follow the wide
range of educational philosophies that they currently adhere to,
including autonomous learning, and will not have to follow the national
curriculum and so on. What do you think of the Government&#146;s
policy in terms of implementing your
recommendation?</div><a name="10012016000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I thought that the existing definition does
not offer a very clear definition of &#147;efficient&#148; or
&#147;suitable&#148;, and I made that point in my report. I talked
about the need for an education that was broad, balanced, relevant and
differentiated, to quote from a report of many years ago, but I argued
fundamentally that children should have an education that equips them
to make choices. Even within the current legislation, although the
definitions are within their own community, it also makes it clear that
within their own community must not preclude other choices.</div>
<a name="10012016000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much has been
said about autonomous education in the wake of the report&#146;s
publication. It needs to be clear that by no means all home educators
are autonomous educators. Some are highly structured. Some offer a
high-quality, quite formalised system of education. I was maintaining
that even within the loosest definition of &#147;autonomous&#148;,
it should be possible for any parent to say, &#147;Over the next 12
months, this is what I wish my child to achieve, and this is what I
wish to see them do.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012016000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can cite,
if you wish, an example of an 18-month-old grandchild who I guess
psychologists would argue is at the key autonomous stage. I can tell
you that in the next 12 months, although she is completely autonomous
in her education because she chooses, her vocabulary will grow from
about 10 words to about 1,000. She will go from monosyllabic babbling
to sentences. I know that there are things that she will be able to do,
because I have some form of prediction and a duty of care, albeit as a
grandparent. I expect no less of her
parents.</div><a name="10012016000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000406"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> So you are not expecting just two sides of A4; you
are expecting a full curriculum and teaching
plan.</div><a name="10012016000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I think that on two sides of A4, for a young
child, you could set out what you expect of them in linguistic terms,
which is particularly important, and maybe in terms of mathematics.
When the child is much older, as a teenager, would it not be remiss of
any parent, for example, not to ensure that they have access to
information enabling them to judge environmental issues such as climate
change? There should be something within the structure of an education
allowing a parent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>to say, &#147;These are the things that are important to us, which is
why we are home educators, and these are the things that we therefore
want for our
child.&#148;</div><a name="10012016000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000407"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> One final question. You recommended that local
authorities should have the right to speak with each child alone if
deemed appropriate, or if a child is particularly vulnerable. The
legislation states that the parent or child can object to such a
meeting. Why are you so insistent in your report that the local
authority meets the child alone without the parent being
there?</div><a name="10012016000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I made it clear in my report and in my
evidence to the Select Committee that I viewed the exercising of the
right to see the child alone as a last resort, and I would hope that
there would be very few cases where that would arise. However, there
are occasions when it is important to ascertain the views of the child
and to do so in a quite direct way. The UN convention on the rights of
the child, which was much of the background to my report, does not
confer those rights on the parent. It does not say that you can have
the right to the child preferred to the parent&#151;it confers those
rights on a child, one of which is to express themselves when they are
able to do so. There are some instances where the views of the child
have been subjugated to the views of the parent, and so, in extremis, I
would expect the local authority, if it had significant cause on a
range of other fronts, to be able to ask that question of the child
themselves.</div>
<a name="10012016000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000408"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> When you were undertaking your review, did you
meet any groups of people who supported the recommendations that you
were
making?</div><a name="10012016000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> Yes, many, and subsequently by e-mail as
well. There was one who gave evidence to the Select Committee, who said
he welcomed registration, and that he already had good relationships
with the local authority. There are many others who welcomed the fact
that were this to become law, home educators would have access to
significant resources, particularly applying to youngsters with special
educational needs. They would also have opportunities to re-enter
schools, sometimes on a flexible basis, and, if they did so&#151;and
many home educators do, at some point in their career&#151;to go back
to a school where their previous career had not been blighted; the
powers of local authorities to offer a new school was very much
welcome. There are a range of reasons.</div>
<a name="10012016000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number also
welcomed the opportunity to be engaged, particularly in the training of
local authority officers, which was one of their major criticisms, and
to have a voice. I made a recommendation that home educators should
have a
voice.</div><a name="10012016000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report is not critical of home education&#151;if anything, it is
critical of local authorities&#151;but it gives home educators a
voice and an opportunity to disinter some of the good things that I saw
about personalised education that we might learn
from.</div><a name="10012016000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><a name="10012016000409"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): Mr. Badman, I want to
start with you as well, for obvious reasons, if you do not mind. I
assume that you have seen the paper that the Department issued today,
setting out some notes about these particular
clauses.</div><a name="10012016000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I confess that I did, half an hour ago, and I
have done my best to read them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div><a name="10012016000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000410"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Great. I think we know what you are trying to
achieve&#151;certainly, my party recognises some of the concerns that
you have. However, in the section that deals with registration, there
is six pages&#146; worth of details of what will be involved in
registration, when it can be rejected and so on. There is a paragraph
that seems to sum up the approach to me, which is paragraph
28 on page 7. It states that regulations will require local authorities
to acknowledge applications for registration to make a decision on
registration within a reasonable period of time. Is one of the reasons
why many home educators object to your report and the
Government&#146;s proposals is that they appear to turn something
that at the moment is a right for people in the country&#151;home
education&#151;into something that they appear to have to not just
notify, but apply to the state for permission to do and to prove their
worthiness to do it? Is that not quite a big tilt in the way in which
the freedom to home educators are set out in this
country?</div><a name="10012016000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I do not think it is. Two pieces of the legal
advice contained within my report makes it clear that under European
law, there is no absolute right to home-educate&#151;the chapter and
verse are given in my report. The process of regulation simply enables
local authorities to determine first of all, how many of these young
people we are dealing with. I more fearful about the numbers that we do
not know about than anything else. One in my reference groups tells me
that the numbers could be way in excess of 80,000. We do not know about
these young people. We do not know if they are safe. We do not know if
they are having a suitable education. The registration process is the
first step in making an inroad into dialogue with the local authority,
which has responsibilities that it cannot necessarily discharge because
the current laws do not give it the
power.</div><a name="10012016000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000411"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> You accept that in practice it is a lot more than
that. We as a party have no objections with notifying, but on page 8 we
see what the statement will involve. Admittedly, it is fairly brief but
it is nevertheless a substantive statement setting out the educational
needs of the individual child, talking about educational philosophy and
outlining plans for the current year. I am not saying that those issues
are not relevant to the local authority, but the provision is turning
what at present is a right into something for which individuals will
have to apply to the state; they will have to apply for permission to
do something that does not require permission at present. Do you
understand why there should have been strong feelings about it, and why
people should feel that the state is intruding not only by requiring
notification but by requiring registration?</div>
<a name="10012016000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham

don&#146;t share them. I see them as someone who has looked in from
the outside. The sort of information that the note issued today offers
is not that complicated.</div>
<a name="10012016000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
almost turn your question on its head. Proper and responsible parents
make that decision, often for very good reason. I acknowledge that
there are many good reasons why people should decide on home education.
Equally, they must have some view of what they are going to achieve,
and what are the needs of their child. If they had no idea of the needs
of the child, they might just as well have left them in a school. It
could have been a good school, it could have been an awful school, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>they must have had some insight of what their child needed and how they
could fulfil those needs more effectively through home education. I am
saying only that if a local authority is to exercise its proper duties,
it needs to know that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000412"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Yes, we accept that the local authorities have to
know who those individuals are, not necessarily that they have to prove
at the beginning of the process.</div>
<a name="10012016000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I take
you briefly to the question of monitoring, which links with the
previous issue? Page 10 sets out the monitoring requirements. Earlier,
you said that the primary concern was that the education should be
suitable. On page 12, it says the same&#151;that the primary purpose
of monitoring is that it should be suitable. In paragraph
40, on monitoring, it
states:</div><a name="10012016000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
section requires local authorities to make arrangements with a view to
ascertaining as far as reasonably practical...whether education is
suitable&#148;.</div><a name="10012016000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
then tacks on three other
things:</div><a name="10012016000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether
education accords with the application for registration; what the
child&#146;s wishes and feelings about the education are; and whether
it is harmful for the welfare of the child to continue with home
education.&#148;</div><a name="10012016000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
you accept that it is not asking only about the suitability of
education, but about a load of linked&#151;but arguably not
linked&#151;issues that would require a different level of
monitoring?</div>
<a name="10012016000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> To use your words, I would argue that they
are linked, in that children do not learn well in chaotic schools. They
do not learn well in chaotic homes either.</div>
<a name="10012016000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Determining
whether a child is benefiting from the sort of environment that you
would get in certain homes might be quite appropriate in relation to
the suitability of the education. Equally, to ascertain the
child&#146;s feelings about what education they are receiving is also
important, and determining whether it accords with what the parents set
out to do is crucial. There would be little point in parents submitting
a registration saying, &#147;By the age of 14, my child will have a
full understanding of calculus&#148;, if they had no intention of
doing anything about it. Checking that what the parents say in their
registration is the truth and that they are achieving milestones on
their way to their major objectives seems appropriate and
important.</div>
<a name="10012016000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000413"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Given the time that we have for these initial
exchanges, may I ask one further question? One reason why Home
Education is probably concerned about the proposals is about what is
meant by &#147;suitability&#148;. At the moment, we have a fairly
light-touch regime. We do not always test it, but if we are to set up a
more rigorous regime, suitability will become much more
important.</div>
<a name="10012016000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 43
makes it clear that you have raised concerns about what suitability
should mean and about how children should be prepared in the 21st
century. It also confirms in paragraph 48 that the Government will now
establish a review to look into the whole issue of suitability and to
report, presumably in a year or two. Is not that really putting the
cart before the horse? Should not we know what suitability is, how we
shall define it and bottom out that debate before putting the apparatus
into place? Surely the concern of home educators is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>your vision of suitability, my vision and theirs might be completely
different and the burdens coming through the provision could therefore
be far more onerous than many of them would wish to
see.</div><a name="10012016000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I understand your point, but we all operate
within the legislative framework of the time. One would have thought
that, in defining throughout the review a more embracing definition of
&#147;suitable&#148;, it would have all sorts of effects on the
curriculum that is offered in schools. Wearing a different hat with
different interests, I might well argue, for example, that we pay
insufficient attention to social networking sites as a means of
communication between young people, and the vital role that they play
within learning. Having access to a social networking site, for
example, could be a key element of the provision of
education.</div><a name="10012016000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000414"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> So we do not know what we are signing up to until we
have an idea of what &#147;suitability&#148; will mean over the
next two, five or 10
years.</div><a name="10012016000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> Forgive me, but you do know what you are
signing up to. You are signing up to a review or a commission of some
sort to determine that. You are not signing up to anything that is
unknown.</div><a name="10012016000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000415"></a>Mr.

we?</div>
<a name="10012016000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> What you have at the moment, though, is a
legislative background for education in this country that is perhaps
greater in definition than in most other developed countries. There are
ample definitions out there. I tried in the paragraph to which you
referred to say that, within that broad sweep of legislation, we should
reasonably expect home-educating parents to define what curriculum they
would put in place in front of their child in such a way that the
child&#146;s choices were not limited in terms of career, interest
and
aptitude.</div><a name="10012016000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be of little point to have a totally monolinear education. I do
not mind if a child is going to be a chess grand master&#151;that
would be terrific&#151;but I would also expect them to know other
things about the world. It is that broad spectrum that I am concerned
about. People have chosen to opt out of the education system, and my
report makes it very clear that I found countless good reasons why many
of them have done so. I was not critical of many of their motivations,
but in terms of the rights of the child as enshrined in the UN
convention, there is a right to a quality of education that does not
limit a child&#146;s choices. Part of the statistics that I presented
to the Select Committee, and which are contained in the note of that
report, is that there is certainly clear evidence from a substantial
number of authorities that there is a much higher likelihood of young
people who are home educated to be
NEETs.</div><a name="10012016000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000416"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> We have received a number of submissions about this
matter and, on safeguards, it has been brought to our
attention&#151;other people have read it&#151;that a number of home
educators feel that some of the impositions that would be placed on
them would mean that people who abused their children would have
greater legal safeguards than those who home educate their
children.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="10012016000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> Yes, I understand that view. Let me tackle
this in a slightly different way. Local authorities are often
criticised for their failure to intervene when children are at
risk&#151;a number of fairly high-profile cases would evidence that.
Equally, local authority intervention in the lives of children we do
not know about has brought about significant improvements in their
welfare. All I am saying is that if there is any risk of a child being
the subject of abuse&#151;probably leading from the five key
morbidities and certainly if they are already subject to a child
protection plan as a result of a section 47 inquiry&#151;the local
authority has a responsibility to consider the welfare of that child as
paramount and, if necessary, either not agree to registration or revoke
it. I am not arguing that there is a greater likelihood. I am saying
that on the basis of the evidence that we have, twice as many young
people within the home-educating community as in the general population
are subject to the highest protection this country can afford: a child
protection plan&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am sorry.
Mr. Stuart and I have had this argument before. I promise
you that that is the case. You cannot ignore those
figures.</div><a name="10012016000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000417"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> What do you say to that, Fiona? It is a fair point,
is it not? If we do not know where children of school age are, there is
the potential&#151;maybe it is a reality for a number of
children&#151;that home education could be used as a smokescreen,
dare I say, for abusive or isolating behaviour by parents. I am sure
that that is not the case across the piece, but unfortunately we know
that it could be happening. Why not notify about the arrangements, just
so it is up front and
there?</div><a name="10012016000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> I am sitting next to somebody who just
said that that was a fact about the child protection plans and then you
said to me, &#147;Fiona, what are you going to say about
that?&#148;, but actually your question was something different. As I
understand it, you are making the same point that was made by the
Liberal Democrats, which is, &#147;Why would there not be a
requirement to notify that a parent either is home educating or intends
to home educate?&#148;</div>
<a name="10012016000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is one
question; the child protection plan is another question. The statements
in the Bill are another issue. The policy statement that was thrown at
us when we came in says something completely different, and the Badman
review says a fifth thing. I think it is the case that we do not know
what we do not know. The facts about child protection plans are not
facts. You can speculate however much you want about what you do not
know. There are children that you do not know about; that is
undoubtedly the
case.</div><a name="10012016000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000418"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Yes, but constituents have written to me about this
in particular. I have some sympathy for not ending up with something
that is basically a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but as I said in our
earlier sitting, I am sure that I heard David, and either Nick or
Michael Gove, say on Second Reading that some changes to the system
needed to be made. I am trying to think of a way forward.</div>
<a name="10012016000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">One issue is
knowing at least where children are, if not going into huge detail
about how they are educated&#151;there is a point about suitability
and what it means&#151;and allowing a level of engagement that can
clarify in a light-touch way whether the parents really want to educate
at home, for a number of very good reasons, or whether there is
something else going on that is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>about education. As I said, I do not have the answers as to how to do
that, but I think that it is a valid question. How do we know where
children are when they are of school age?</div>
<a name="10012016000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona

<a name="10012016000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona

to ask about amendments that could ameliorate any part of it, because I
do not agree with the first

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
85</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000420"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Mr. Badman, what is the rush? I must
say that I am rather disappointed that, following our exchange at the
Select Committee sitting, you have not reflected in any way on the
child protection plan figures, but we will not necessarily play that
out again.</div>
<a name="10012016000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The truth is
that we do not have sound data on the educational outcomes for
home-educated children in this country. There is a lot of research
around the world, but it would be fair to say that your report airily
dismissed pretty much all of it. Would it not be right to go slowly and
with humility, to establish the facts in a way that could be commonly
accepted, and then to take forward&#151;perhaps immediately, while
doing the research&#151;the recommendations in your report that I
certainly welcome, as I know many home-educating parents do, that
additional support should be made voluntarily available to families if
they wish to have it? Is it not true that most of the children who are
beneath the radar at the moment are there because there is absolutely
no benefit whatever in registering or notifying the local authority? If
there is no support and no access, why would anyone bother? Should we
not move forward on a voluntary basis, put in place the extra support
that you talked about and get a better understanding of the facts
before we move to what is by any stretch of the imagination a fairly
draconian set of proposals, as we have been discussing?</div>
<a name="10012016000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I reflected a great deal on our exchange of
views, I promise you. I did go back and look at the figures and I came
up with exactly the same conclusion. In fact, if you want me to qualify
it, when surveying the number of child protection plans in the
authorities that we covered in the last survey, we came up with a
figure of 0.4 per cent., which is double that within the normal
population. In fact, that figure could be fractionally higher, because
we discounted any child protection plan that was there as a consequence
of disability. I know you argued that because I did not know about the
other half, that therefore negated it and made it even again. My
argument in return, as you will recall, was that because we did not
know about the other half, that did not mean to say that they were all
safe either. It could be exactly the same figure or
more.</div>
<a name="10012016000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
86</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000421"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I interrupt you there? The question was not
about the letter to the Select Committee in which you suggested that I
had said that any child who was not known about was automatically safe.
I said no such thing, so you have your facts wrong there&#151;again.
What we were establishing was the rate of child protection plans in the
home-educating community. We went through it slowly, and you want to
rehearse it, so I will rehearse it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="10012016000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you have a
child protection plan, automatically you are known to the local
authority, so children previously not known to the local authority who
become subject to a child protection plan are then known to the local
authority. It does not by any means guarantee that children who are not
known to the local authority and do not have a child protection plan
are necessarily safe. But what you do know is that every child with a
child protection plan is known to the local authority, and you claimed,
completely erroneously&#151;and although you have been corrected,
here you are months later still getting it wrong, which is pretty
frightening&#151;that the percentage of children who are home
educated who have a child protection plan is double the national
average, when your own report suggests that the numbers are at least
double the 20,000, which is the number registered with the local
authority, and the Secretary of State said on Second Reading that the
Government estimated the number was 70,000. They do not know for sure,
but they think it is
70,000.</div><a name="10012016000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
you take the number of home-educated children with a child protection
plan and you see that as a percentage of 70,000, it comes out at a
great deal less than the average for the population, and that I believe
is the definitive statement of what we know. It does not tell us
everything we need to know, which is why I would not overstate my
reliance on it. Could you please comment on whether you believe that we
can truly say, as you have repeatedly said, that there is double the
rate of the most serious level of child protection plan among children
who are home educated?</div>
<a name="10012016000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham

same circle. I am afraid I fundamentally disagree with you. You think I
am wrong; I think you are
wrong.</div><a name="10012016000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000422"></a>Mr.

<a name="10012016000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> Well, fine; we might want to debate that
later&#151;perhaps you went to a better school than me. The fact
remains that I do not agree with your assumptions. On the basis of the
data collected from the local authorities and from two surveys that
have been validated by DCSF statisticians, I believe that we are quite
safe in saying that on the basis of the child protection plan analysis
that they carried out, there are twice as many young people on a child
protection plan known to local authorities within that population as
are within the general population. That is a fact. I am sorry that you
do not agree with me, but we could go on for ever
disagreeing.</div>
<a name="10012016000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000423"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The wider point to focus on is that there is a lot
that we do not know. I think that you called for greater research and
for greater support. Why not do the research and the support before
coming forward with a procedure? If the Secretary of State is right,
and if the impact assessment&#146;s numbers are right&#151;that is
a whole different ball game, I know&#151;it is going to cost
&#163;500 million-plus over the next 10 years at a time when we are
seeing numbers in child welfare and in education being slashed. That is
the situation. We are going to spend &#163;500 million chasing a
problem of which we have not established the existence. Can we not go
more slowly? Why do this
now?</div><a name="10012016000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> You assume that the analysis was carried out
over the period of my report. That would be wrong. The report,
fundamentally, had children&#146;s rights 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>at its heart&#151;yes&#151;but equally it drew evidence from local
authorities with years and years of pent-up frustration at not being
able to do the job that they thought they should do. It drew
particularly upon the work of the National Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, Ofsted and so on&#151;all those
agencies&#151;and Barnardo&#146;s. This is not a view that has just
emerged and therefore can be left to the caprice of a few years&#146;
time&#151;it is not that at all. Over the past five or six years,
there has been a growing body of concern that a number of home-educated
youngsters are not receiving a suitable education and a tiny percentage
of them are at risk. You ask me why the urgency. My urgency would be
very simple: if, by going forward with a registration scheme, we
safeguard the life of just one child, it is worth
it.</div><a name="10012016000184"></a>

Cryer:</b> May I suggest to the panel that there are important
issues not specifically to do with home education? We must know where
children are. In certain local authority areas such as
Bradford&#151;my own&#151;children are taken out of school and sent
back to Pakistan or Bangladesh for very long periods. In the case of
one boy, that period was 18 months, but no one came to school to tell
the head teacher that he was going anywhere, and no one came to school
at the end of that period to say that he was coming back. The school
could have helped by preparing work for him to do. This is just an
extreme case, but every year many children are taken back to their
family&#146;s country of origin without telling anyone&#151;they
just disappear. In the worst case scenario, girls are taken back for
marriage and no one knows, so this is very
important.</div><a name="10012016000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not suggesting for one minute that that has an impact on home
educators, but I am simply saying that we must bear in mind that in
certain parts of this country we must be very careful about where
children are at any given time. They must be given the support of the
child protection that we would extend to other sectors of the
community. Does anyone want to comment on
that?</div><a name="10012016000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> There is an issue with the fact that since
the children are, in effect, under their parents&#146; jurisdiction,
surely if they are home educated it has nothing to do with the local
authority where they are. They are with their parents, which is good
enough. If their parents decide to take them around the world for three
years, visiting wherever and doing whatever, that is the
parents&#146; decision. Sure, it would be nice if they consulted
their child and the child agreed, but that is not illegal or something
that we should have to worry
about.</div><a name="10012016000187"></a>

age and the parents say, &#147;We want to go around the
world&#148;, I do not necessarily have an objection&#151;at least
we know what the state of play is. In other circumstances it might not
be about an educational experience but possibly forcing or compelling a
young woman or girl into a marriage of which she does not want to be
part. Just knowing where children are, at least there was a
conversation. Would you not agree with
that?</div><a name="10012016000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe

their child, they can say one thing and do another. You cannot force

Nicholson:</b></i> Current registration regulations in
England from 2006 mean that, if a child is taken out of school in order
to be home educated, the school has a duty to notify the local
authority. The local authority then knows. If the child simply does not
return to school, there is no duty in the Government&#146;s pupil
registration regulations for the school to notify anyone; it only has
to make reasonable inquiries, which are defined as calling on the home
a couple of times within a 20-day period&#151;you could have two
10-day holidays or 20 days if they do not appear&#151;and they are
struck off the register. When anyone queries that, they are 
told that it would affect the attendance targets set by
Ofsted.</div>
<a name="10012016000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was at a
National Association of Social Workers conference last year because
Graham was speaking, and there was an interesting workshop in the
afternoon with somebody who gives tips to schools on how to improve
their attendance targets. He was very clear that what schools should do
was to knock pupils off the register immediately. You would not hold a
place open for them for any time at all because it would affect your
PA&#151;persistent absence&#151;targets and we tried to speak about
this to Ofsted. There is a huge problem with children who just
disappear out of school. For the ones who are taken out of school to be
home educated, the parent has a duty to notify the school. The school
has a duty to notify the local authority. It is in the pupil
registration regulations. If those regulations are not being
implemented&#151;I believe they are not, in many cases&#151;that is
problematic. Whether those regulations should be revised is, again, a
separate issue for legislators, but the regulations are in place and
there is a loophole over children who just do not come
back.</div><a name="10012016000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> Just for the sake of absolute clarity,
although I understand the points you have made about arranged marriage,
my
report&#151;</div><a name="10012016000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
90</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000427"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> No, I am not talking about arranged marriages; I am
talking about forced
marriage.</div><a name="10012016000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> Forced marriage. I am sorry; that was my
mistake. My report does make it clear that we found no evidence of home
education being used in that context. The second point I would like to
make, though, is about children who are missing. Certainly, schools
facing Ofsted section 5s will be under a much greater duty of
responsibility to report on the perceived welfare of youngsters,
including those whom they might have some cause
for concern for if they were absent from school for a long time. That
seems to me to be another element of safeguarding in relation to going
to
school.</div><a name="10012016000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point that was made, too, about the way in which attendance figures
were manipulated, yes, of course we are well aware of that. There is a
reference in the report that just to suggest that people go home and
become home educators to avoid exclusions is, we think, absolutely
wrong. Equally, there is a recommendation that the school place be kept
open for 20 days so that home-educating parents can have that
opportunity to reconsider if they wish. There is nothing about
dragooning them back at all; it is just about keeping their options
open. Some of the points that were made about the flexibility of
schooling are within the report, specifically in relation to
home-educating parents.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div><a name="10012016000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Paul Ennals:</b></i> It seems to me there is an underlying
issue, which has been troubling us throughout the debate, not only
through the review but for longer than that. The underlying issue is
that the population of home educators is far from homogenous. There are
several separate sub-categories&#151;we had some discussion with the
Select Committee on this issue&#151;and trying to develop some
commonalities of approach that cover all four of the sub-headings,
which I shall come to shortly, is where I think a lot of the
misunderstandings come. In my view&#151;the evidence is hard to
quantify seriously&#151;the significant majority of home educators
are likely to be highly effective in the education they provide and the
education that the children are receiving is likely to be of good
quality, despite their not having as much support as we should be able
to hope. That is group
1.</div><a name="10012016000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Group
2 is children with special educational needs.  I do not agree
with a previous witness&#146;s suggestion that the figure may be over
50 per cent. I have not seen the evidence that would back up that, but
it is a significant population of children who have been removed from
school because the school or certainly the parents have believed, often
rightly, that the school has been unable effectively to meet their
special educational
needs.</div><a name="10012016000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
two other groups are much, much smaller. One group&#151;I cannot
quantify it, but I know and we all know it exists&#151;is of children
who are withdrawn for malevolent purpose or through a lack of
capability of the parent, as a cover for abuse. Unquestionably it
exists, but it is a very small number of children. There is a fourth
category, which Graham has rightly drawn our attention to. It is where
some local authorities actively discourage a child from remaining in
the school education system, to help the school to meet some of the
performance targets that schools are
facing.</div><a name="10012016000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
are four separate groups, and in many ways the measures and support
that are needed for each of the four are different, so the challenge
that the Government and you as legislators are facing is trying to work
out how to enable the system to move forward, on the one hand improving
the quality of support for the large majority who, in my view, justify
that, and on the other, making it at least more likely that we can spot
and do something about the small vulnerable groups. I am not saying
that the solution that has been put forward is perfect, but in my view,
it is a proportionate response in seeking to meet both those separate
needs.</div><a name="10012016000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirement for setting forward a statement of roughly two sides, which
was the outline that I suggested to the Select Committee, should enable
us to, at least early on, identify the small group of parents who are
unable to provide an effective education for their child, and it would
be right for the local authority not to simply agree to registration,
but to investigate further. For many of those parents, the demand of
writing a two-page statement will be a sufficiently high hurdle for
them to fall. So they would be unlikely to submit a statement, and some
of the existing provision would enable us to, hopefully, one way or
another, identify the needs of that
child.</div><a name="10012016000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I also believe that a two-page&#151;it says mission&#151;statement,
as part of a simple registration process, is not an onerous burden on
the hands of those parents, the great majority of whom are more than
able to identify in simple terms the needs of their child, set out
their approach to education&#151;I prefer the word 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>&#147;approach&#148; to &#147;philosophy&#148;, which I
personally, and I suspect, many other parents, get a bit scared
of&#151;and to set out simply the building blocks of what they would
be seeking to offer and make available to their child. I do not think
that that is an undue burden.</div>
<a name="10012016000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
debate has been somewhat poisoned by the feeling, which I can
understand, that that kind of structure&#151;the statement and the
registration&#151;is a cover for trying to find out whether the vast
majority of parents are child abusers. I do not believe they are, but I
believe that the proposed system will enable us to make that even more
likely, and hopefully, it would enable us to start to focus the support
on to the needs of home educators that they have long needed. It is an
investment, and it will be costly, but I believe that it would be an
appropriate and valid use of Government money, which in turn would
produce improve outcomes for children and make savings for our
community in the
future.</div><a name="10012016000203"></a>

with a lot of it, but as Paul just said, the trouble is that you are
subjecting all those four groups to an awful lot of paraphernalia that
may be applicable to the tiny majority, as you described
it.</div><a name="10012016000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like go back to something Graham Badman commented on earlier, and
I would like everyone, or as many as would like to, to answer this
question. We have stepped around the safeguarding issue, and you have
now gone on to children&#146;s rights as well. I thought that the
initial analysis was that the criteria behind the proposals were to
secure a good education and safeguarding; you did not want to give a
preference to either one. Now you are saying that it was fashioned in
terms of children&#146;s
rights.</div><a name="10012016000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
said that there were several high-profile cases. There seems to be some
contention over the child protection plans. I asked this question
earlier: what research did you do on how many children who have been
the subject of serious abuse or have been fatalities, and have
therefore been the subject of serious case reviews&#151;making it
quantifiable evidence&#151;were undergoing home education? What are
the statistics on that?</div>
<a name="10012016000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming on to
the children&#146;s rights aspect&#151;perhaps Chloe and Fiona
might like to answer this question&#151;what would the position be if
we were to interview an eight-year-old child, who is being home
educated, and that child says, &#147;I do not want to be home
educated. I want to go to school.&#148; What would happen
then?</div><a name="10012016000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> We need to make it clear that serious case
reviews do not routinely gather the information about home-educated
young people. Therefore it is not necessarily categorised in the
serious case review that that child was a subject of home
education.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000429"></a>Tim

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000430"></a>Tim

do not necessarily list that the child was being home educated. What I
can say to you is that we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>surveyed all the serious case reviews where there was a death or serious
injury in relation to home education, and there were very

write to you. I will not give you figures of which I am not
certain.</div>
<a name="10012016000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">A serious
case review is about the learning experience. It stems from part 8.
Those inquiries resulting in a serious case review are for local
safeguarding boards and local authorities, to determine the lessons to
be learned. What they do not necessarily expose is whether the local
authority has been successful in intervening with children who were
home educated and were the subject of child protection plans before
something happened that was so awful there had to be a serious case
review.</div>
<a name="10012016000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">You would
have to fall back on the figures that I discussed earlier. Does a child
protection plan exist, and is there a disproportionately high number of
them? The serious case reviews are, sadly, for when everything has gone
absolutely wrong. Therefore, I have no means of knowing necessarily
where interventions were taken and things did not go
wrong.</div><a name="10012016000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
go back to the other point about the statistics on education, 81 per
cent. of local authorities estimated that 15 per cent. of the total
higher education population were not receiving any education; 48 local
authorities&#151;that is, 65 per cent.&#151;that responded said
that 482 children were receiving some education, but not full-time
education; 58 local authorities, or 78 per cent., said that 173 were
receiving full-time but not suitable education. I agree with Paul.
There are gradations in how communities operate. At the tip&#151;or,
if you want, the base&#151;are those poor benighted souls who are the
subject of abuse. They are, mercifully, a tiny
number.</div><a name="10012016000219"></a>

Badman:</b></i><b class="B"> </b>Let me talk about the timing. This is
an absolutely truthful and honest answer: I was unaware of that case at
the time of agreeing to do the review. I agreed to do the review just
before I left my last permanent job. During the course of the review,
of course I became aware of the case, as indeed I am aware of other
serious case reviews that are running and some that have taken place
since the review was written. Of course I have taken an interest in
those.</div><a name="10012016000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it would be wrong to say that I was commissioned to do the review in
short order because of that. I was commissioned to do it, as I said
previously, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>because of a mounting body of evidence and concern from local
authorities about a huge number of children, some of whom were not
receiving any suitable form of education, as the figures that I just
read out illustrate, and many of whom they simply did not know about
and were concerned
for.</div><a name="10012016000224"></a>

very hard to know what exactly they meant by that. I know
eight-year-olds who will get in a strop and say that they hate their
parents and want to kill them. You do not take that seriously. Equally,
it could be something serious, but I do not believe that the child
should have the final say in their education, because they do not
necessarily know what is best for them. It is the parent&#146;s duty
to know what is best for the child and do it at all

that?</div><a name="10012016000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Paul Ennals:</b></i> In an earlier question, Mr.
Stuart rightly queried whether the rights of the child were embedded in
this legislation. In fact, in almost all education legislation, it is
not. Education legislation tends to be steered around the rights of the
child more than social care legislation, which is driven much more by
them. The exception is SEN legislation. My understanding of what is
proposed is that the wishes and feeling of the child would be sought,
but that that would not be the deciding factor as to whether
registration would be revoked. Nor should it be. It should be a factor
to be taken into account and, if I was the officer undertaking
it&#151;hopefully, having received the appropriate training&#151;I
would doubtless raise it with the parent by asking them how they wanted
to address the issue that had been raised by their child. But, unless
it triggered any other concerns that, in turn, would trigger existing
social care legislation opportunities, I do not see that the
opportunity for an eight-year-old child to say, &#147;No, I
don&#146;t want to be educated at home&#148; could be seen as a
reason to revoke
registration.</div><a name="10012016000228"></a>

turn to
speak.</div><a name="10012016000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000443"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I want to ask Beth a question, and to look at the
support package side for a moment. Has the National Autistic Society
received representations over the years from parents who thought that
their only option was to withdraw their child from mainstream school
because they were not getting an adequate education? Obviously, you
have expertise on autism. Has that been a common occurrence to the
society?</div><a name="10012016000239"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Beth
Reid:</b></i> Yes. We regularly get calls on our helpline
from parents about whether home education could be an option for them.
Usually, it is because the school or the local authority has not been
able to meet their child&#146;s needs. I do not know whether that is
because they are not equipped to deal with them or they are failing to
recognise the child&#146;s needs in the first place. We hear quite
regularly from families when the school is disputing a child&#146;s
diagnosis. Recently, we had a case of a child who received a diagnosis
from Great Ormond Street hospital. The school refused to recognise that
that child had autism and to put any support in place.</div>
<a name="10012016000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
cases, the problem may be because of severe bullying. We had a call
this morning from a parent whose child was being severely bullied. The
school was providing no support. In that case, the school had actually
advised the parent that they would not be eligible for home education
because the child did not have a physical disability, which was
obviously completely inaccurate. It is a major problem for a lot of our
parents. It is often because of a failure in the statutory services to
meet the child&#146;s needs. That presents a strong case to have
adequate support for those children and for those families who have to
meet educational needs when there are no statutory services that can do
so.</div><a name="10012016000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000444"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Thank you. That is one of Paul&#146;s four
categories. It is one that we should be concentrating on in the
legislation in many ways because, in the past, parents have been turned
down and told that there is nothing for them. Yet suddenly it is a bit
like the spider saying to the fly, &#147;I am going to be really nice
if you come closer.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012016000242"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Beth
Reid:</b></i> Those parents also fall into one of
Paul&#146;s other categories. We sometimes find that parents are told
that they should home educate their child because the school cannot
cope with their child&#146;s needs. That is particularly the case for
autism, but it probably applies to other special educational needs. It
means that the parent is left without any support at all, and that the
statutory services have effectively given up on the
child.</div><a name="10012016000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000445"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> You will obviously agree that it is a high
priority to make sure that there is a package of support for home
education for children with and without statements, with special
educational needs. Do you agree that that should be one of the first
things that is attended
to?</div><a name="10012016000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Beth
Reid:</b></i> Absolutely. There could be benefits in
registration and monitoring, but it very much depends on how that is
framed. The monitoring must be in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>form of support for parents of children with special educational needs.
Currently, it looks like a very one-sided system. Without that support,
the proposals will not make a difference to children with special
educational
needs.</div><a name="10012016000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000446"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> May I ask Paul a different question, and then you
could add anything before we move on?</div>
<a name="10012016000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fiona
correctly said that, at the moment, there is obviously a notification
system if a child is withdrawn from school. As I understand it,
however, the gaps exist if the child moves authority or if the child
has never been to school. I agree that we need to get some idea of the
numbers and I understand that, for Fiona&#146;s group, registration
now has this connotation of all these hoops that you have to jump
through&#151;I understand that entirely. So we will just come back to
pure notification, Paul. Would a pure requirement for notification
actually act as the first filter that you require?</div>
<a name="10012016000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Paul Ennals:</b></i> I am not sure that it would. There has
been a voluntary system until now and the degree to which it has been
taken up is very variable.</div>
<a name="10012016000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
106</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000447"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Compulsory notification?</div>
<a name="10012016000249"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Paul Ennals:</b></i> Okay. I take the point. Well, it might
provide some use, but it is a matter of what comes behind it. If what
you are saying is compulsory notification as opposed to compulsory
registration, there would still need to be something that would follow
from that, unless part of the notification was completing something
that set out your understanding as a parent of the needs of the child
and something about your approach. Unless that was the case, I cannot
see how compulsory notification would act as that first hurdle that
would be required.</div>
<a name="10012016000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
we are still battling with the fact that we have got ourselves in the
position within this debate where an approach that still seems to me to
be a proportionate one is seen as something that is much more draconian
than it needs to be.</div>
<a name="10012016000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me put it
another way. If I was on the Committee, I would want to see the
regulations and guidance in draft form during the Committee stage, to
gain reassurance about what is intended in relation to some of these
processes. I am not sure if those draft regulations and guidance are
yet in place. Forgive me&#151;I understand that a document was handed
out today that I have not had the chance to look at yet. Nevertheless,
I think that some satisfaction should be sought in relation to the
legitimate concerns that are raised.</div>
<a name="10012016000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can I take up
the invitation that Annette gave me, just to add a word on special
educational needs? I strongly support the idea that an important part
of this process should be to enable us to identify more effectively the
way that we can support children with SEN. However, I am not yet
convinced that that will require any changes in legislation. I think
that that would be another issue that could and should be appropriately
covered in the guidance, including the draft guidance. As I have said,
I would encourage you to ask for that draft guidance, if it can be made
available. I am not convinced that a further legislative change would
be required during the passage of the Bill to enable that objective in
relation to SEN  to be met.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000448"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> The question was about prioritisation of actions,
which does not necessarily mean legislation at this stage.</div>
<a name="10012016000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Beth
Reid:</b></i> On that point, we need to be very clear about
the support that people are entitled to. When these parents and
families have been through the statutory SEN system and have still not
been able to get the support that they need through the statement or,
in many cases, even through the tribunal&#151;they may have been to
the tribunal three or four times&#151;we need to ensure that those
parents, families and children are able to get the support that they
need for their SEN in the home education environment. Given that the
statutory system may have failed them already and they have had to seek
legal recourse, we should make it as strong as we possibly
can.</div>
<a name="10012016000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000449"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> One thing that has also come across in the evidence
that we have received is how there are these very different ways in
which local authorities go about dealing with both the voluntary
arrangements and the support that is offered to families. Judging from
some of the information that we have received, it seems that in some
places the situation is very good and in some places it is not so
good.</div>
<a name="10012016000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is there no
way in which this debate can be moved on to a ground where we say,
&#147;Is this an opportunity to try to improve things, both in terms
of notification and support?&#148; It seems to me that doing that
would respond to some of what seem to me to be the justifiable
criticisms that have been made, both today and in the submissions that
we have
received.</div>
<a name="10012016000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> Yes, there is no core of support for home
educators. There is a postcode lottery. I think that the local
authorities make it up as they go along. Judging from the research that
we have done, there is a difference in staffing costs between various
local authorities. It varies. One local authority spends &#163;60 a
year, whereas the average is about &#163;200 a year on staffing costs
and nothing at all on support.</div>
<a name="10012016000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
exceptional to spend as much as &#163;500 on staffing costs, largely
taken up by a person driving to someone&#146;s house, spending time
there, driving back again and doing the same 365 days later. The
support is not there. There is no common agreement about what support
should be offered. We as an organisation&#151;Education
Otherwise&#151;put forward suggestions about what could be done.
There is absolutely no funding; home education has no clout with local
authorities; and it is not embedded in the Department, so there is a
part-time retired head teacher, who is just doing contract work and
gets paid a few hundred pounds to make a visit and write a report. The
bribes and carrots are not there&#151;nothing is there. There are a
few local authorities, which we have drawn the Department&#146;s
attention to, that are making valiant efforts to offer something, but
they do not have any money to do that and it is extremely patchy or not
there.</div><a name="10012016000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a further issue of support, Graham Badman was saying that some home
educators welcomed his report. There was more in the Badman review and
report about support than there is in the Bill that we have in front of
us&#151;there is nothing in the Bill about flexi-schooling, any core
offer or entitlement to support. Support is seen as spending eight
hours informing home educators that they may be able to access some
services. There is not actually anything helpful.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="10012016000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> Just to agree with
Fiona&#151;</div><a name="10012016000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> A
first.</div><a name="10012016000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> It is not a first. There are certain things
that we agree upon. Performance is extremely variable, I accept that.
We put some case studies of good practice in the report. From what I
think was announced by the Minister at the Select Committee, local
authorities will be able to draw down funds, which they can spend upon
the provision of services to home educators. Although not necessarily
within the legislation, there is money following the report. That is
totally
justified.</div><a name="10012016000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind Fiona that there was also an attempt in my report to give home
educators a voice about local authority services in an
authority-by-authority grouping. She has in the past shared with me the
difficulty of getting a consensus voice even within her own
organisation, but it is worth trying, because there is among home
educators something that should be disinterred, to inform how local
authorities carry out their business. There are many references to the
engagement of home educators in, for example, the training of local
authority officers, so they genuinely understand what it is that they
are trying to review, for good
reason.</div><a name="10012016000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
briefly back to special educational needs, if I may, the report clearly
sets out the opportunity for local authorities not simply to provide
the support to sometimes quite specialist needs, but to commission the
voluntary sector to do that. I do not think that they do that
sufficiently and I have said so. I have also raised the
spectre&#151;for example, if a child has been the subject of school
action plus and has therefore had money following the child into the
school&#151;about when the home becomes the place of education. I
asked the question about why the money and services do not follow.
There is much within the report about that continuum of support on
leaving school to be home educated, and I feel strongly that the
voluntary sector&#151;the third sector&#151;should be engaged in
commissioning the support for some of those families, who I acknowledge
are fighting against the
odds.</div><a name="10012016000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Beth
Reid:</b></i> I agree with Graham. I think that children at
school action plus, who have not got the protection of the statement,
very much need to be recognised in the system. Real importance needs to
be placed on specialist training for the different needs we are looking
at. We come across parents who have been accused of being a bad parent,
because their child&#146;s behaviour is not as it should be at
school. In some cases, they have been investigated by social services
for child protection issues, because of a failure to recognise autism
and how it presents within a family, as a child behaves around them. We
need to ensure that those who monitor home education, especially if
there is a child with special educational needs, have training not only
in SEN, but in the child&#146;s specific
disability.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000450"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> Thinking through the practical implications of
the Bill and knowing from the evidence about the attitudes of many home
educators, will the Bill help improve relations, understanding and
co-operation between home educators and local authorities, or is it
more likely to drive an even greater wedge between them, preventing
more support and co-operation? If, when the Bill is enacted, a high
proportion of home educators refuse to comply, which we heard today
might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>happen, and given that the sanctions for non-compliance seem to be weak,
we may end up spending a lot of money to achieve very little. May I ask
Chloe to comment first? I shall then ask other members of the panel if
they would like to add anything.</div>
<a name="10012016000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> Ever since the proposal came out, it has
caused great friction in my area between families and the local
authority. I have had reports from home-education kids across the
country about children and parents refusing to talk to the local
authority. Indeed, in my area, three families within a mile radius
refuse to have any contact with the local authority, because they
believe that it will not follow good practice.</div>
<a name="10012016000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">For instance,
an inspector might change; for years, you have had nice inspections
with someone you know, who has behaved decently, but then someone else
comes in who just ticks boxes and tells you what to do. I have
experienced that personally, as have many home educators. We do not
want to be put in that position, with the risk that someone assessing
you who was not necessarily malicious but who you would not want in
your home could revoke your right to home-educate based on their own
prejudices.</div>
<a name="10012016000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> It goes back again to the question of the
unknown. I say it with Fiona sitting next to me, but I believe that her
membership is about 4,000, so the voice of home educators may not yet
have been heard. I believe that there are substantially more than
20,000 families out there; a huge number of them have not responded in
any way to the report or the discussion of the legislation.</div>
<a name="10012016000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to
your question, I would say that whenever there is a new regulation, it
causes some adverse reaction, even if it is only a speed limit. If
Parliament brings in a process of registration and review, and
accompanies it with the model of training and support that I outlined
in my report, we would still have one of the most liberal regimes in
the whole of western Europe. If you look at the systems that run in
other countries, there is no adverse reaction in France, Scandinavia or
Australia. The Tasmanian system, which I researched, is offered as a
model for home educators; home educators there are involved in
monitoring, and you do not get that reaction at all.</div>
<a name="10012016000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
why you asked the question, but I sincerely hope that you are wrong. It
would be in the best interests of children and their families to try to
embrace the support of local authorities and to encourage them to
monitor and survey what is going on in a more responsible
manner.</div>
<a name="10012016000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> May I comment briefly on that? You said that
we are the most liberal in western Europe, but that takes no account of
America, the most affluent country in the world, which has a much more
liberal take on home education than any other country. It has the
largest home-educating population. Refugees from places in Europe are
bringing their children to England specifically to avoid that. I am
sure that they cannot make a huge outcry in their own area, but that is
because there are not many home educators there. I know two families in
Germany who have literally fled to England to avoid having their
children taken from them or having huge fines imposed, because it is
not liberal enough. They are coming here because it is a haven
and  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>a place in which, at present, we can home educate in peace without
judgment from authorities that really do not have any right or reason
to do
so.</div><a name="10012016000273"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> In Germany, there is no such thing as home
education. It is
prohibited.</div><a name="10012016000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> May I contradict you? I know families who are
home educating in Germany at this
time.</div><a name="10012016000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> Well then, they are doing so outside the
framework of the law, but that is not for me to
debate.</div><a name="10012016000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000451"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is a Nazi law, but never mind. It was passed
by the Nazis in 1938, specifically to stop children escaping the
inculcation of Nazi
propaganda.</div><a name="10012016000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> We agree. That is absolutely the
case.</div><a name="10012016000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the USA, there is no countrywide system. It is done on a state
system&#151;some are very liberal, and some have powers of
intervention. There is no national system. I can tell you that this
report has been picked up by Stanford, which is very interested in it
not least, of course, because of the very high-profile case that is
currently running in America. My claim about other nations is simply to
make the point that, where there is a registration process, there is
not the sort of civil disobedience that you
fear.</div><a name="10012016000279"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> I cannot overstate the fear and
apprehension that home educators are experiencing over the Bill. If it
were to pass into legislation, it would be two years before we will see
any of it. But there are people right now who are hardly sleeping and
hardly able to eat. That has been the case for a whole year, because
they are in dread of what will happen. Whether that would lead to mass
civil disobedience, I have absolutely no
idea.</div><a name="10012016000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
really believe that you will not find home-education support
organisations that will deliver training on how to implement the Bill,
so in respect of all those plans for softening the edges and making it
palatable and home-education friendly, I cannot see where you will find
such people. There are two home-education support charities: Education
Otherwise and the Home Education Advisory Service. They are both
registered charities. They are membership subscription organisations.
They get their funding entirely from member subscriptions. Our members
are not paying ours to help the Government to implement the Bill, so
unless you set up your own home-education support organisation, I do
not really see how you will find home educators to train local
authorities to deliver the Bill, even with substantial amendments. It
will be very
difficult.</div><a name="10012016000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Paul Ennals:</b></i> I recognise the validity of much of what
Fiona says. I am not sure whether it is normal practice for the
Committee to take such factors into account when deciding the best
legislation for meeting the needs of the population that it is
concerned about. I do not think that it should be either. I said
earlier that I really regret the way in which the debate over the past
few months has ended up polarised. It is a real cause of regret that it
is now much more difficult for many people to feel that they can put
forward a public statement about this, because of the abusive e-mails
that they, I and others would receive in those circumstances. Like
members of the Committee, I recognise that that goes with the job, but
not all my colleagues who work in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>sector do. That is why it is much harder to find people working in the
field of children who feel confident enough to come to such sittings to
put propositions that might not be popular with some sections of the
home-education lobby. Over many years, I have worked very closely with
many of them, which is why I particularly regret this and why I
continue to say that we need to find ways of improving the outcome and
support for them. But we should not be using anxiety from some
individuals as an argument in itself for resiling from measures, if the
measures can themselves pass muster in meeting needs. That is a
question for the
Committee.</div><a name="10012016000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
111</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000452"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Sir Paul, I think that this indicates how badly the
whole measure has been handled from start to finish. You cannot blame
members of the public who are unhappy with the things that emanate from
the House of Commons. We have to blame the Government and, I am afraid
to say, Graham Badman, for how the whole matter has been handled.
People&#146;s views about our legislation and proposals are very
valid, and need to be taken very seriously when we
legislate.</div><a name="10012016000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I give Chloe Watson and Fiona Nicholson an opportunity
now&#151;because I do not think they have really had one&#151;to
set out their case why they are so opposed to these proposals? In
particular, would you mind, when answering the question, trying to
incorporate in the answers the issue about safeguarding, which I am
concerned about, and the issue that Graham Badman mentioned, which is
that the home-educated population has twice the rate of NEETs compared
with the population as a whole? Could you broadly set out your case now
as to why you are so opposed to this
legislation?</div><a name="10012016000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> First, I want to make a quick point to Sir
Paul. You are saying that it is the anxieties of a few. I think the
consultation results will come out, and the view was markedly against
the proposals. It is not that home educators are not responding. They
are responding. Sure, not everyone is. That does not mean they oppose
the ones who are responding. Everyone has been able to respond; nobody
has been silenced. So why not listen to the people who know what they
are talking about&#151;the people who are doing the home educating,
who live it, who live with the consequences of what they do? As
parents, you care that your child gets a good education. You cannot
help that as a parent. It is a biological imperative. Why not listen to
the people who are saying, &#147;This will wreck my child&#146;s
life&#148;? Why not take notice of that, over and above the people
who think, &#147;Oh well, maybe in a few cases something might go
wrong&#148;? Until we as home educators are presented with evidence
that there are serious problems with home education that cannot be
fixed within the current system, we are not open to letting people into
our houses to judge us and subject us to all sorts of ridiculous
regulation.</div><a name="10012016000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the regulations, first, the Bill does not actually take account of the
needs of the child, and HEYC is very firmly in favour of the
child&#146;s needs being met, not left in the dust for the sake of
administration. Secondly, the Bill completely changes the balance of
rights between parent and child, and local authority. The rights of
parents and children remain the same to each other, but now local
authorities have powers. It has not given parents or children more
power to get what they want or need. It has not given rights to
children. It has given rights to Government, and it is not what we
want. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>have withdrawn from the system because, for whatever reason, the system
is not what we want. You cannot then turn round and say,
&#147;I&#146;m afraid that&#146;s not good enough. We&#146;re
going to come and inspect you anyway.&#148; That is not reasonable
and we really will not stand for it. I cannot put it any
better.</div><a name="10012016000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> To take the issue of safeguarding, my
organisation&#151;Education Otherwise&#151;has consistently said
that far more non-judgmental support should be available, so that there
is more information about what you are walking into and a lot more
information about what you might be landing somebody else in if you
asked for support, help or any form of intervention for them. That
needs to be in place; it is not there at the moment. The idea that you
could rescue individuals by going to every family and trying to
ascertain which families needed to be brought out or changed is an
incredibly inefficient way to go about
it.</div><a name="10012016000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
you had a system whereby people would come to you&#151;if you had a
system whereby home educators trusted that some good would come of
reporting somebody to social services, for instance&#151;you would be
in a very different position from where we are now. The idea that you
can police people, that you can go to them, that you can inspect their
educational provision, that you can take the child to one side, with or
without a trusted adult, for 10 minutes or half an hour and say,
&#147;Do you have any bruises?&#148; or &#147;Is there anything
you&#146;d like to tell me?&#148; and then go away and think you
have sorted it is just not correct; that is box-ticking. You are not
going to get that from anything that you are doing. You would have to
just put down what is being proposed at present and put in far more
partnership working between home educators, home education support
organisations, local authorities and national Government
representatives, which you just do not have at the moment. </div>
<a name="10012016000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">This entire
Bill has never been tried. All the measures in it are designed so that
people eliminate themselves from inquiries and so that you can still
zero in on individual cases, thinking that you will be able to spot
them and then thinking that you will be able to make a difference when
you have spotted them. Experience shows us that very often a difference
is not made; you identify that a child has needs, you simply record
that a child has needs and then you move on to identify somebody else.
You bury the fact that something needs to be done under a mass of data
about that family and that child. All the serious cases were not
undocumented&#151;there was not a lack of information, but nothing
is  done with it. Services are not joined up and people are not
given the help that they say they want. So you would have to start
doing it in a completely different way, but I believe that it would
start with non-judgmental
support.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000453"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> How do you and Chloe tackle the accusation about the
quality of home education that is leading to these NEET
statistics?</div>
<a name="10012016000290"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> So far, there is no evidence from any
unbiased body that home education is any worse than school education.
It is considered equal or better by all authorities that are not local
authorities. Local authorities have cited the 50 per cent. that Graham
quoted. I strongly believe that it is nothing like that, given
that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>I know thousands of home educators and not one of them has an unsuitable
education in my eyes or their eyes.</div>
<a name="10012016000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, a
local authority is judging by its standards. You cannot necessarily do
that, because that is sometimes just one individual going around the
houses, and what do they know about a child&#146;s individual
circumstances and education? The people who actually know if a child is
progressing and learning things, whether it is reading, writing and
maths, social interaction or tree-climbing&#151;you cannot say as a
local authority that that is education. For a parent, however, that
might be more important and really the final judge cannot be a local
authority that has to tick certain boxes, because we do not actually
have a definitive &#147;This is a good education&#148;. You cannot
say, &#147;This child is having a good education.&#148; We do not
know what a good education is. No one has a monopoly on the means by
which any education may be
achieved.</div><a name="10012016000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
cannot go in saying, &#147;Oh, well, this person hasn&#146;t
learned to read at this age or that age&#148;. You have to look at
the person&#146;s long-term outcomes. If, by the age of 30, they are
happy and earning, you cannot necessarily say before then. Sure, they
might not have learned to read or write until they were 14. I know a
child who was like that and they are now earning a perfectly good wage,
they are a chef and they are happy. What can you say about that? Sure,
if you are going to inspect them, you can say, &#147;Oh,
that&#146;s not good enough. 14 and can&#146;t read? Back to school
with you.&#148;</div>

113</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000454"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> What about your qualifications? Can you tell us what
you
achieved?</div><a name="10012016000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> I personally have been able to get access to
a school to take some exams. I have not taken the full five GCSEs at A
to C that you are supposed to get. I took double science and maths. I
took them two years early and in half a year, and I got A*&#151;top
end of the range. Then I proceeded to do A-level maths and physics,
again two years ahead but at normal speed this time, and I got As in
both of those. I also did GCSE Latin, at the same time as my peers, and
I got an A in that.</div>
<a name="10012016000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has done
me fine, according to my judgment, but I have no English qualification,
no history or geography or art or anything. Yet I am employed. I am an
educational researcher, as I have said. I also tutor in maths, English
and Latin, and I am doing fine for myself, I think.</div>
<a name="10012016000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that my education has been let down in any way, yet technically I
am not able to receive child benefits because currently I am doing
further maths AS-level. I am only doing that one A-level, because I
took the others early. They now say, &#147;Oh, you&#146;re not
having full-time education&#148;, which I suppose is true.</div>
<a name="10012016000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also think
that I am a registered NEET, because  I have not responded to
Connexions; I have not taken any notice of what Connexions is telling
me. I saw Connexions once about possibly going to university. I have
decided against that; I will do Open university. So  I do not
know where I stand on that; I do not know if  I am a NEET
statistic, or
not.</div><a name="10012016000298"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000455"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Colleagues, we have only 15 minutes left. At
least four people want to ask questions, including a colleague who
wants us to move on to clause 28. So  I call the
Minister.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div></div><a name="10012016000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000456"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Chloe, what you just said is very interesting.
Everyone would be delighted by what you have achieved. You point out
some of the anomalies in the system: you are regarded as NEET, when
that clearly seems nonsensical to you and to everybody in the
Committee. However, it is interesting that we could all have the
Government we absolutely dreamed of and there would always be a tension
between the pursuit of what anyone would regard as the public good and
where that butts up against individual rights and individuals&#146;
right to go on in an unfettered way, irrespective of the state and
completely free from state
interference.</div><a name="10012016000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
debate goes on all the time about where that interface should be. At
its extreme, it is easy, but as it closes up, it gets more difficult to
draw the line and the balance. We in Government felt that issues were
coming to our attention, so we asked Graham to conduct a review. We
were not trying to outlaw people or say that things were draconian or
terrible; we were simply conducting a review to find out what was going
on and analyse the numbers and some of the issues.</div>
<a name="10012016000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
consequence of that and some of the things that have been said, none of
us here would question the desire to ensure that we understand who is
missing. There may be people outside the system whom we know nothing
about and who may be suffering in some way that we do not understand or
know. Alongside that are quality issues and, for a very small number,
issues of safeguarding. If the Government step back from that, my
question is whether it would not be an abrogation of
Government&#146;s responsibility to say, &#147;Isn&#146;t this
something that we should try to understand and do something
about?&#148;</div>
<a name="10012016000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
accepting people&#146;s right to educate their children&#151;we
respect that and do not want to undermine it&#151;do not we as a
state also have a right to ask whether we are doing all that we should
to protect young people, understand who is missing and look at the
quality of what is going on? We recognise the right of people such as
you to be home educated and of the people whom Fiona represents to be
home
educators.</div><a name="10012016000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> I am not denying you the right to ask the
question; I am saying that people will not accept you coming into their
homes before you have collected any real evidence. All the evidence
that has been used to justify the measures either is in dispute or has
been overturned in the eyes of home educators.</div>
<a name="10012016000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the abuse
statistics, although I am not personally involved with the project,
freedom of information requests about abuse have been made to all the
local authorities in Britain, and the percentages show that it is
approximately one quarter the rate of national abuse. That is 48
children so far who have been abused in the home educated community,
against 142,000 who are in school.</div>
<a name="10012016000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
that it is not good that there are 48&#151;I was shocked by that,
actually&#151;but I do not believe that the difference between
saying, &#147;There are 48; that&#146;s not very good,&#148; and
saying that we are at higher risk can be just ignored. We were told
that we were at higher risk of abuse than every other child, but
actually it turns out that we are not, according to all the evidence
that we can find. I am afraid that is the only evidence I am willing to
rely on. Evidence for educational achievement has shown in all cases
that home educators achieve well.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="10012016000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until there is
evidence to the contrary that we as a community can accept and
understand and that is not backed up by statistics with which we
disagree, we cannot accept that your changes will be good for us. You
are welcome to inquire and do research into long-term outcomes, but
because nobody really understands how autonomous education works, for
instance, or any one-to-one flexible education&#151;nobody knows why
or how it works&#151;you cannot judge it according to the same
criteria as school education, which is the only way  that the
Government are judging it at present. I am convinced that the only way
to judge education is by the outcome. If home educated children end up
happy and healthy, with a house over their heads, what can we say
against it?</div>
<a name="10012016000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000457"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Would Mr. Stuart and Mr.
Laws put their questions one after the other, and will the witnesses
then respond? After that, we shall have a little time for clause
28.</div><a name="10012016000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
115</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000458"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> This will be a question for Mr. Badman.
We cannot get over the fact that we should get the evidence before we
act. No one disputes the Minister&#146;s point about acting if the
evidence is there.</div>
<a name="10012016000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
consider other similar systems. For instance, Mr. Badman,
you said in your report that New Zealand had demanded that home
educated children be taught at least as regularly and as well as in
registered schools. Why did you not mention the fact that for the
second time in a number of years they decided that their monitoring and
licensing scheme was a waste of time and money and dropped it
altogether? Why did you not mention Ontario, which decided that it was
a waste of time and money? In New Zealand, many people said that it was
similar to the UK and that the incidence of problems was so small that
it did not justify the cost, saying that the money would be better
spent on support than on bureaucracy and
licensing.</div>
<a name="10012016000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000459"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I have two brief questions. The first is to Chloe
and Fiona. Do you accept the Select Committee&#146;s conclusion that
it is unacceptable that local authorities should not know accurately
how many home educated children there are in their areas?</div>
<a name="10012016000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question is for Graham. Is it your view that local authorities have a
responsibility to all home educated children to ensure that their
welfare and safety are secured? Graham, as you have the easy question,
do you want to go
first?</div><a name="10012016000312"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I shall take the easy one. Yes, it is my view
that just as local authorities must have regard to the quality of
education in school so should they have regard to the quality of
education that young people receive at home. I took great pains in the
report to stress that the home is first and foremost a home, but if
people choose to use it as a place of
education&#151;</div><a name="10012016000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000460"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I said welfare, not
education.</div><a name="10012016000314"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I&#146;m sorry. Welfare has a broad
meaning. Local authorities must have regard to the safety of young
people, wherever they are. Welfare is too flexible a word, but I would
take it as meaning safe from harm, safe from abuse; it is something for
which local authorities should have a
function.</div>
<a name="10012016000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000461"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Fiona and Chloe, do you agree with the Select
Committee&#146;s conclusions?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div><a name="10012016000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> I return to the point that I made in
evidence to the Select Committee. I find it surprising that some local
authorities will say that they have no idea how many home educated
children they have in their area. When we went through their
consultation responses, some local authorities said that they felt that
they had a pretty fair idea.</div>
<a name="10012016000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000462"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is it unacceptable that they should say at present
that they do not know? Is that unacceptable to
you?</div><a name="10012016000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> It is not unacceptable to me that they say
it.</div>
<a name="10012016000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000463"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is it unacceptable that that is the situation? Do
you think that local authorities should know the identities of all home
educated children in their areas?</div>
<a name="10012016000320"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> I do not take the view that they should or
should not. I find it surprising that they don&#146;t do so. In 2010,
I find it extremely surprising.</div>
<a name="10012016000321"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> I consider that it should be down to the
parents and children&#151;and the children in particular. I
don&#146;t think that children should be forced to notify somebody
that they are doing a certain thing. If the local authority finds out,
fine, but I don&#146;t think that children should be kept on any
record against their will. They should be able to say, &#147;No
thanks, I don&#146;t want you to keep track of me.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012016000322"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> May I say
something?</div>
<a name="10012016000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000464"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am sorry, but there is very little time. Was
there a response to Mr. Stuart&#146;s
question?</div>
<a name="10012016000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000465"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Graham, New Zealand had a similar system of
monitoring and licensing, but they have just canned it because they
thought it was not worth it.</div>
<a name="10012016000325"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Badman:</b></i> I am not privy to the data that brought about
that decision. Equally, I did not tell you in my report of the success
of the Swedish system or of other systems. It was an attempt to draw
some form of international comparison. I take the criticism that was
levied at me just now, but the report was based on not just the weeks
that I worked on it&#151;it was just weeks, I admit, though a
substantial number of weeks&#151;but the evidence accumulated over a
number of years by local authorities, the NSPCC and Ofsted. It was not
something that was just pulled out of the air, but distilled from a
huge body of
evidence.</div><a name="10012016000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
the line of questioning just now seemed to go was to hark back to a
voluntary scheme. We have a voluntary scheme, but it has not worked.
That is why we are sitting around this table. Candidly, it has not
worked because sometimes the statistics that are used are themselves
abused. I looked at research on the effects of home education, but it
is on a very small scale, and there is little of it&#151;even
Stanford finds it difficult to get that
research.</div><a name="10012016000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
to put one other matter right, in terms of the data that were used, no,
you are not NEET because you have not registered for Connexions. The
Connexions figures were the ones that gave the NEET figures, so those
are the ones that were
known.</div><a name="10012016000328"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> I have met with them, but I have not
responded to any of their letters since I was
14.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div><a name="10012016000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000466"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Just before the lead Minister puts a final
question to our witnesses, I think Tim Loughton wanted to put a
question to Sir Paul Ennals about clause
28.</div><a name="10012016000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000467"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> This seems slightly academic and on a completely
different subject. Clause 28 is about local safeguarding
children&#146;s boards, apparently giving them considerable powers to
request information, the purposes of which are not entirely clear.
There are no examples of what that information might be and for what
purpose, so there are questions about confidentiality if it is on
specific people. Are you aware of what this is aimed at, and the
deficiency that it is aimed at
bridging?</div><a name="10012016000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Paul Ennals:</b></i> I am afraid that I am not aware. I have
not been sufficiently briefed on that, and I have not been party to the
discussions that led to it. Apologies, but I do not feel I can give an
informed
response.</div><a name="10012016000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000468"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Okay.
Pass.</div><a name="10012016000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="10012016000469"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The final question picks up on what David Laws
said. If local authorities are saying to us that they know about 20,000
children, but there may be 40,000 children, is it not incumbent on the
Government to try to ensure that local authorities know how many home
educated children there
are?</div><a name="10012016000334"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Nicholson:</b></i> May I just say that I do not think anyone
can? May I also say this? It is not an answer to your question, but an
answer to a question that I just asked myself. When we arrived in
London this morning, we had the text of the Bill. Since we arrived, we
have been having text messages saying that revised impact assessments
have been published, and when I came here, it turned out that there was
a piece of stapled paper on the table saying, &#147;Clause 26 and
schedule 1&#148; and &#147;Home education policy statement&#148;.
It is not dated and I have no idea of the status of it. I would like to
put on record that we did not have time to read it before the Bill
Committee session, which I find absolutely
extraordinary.</div><a name="10012016000335"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Paul Ennals:</b></i> I will give a brief answer to the
Minister. I think we should find ways of establishing the
information that the Minister outlines. I am not convinced about the
numbers myself but, as has come up frequently in this session, the
population data are not strong. That is part of the problem, and I hope
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>a registration system would genuinely help with that. My own view is
that in addition to the 20,000 who have been identified, I would expect
it to get up to between 25,000 and 30,000, rather than the higher
estimates that I have heard quoted in recent
weeks.</div><a name="10012016000336"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Beth
Reid:</b></i> I agree that it would be very helpful to have
that information. There then needs to be consideration about what you
do with it. It should be used for planning purposes, feedback into
children and young people&#146;s plans and into the children&#146;s
trust, to ensure that appropriate provision is made&#151;particularly
for children with special educational needs&#151;for all home
educated children, so that they get the support that they need from the
local
authorities.</div><a name="10012016000337"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chloe
Watson:</b></i> May I suggest that to find the numbers of
home educated children, it would be good to make contact with the local
authority at least palatable, if not desirable, which at present, it is
not? Families do not want to know their local authorities&#151;they
have nothing to offer, and they have nothing to gain from meeting their
local authorities, just the risk of a school attendance order if they
meet someone who does not like them. Why on earth at present? Because
it is voluntary&#151;to some degree, we cannot deregister&#151;and
people do not want to do it, surely that tells you something more about
the local authorities than the home
educators.</div>
<a name="10012016000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000470"></a>The

for a moment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012016000471"></a>Mr.
