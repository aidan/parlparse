<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have received a letter from Mr. Paul Hadlow, the assistant editor of the Hansard Committee section who has been kind enough to write to me as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Dear Mrs. Dunwoody,
It might interest Members to know that all seven parts of the eighth sitting will be available tomorrow morning. There is a possibility that the last part covering proceedings between 11.25 am and 1 pm will not be available until the afternoon, but the printers are doing their best to ensure its availability tomorrow morning."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That gives me the opportunity to say how grateful we are to the Hansard employees in the House of Commons, who do a remarkable job without much appreciation.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I would not dream of questioning the good faith of hon. Members' endeavours to probe the Bill and the Government's intentions, but there may be more to it than mere probing. It seems that Opposition Members' objections to the clause, which are framed in the amendment, are rather I use a word that they used sinister. I may be wrong, but they seem to think that the Bill should not make as much progress as it could. However, I will let that unworthy suspicion go and deal with the amendments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry will agree that the amendment rests on the words "in good faith". Those words are based on existing employment law in section 104(2) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. If the good faith test was sufficient in the legislation enacted by the Conservative Government, why are Opposition Members now questioning it?
<P>
The history of the words "in good faith" is interesting. Section 29 of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 introduced an automatic right not to be unfairly dismissed for bringing proceedings to enforce any statutory employment rights or for alleging that the employer had infringed such rights. That section is now consolidated in section 104 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I defer to the Minister's legal knowledge, but is she saying that the clause is redundant, because existing employment law states that workers' rights are protected while they pursue them?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman intervened, because that allows me to explain the position. The clause makes a separate set of provisions. I was drawing an analogy and saying that the good faith test is not a new concept. It is a known concept in employment legislation and, indeed, has been used in previous employment law and under previous Administrations. In 1993, when the test was introduced, the Secretary of State for Employment was the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard).
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am afraid that I am not as familiar with the Employment Rights Act 1996 as the Minister, but are we not seeking to apply the test to an area other than that to which it has been applied under the Act? Secondly 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. To what precisely does the in-good-faith test apply in the Employment Rights Act 1996?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Its application is analogous. As I said before, when I quoted from the Act, the test is used basically to deter frivolous and vexatious claims. I understand as I have banished my unworthy suspicion that Opposition Members are probing our intentions. They appear to be saying that this is a completely new test, but nothing could be further from the truth. The test has a history in employment legislation.
<P>
It is quite plain that the good faith test for making such a claim is perfectly sufficient to deter frivolous and implausible claims. No genuinely self-employed person a taxi driver for example will find it easy to claim payment from someone of the national minimum wage. Similarly, if someone is receiving double the minimum wage, it would clearly be silly for that person to submit a claim for payment of the minimum wage.
<P>
I would also point out to Opposition Members that the subjective good faith test must be measured against an objective test of reasonableness. That is a tried and tested principle of our legislation. The test of objective reasonableness that the amendments seek to add would add only to the bank balances of lawyers called on to argue over fine distinctions of meaning. The amendments would not improve the drafting of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am surprised that the Minister asserts, if I understand her correctly, that the in-good-faith test carries with it a test of objective reasonableness, or that claims that are in good faith must also be objectively reasonable. Good faith and reasonableness are not the same.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall repeat what I said. The in-good-faith test is expressed subjectively but it must be measured against an objective test of reasonableness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is absurd.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I hear, Mrs. Dunwoody, that the hon. Gentleman believes that that is absurd. It is not absurd; it is the kind of undertaking that takes place in the courts every day. All kinds of things in criminal and civil law are expressed subjectively but are measured against an objective test of reasonableness. The hon. Gentlemen may well look puzzled, but if they examine our system, that is what they will find.
<P>
I hope that I have managed to convince Conservative Members of my case. If I have not done so, I would urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I hardly think that your hesitation in calling me, Mrs. Dunwoody, arose from unfamiliarity.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would not like it to be thought that we are too familiar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, nor are we contemptuous of one another.
<P>
I was a little disappointed, and almost nettled, by the Minister's suggestion that we should have tabled the amendment without good faith or with unclean hands in proceeding to consideration of what is, or is presented as, a legal point. With the best will in the world, I am not wholly happy with her response. I understand, and I think she is right, that there is a banding of this good-faith test in previous legislation. I also more or less understand that there may be an objective test in that the claim must be reasonable anyway. I think that these two come together in the process of pre-sifting that a tribunal will have to undertake. The Minister is looking a little more quizzical at that, but I am trying to think it out for myself, and it is important that lay people in the Committee should understand it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If I follow my hon. Friend's analysis of what the Minister has said, while she may be absolutely right, in that case is there any reason why she would not accept the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is an incredibly seductive remark, but sadly in my experience there is a propensity for Ministers, maybe from habit, to reject amendments, or for officials to write on briefs for the Minister "Reject", however reasonable the Opposition appear to be. It is usually possible to validate that, at least in the eyes of Ministers and sometimes even to the satisfaction of Committees, by saying that an amendment will cause legal difficulty and that only the lawyers will benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I have been having a conversation on this point and he has an interesting view on it. I put to him another, which is simply stated. It is perfectly possible for somebody to act in good faith, wholly unconscious of his or her unreasonableness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall probably not follow my hon. Friend down that seductive path.
<P>
Let me summarise. We all agree that there is a good-faith test and that it is subjective. The Minster has told us, and for the purpose of the Committee I concede, that there is some kind of objective screen in terms of whether or not the action is unreasonable. To put it another way, if it is not reasonable, the tribunal would be in a position to sling it out, I think. That is a lawyers' argument. I then come on to the real world. We still have a problem with the level of industrial tribunal cases and with the apprehension, particularly of the smaller business, such as the one that I adverted to in moving the amendment, because it does not have the fire power to cope with such situations, however reasonable the employers may be. We also have, and I am troubled by this, the concern of the engineering firms, which is at the other end of the spectrum both of industry and of the nature of employment. Those are typically, though not always, larger firms, the kinds that have personnel departments and lawyers to advise them in house. They particularly ask that this point should be considered.
<P>
We still wish to register our support I hope that I have convinced my hon. Friends for our amendment on the grounds that serious and responsible industrial interests have expressed concern about the point and because we are concerned about the amount of traffic in industrial tribunals even before this new function and activity are added to them. It is on those grounds, by a relatively short head, that I do not seek to withdraw my amendment.
<P>
I invite the Minister to reflect on one matter, and indeed those who read our proceedings, and they will have a good read as a result of the work of Hansard. My observation is based on my experience on other Bills. If the engineering employers or any other representative body can produce specific evidence of the deficiencies of what might be termed the one-shot approach the good-faith test on its own in the Bill I hope that the hon. Lady will treat that as sympathetically as we would.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have already heard about the report of the West Midlands low pay unit. It is a matter of regret that in our excellent progress we have passed over some of the amendments that the unit offered to the Committee. I want to speak briefly on the unit's concern about the clause and to ask the Minister to respond to that.
<P>
The Unit is worried about the absence of a reference to the civil courts in line 34. We have debated at length the twin-track approach through a tribunal or the civil courts. The unit is concerned that workers' protection might be affected if an enforcement officer took civil proceedings against an employer under clause 18(1)(c) through the courts rather than a tribunal. The omission might create a problem, but it would be a technical and, I am sure, an inadvertent problem. There should be no unfairness in the choice between the two routes, which is a matter for the enforcement officer and subject to the acquiescence of the worker.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I would go further than my hon. Friend because and I apologise to him for saying this I feel more strongly about the matter than he does.
<P>
The clause has been amended only by a technical Government amendment. The Minister's reply was characteristically charming, but it was also inadequate. She said that she had unworthy thoughts about the motivation behind some of our amendments. I could have equal and opposite thoughts that the Government are anxious to proceed quickly with the Bill because they want to stifle debate and to enact it before the evidence of the Low Pay Commission is published. I shall, for the moment, try to dismiss such unworthy thoughts.
<P>
The problem with the clause is that it is potentially a rogue employee's charter. We have heard much about rogue employers in our debates over the past few days. The clause is infused with the assumption that the idea of a rogue employee is almost an impossibility. Such an employee would try to work the system and would use the fact that the clause will give him the right not to suffer detriment.
<P>
The Minister must appreciate that there is right and wrong on both sides of the argument. There are indeed rogue employers some workers are badly treated and they deserve legal protection. Labour and Conservative Governments have passed employment legislation to protect their rights but it is foolish and unhelpful to industrial relations to tilt the balance in favour of the employee as far as the clause will do. Along with any good that it will bring will come much bad. The clause states that when a worker's right is infringed it is "immaterial" whether he had that right. It is hard to understand how it could be immaterial. We have already debated the good-faith test. Put starkly, when a right is infringed it simply cannot be immaterial whether or not that right exists. It is a foolish law that tries to make the contrary assertion.
<P>
The Minister said that any problems that occur could be set right at an industrial tribunal. The right not to suffer detriment would be heard before an industrial tribunal. As was said earlier, it is very much a lawyer's argument to say that it is acceptable for all such problems to be sorted out in that way. The lawyers are the people who will benefit. I speak on that matter with less prejudice than almost any other member of the Committee although I am not a lawyer myself, I am married to one. I do not regard lawyers as bloodsuckers. I have sat here and winced at the comments of hon. Members for example, when it was said that there was no such thing as cheap legal advice. I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not discuss the marital arrangements of the hon. Member for Ashford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Precisely not, Mrs. Dunwoody. One should always be straight about any matter in relation to which an interest could be declared. I have no marital interest to declare, but one of my daughters is a lawyer and, even worse or better, depending on one's viewpoint a Government lawyer at that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is all very fascinating and I am sure that it is immensely useful, but can we control ourselves and return to the clause? The Committee may want to know that I have large numbers of doctors and teachers in my family. Any time the Committee has nothing to do, I will happily recite a long family tree, including the employment of all the members of my family. But for now, can we discuss the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am more than happy to return to the clause, Mrs. Dunwoody, and shall mention no more members of my family or the professions to which they belong or, in the case of my children, aspire.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have 10 grandchildren.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was saying that the tribunals will be the end point of the procedures laid down in the clause. It is not satisfactory for the Minister to say that the tribunals will be fair and run by good people so that justice will be done. By then, the disadvantage will already have been made manifest, particularly for small businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On a point of clarification, the members of the appeals tribunal who will deal with[Mr. Ian McCartney]
these matters were appointed by the hon. Member for Solihull in one of his last acts before leaving office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am delighted to hear that and to have my view reinforced that they will not only be good, honest, faithful servants of the state but exemplary lawyers, too. However, my point is that these matters should not go before lawyers. Even if an employer is a victim of the type of rogue employee that I have referred to and has a good case and wins, the damage will already have been done, particularly for a small business. Mostly that damage will be the time involved. A small business is not likely to have the time or financial resources

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was saying when the sitting was suspended that for a small business man I shall reject politically correct language and ask hon. Members to assume that I mean small business person a tribunal hearing as a result of action taken under the clause could conceivably be a complete disaster. I agree that it will not happen very often. However, even if the business man has a good case and is confident that he will win, the time and effort involved will be disproportionate to the time and effort involved for a larger company. It is true that large 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There has been wide debate on the involvement of small businesses and this is a specific clause. The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that it has not been amended, except by the Government. It relates directly to the right not to suffer detriment, and I hope that that is what the hon. Gentleman will address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am addressing the balancing of the right not to suffer detriment with the detriment that would be suffered by the person against whom that right is assumed. My proposition is that the clause is unbalanced, in that it provides too much right on one side and not enough on the other to make it a level playing field.
<P>
I understand that the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry will reply to the debate. Will she address the case of the innocently accused business and acknowledge that the clause is likely to damage such a business? She may say, "Yes, I agree. Nevertheless, an employee's right under the Bill not to suffer detriment outweighs that." That would be an honest response which I would respect, but so far all we have heard is that there can be no possible damage, that there is nothing wrong with the provision. Will the Minister at least acknowledge that the clause tips the balance not only against bad employers but potentially against good employers, which in itself is damaging? Even if she believes that she has the right balance and that the damage is a price worth paying, will she acknowledge that some damage will be done? I look forward to hearing from her on that point.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall deal first with the concern of the hon. Member for Daventry about the twin-track approach, I listened carefully to what he said and I could not immediately see any cause for concern, but, as I appreciate the spirit in which he raised the point, I give him and the Committee my assurance that I and my officials will look at his argument to see whether there is anything in it.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Ashford, the clause protects workers against, for example, victimisation for asserting their rights to the national minimum wage as well as other rights under the Bill, such as the right to access to relevant records. It is right, as I have already said, that the vast majority of employers will comply hon. Members on all sides of the Committee accept that but there will unfortunately be some unscrupulous employers who do not. That is why, if there is to be effective enforcement of the national minimum wage, which is what Opposition Members have been arguing for, we must have this provision, because all workers should be protected against retaliation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister explain whether "detriment" in the clause is to be understood as positive action by the employer which is to the detriment of the employee or merely the admission of an action? In the case of a negative cause of detriment, will it be necessary to show that it was a deliberate failure by the employer?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It can be either. It is unfortunate that some employers exist I stress that they are the great minority who make this provision necessary, but, again, it is not something new. We have done the same for other employment rights and for employment rights enacted by previous Conservative Governments.
<P>
The clause is important in ensuring effective enforcement of the legislation and I commend it to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I will attempt to make briefly a number of points, on some of which I was hoping to obtain clarification from the Minister. As she has already spoken, that may not now be possible.
<P>
Opposition Members' central concern is that the clause protects a worker from detriment, and I take it that the most significant detriment imaginable in this case is dismissal, on the basis that the employer has been accused of breaching the legislation not convicted of breaching the legislation, but simply accused of it. That seems to us to offend the concept of natural justice. On the finding of an officer appointed, a notice will be issued and the employee, or worker, is from that time forward protected from dismissal by the Bill.
<P>
A substantial body of law already exists to protect employees from wrongful or unfair dismissal. The Government are grafting onto that a clause that will make employees or workers subject to a claim under the Bill effectively undismissable. I entirely accept what the Minister said that in many cases employers would be at fault and that employees should be protected but it is not unimaginable that employees could make vexatious claims, which, notwithstanding the good-faith test, could cause a potential injustice to the employer. However, I shall not speak about either of those two extremes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend was right to be careful not to return to the question of good faith, but that bears upon claims to rights under the Bill. However, assertions by workers or employees that they have suffered detriment are not subject to that in-good-faith test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point and further emphasises our concerns about the matter.
<P>
It seems extremely unfair and disadvantageous to the employer that, if the employer and employee are already in dispute, the clause effectively prevents the employer taking routine disciplinary action against an employee. In the real world, human nature being what it is, it is likely that an employee would make a vexatious complaint if matters in the workplace had come to the stage where dismissal or disciplinary proceedings were imminent.
<P>
I also submit that there is no symmetry between worker and employer in the clause. The employer is effectively paralysed from the moment the procedure begins, and is unable to discipline the worker for any offence. I do not want to give a ludicrous example, but an extreme example will illustrate that nothing can prevent the employee resigning during the process. There is a lack of symmetry and a lack of balance.
<P>
Another worry is that clause 21 extends the provisions of clause 12 to persons who are not employees. The Minister will doubtless make her case for the provisions of the clause in relation to employees. Although we may quibble with the outcome, we are in broad agreement that employees need to be protected from being victimised because they have been attempting to exercise their rights under employment protection law. Indeed, as the Minister pointed out, those protections already exist in other employment law.
<P>
However, the Bill breaks new ground. It will impose the same limitations on an employer in relation to workers who are not employees. For example, if an employer as defined in the Bill asks someone to do piece work and assemble 3,000 widgets at home, that is a contract. We shall not dispute the fact we have voted on the matter, and it has been accepted that such a person will be deemed to be a worker and therefore subject to the legislation. Under such a contract, which is not an employment contract, one party will become subject to a prohibition and, by virtue of clause 21, be unable to terminate that contract.
<P>
The Minister may want to correct me if there are examples of employment law covering contracts that are not employment contracts elsewhere, but I am certainly not aware of any such examples. It seems a dangerous development, especially as no judicial or quasi-judicial body has heard evidence or made a finding of "guilt" against any party. Clause 22 is different; but clause 21 does not require a finding by any judicial or quasi-judicial body.
<P>
The clause provides a good-faith test for the actions of the employee; but an employee acting in good faith may still be problematic. What I have said in relation to other clauses is germane to clause 21. The Bill does not require workers to keep records relevant to the position under consideration, nor does it allow an officer to intervene on behalf of an employer, who may be a sole trader, even if he feels that it would be just and right to do so. For example, an employee may have lied about his age and persuaded an employer that he is over the age of 26 and thus subject to the minimum wage under regulations to be made under the Bill, a worker under the age of 26 would not be entitled to that minimum wage. However, the Bill gives no power to an officer to intervene on behalf of the employer if the employer is the wronged party.
<P>
Our worry is that clause 21, taken with those parts of the Bill that we have already debated, will have a cumulative effect that is extremely disadvantageous to the employer, particularly the small employer. He must pay up when a notice is served on him; he is presumed to be guilty; and if he wishes to clear his name, he must stand the cost, the time and the effort of mounting an appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am listening to my hon. Friend's argument with close interest and considerable anxiety. Is my hon. Friend saying that, as a result of clause 21, there is a serious danger that employers will cave in rather than go through the legal process, for fear that it would be a disaster that it would be better to capitulate at the outset because of this vexatious clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Again, as we have said previously, it will not cause large employers to cave in in the face of cumulative pressure. However, the small employer with limited resources and a limited capacity to deal with such issues will suffer the cumulative effect of having to pay up when a notice is served, of being presumed guilty, of having to find the cost of proving his innocence on appeal, and then having severe restrictions imposed upon him under clause 21.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered that the mere fact of having to appear before an industrial tribunal would severely affect a business's reputation, particularly locally? Many small businesses make the bulk of their profits locally and their business depends on reputation. The mere fact of appearing before a tribunal will damage it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand my hon. Friend's point, but I fear that I would be straying out of order if I replied to it, so I shall not do so.
<P>
The prohibition in the clause is the straw that may break some employers' backs. For the small employer, it will result in paralysis and a total fear of dealing with his employee under any of the normal disciplinary procedures while a complaint is extant under the Act. The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry frowns, but the understandable reaction of the small employer who faces sanctions if he breaches this prescriptive clause will be to freeze in fear.
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In relation to subsection (4), does my hon. Friend agree that it is well established in existing legislation that employees with the benefit of fixed-term contracts may waive their employment rights? Why is a distinction drawn between detriment that may or may not result in the dismissal of employees with fixed-term contracts? Does that concern my hon. Friend as much as it concerns me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I must confess to my hon. Friend that I have not considered that important point in detail. I hope that other of my hon. Friends can contribute something on it.
<P>
If I may make the point that I have tried three times to raise, the effect of the clause on employers has to be seen cumulatively. The clause may be the final straw that breaks the camel's back. It is unnecessary because there is plenty of provision in existing employment law to protect employees from being victimised for attempting to access their legitimate rights.
<P>
Finally, industrial tribunals or employment tribunals as they are now to be known are heavily burdened at present. It may take a long time for them to hear cases. The clause places prohibitions on employers and prevents them from carrying out their normal day-to-day discipline activities in relation to their employees. It is, therefore, more important than ever for tribunal cases to be heard promptly. Will Ministers tell the Committee whether additional resources will be made available to the tribunal system to deal with the case work that the Bill will impose when it is enacted? Will the Government make resources available in recognition of the fact that it will become more important for actions and tribunal hearings to be dealt with speedily because of the effects of clause 21?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friends have dealt with most of the issues, but one remains. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry averted to it, but it would repay us to consider it more carefully because it concerns quite a distinct point.
<P>
We have heard the Minister's response to the initial aspects of the debate. The Government are resting heavily on the Employment Rights Act 1996 and seek to justify the provisions in the clause by analogy with it. They are, indeed, resting on that Act in the enforcement of the rights in the Bill.
<P>
Let me explain my interpretation of clause 21(4) so that the Minister can determine whether it is correct. Clause 23 deals with unfair dismissal for all classes of employees other than those on fixed-term contracts. The Employment Rights Act 1996 does not offer redress for unfair dismissal for people who are on fixed-term contracts. The Government intend, however, to provide a remedy for perceived detriment, including such unfair dismissal. Subsection (4) is, therefore, intended to bring those people back under the provisions, as is clear from the notes on clauses.
<P>
Why do the Government think that a remedy for detriment, including a claim of unfair dismissal, should be given to people on fixed-term contracts, as distinct from the provision of the 1996 Act? As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made clear in his short intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, it is a well-established fact that when people enter into a fixed-term contract, they may effectively waive their employment rights. Under the Act, sex discrimination an important aspect of law is not provided for in relation to unfair dismissal cases that involve fixed-term contracts. In the Bill, that does not apply. The Government have chosen to go further, and to set aside the precedent of the 1996 Act. They have proposed that such unfair dismissal claims should be possible.
<P>
That is an important distinction, and it is potentially damaging. The point of fixed-term contracts is that they are premeditated and that they are based on an expectation that the term in question will end. Even if the reasons given by an employee about why the fixed-term contract is not renewed or extended are spurious or arbitrary

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making interesting points. I remind him that the matter is narrowly drawn, although the clause is complicated. As is clearly stated, the clause is about
"Rights not to suffer ... detriment",<P>

<P>
which is a narrow concept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. As I understand it, the right not to suffer detriment includes unfair dismissal claims. That right would not do so under fixed-term contracts without subsection (4). Subsection (4) has introduced unfair dismissal as a detriment into the ambit of fixed-term contracts. It is germane to the clause to point out such an unusual extension, which differs from the 1996 Act.
<P>
I have little more to say about the point. I hope that I have made it clearly. The principle involved is that the entry of employers and employees into fixed-term contracts, which is clearly premeditated, will pre-date the suffering of detriment. Given the expectation of the contract ceasing, that extension of employment law is unusual and alarming.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> As I understand it, the provision applies only to fixed-term contracts of one year or more. Does my hon. Friend agree that the extension of rights not to suffer detriments to such contracts will lead to a distortion? Many nine-month, 10-month or 11-month contracts will be granted, under which the arbitrary right will not be available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. In my short and inadequate attempt to summarise the purpose of subsection (4), I neglected to make that point. I hope that few employers who establish a fixed-term contract will feel so alarmed at the implications of the clause that they will vary their normal business in such a way. I understand my hon. Friend's point, but I hope that it would not be as potentially damaging as that.
<P>
To interfere with fixed-term contracts to the point where a tribunal could extend a contract contrary to what was obviously both parties' intention before any detriment ever occurred is damaging.
<P>
If falls to the Minister to explain why, having rested on the Employment Rights Act 1996 in so many other respects, the Government now seek to go beyond it and offer a different solution for fixed-term contracts.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I will dispense with further comment on the likely impact on the number of cases being heard by industrial tribunals and the potential consequences for small employers, because you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and the Committee may have heard quite enough about that.
<P>
The Committee should consider the operation of the clause. My perusal of the notes on clauses suggests that there is a broad attempt to provide an enforcement mechanism for persons with a contract of employment through the industrial tribunals. Similar safeguards against detriment will be available to people with quasi contracts those who are without a contract of employment but are covered by the national minimum wage at a tribunal.
<P>
Will that operation result in the same consequences in practice for those with contracts of employment and those who have other arrangements but are subject to the national minimum wage? No distinction is intended. The Minister of State nods, but a comment would be helpful.
[Mr. Boswell]
<P>
There is slight asymmetry a phrase that we have used before between the treatment of detriment and the enforcement of rights under an enforcement notice. The provision appears to be tied to the employment tribunal, as we must learn to call it, rather than to the county court. In one case it will be possible for a worker or an officer, on his behalf to go to the county court, but in the other, matters could be referred only to an industrial tribunal. An administrative absurdity could arise, in which an employee could assert a right to the national minimum wage in the county court but would be confined to an industrial tribunal when asserting a separate case relating to detriment.
<P>
I realise that that situation would not be common, and that complex crossover problems could arise if the employee were able to resort to the county court in the latter circumstance. However, I hope that the Minister will clarify that untidy dissimilarity.
<P>
A related matter a lawyer pointed it out to me, but I hope that the Committee does not think that invidious is that the provision puts a top limit on the compensation payable. The national minimum wage might be œ10,000 a year we still do not know and people claiming it might find that compensation is limited by their inability to go to the county court.
<P>
There are questions also about the universality of the national minimum wage in relation to the clause. The framework for people who lose their jobs is fairly fixed, but the clause seems to affect the structure for casual workers. It is difficult to work out what should be considered continuous service. A tribunal would have to decide on the facts in each case, but problems could arise in relation to intermittent employment. The provisions covering compensation for employees and quasi contracted workers are rather double-headed, as there is a basic award and a compensatory award. The application of the basic award to casual workers could have perverse effects. It may be better if those workers have access only to the compensatory award subject to whatever overall limit the Minister considers appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, although the clause provides that employees, or those treated as such, who have suffered detriment should be compensated to the extent of their lost earnings, there is an inappropriate sense of penalty attached to compensatory awards?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is right. The principle of the clause should be simply to ensure the recovery of lost earnings.
<P>
These are complex legal matters, and I am not entirely au fait or comfortable with them. Some of the interpretations that I have questioned may be considered to be lawyer's points, but we are anxious to achieve parity of treatment between people with a contract of employment and those with no contract, but with other arrangements that enable them to avail themselves of the legislation; secondly, whether there are anomalies between action in the county courts as against action in a tribunal; and thirdly, whether there is a distinction between the basic award and any compensatory amounts. The latter could have an uncovenanted effect with regard to the level of compensation payable and might give rise to suspicion that there had been a penalty, as opposed to a simple replacement of loss. I would be grateful if the Minister of State or the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry would consider those points.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to make a couple of brief points which follow on from the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.
<P>
I repeat that I am not a lawyer, and the clause seems extraordinarily complex. Its architecture, if I may use the term, makes it difficult to follow. I therefore throw myself on the mercy of the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, who understands these matters and may be able to offer clarification when she replies.
<P>
I want to focus primarily on the situation of a worker who is not an employee taking action under the clause. I am happy to stand corrected if I am wrong, but it seems that it is a novel extension of employment protection law to use an employment tribunal and the Employment Rights Act 1996 to provide the means to deal with a contractual situation that is not an employment contract.
<P>
There seems to be a trend for statute increasingly to intervene in contracts. In employment law, for example, the European agency directive places statutory limitations on the freedom of two parties to contract together and seeks to impose statutory terms on such contracts which would override any negotiated terms.
<P>
My concern is that the mechanism of the basic award for unfair dismissal under subsection (4)(a), which will be the basis on which any compensation award is made, is itself based on a concept of weekly pay. It is thus entirely designed to deal with employees. How will it be used effectively to deal with the case of someone who is a worker but not an employee? The contract that is at the heart of such a dispute could be complex, in that it might deal with items other than the simple use of time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend in mid flow, but his case is stronger than he thinks. It is not just that basic awards will be based on weekly pay if I am wrong, I am sure the Minister will correct me but they will also, at least in part, be based on length of service. That would clearly be inappropriate for casual workers, who are not in permanent employment with one employer, as the clause supposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I would urge my hon. Friend not to underestimate my opinion of the strength of my case, but I take his point. It reinforces my argument that the mechanism seems wholly inappropriate for determining the basic award for someone who is not an employee.
<P>
The Opposition would be extremely grateful if the Minister would explain how the tribunal is to deal with a contract which might include, for example, the provision of the space in which work is done in the case of piece work done at home as well as payment for time expended on the work. Moreover, how would it deal with the length of service provision which underlies the calculation of the basic award?
<P>
The clause also provides for compensation for a worker who has suffered detriment. It is strange that compensation will be paid as opposed to lost earnings being reimbursed when compensation will not be provided for a worker who has suffered deliberte underpayment of the minimum wage. What are the Minister's thoughts on the asymmetry between the clause and the rest of the Bill in respect of workers who have suffered a genuine wrong but are not entitled to compensation?
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I intended to make three points but, following my hon. Friend's speech, shall make two only.
<P>
The first relates to industrial tribunals, which will be the vehicles for the enforcement of workers' rights. The Bill is at best ambiguous; I hope that the Minister can reassure me that regulations will clear that up. For example, tribunal jurisdiction the awards that can be given is limited in breach of contract cases to œ25,000. Will there be special limits for industrial tribunals? Will they apply the rules used in all other cases under employment protection legislation for Great Britain or the specific legislation for Northern Ireland, or will there be special limits in minimum wage cases?
<H4><center>[Mr. Peter Atkinson in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
The matter is of interest not just financially, but in terms of whether the wider court system will become involved. Above the œ25,000 limit I pause to bid farewell to Mrs. Dunwoody and to welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, the Chair claims must but be brought in the High Court.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am the night shift.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us whether concurrent jurisdiction involving, perhaps, the county court and the High Court will be permissable? I do not know whether it will be or whether it would be appropriate. If that will not happen, why not?
<P>
Subsection (5) deals with circumstances in which
"the worker has been working under arrangements which do not fall to be regarded as a worker's contract for the purposes of 
(a) the Employment Rights Act 1996, or ... the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996"<P>

<P>
Labour-only subcontracts, where A contracts with B who subcontracts to C, are particularly relevant. The problem lies in establishing primary liability. One assumes that whichever employer along the chain was regarded as being primarily liable for the underpayment would be brought before the tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Has it occurred to my hon. Friend that while the Bill can be used by an underpaid worker to bring an action, it could equally be used by someone who had not been paid at all as an alternative route for redress?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That interesting point had not occurred to me. Clearly, a person who has not been paid for work done is not being paid the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would not the determination as to whether the national minimum wage were payable depend on whether a contract of employment, or its equivalent for the purposes of the 1996 Act, was in force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I am not trying to curtail debate, but the clause deals specifically with detriment. Conservative Members are talking about clauses that have been passed already that dealt with the entitlement to the national minimum wage of people whose employers do not pay it. We seem to be going backwards.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister will know that the Chair keeps a careful eye on proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that, Mr. Atkinson. The points that I have made about subcontracting are specifically relevant to subsection (5), which deals with work that constitutes a contract. A good deal of labour-only subcontracting goes on and a worker may not be sure with whom he has a contract.
<P>
The clause covers enforcement, through industrial tribunals, of the right not to suffer detriment. Such a tribunal must know who is guilty and not act against the wrong person. Primary liability must be established before a legal action can succeed. The clause gives no guidance as to where that primary liability might lie. [Interruption.] It is perhaps appropriate at this time of night to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham is moonlighting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would not it be more accurate to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham is engaged on two simultaneous employments, for neither of which is he being paid at the margin? Just now he is contributing to an important Adjournment debate on the Floor of the House about Stoke Mandeville hospital.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Ashford will not continue with that diversion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I have no intention of so doing, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
The Minister looks puzzled: has he considered the point that I have just made? Where does primary liability lie in subcontract cases? If that is not clear, how will the clause provide satisfactory redress for workers?
<P>
Many claims made under the Bill will come from agency staff. As many home workers and piece workers are employed by agencies and not by the ultimate employer, who will be liable in cases brought by such workers, the agency or the ultimate employer? There may be a chain of two or three barriers between an aggrieved worker and the ultimate employer responsible for underpayment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Another thought has just occurred to me. In labour-only subcontracting, the intermediary may be prevented by clause 21 from dismissing a worker. What happens if his contract is in turn terminated by the superior employer? He is saddled with the worker whom he cannot dismiss for fear of the effects of clause 22, but has no contract under which to generate the remuneration to pay that worker.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely good point. I had worked out the unfairness in one way, but not in the[Mr. Green]
other. In one way, the potential unfairness is that the ultimate employer may be held primarily responsible. He may have tried to carry out checks, but for reasons of genuine oversight, rather than complacency or incompetence, he may not have known that workers were being illegally underpaid further down the chain. There would seem to be a degree of unfairness in prosecuting him. As my hon. Friend noted, however, somebody halfway down the chain may find himself holding the baby and taking responsibility. He may have no means of redress against the person further up the chain.
<P>
All those points suggest a serious level of deficiency in the clarity and scope of the clause. In many cases, it is not clear where responsibility will lie in practical terms. Broadly speaking, we know that industrial tribunals will be the vehicle for enforcement, but it is not clear whether they will exercise the same powers and impose the same limits and fines as they do in normal employment cases. If there is a 100 per cent. read across and they exercise the same powers, the Minister should tell us where the intersection with the wider court system comes in.
<P>
We have heard much about simplicity being the virtue of the minimum wage as the Government have presented it. This clause and many others demonstrate, however, that there is huge complexity in the nitty gritty. Perhaps the Government have not considered that; perhaps they have failed to report that to the Committee and prevented hon. Members from seeing through them; or perhaps they are simply trying to hide the complexity from us for some sinister reason. I reject the last interpretation for the moment and say merely that I hope that the Minister appreciates that there are genuine difficulties with the clause and will talk us through them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> In the debate, hon. Members have struggled purposely to find an indication that the Government have not done their homework and have not tried to ensure effective enforcement. Some specific issues have, however, been raised and I shall try to deal with them.
<P>
First, there seemed to be some confusion at the outset about the distinction between an employee and a worker. The definition of an employee is limited to those who have a contract of employment; the definition of a worker is wider. The Bill goes wider than simply referring to the worker that is why we have clauses 31 and 32. I do not want to discuss those before we get to them, but they are intended to ensure maximum coverage for the national minimum wage. That was the commitment that we gave. The purpose is to give wider emphasis to the definition of those with a direct, implied or other form of contractual arrangement with an employer.
<P>
A worker who is not an employee and who has been dismissed and claims that that dismissal is an unlawful detriment cannot recover more than a worker who is an employee can for unfair dismissal. That answers the point made by the hon. Member for I am sorry, but I cannot remember his constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am sorry, but I must be going deaf. I did not hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I appreciate that it is not your fault, but I have been the victim of collective amnesia. Your predecessor forgot my name, and the Minister has forgotten my constituency. Is that the precursor to the moment when, in the same way as the unfortunate Mr. Dub\ccek, I shall find my desk moved further and further along the Room? It may eventually disappear altogether, and I may be sent to manage a forest in outer Slovakia.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am sorry. I should have realised that the hon. Gentleman was the hon. Member for Daventry. I was once in a car crash in his constituency. The car was a write-off, as were my neck and my thumbs for some weeks. My only experience in the hon. Gentleman's constituency was unhappy. He might wish to know that the damage was not caused by a constituent of his, but by a constituent of the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). Three months later, the magistrates court at Northampton gave him a hefty fine and banned him from driving.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mrs. Dunwoody has only just left the Chair, but order should be maintained.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise. I am probably the first Minister to be accused of filibustering during debate about his own Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised the issue of statutory rights and overlapping. Statutory rights overlap other civil remedies. That is not novel it does happen. There is little that can be done about it; the system should cope with it reasonably and with common sense.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point is unrealistic. A contract claim for reimbursement of a non-payment of wages can be dealt with at a county court, and an unlawful reduction of wages can be dealt with before a tribunal. In practice, that will probably not happen, because double recovery is not possible. If such a case were to go before a court, the court would probably adjourn the outcome, to ensure that one specific jurisdiction had been selected. It would not normally be in a worker's interests to pursue a case in two different jurisdictions. The hon. Gentleman's point was interesting, but in practice there is no such difficulty or problem with clause 22.
<P>
Under the Bill, a worker can recover underpayment before a tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister asserts that it would not be to a worker's advantage to take a case before two different jurisdictions. If a worker were receiving an enforcement officer's free advice in one jurisdiction, why would it not be to his advantage not to pursue the case concurrently, but at least to set the wheels in motion, because the procedures involved would all potentially cause expense for the employer?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Clause 22 is about the enforcement of a right not to suffer detriment in relation to claiming the national minimum wage. That detriment includes the unfair dismissal of an employee. The clause deals with people who wish to claim their right to receive a national minimum wage. It does not raise other issues concerning unfair practices in the workplace.
<P>
The clause enables workers to complain to an industrial tribunal if they think that they have suffered a detriment that breaches clause 21. Other cases of unfair dismissal are covered by clauses 23 and 24. The employment tribunal involved will have three members. That mirrors the current best practice.
<P>
Several hon. Members raised the issue of compensation levels. It may help them if I say a brief word about compensation. In cases in which the normal limits apply, the maximum amount of compensation that can be awarded for unfair dismissal is œ11,300. A basic award at a maximum of œ210 can apply to up to 30 weeks, making a maximum amount of œ6,300. Other additional awards are provided for, for re-engagement and reinstatement when that is not complied with.
<P>
A point has already been made about the fact the compensation levels are set down in statute. Under current legislation, there is no ceiling on compensation for cases of detriment excluding unfair dismissal. For cases of dismissal of a worker who is not an employee, the Bill pegs compensation to the same level as for employees with unfair dismissal cases, where the maximum award is limited. There is no qualifying period of employment before which the right can be exercised. That is because we want to ensure that workers who assert their right to the national minimum wage are protected from retaliation from day one.
<P>
There is no limit on compensation for victimisation but there is for dismissal. Individuals can be compensated only for what they have lost. In cases where someone has suffered detriment other than dismissal, he will, by definition still be working. He is therefore unlikely to have lost much financially and so there is no need to limit compensation.
<P>
I ask my hon. Friends to support the clause. There will be employers who, on occasion, will try to prevent an employee from seeking the right to the minimum wage. It is important that when that happens, the employee has a right to take action to secure that wage.
<P>
We have all had experience over the years of people working in places where bad employment practices are followed. When those people try to seek their statutory rights, they suffer actions against them. Sometimes they are subject to physical harassment; sometimes employees are sacked or they fail to receive proper training or opportunities to advance in the workplace. That is wrong, and I hope that hon. Members will therefore support the clause.

</FONT>Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall make brief comments, one more substantial than the rest, on points which give rise to concern.
<P>
First, proposed new section 104A(1)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 refers to an employer being
"prosecuted for an offence under section 28 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 as a result of action taken by or on behalf of the employee".<P>

<P>
I have two concerns. If the employer was acquitted, no detriment could have occurred. The employer would leave the court without a stain on his character, and[Mr. Boswell]
might have enhanced his reputation. That chimes in with my second concern, which relates to the words
"action taken by or on behalf of the employee".<P>

<P>
An enforcement officer could be acting on evidence provided by a third party "I don't think I should tell you this, but you might like to know that Mr. X is underpaying Fred" which was unavailable to the employee. The enforcement officer's inquiries may show that Fred does not care about being underpaid, is itinerant or has ceased to work at the firm. A third party could act on behalf of such an employee to enforce his rights, but no detriment would arise if the employer had nothing to do with that. Such a case should be excised before inquiries even begin.
<P>
My second point relates to proposed new section 104A(2) of the 1996 Act. Our old friends the words "good faith" appear. Because I like to hear it so much, I should like the Minister to repeat the assurance that, despite the fact that "good faith" is a subjective test, an objective test of reasonableness will kick in. That would not remove my concerns about the likely impact of enabling employees to assert rights some may intend to victimise their employers or may be irresponsible but the Minister's assurances always cheer me up even though I am not always convinced by them.
<P>
The third concern is a fresh point. Some of my hon. Friends who are more expert in employment law may wish to comment. Subsection (2) of the clause would insert a test of redundancy into section 105 of the 1996 Act. That might seem reasonable at first, although there are always evidential problems when there is more than one test. Clearly, there will be open and shut cases, but in others unfairness will be less easy to determine.
<P>
I am worried about the defence that an employer could reasonably adopt at a tribunal. An otherwise decent employer in a low margin trade may offer relatively low rates and be unable to pay the national minimum wage and perhaps we will know how much that will be before we end discussion of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> But not of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, but what course of action would an employer in the circumstance that I described take? If some employees are made redundant, would those dismissals be considered to be redundancies for economic reasons or for breach of the provisions of the Bill? The Under-Secretary has clearly considered that problem.
<P>
The important point is that an employer can mount a defence in redundancy cases but not in cases involving breach of rights under the Bill. Those would be open and shut cases. The result could be that, regardless of the facts, as the lesser of two evils employers would dismiss for redundancy because they could get legal protection. It would be difficult for the courts to sort out that problem. In cases of doubt, will they be able to make a ruling, or will two cases have to be dealt with sequentially?
<P>
An employer with a temporary cash flow problem faces a difficulty with the continuity of employment rules. Dismissing an employee will break that employee's length of service, and employees must have two years' service before they can claim for unfair dismissal. There is a problem, for example in the hotel trade, that people will be constantly dismissed and then re-engaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend, but does not clause 23(3) cover claims for unfair dismissal under the Employment Rights Act 1996, for which there is no qualifying period for a claim? The two-year period does not apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that the Minister is nodding agreement. No hon. Member wants people to suffer a series of engagements or dismissals on grounds of redundancy simply because that is a more attractive option to employers than a one-shot risk in relation to the national minimum wage. That applies from the first hour of employment or whatever the pay reference period is. Employers, particularly in temporary and fluctuating trades, will be sensitive about the issue. If the provisions work in the way that I have outlined, an employer might dismiss somebody before the two-year period has lapsed rather than build up a record of unfair dismissal. He would not want to get involved in unfair dismissal cases because he would be frightened of the national minimum wage clauses. That would create a difficulty.
<P>
I do not have a final view on the matter. I suspect that it needs some elucidation from the Minister, and I would be grateful for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has argued lucidly and persuasively that there are deficiencies in the clause. I want to add some different points.
<P>
We are dealing not with workers who are not employees, but with those who are. We are in the business of introducing the relevant provisions in the Bill into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and bringing them under its protection, rather than extending it, which was achieved in clause 22.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was wrestling with the complex legal concepts. To avoid doubt, I should have said that Conservative Members had no problem with inserting the concept into the Employment Rights Act 1996. It is simply a matter of getting the provisions of the Act to bite even-handedly and without perverse effects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I think that we are proceeding on a common understanding of the matter, even judging by the Ministers' response to the little exchange that we had a moment ago. We understand what the clause is intended to do; the question is whether it will do that in the right way.
<P>
On redundancy cases, clause 23(2) would make it unfair to select an employee for redundancy because of the application of the national minimum wage. I do not want to replay the arguments about whether that is right, but it is clear that employees who were paid less than the national minimum wage before implementation of the Bill will have to be paid the national minimum wage afterwards. We can reasonably assert this has not been contradicted in any realistic way in the debate thus far that the value to the employer of such employees will not necessarily rise. There may, therefore, be a gap in economic terms between the productivity and the value that accrues to the employer from a given worker, employee or set of employees. In consequence, when that employer is in difficulties, he may choose to make redundant those employees who make the least net additional contribution to the gross margin of the company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I want to urge my hon. Friend not to forget the important economic principle of the McCartney curve, which is an upward-sloping labour demand curve. It shows that, as wages rise, the demand for labour will increase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, it is an interesting observation that the Minister of State has added a principle to that of superior goods carrying a premium price. Apparently, if one raises the price of labour, people demand more of it. In that case, why not go to œ10 and try to employ everybody? I shall not digress, Mr. Atkinson; I should remain firmly rooted in a discussion of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I should be grateful if my hon. Friend helped me back to discussing the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I do not think that my hon. Friend requires my help. I wish to boil the issue down. Is he telling the Committee that, in practice, an employer could be done for making redundant an employee whom he could not afford to retain? The employer would suffer as though he were dismissing someone for asserting an employee right when he was doing nothing of the kind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes. My hon. friend uses technical language.
<P>
An employer may, as in the past, go through an appropriate employment legislation mechanism to identify employees who should be selected for redundancy. There may have been no sexual or other discrimination, but there could be conflict between the economic grounds for redundancies and the application of the national minimum wage. Employees receiving more pay than previously or more than the employer feels that they are worth might have been selected for redundancy on economic grounds, but the employer could be accused of using redundancy as an excuse to eliminate workers paid under the minimum wage provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In the real world, employees who were claiming against small or medium-sized employers would be exempt from redundancy. The employer is bound to take the course of least resistance. Faced with the need to make 10 out of 30 employees redundant, he would not make himself liable to action by choosing an employee who was making a claim. Is not that grossly unfair to employees who are not engaged in such a process? They are correspondingly more liable to be made unjustly redundant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. That problem may occur particularly in the early years. Employees who were paid less than the minimum wage will think that they occupy a protected position, as my hon. Friend said. They will be able to claim that they have been selected for redundancy or dismissal because the employer had to pay them more, even though there may be valid competing reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered a further effect? Subsection (2) covers the motives for an employee complaint. Employees dismissed for good economic reasons say genuinely believe that they have been unfairly dismissed. They have only to show a tribunal that they have claimed in good faith, but they may be wrong. Unnecessary damage to the employer might in turn result in loss of profits and further redundancies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes. My hon. Friend is right to reinforce the point. Subsection (2) may hit employers by forcing them to select for redundancy. It may also give rise to vexatious claims from employees near the minimum wage level who are dismissed for different but valid reasons. There is no requirement for their accusation to be reasonable or made in good faith. The good faith condition really only relates to whether workers have rights under the terms of the Bill and it will be easy for most workers to establish that.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> To correct my hon. Friend, workers need only prove that their claim to a right is made in good faith. They could do that easily enough, but on an analysis that is nevertheless false.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, just as people in Germany who want to recover Pomerania need only say that they have a right to it.
<P>
Employers in serious economic difficulties may find that their discretion to select for redundancy for economic reasons is compromised. There will be conflict between competing grounds for redundancy. Some employees selected for redundancy on economic grounds will not be able to argue that they have been dismissed because they had to be paid above the national minimum wage, while others will be able to make such a claim.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, that will give them an advantage. The clause provides no protection against that happening, and no balancing mechnism. Labour Members who have represented people in unfair dismissal claims will know that there will often be a number of claims against employers even when a redundancy scheme applies. In such claims it may be alleged that the dismissal is not in accord with the objective terms of that scheme but is the result of subjectivity or discrimination or, in this case, the application of the provisions of the clause.
<P>
The Bill needs to specify which reason for dismissal is significant for its purposes. There is no mechanism for establishing the necessary level of proof: a claim can simply be asserted. That will cause difficulties in the context of general redundancy initiatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has it occurred to my hon. Friend that the clause will have the ludicrous effect that bad[Mr. Green]
employers and dodgy employees will pick and choose the reasons for redundancies? Different circumstances and qualifications will get tied up in a ridiculous tangle of string. People will give various reasons why they may have been dismissed or why they have dismissed employees. In such circumstances, we know that the bad will flourish and the good will be tied up in red tape. Either way, businesses will suffer.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes his point clearly and I do not need to add to it. I know that my hon. Friends have one or two separate points, so I must not delay the Committee, but it would be sensible to consider the issue another way round. The self-same problem could manifest itself in a detrimental way, as perceived by Ministers and Labour Members.
<P>
Let us say, for the sake of argument, that an employer, affected by the implementation of the national minimum wage was looking to dismiss employees rather than retain them. This provision is intended to deter such an employer from taking that action understandably; the essence of the Opposition's earlier argument was that a loss of jobs might be a damaging by-product of the Bill, and it must therefore be in the Bill's interests to minimise that effect.
<P>
However, an employer has competing potential opportunities for dismissal. One is to seek redundancy and argue for it on economic grounds. Thus, we might see employers who are adversely affected by the implementation of the legislation trying to reduce the number of their employees, particularly those who benefited from the national minimum wage. In doing so, they will not say, "I have had to lose jobs as a consequence of the national minimum wage" no doubt Ministers will derive political comfort from that they will say, "Look, nobody has been sacked because of the national minimum wage." The reason nobody will have been sacked is because were employers to do so, employees would launch a claim for unfair dismissal and the net effect on the employer would be nil, or he would still suffer all the costs.
<P>
Employers will therefore use redundancies on economic grounds. They will seek to claim, perhaps over weeks or months, that there are changes in, for example, the gross margins of their businesses. Those would accrue and, in time, employers would adjust their employment levels with reference to their cost base, as business people have to do, and people would lose jobs. Ostensibly, they would not have lost them because of the national minimum wage, but that would be the real reason.
<P>
The provision may simply disguise the character of the dismissals and job losses. Far form protecting employees which is the Minister's no doubt honourable intention it may leave employees no better protected than they were in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We have already seen elsewhere in the Bill a provision for the Low Pay Commission to take account of the general economic state when it recommends a national minimum wage rate. If my hon. Friend is right, as I am sure he is, that dismissals arising from the imposition of the minimum wage will be disguised because employers will choose another route, the Low Pay Commission will not be able to take a sensible and objective economic decision based on the data, because it is being hidden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes. I fear that I did not entirely follow my hon. Friend's argument perhaps he should make his point at greater length later. I am trying to complete my argument, and it might be better for speeches to stick to one point rather than moving on to others.
<P>
The matter has one final aspect. Employers who have temporary cash difficulties, especially those involved in small businesses, will observe the significant differences in employment protection offered to their employees by different parts of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Dismissal of a worker because of the national minimum wage would be classed as unfair. Such employers may have a significant number of employees who are below the two-year qualifying period of service. If they have to adjust their employment levels in response to the national minimum wage, they will claim to do so on grounds other than the minimum wage. They may opt to dismiss within the two-year qualifying period. They will not wish to expose themselves to the risk of unfair dismissal claims by referring to the national minimum wage level that applies to the staff concerned.
<P>
That is another distortion, and another way in which the Bill will not offer the protection that it is designed to offer. Instead, well-meaning employers may be left wide open to vexatious claims because of conflict between the various grounds on which it is claimed that redundancies are made. They will be subject to non-economic considerations in employing people, which will prejudice their businesses.
<P>
Those aspects of the clause will not deliver the intentions behind them and may well have harmful, unintended consequences.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The clause provides employees with automatic protection against dismissal because they have asserted their right to receive the national minimum wage or any related rights that are referred to in clause 21 and the rest of the Bill. Any such dismissal will automatically be regarded as unfair. The claim that a right has been infringed must be made in good faith.
<P>
The Committee has discussed the test of good faith before. I attempted to reassure Opposition Members about the nature of the test. I am happy to try to persuade the hon. Member for Daventry about the point. He will not mind if I tell the Committee that he and I had an interesting discussion about the matter outside the Committee Room, in which I tried to reassure him. I am happy to give him the same reassurances again.
<P>
The clause inserts the rights that relate to the national minimum wage into the Employment Rights Act 1996 as an additional protective right, by making a new section 104A. As has been pointed out, no qualifying period of employment has to be completed before the right can be exercised. As the Minister said in an earlier sitting, the Government are acting to ensure that all employees are, from day one of their employment, protected from retaliation against an assertion of their right to receive the national minimum wage.
<P>
A number of points have been made, some of which have been more pertinent to the clause than others. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge used a wonderful expression, which involved the phrase "the real world". I shall attempt to return the Committee to the real world. It was a bit of an Aunt Sally to speak of third parties enforcing the rights and employees not knowing anything about it. I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that I cannot concede that such a situation could exist. In the real world of industrial relations, an enforcement officer would have spoken to the employee and employer concerned. We had a constructive discussion on that point earlier.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also discussed what would happen to somebody who had taken a case to a tribunal which was then dismissed. There has to be provision for such employees because detrimental action leading to dismissal could have taken place in a minority of cases.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I fear that in my haste to make progress I did not deploy the full force of the argument. I do not deny that there could be some effect from a discharged case, but surely the civil text of why action was taken would cut in. If there had been offence proceedings but no civil test, surely there would be no detriment to the employee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. The employer must have treated the employee in such a way as to cause action to be taken.
<P>
We had a lengthy discussion on redundancy. The notes on clauses state:
"Clause 23(2) inserts a new subsection 105(7A) into section 105 of the ERA which provides that selecting an employee for redundancy on certain grounds amounts to unfair dismissal."<P>

<P>
I must tell Conservative Members that, again, this is not new. There are circumstances in which selection I emphasise that word for redundancy may amount to unfair dismissal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Under-Secretary emphasised selection heavily. She will forgive my relative ignorance of these matters. Would a test of whether an employer had picked on one employee cut in if a number of workers were sacked because he was in trouble economically?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is absolutely correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Would it amount to unfair dismissal if an employer selected for redundancy workers whom he could not afford to pay those who were paid more than the minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> This is unreal. There are well known legal definitions of genuine redundancy. Selection for redundancy on certain grounds amounts to unfair dismissal. I remind the Committee of existing employment law which deals, for example, with the selection for redundancy of people who are pregnant or who have enforced health and safety rights. I also remind the Committee, not for the first time, that the concept is enshrined in legislation such as the 1996 and 1992 Acts.
<P>
Conservative Members described a farrago a bureaucratic mesh but I am discussing the reality of employment law.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</b> rose<P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, no, no [Interruption.]
<P>
To receive a proper answer, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire should ask questions that are related to the clause, as some of his hon. Friends have. Otherwise, my answer would be ruled out of order by you. Mr. Atkinson, which I do not want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the Minister give way for a factual question?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is about subsection (5), and the insertion of minimum wage provisions into section 110 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. How many orders have been made under that section?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I gather that the answer is one order I am impressed by my hon. Friend the Minister of State's very prompt prompt.
<P>
Subsection (5) ensures that the Bill is on a par with employment legislation introduced by the Conservative Government, and that it builds on earlier legislation. Clause 23 will ensure that the national minimum wage works and that people are not victimised for exercising their rights to it. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Two points arise from what the Under-Secretary said. I thank her for the speed of her answer to my factual question, but if only one order has been made in two years the clause does not represent an enormous step forward for the rights of those workers who the Under-Secretary claims are being treated unfairly. She enjoins us to live in the real world, but subsection (5) has little meaning. That part of the Employment Rights Act 1996 may need to be revisited.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> We must not fall into the trap of believing that, because there has been only one order under section 110 of the 1996 Act, subsection (5) will not lead to more. Might not the subsection encourage employers to create such statutory dismissal procedure agreements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We know that detailed provisions that interfere with the contracts between employers and employees may have secondary, unintended and unpredictable consequences. My hon. Friend is right in predicting that subsection (5) will encourage employers to extend the web of exclusions available to them. The result will be a reduction in the rights available to low-paid workers. Perhaps I am too kind in thinking that subsection (5) is merely otiose, when in fact it could be damaging.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire said that he did not understand the second point that I want to make when I brought it up in an earlier intervention, so I shall try to express myself more clearly this time. Clause 7(5) provides that the Low Pay Commission has a duty to assess the economic[Mr. Green]
consequences, especially for competitiveness, of the rate set for the national minimum wage and of the regulations that are made. It is perverse that the clause will encourage employers to behave in such a way that what Opposition Members anticipate will be the effect of the imposition of a national minimum wage at too high a rate reduced competitiveness and increasing unemployment will be disguised.
<P>
If the Government allowed the Low Pay Commission to work on the basis of rational economic analysis, what we argue will be one of the most serious direct effects of the Bill increased unemployment would soon become evident. Instead, the clause will disguise that and make it more difficult for the Low Pay Commission to do its work. That is one of the most unsatisfactory aspects of the clause. It negates the purpose of another clause in the Bill.
<P>
Finally, I should like to make a general point about the paucity or non-existence of defences for employers against action taken by disgruntled employees under the clause. My hon Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has already discussed the problems of employers who need to dismiss workers for what could be described as genuine reasons, although that does not sound very compassionate. To put it as compassionately as possible, an employer who has 20 workers may realise, in looking at the books and the potential state of the economy, that he must dismiss either 10 of them or 20 of them and himself, because otherwise his business would cease to exist. Clearly, a decision to dismiss 10 would be not only economically efficient, but compassionate.
<P>
The clause will make it more difficult for an employer to take such decisions on grounds of maximising efficiency and, therefore, long-term employment prospects. If the business survives and flourishes, at some time in the future it may then become possible to re-employ some or, indeed, all, of those dismissed workers a social and economic good. One of my main objectives to the clause is that it ties down employers and makes it more difficult for them to take the sorts of rational economic decisions that would allow them to create employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, whose argument I am following intently. He is arguing that there will be an incentive under the clause for economic inefficiency rather than economic efficiency. If an employee becomes eligible for, and shortly therafter asserts his right to, the national minimum wage, but, for economic efficiency reasons the employer wants to dismiss that employee, he will be prohibited, or at least discouraged, from so doing.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for Ashford replies to that intervention, I must tell the hon. Member for Buckingham that he has made that point before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I wanted to elucidate the point, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The underlying point is that a peculiar class of employee will be created, comprising employees who were previously paid less than the rate of the newly imposed national minimum wage, but who will now be paid more than that. Those employees will also be

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall give way in a moment, but I want to finish the thought, not least so that my hon. Friend can understand it I keep confusing him.
<P>
As those employees pass through that barrier, possibly for other reasons, they may become liable to dismissal. They will then be in a strange position they will genuinely believe that they are being sacked because their wages have risen, when they are in fact being sacked for other reasons. The clause will give them the right to assert in law the fact that they were sacked for one reason, when in fact they were sacked for another reason. That is very peculiar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister's speech suggested that that is analogous to dismissal on grounds of sex discrimination or pregnancy. Does my hon. Friend agree that those cases are different? The form of dismissal that we are discussing bears directly on the cost of maintaining employment. Selection for redundancy can have a direct economic consequence on the viability of a business. With sex discrimination, there is no difference in value between the two types of employee. The economic effect on a business is quite different.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The Minister's analogy does not apply. We should reinforce the point that there may be a one-off shift if the Bill is implemented this year. One suspects the immediate effect will last for two years or so and that those years will be the point of maximum danger. When the perverse incentive contained in the clause becomes known after it proceeds through Parliament, businesses that see what is coming might conceivably advance redundancies for the low paid, which would be a disaster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have one thought to add to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. The analogy drawn by the Minister does not hold up. Protected employees become so at their own volition by commencing the necessary proceedings. That is not the case with sex discrimination cases, in which the individual has little control. I know that people have been able to change their gender, but I doubt whether anyone would do so simply to avail themselves of protection against unfair dismissal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am tempted to test the ministerial team further by asking whether anyone has been known to change gender to take advantage of sex equality laws.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Moments of this debate are becoming increasingly familiar. Will the hon. Gentleman, if he is going to continue, advance his argument a little?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was drawing to a close, Mr. Atkinson [Hon. Members: "Oh no!"] I am glad that that has caused the Committee such joy.
<P>
I regret that the Minister did not fully answer the many questions that have become so familiar to you, Mr. Atkinson. Clause 23 is filled with good intentions and bad effects. On the surface it would transfer the terms of the Employment Rights Act 1996 to minimum wage law. However, during the transitional period between not having a minimum wage and its arrival, there will be deleterious effects on employers and, conceivably, on employees whose employers try to forestall the perverse effects of the Bill. That is why the clause is profoundly unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall be brief. I have read the notes on clauses carefully during my hon. Friend's speech, and now realise that I may not have been getting the position quite right. The Minister may choose not to respond at the end of the debate. I may have suggested that employers would respond in a particular way, but they probably will not.
<P>
The purpose of clause 23 is to exclude unfair dismissal under the national minimum wage from the sorts of dismissal that can occur under statutory dismissal procedures agreed in section 110 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Implementing the clause would hardly give employers an incentive to pursue a section 110 statutory dismissals procedure agreement. In that sense, my argument does not apply, but the question remains whether Ministers propose to use theERA in that way. Only one order has been made under section 110; do Ministers propose to review the section 110 procedures? How many additional orders do Ministers expect to occur?
