</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 2, leave out line 7.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 20 in, page 2, leave out line 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Amendment No. 19 would remove line 7 of clause 2(2), which refers to the ``degree of public support''. I am trying to extract from the supporters of the Bill what they have in mind in including that criterion, because it is not clear to me what is meant by the phrase. Is it intended to be a judgment that is made on appropriate occasions by the commission? Does the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) want to express a view about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Robathan </B>(Blaby): Perhaps I can forestall the rest of the debate by pointing out that the matter is to rest entirely on the judgment of the commission, which will be given guidelines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am grateful for that observation. Obviously, there should be a good deal of public support in such circumstances. The hon. Member for Blaby would probably agree that if somebody proposed a referendum on a matter for which there was no widespread support, the commission should say, ``No, it is not appropriate to use this vehicle in that way.'' Referendums should be about issues that cannot be resolved in a sensible way by the procedures that are currently available to us, and both parties should have a fair opportunity to put their cases to the electorate. We should use this debate to try to guide the commission to the effect that if there is only a minor degree of support it would have the power to say that the degree of public support is so small as to not warrant wasting public money on testing the matter through a referendum.
<P>
I should welcome the observations of the hon. Member for Blaby on amendment No. 20, which would remove from the criteria the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other matters as the Commission considers relevant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If Parliament wishes to set up an arrangement of this kind, it should give clear guidance about what factors are relevant and, by implication, not relevant. The Bill's supporters should state their intentions in that respect. I believe that it would be inappropriate for Parliament to duck out of the responsibilities that it assumes, from time to time, on issues that are controversial with the public. I suspect that there would be some cross-party consensus on that. For example, it would not be appropriate for the Bill to be used as a vehicle for a referendum on capital punishment. That is a complex area, in which we as parliamentarians need to make our judgments clearly.
<P>
I suggest to the Bill's sponsors that it would be helpful to set out the areas that they believe the commission should consider when determining whether a matter is relevant for referral. What does the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other matters as the Commission considers relevant''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
mean in that context? There is a risk that the selection of a campaign or body from among competing applicants will be fairly acrimonious, and may drag the commission into political controversy. I agree with the hon. Member for Blaby that there ought to be an independent umpire in such matters--that is the purpose of setting up the commission--but it is Parliament's responsibility to establish the rules of the game.
<P>
Again, I see that there are at least a couple of experienced lawyers across the Room, and suggest that subsection (2) as drafted may encourage judicial review applications and bickering between competing parties if Parliament is unclear about its intentions.
<P>
With those comments, I commend the amendments to the Committee. I look forward to hearing the observations of the hon. Member for Blaby. He is well-meaning, but I am conscious of the fact that we may be leaving a hostage to fortune if those two small points are not made totally clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): As this is my first substantive contribution to the Committee's proceedings, I join in previous welcomes to you, Mr. Wells, in your chairmanship.
<P>
Perhaps the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) needs to reread what the Neill committee said in its recommendations and  discussion. It is clear to me what my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby intends by clause 2(2)(c) and (d). If we are to follow the Neill committee's recommendations, it will be vital that the commission should have the opportunity to assess the degree of public support and have a wide discretion to consider other matters. In particular, I am concerned about the Neill committee's recommendations about spending limits. That is vital when considering the certification of one individual or body as the designated referendum campaign. I remind the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston of what the Neill committee said at paragraph 12.47:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In addition, there is an argument of principle that arises in connection with referendum campaigns that does not arise--or at least does not arise in the same form in connection with ordinary election campaigns. In ordinary election campaigns, the political parties are competing for power. The party that wins the election takes power. The parties therefore have an interest in putting forward every argument that may possibly persuade voters to vote for them rather than for someone else. In an ordinary election campaign, it is extremely rare for relevant arguments to go unheard. By contrast, in a referendum campaign the reasons for voting Yes or No may be exceedingly large in number, extremely disparate and''
<P>
--crucially--
<P>
``possibly even contradictory.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Yes campaign in Northern Ireland, with the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and Sinn Fein all on one side, and Republican splinter groups and the DUP on the other, provides a vivid illustration. Future referendum campaigns on electoral reform or on joining the European Economic and Monetary Union could easily take the same form (as, to some extent, the European Community referendum campaign did in 1975).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All hon. Members in the Committee will remember that final example, which was referred to in debates this morning and last week.
<P>
Paragraph 12.6 of the report states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a referendum campaign is more like a free-for-all.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Anyone can participate. Many do. The political parties may, or may not, be the principal contestants. It is often not known long in advance whether the referendum will take place, let alone when it will take place. Those on the Yes and No sides of the argument may never have worked together before--and may, quite possibly, be unwilling to work together now.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It appears to me, as it does to the Neill committee, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``under those circumstances it would be impracticable to try to control campaign spending.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some controls are needed, however, which is where my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby has got the balance absolutely right. The Bill gives the proposed commission the widest possible discretion to take into account
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other matters as the Commission considers relevant''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in deciding the designated campaigns. It must, however, consider the amount of public support so that the referendum does not become even more of a free-for-all than, as the Neill committee pointed out, it will be anyway.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said that the amendments were probing amendments. I hope that he will feel that they have probed sufficiently, and that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment rather than press it to a vote. I warn him that the Neill committee identified the following difficulty in respect of specific controls on campaign spending:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The administrative apparatus required would resemble one of Heath Robinson's most outlandish contraptions--and would almost certainly not work.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said, my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby has got the balance right, and paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (2) are vital. I hope that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston will decide on further consideration to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> For the purposes of clarification, clause 2(2) requires that the referendum commission shall, in deciding which individual or body should be certified as the designated referendum campaign, take account of the following criteria:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) the ability to conduct an effective campaign;
<P>
(b) the views of political parties;
<P>
(c) the degree of public support; and
<P>
(d) such other matters as the Commission considers relevant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The requirements for the commission to have regard to the views of political parties and to the degree of public support may be difficult to apply in practice. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston is seeking to address those difficulties.
<P>
As I read the amendments, they would require the commission to have regard to only two criteria,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the ability to conduct an effective campaign''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and the extent to which the body in question appears to be representative of opinion on its respective side of the argument. I am sorry that we keep returning to this comparison, but I should point out that the latter test is similar to that which was used for allocating core funding in the 1975 referendum. I do not know whether my hon. Friend thought of that, but he has proposed a very similar procedure. The proposed commission's decision to certify a particular body as a designated referendum campaign, as we debated clearly this morning, could be important. Not only would that body receive core funding, which is important, but that decision would have the effect of labelling that body the official--with a small ``o''--campaign for its side of the argument.
<P>
It is especially appropriate and important that we reflect carefully on the sort of body that should be eligible for designation, and on what criteria such a body might be selected.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the hon. Member for Blaby said, the Bill as drafted would provide the commission with the four criteria to which I recently referred. The first, sensibly, concerns the ability to conduct an effective campaign. I imagine that the commission might use that criterion to consider whether a body's application demonstrated that it had a worked-out plan for arguing and presenting its case. I do not think that anyone would contend that presentation is not equally as important as the arguments.
<P>
We would all wish that body in receipt of public money would also demonstrate basic organisational competence. A well intentioned organisation might be established, but it might lack the necessary organisational capacity or skills to make an impression on the voters in a referendum. I do not wish to overplay the point, but it is sometimes difficult in the hurly-burly of an election to convey complicated points, and a proper organisation is required. I was gazing at the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell), who seemed to have achieved that well. It might also help for a body to show that it had a support structure. Such a test would be relevant and should be applied.
<P>
I am not convinced that that is still the case for the remaining criteria. The requirement to consider the views of political parties does not appear to be workable in practice. Is the commission required to consider the views of all political parties, or of all registered political parties? There are obvious examples of parties that might not have a sensible contribution to make. I would not wish to denigrate the Monster Raving Loony party, but its views should not be taken as either relevant or necessary to a referendum campaign.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I think that there are more extreme examples; at least the Monster Raving Loony party has fought many elections. One thinks of the candidate on an official party ticket who recently fought an election in Liverpool who scored the princely sum of zero votes--a constitutional record. Should that political party be taken seriously by the referendum commission?
<P>
Mr. Robathan rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It may be as well if I say something before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, but if he wishes to intervene, I shall let him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> The learned and wise gentlemen of the referendum commission should be given flexibility. If they thought that a party--the Ellesmere Port dog preservation and cat shooting society, for instance--was not worth considering, they would not take it into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not want to be drawn into that argument. I do not know whether such a body exists, but I am sure that if it did, it would have the undying support of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston.
<P>
The hon. Member for Blaby wants to give the commission, whether it be a referendums commission or an electoral commission, sufficient flexibility to make sensible decisions. I agree, but if we require the commission to take into account different sets of criteria, we narrow rather than broaden that flexibility. If the hon. Member for Blaby were to reflect on that, he would have to agree. I make that point in a constructive spirit rather than simply to oppose him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> From examining the words in the clause rather than the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, it is clear that the commission would certify one group for each possible outcome of the referendum. Surely the commission would have to take into account the point that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston made about minor bodies in deciding that, even if the Monster Raving Loony party, for example, supported a particular outcome along with a much bigger force with much wider public support, the party or group with the wider support should be the designated body? If the Monster Raving Loony party and its members wanted to join that wider group, they could do so.
<P>
Part of the value of retaining the words in paragraphs (c) and (d) is that doing so would ensure that the commission could take that point into account. That would not rule out the minor parties, but it would prevent them from being the designated campaign for that outcome, and would allow the less supported minority, and perhaps whimsical, campaign to join the major, designated body campaigning for that referendum outcome. Would that not be the best of both worlds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, and I agree that the sensible thing to do in a proper and flexible regime would be to allow the commission to make a judgment about where the bulk of the argument lies and how the campaign would work in practice. Setting four criteria narrows the scope for flexibility rather than broadening it. Other examples could be cited, but between us we have illustrated our point sufficiently well not to need further examples.
<P>
Under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, 70 political parties are registered. As subsection (2)(b) makes no distinction between them, the Stamford ward--I hope that no hon. Member has a ward in his or her constituency called Stamford--residents' association, for example, would have equal status to the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. I am always loth to try to describe the status of the hon. Member for Tatton, but under subsection (2)(b) it would be considerable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): Does that really matter? We are establishing a commission to make a few sensible value judgments on such issues. Submissions would be received, and the commission would merely be asked to take into account representations that are made. It would be able--as would anyone--to form in a few minutes a view about who the major players in a referendum are likely to be. The remaining ones would receive polite letters thanking them for their submission. It could all be taken into account without any great difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, who, if I am not mistaken, before becoming a Member of Parliament was a distinguished lawyer as, indeed, was my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), who remains a distinguished lawyer--as I am sure does the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). Given the issues at stake, he will know that one or more of those bodies may dislike the commission's decision and may choose to go to law.
<P>
In those circumstances, if the commission had made valued, sensible judgments as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield described, it would cause difficulties in a court action in determining what was appropriate. The hon. Gentleman also knows that such matters would be weighed heavily by the provisions under the Bill that would govern the legal judgment.
<P>
<B> Mr. Gerald Bermingham (St. Helens, South):</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B> Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, South, although I have a horrible sinking feeling that I am about to enter into waters in which I am probably not qualified to swim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> Does he agree that the more bodies that are listed in the Bill as potential consultees, the more persons are given the right to challenge the result in the administrative courts, by way of judicial review?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I was trying to make that point in my own less than lawyerly way. I apologise for getting my hon. Friend's constituency wrong. It is St. Helens, South. I am sorry if I said Birmingham I confused the two passions in my hon. Friend's life, one of which is in Birmingham and the other, I know, is in St. Helens, South.
<P>
What the commission is to make of the test is unclear. Similarly, I do not understand how the requirement that the commission has regard to the degree of public support commanded by a particular referendum campaign could work in practice. How would it be tested? Is the commission expected to conduct an opinion poll? I say, somewhat tongue in cheek: perhaps they would even hold a referendum.
<P>
The criteria put the cart before the horse. Perhaps the proper interpretation is that the commission should consider the breadth of opinion, which was the point made by the hon. Members for Beaconsfield and for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins), although I would place the argument of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath in an opposite direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> As the Minister is aware, we are considering a designated campaign for a possible outcome of the referendum. There could be multiple answers to a particularly drafted referendum question, so there could be four or five different campaigns. Surely it makes sense for the commission to have the widest possible discretion as set out in subsection (2)(d), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other matters as the Commission considers relevant''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such discretion would be narrowed if that provision was removed by the amendment of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston.
<P>
As for deciding the main campaign, there must be a public support test. I appreciate that the Minister was being facetious when he was talking about the commission holding a referendum, but it could ask which of the main political parties supports a particular referendum outcome. That is a way in which to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is certainly one way in which to decide. I am sure that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath agrees that there are advantages in reasonable flexibility. The difficulty was created by setting those four criteria. Although they were intended to be helpful, they have not had that effect.
<P>
I am not sure whether clause 2(2)(d) is a catch-all provision. I do not think that we would want an open-ended provision, although it is possible to envisage that the commission's choice of designated campaigns may be open-ended. I made the point in response to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield a few moments ago that the matter could become the subject of litigation.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In trying to ensure that the commission's decisions are based on clear, transparent and operable criteria, we hope to guard against such action. The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston would help to make the arrangements more workable in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell </B>(Tatton): I feel obliged to put the anti-party point of view, as I am the first Independent to participate in such a Committee for 49 years. I am well aware of the defectiveness of the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998. I stood as an Independent; I sit as an Independent; and I asked to register as an Independent, but I was not allowed to do so. For the purposes of this provision, we can rely on the common sense of the commission--surely the guiding principle--not to put too great a weight on parties. The provision does not say how much the commission must take into account the views of the parties. I should hope not too much because, as we all know, the crack of the party Whip is not--or should not be--the be-all and end-all of a live democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) for that historic intervention. I do not want to get drawn in too closely to his argument, but I respect--as does the House--that he was elected as an Independent and sits as one. I hope that he will recognise that, unlike the Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat parties, the term ``independent'' applies to anyone who chooses to declare himself as such. The established political parties have a slightly different identity to protect. While I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's difficulty, I am sure that he would be the first to acknowledge that he would not wish to appropriate exclusive use of the term ``independent''. being a decent and sensible man, I know that he would consider that both inappropriate and unworkable. That is the difficulty that we were confronted with in dealing with that legislation and why he finds himself in that position.
<P>
I was about to say that the amendments are sensible. They would make the arrangements more workable and it would be useful to incorporate them into the sill.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath who has put our case extremely well. I commend the hon. Member for Tatton--this is not just courtesy--for talking common sense. We are relying on the commission's common sense.
<P>
Some of the arguments of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the Minister have been somewhat drawn out and spurious. I do not see why one would wish to prescribe the commission. It must have some flexibility. There has to be a balance between prescription and flexibility. The idea that ``the degree of public support'' and ``other matters'' should not be considered by the commission is not acceptable. I shall oppose the two amendments because they would benefit neither the commission nor democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> Amendment No. 19 is extremely sensible. How can one register the degree of public support before the argument has begun? On the matter of the registration of parties, political parties can be simply political parties, or they can be registered for the purpose of voting. There is no prohibition in this country on a political party being registered not necessarily to vote. It may not take part in elections, but is simply a philosophical group of free thinkers. Were the hon. Member for Tatton to seek re-election, he could register himself as the former Member of Parliament for Tatton, which would get him straight on to the ballot paper with all the advantages that he would need.
<P>
I digress, so I shall return to the amendment immediately. Subsection (2)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the views of political parties''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which governs any grouping--they can call themselves what they want. If we say that political parties have to be what we know as political parties, we shall end up in the divisional court arguing the matter, thereby making money for lawyers, which is what most of these Bills usually produce. Political is only political in the colloquial sense--the Bill does not refer to registered political parties.
<P>
Subsection (2)(c) on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the degree of public support''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is superfluous. It says simply that there must be support from a certain group when the Bill calling for a referendum is passed. Clause 2(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As soon as possible after the introduction to Parliament of any Bill which provides for the holding of a referendum, the Commission shall invite individuals or bodies to apply to be a designated referendum campaign in respect of that referendum.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How can one work out the degree of public support? Does one immediately rush round and say, ``Gosh, are you going to support this?'' The argument will not have started. That is a negation of democracy. I thought that this Bill was intended to advance democracy. Of course the commission should be able to take on board the widest number of views, but it cannot do that until the Bill providing for the referendum has been passed, the views of the political parties have been taken and the commission has worked out the ability of those parties to conduct an effective campaign.
<P>
Let us consider a stupid proposal, such as the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 which, regrettably, I voted for, along with most hon. Members, and which we have regretted ever since. An even classier one is the Child Support Agency Act 1991. I am sure that every hon. Member who voted for it would give his right arm to get rid of it. By voting for it, what were we saying? We were talking about the right of children to be supported, so we were all doing what is good and great. What we did not know was that a monstrous agency would be set up that would have little, if any, effect. It collected hardly any money; when it did, it gave it all to the tax man, rather than to the families who needed it.
<P>
If there had been a power of referendum, all the good and great would have said, ``Gosh, yes.'', but we would not have known about the St. Helen's boys brigade action group, consisting of God-fearing men who had paid their dues, whose wives had all walked out on them. Thank goodness, there is no such group, otherwise I shall be pilloried--at least, I hope that there is not.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been tolerant about the degree to which we have been going wide of the issue. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are discussing leaving out line 7 of clause 2, which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the degree of public support''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that alone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> I stand admonished, although I think that I am still in order, but I shall not argue that point.
<P>
If the Child Support Agency Act 1991 had had a referendum clause, all of us who were so carried away with enthusiasm to do the right thing that we passed that monstrous Act in about two days flat would not have been in a position to gauge public opinion. We would not have had a truly reflective opinion. That cannot happen until we are some way down the line. We need time to assimilate the contents of a Bill and the effectiveness of a referendum.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston is right--amendment No. 19 removes the question of public opinion because that is adequately covered by paragraph (d):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other matters as the Commission considers relevant''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The commission, which is the expert in the matter, will examine the Bill and the referendum, ask the opinion of political parties, registered and non-registered, and any interested parties in the sector and then work out who should be allowed to call a referendum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I shall not be drawn on the question about the CSA because only my hon. Friend the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South know the answer to it; they were in the House at the time. On the point raised by the hon. Member for Tatton, ``independent'' creates an unusual situation. Everyone in the House acknowledges that the hon. Gentleman is a genuinely independent, free-thinking soul who will say what he thinks and is not hidebound by a party Whip--he has often told me that he is his own thief Whip--but anomalies occur. The hon. Gentleman may have seen the television programme that showed, after the recent elections, a council composed of a group of independents. That seems an inherent contradiction. Leaving that aside, genuinely independent people create an unusual situation.
<P>
The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission shall certify one individual or body as the designated referendum campaign in respect of each of the possible outcomes of the referendum, taking into account in respect of each individual or body which has made application''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We could end up with a horrendous situation. If one of the outcomes reflects a very narrow point of view, the commission could be forced by that wording to invite the wrong decision. The hon. Member for Blaby assures me that that is not his intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> In response to the hon. Gentleman--who began his remarks by saying that the amendments were purely probing--I point out that paragraph (c) covers an eventuality that no one has mentioned: the Natural Law party becoming the designated body for a particular outcome. If it is clear from the fact that it has done extremely badly in all the elections for which it has stood that a party has almost no support and a better, wider body is arguing for the same outcome, it is vital--in opposition to the argument that the hon. Gentleman has just made--to retain paragraph (c). The hon. Member for St. Helens, South says that one cannot judge the matter at the outset, but there is no difficulty in distinguishing the huge difference between the support of our great national parties and that of the minority, single-issue campaigns and slightly strange parties such as the Natural Law party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Having faced the Natural Law party in elections and shared platforms with it through the Council of Churches--as well as all the candidates that contested my seat in the 1992 election--I cannot entirely agree with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. The Natural Law party is a particular case; it defies science, logic and natural law.
<P>
Subsection (2) specifically states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission shall certify . . . each individual . . . which has made application''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That person's point of view could influence the outcome of a referendum.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Blaby assures the Committee that he would expect the commission to use its judgment and not certify a body that manifestly had no widespread public support. Presumably, given the hon. Gentleman's logic, the fact that the commission judged that the body had only narrow support and, therefore, that it was not appropriate to certify it would be relevant.
<P>
In some electoral systems, a body can have seats only if it commands more than 5 per cent. of the votes. Rather than prescribe a body as not being appropriate to receive funds under that sort of mechanism, the hon. Member for Blaby wants to do so by the spirit of his words rather than the letter. I accept what he says in good faith, but I would prefer to use the words that my hon. Friend the Minister suggests. In the spirit of what the hon. Gentleman says, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Amendment No. 7 has suffered a degradation of status since it was tabled. It was originally intended to supplement amendment No. 6, which the Committee, in its unwisdom, has regrettably decided to reject. Amendment No. 7 is now merely a probing amendment.
<P>
Under clause 3(2), the stipulations for broadcasting organisations regulate how much coverage they can give to the bodies that have been certified as the designated campaigns, but no reference is made to other coverage. Amendment No. 7 would deal with that matter because it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission shall, for the campaign for each possible outcome, decide upon an appropriate share of any public support or broadcast coverage for each individual or body supporting that outcome''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in other words, not merely the designated ones.
<P>
To use the example that was discussed during the previous sitting, let us assume that the campaign of the hon. Member for Blaby has been officially recognised, but not that of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson). Under clause 3, strict restrictions would be placed on the remarks that the hon. Gentleman could make on the broadcast media, because his organisation would have been declared a designated body. However, my hon. Friend, whose organisation would not have the benefit of that designation, would be free to say as much as the broadcast authorities allowed. That cannot be the intention of those who drafted the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would solve that problem in an unnecessarily complicated way. It was necessary to draft it in that way to cover the possibility that several organisations might be involved on each side of a debate. The Bill should allow a fair balance between the possible outcomes, not merely between officially recognised bodies, but all bodies.
<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston will speak to amendment No. 21 at greater length. If we empower the commission to set a sum to support those bodies, it is desirable that it should be able to assign from a range of sums, mainly so that it could see what sort of order of magnitude we had in mind. Otherwise, a sum could be decided on that we seasoned politicians knew would be too small, or that was so large as to be an unnecessary drain on the Exchequer.
<P>
New clause 5 deals with spending limits. We are all grappling with spending limits in the context of general elections, but they will also be pertinent for referendums. Many of us have referred to the referendum on remaining in the European Community. Those on the no side recall with some bitterness that we were ludicrously outgunned by the expenditure of the yes side. Most of us felt at the end of that campaign that the outcome had been unreasonably influenced by an imbalance of cash, regardless of the issues involved. In retrospect, the outcome may have been right, but we have noted that cross-over before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If, as I suspect, the intention is to pursue the financing of the referendum campaign in 1997, I must warn the hon. Gentleman that it would be severely out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I defend myself, Mr. Wells. I was not about to pursue the financing of that campaign. However, I undoubtedly accept your guidance and I shall not pursue the intervention that the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) was kindly about to allow me to make.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Thank you, Mr. Wells, for your guidance. I mentioned that referendum only as an illustration of the problems that could arise.
<P>
New clause 5 is only a first draft of what we might finally achieve, but it attempts to set out fair spending limits. Although it recognises that some bodies are legitimately able to call on wider public support, it avoids a total imbalance. Subsection (1) would set a limit of 200 per cent. of the amount allocated by public funding. Following amendment No. 21, if the sum is fixed at £400,000, it would be legitimate to spend £800,000 on the referendum campaign.
<P>
Subsection (2) would provide for at least some expenditure for those unfortunate individuals and bodies who were not lucky enough to be smiled upon by the referendums commission. It would allow them to spend at least a modest sum on their campaign. It would avoid the serious risk of the balance of funding of the official campaigns being wildly skewed by any number of supplementary campaigns--one can imagine such campaigns as ``Employers for the Euro'', ``Trade Unions for the Euro'', ``Regional Authorities for the Euro'' and so on.
<P>
If we have decided to force an umbrella system, we should also have an umbrella system for spending. Under new clause 5(5), if a body contributes to one of the designated campaigns, that contribution will not count against the limit of £1,000.
<P>
In other words, one is free to be as generous as one likes in contributing to the umbrella organisation, but the umbrella organisation has a limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I cannot resist asking the hon. Gentleman whether he has  recognised that subsection (2) of new clause 5 that he is so eloquently describing could lead to litigation. It may lead to the imprisonment of members of his party or, indeed, Ministers in the Government were it to be implemented. It would be argued that the national changeover--or the national handover plan--was part of the referendum campaign that was conducted by a body other than that which was likely to be designated.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his enticing suggestion. It would be possible for my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues in the Government to argue that they are the Government and not a referendum campaign. The offence would apply only to referendum campaigns that had not been designated. I should be happy to consider variations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> What the hon. Gentleman is suggesting would negate our democracy. That is why new clause 5 is ridiculous. If only the people concerned can speak and the rest of us must shut up, that is negation of democracy.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am certainly not proposing that others be forbidden to speak. I am following the logic of this morning's argument when the Committee decided to group all significant referendum activity under the umbrellas--at least for public support and broadcast coverage. The logical consequence is that those who wish to play a significant part in the campaign must do so as part of the umbrella organisation. Otherwise, the risk is that the intent of the umbrellas to provide a balanced debate will be subverted by a mushrooming of subsidiary organisations contributing to that debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> What happens if a referendum campaign is set up, and there is a pro and an anti, and the Member of Parliament for St. Helens, South in one of his bellicose, independent moods says, ``A plague on both your houses''? Which side will I be credited to: the pro or the anti, or will I be committing an offence by commenting and exercising my democratic right? It is a conundrum to which there is no answer, other than to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend did not follow this morning's debate. I was arguing the same point. It is fundamentally undesirable to force all bodies into two umbrella organisations. However, the Committee has decided to concentrate the main thrust of the Bill into two umbrella organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> That is not what the Committee said. It said that if people wish to have public money, they must enter into some form of umbrella organisation that will be a designated campaign. They do not have to work together. They have to accept that they are working for the same conclusion. We did not say that any organisation may not, if it so wishes, campaign. Of course, it may.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. The Bill's intention to set up a balanced campaign between the alternative arguments will be subverted if no attempt is made to bring the two campaigns, whether designated or not, under a broad joint spending limit. Given that an organisation outside the umbrella cannot be expected to adhere voluntarily to a decision of the umbrella organisation, we are effectively forced to strictly limit the spending of organisations outside the umbrella.
<P>
We can discuss openly whether that limit should be £1,000 or £10,000. If there is no limit, we are saying that the official umbrella organisations might have £400,000 of public money and some additional private money each. Also, one of our friends in Costa Rica with £20 million could throw that into the scales and completely distort the referendum's outcome.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In new clause 5(3), the commission would be empowered to ask organisations to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``submit an account of expenditure in connection with a referendum",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which means that it would be able investigate exactly how much had been spent even if the body concerned was not the designated referendum campaign. New clause 5(4) is an important weakening of that principle. It would be unreasonable if organisations were not able to campaign to their own members. If there is a referendum on abortion, it must be possible for the Catholic Church to write to its members urging a certain point of view. In that case, the Catholic Church should not be able to spend vast additional sums of money campaigning against arguments advanced by the anti-abortion campaign.
<P>
New clause 5(6) attempts to provide some deterrent to breaking the rules, bearing in mind that the deterrent that applies to us in Parliament of being removed from our seat--cannot apply in a referendum, when individuals will not be involved in a process of election.
<P>
I accept that the new clause probably needs substantial improvement, but I tabled it because the issue needs debate. The Committee needs to decide whether we are going to consider public funding of the major campaigns and ignore total spending. If we consider total spending, will we look at it within only the umbrella organisations? If we consider it outside the umbrella, will we impose a limit there? Unless we can answer those questions convincingly, the Bill will be flawed and there will be referendums in which clearly there is a massive imbalance on one side or the other.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> On that last point, how does the hon. Gentleman reconcile what he said with the recent decision of the European Court--I cannot remember the name of the case--that individual persons or groups are entitled to leaflet and solicit for votes in general election campaigns?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The Bowman judgment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister. A general election is really a referendum by any other name. In that case, someone sought to influence the outcome of a general election. If we have a referendum on whether there should be, for the sake of argument, dog catchers in Liverpool, what is to prevent an association of canine lovers in St. Helens from interfering by campaigning, not within the umbrella, but as a specific single unit, as in the Bowman case?
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> That is the sort of argument that we will be forced into. It has been raised to a fair extent in the United States, where the Supreme Court has ruled spending limits to be unconstitutional on the grounds that they are an infringement of freedom of speech.
<P>
I believe that in Europe we are less willing to equate freedom of speech with freedom to spend money. It would, therefore, be appropriate to attempt to resolve the conundrum by overall spending limits. That produces the problem that my hon. Friend refers to, which is that, according to the European Court's decision, each individual body is free to spend money. The question is how to hold the whole group of bodies favouring that outcome collectively responsible. I do not know the limits of that decision whether it applies equally to referendums--it seems likely that it would--and whether it means that all forms of spending limit are effectively impossible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I was warming to the spirit of the argument of the hon. Member for Blaby until he intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe. I also listened carefully to the exchange between my hon. Friends the Members for Broxtowe and for St. Helens, South and began to realise from where the confusion arose. I remind the hon. Member for Blaby that on Second Reading in response to the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman), he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Referendums are here to stay . . . I am a democrat and I believe that the democratic process must be fair, and must be seen to be fair.''--[Official Report, 19 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 1384.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to explain from where he was drawing his support, such as the Electoral Reform Society, the Jenkins commission and Charter 88.
<P>
The hon. Member for Blaby has just let the cat out of the bag. He said to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe that, under his proposals, it is in order to end up with a referendum that is structured and managed by the proposed commission, but that people outside that body have the power, as individuals--in the context of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South--or as organisations to put their tuppennyworth into the equation. That is all right if, it is a tuppennyworth, but if--to take the example of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe--someone from Costa Rica wanted to throw in a couple of million pounds, it would be manifestly unfair.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Blaby intends to maintain the spirit of his argument on Second Reading, surely he must accept that we cannot end up having campaigns that are supported disproportionately on one side or the other--certainly campaigns that could gain clandestine support by people saying, ``I am not joining the umbrella organisation; I am going to interfere with the process from outside that umbrella.'' That is an enormous risk, given what the hon. Gentleman said on Second Reading when he prayed in aid his supporters who believe in fair referendums, including the hon. Member for Tatton. Such a formula could result in a huge distortion of campaigns.
<P>
Amendment No. 21 would set some parameters. I acknowledge that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe is playing the joker, which is a difficult intellectual process to get to grips with. The Bill gives no indication of the amounts to be paid from public funds to designated campaigns--perhaps the hon. Member for Blaby intended that no such sums should be paid.
<P>
The amendment attempts to remedy the first deficiency. Even if the commission is given discretion to decide the precise amount, it is desirable to set some parameters. The amounts are obviously a question of judgment and will change over time, but it would be helpful to know whether the sponsors support the notion that public moneys should go to the competing parties of approved referendums and what order of sum--in today's terms--they think appropriate for those referendums, plus or minus the amount set out in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe. It would be perverse for that carefully balanced equation to be thrown out of kilter by somebody of great weight--in terms of bank balance--standing on one side of the scales but outside the umbrella figures and we could not support that.
<P>
For the purposes of the amendment I adopted the figure of £600,000 which the hon. Member for Blaby will find is derived from the Neill report. I have suggested the smaller figure of £200,000 as the minimum necessary to support an effective campaign.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> Say, for example, we decided to have a referendum not on the single currency or proportional representation, but on regional government. Would we then, as happened in the setting up of the Parliaments in Wales and Scotland, be limited to £200,000 or £600,000, or would the commission have the right to determine the figure in such a situation--because £200,000 would not go far and £600,000 not much further?
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> My hon. Friend is right to consider the issue of assemblies that emerges from the Bill. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Blaby said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regional assemblies may be introduced following regional referendums''.--[Official Report, 19 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 1384.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So it is clearly in the hon. Gentleman's  mind.
<P>
A maximum figure needs to be set down; I acknowledge that my suggestion would not necessarily go far--in my county, for example, it would mean approximately £1 per elector. The commission also needs to set down the minimum figure to run an effective campaign. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South may be thinking ahead of a figure that may be appropriate in two, four or 10 years time and that is where the second part of my amendment comes in; it provides a mechanism for varying the amounts over time and in the light of experience. Having dipped our toe in the water, the figure may be determined by representations from the commission to the Government that it needs to be higher. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House would acknowledge that no self-respecting Chancellor would be enamoured of the idea of an entirely blank cheque; a large foot would be put down if we attempted to have no limitations whatsoever
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not envisage changes being made in the heat of the moment; a mechanism could perhaps be established for periodic reviews to inflation-proof the figures, but with the success of the Government's economic policy--a theme that I shall not pursue, Mr. Wells--not much change would be needed. However, the commission may occasionally judge from its experience that my figures are too high or grossly inadequate. Equally, hon. Members on both sides of the House are becoming increasingly concerned about the enormous levels of expenditure thrown into the electoral process from public and private sources; I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is involved, wearing his other hat, in discussions with other parties about changing some of the processes of registration and so on.
<P>
There is much concern in all parts of the House about some of the issues, one of which is the way in which expenditure is managed. In the specific context of referendums, we should start as we mean to go on and implement constraints on the burden on the public purse. I hope that the hon. Member for Blaby agrees that even were a referendum funded from private sources, the money should be incorporated into the total costs so that we do not end up with a runaway set of figures or the worrying situation that he referred to earlier of a hugely unbalanced campaign. With those remarks, I commend amendment No. 21.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall oppose the amendments and will touch briefly on the reasons why. My main concern, however, is to set out the position of the Conservative party on what is a vexed issue--that may be of interest to the Minister because he views the debates as contributing to his latest endeavours.
<P>
The principal point is that we are entirely open to the idea that there should be some rational constraints on total expenditure in referendums; I stress the word ``irrational''. The debate on the amendments and new clauses--which were put forward in good faith--has illustrated how difficult it is to design rational constraints. The first danger is the ease with which the ability of independent-minded people to conduct campaigns outside the official apparatus of the referendum can be quenched. Such campaigns will necessarily be disadvantaged because they will operate within the limitations of not having the benefits conferred to the official campaigns under the Bill of equal access and equal funding by taxpayers, but we do not want it to become well-nigh impossible for people outside the campaigns to conduct an effective campaign. That is why I cannot support the hon. Member for Broxtowe's amendment and new clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston clearly illustrated the problems that would result if an overall limit were established. The limits proposed in amendment No. 21 are for designated campaigns only; the amendment says nothing about external campaigns. It would be ludicrous if the taxpayer funded two official campaigns that had access to the media and were therefore prevented from spending more than a certain amount, but other groups were allowed to spend vast sums of money--perhaps hundreds of millions of pounds.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> To follow the hon. Gentleman's  logic, such a vast sum of money could result in a total imbalance in the campaign.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, that could result in a great imbalance.
<P>
I do not utterly despair of finding a rational arrangement for limiting referendum expenditure which does not fall into either of those traps. I am bound to say, however, that I should admire the Minister's ingenuity if his draft Bill contained limits that did not prove to be highly controversial and subject to problems of the sort that we have mentioned.
<P>
Those matters are far too difficult and contentious to be included in the Bill in any of the forms suggested so far. That is no disgrace to hon. Members who made such suggestions, because they are difficult things to include. The aim is to establish two simple and wholly uncontentious things: public funding, and equal access to broadcasting.
<P>
I do not claim that that is the end of the story. The Bill has been referred to as an insurance policy, but to be effective it must be uncontentious. If the Minister's ingenuity, and that of his colleagues and advisers, is sufficient, the magnum opus that he will give us in the later summer will provide marvellous, robust and consensually acceptable limits on expenditure, and we shall all be much the happier.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I have two small queries. First, the hon. Gentleman suggests that amendment No. 21 represents one extreme by limiting only the official campaigns. In fact, as I understand the amendment, it does not limit the official campaigns, it merely limits the amount of official money given to them; they would still be free to spend £50 million if they could obtain the money from someone else. Amendment No. 21 is not contentious.
<P>
Is it the hon. Gentleman's intention that the broadcast coverage referred to in clause 3(2) should focus predominantly on designated campaigns? As it stands, it seems to specify only that whatever coverage the designated campaigns receive must be balanced. It does not say whether that coverage should be a fraction of the total coverage or all the coverage. I am not clear about the hon. Gentleman's intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I suspect that if answered the hon. Gentleman's last question now rather than later, I would be ruled out of order. However, we must certainly deal with that point when we come to clause 3. The hon. Gentleman's first question, however, was highly germane to this debate. He was quite right; I was ignoring the fact that amendment No. 21 does not set a limit for official campaigns. It merely limits the amount of public money made available to them.
<P>
Amendment No. 21 has a further problem attached to it; it is a technical defect rather than one of principle. I do not see how a commission, which is not Parliament, can vote moneys; we cannot allow the commission to determine how much money the taxpayer should have to spend. In any case, the sums to be spent would be sanctioned in the Bills that give rise to the referendums; and if a Bill has to sanction the amount, there is no reason not to allow that Bill also to determine the amount, rather than leaving it to the commission. I do not see much merit in amendment No. 21.
<P>
New clause 5, tabled by the hon. Member for Broxtowe, would first limit the designated campaigns before moving on to clobber the small fry with the £1,000 limit. Either version--that which contains the £1,000 clobber limit and that which does not--suffers from grave defects. It will be difficult, but I hope not impossible, to find a means of solving that problem, but it certainly cannot be solved this afternoon or with this Bill. I hope that our discussion will have proved  useful, and that the Minister will illuminate matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to have reinforced one of the fundamental difficulties of the Bill: it and the proposed amendments do not get to grips with the substantive problem of the imbalance caused by outside funding, from whatever source. That is against the spirit of his remarks on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not think that that indicates any deficiency in the Bill, given its purpose. It is perfectly true that it has not covered one area. Indeed, there are many areas that it does not cover. The Minister's complaint about the Bill is that he can think of thousands of areas that it does not cover, many of which were in the Neill Committee report. Most of those aspects will be debated for a long time to come, and rightly so.
<P>
The Bill has two modest aims. It is intended that they <P>
should be implemented soon. It is not a deficiency that the Bill has not solved the problem of external funding. That problem existed before the Bill, and it will continue to be a problem after debate on the Bill. It arises whenever there is a referendum. We cannot smuggle bad solutions into the Bill merely because it would be nice if the Bill covered things that it does not cover. I can think of other splendid things that it could cover--for instance, in the field of ocular therapy--but we should not indulge ourselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I believe that the Bill adopts the right approach. It provides for a referendums commission to certify only one organisation on each side of a referendum question as a designated campaign. That is eminently sensible, and the Committee broadly agrees on that. It was the approach adopted in the 1975 referendum campaign. Sensibly, it was the option favoured by the Neill Committee.
<P>
The Neill scheme, and the scheme envisaged in the Bill, will not work effectively if, as amendment No. 7 implies, a number of organisations are formally recognised on each side of the campaign. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe said that the supporters of a particular outcome in a referendum may refuse to work together, and that we should therefore allow for the possibility of several officially recognised campaign bodies on each side. The Neill Committee considered that possibility, but decided that no organisation should be formally designated as an umbrella campaign body.
<P>
As we said this morning, there is much merit in such an approach. Otherwise, the referendums commission might have to pick its way through the minutiae of disagreements between people who have formally adopted a common position. Such groups might have a myriad of reasons for how to arrive at that conclusion--so much so, that they may find it impossible to work together. This morning, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) described how he found it unacceptable to share a platform with people who held the same final position as him but for entirely different reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister makes an important point, but, casting my mind back--the Minister may remember these events better than I do--to the referendum of 1975, in which all sorts of disparate groups argued on one side or the other while having very little in common, I do not recollect that the umbrella organisation created major problems. I accept the point about the difficulties of sharing a platform, which, I dare say, may have been experienced on the other side, too. No one suggested that the campaigns were impossible to conduct because of the creation of two umbrella organisations, which seem to have combined without too much difficulty.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman's description of what happened in that referendum is accurate, and the Bill suggests, as do I, that that would be the ideal approach. All that I am trying to do--I am genuinely not being obstructive--is suggest that that might not be the case in all circumstances. I hope that, in future referendums, two campaigns can be designated official and that arrangements such as have been envisaged will work.
<P>
Under clause 3, the Bill provides for grants to be made to designated referendum campaigns but the Bill's sponsors have not told us the level of such grants. The hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) acknowledged that as a deficiency, but thought it beyond the Committee's scope to resolve today. Perhaps I have slightly misquoted him: rather than it being a deficiency, he said that the Bill does not resolve the issue.
<P>
The Neill Committee proposed a figure of £600,000 for each side because the experience of 1975 showed that that was the sum needed to run a minimum campaign. Amendment No. 7 would provide that the available grant should be shared among the designated campaign bodies on each side. If £600,000 were divided among several organisations, it is most unlikely that any of them could mount a campaign worthy of the name--unless, of course, they had access to private funds. It would defeat the object of a Government grant if a campaign could be run only through the introduction of private funds. The proposal would not enable anyone to conduct a minimum campaign, however defined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I should like to correct a point of fact. The Neill Committee did not recommend that the grant should be £600,000 because that it is the equivalent of £125,000 in 1975. What it said, in recommendation 87, is that core funding should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not less than that provided in connection''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with the referendum of 1975. There is a major difference between those two statements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman perhaps puts himself in the position of a grant applicant, whereas I may have read the recommendation putting myself in the position of someone who might be involved in considering such applications at some stage. However, I obviously do not want to misrepresent what is said in the Neill recommendations.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister is arguing that, in the event of three distinct points of view--two on one side and one on the other--it would be difficult to split the £600,000 into two grants of £300,000 without making it impossible for either side to campaign. In such circumstances, the commission might consider it appropriate to increase the total amount to ensure that all three distinct points of view could be expressed without destroying the overall balance, resulting in, perhaps, £400,000 each for one side and £800,000 for the other. The amendment would allow for different points of view on one side. The Neill recommendation of saying, ``Well, in that case, neither side gets anything'' singularly fails to address the issue.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not accept the logic of my hon. Friend's point. For argument's sake, I shall use the example of the single currency issue. Let us suppose that there was a yes campaign and it emerged that one campaign was in favour of implementing a single currency, but that three separate campaigns opposed it and wanted to encourage a no vote. If each campaign received £600,000, which was what my hon. Friend suggested--
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Well, perhaps my hon. Friend can explain what he meant.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The commission might decide that £600,000 was a reasonable sum to allow two points of view to be expressed. If there were three or even four points of view, it would probably decide to increase the total sum to £800,000 and that amount would then be sub-divided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I now understand my hon. Friend's point, but my general proposition still holds true, namely, that one side would receive more funding than the other. If one campaign was on one side of the argument and three or four were on the other, as a result of which the commission decided to increase the amount of money for one side beyond the ceiling that applied to the other half of the campaign, the one point of view expressed by four different bodies would receive a larger grant.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am sorry to be difficult. If the maximum limit was £800,000, the yes campaign would receive £400,000 and the no campaigns would receive £133,000 each. A balance would be preserved between yes and no, but the range of different reasons for voting no would be reflected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I apologise to my hon. Friend. I do not know whether it was only me who misunderstood him or the whole Committee.
<P>
I am not clear that an effective campaign could be mounted if the amounts were divided between different organisations. We could not be assured that that side of the argument would mount one minimum campaign, because there would be no clear co-ordination between the separate organisations. We would be straying away from being faithful to Neill if we were to go along those lines. Given that Neill was asked to make recommendations on such matters, it is important that we keep as near to the report as possible.
<P>
Other difficulties would arise in relation to broadcast coverage. The arrangements under clause 3(2) could just about work with only one designated referendum campaign organisation on each side but, with more than one, the whole arrangement could easily descend into confusion and disarray. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe did not foresee that consequence, but we must accept that it could happen. The amendment could serve to defeat the Neill committee proposal that the broadcasters follow the lead of the electoral commission by allocating referendum broadcasts to designated campaign organisations. Although referendum broadcasts were a feature of the 1975 referendum, they have not appeared in subsequent referendum campaigns because of the difficulty of ensuring balance between the two sides. Under the Neill scheme, the necessary balance would be achieved by allocating air-time to the two umbrella organisations, one for each side, formally recognised as such by the electoral commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I am slightly confused. Which clause is the Minister speaking to?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am speaking to clause 2 and the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. I am referring to the consequences of accepting those amendments. The hon. Gentleman's intervention was a nice try, but I know that you were listening attentively, Mr. Wells.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I was a little lost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I have many roles in life--some more onerous than others--but I am not prepared to take on the task of guiding the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
If the electoral commission--or, in this case, the referendums commission--formally recognised three organisations on one side but only two on the other, the required balance could be lost, which could rule out the prospect of having any referendum broadcasts.
<P>
Amendment No. 21 would make an important refinement to the provisions in the Bill on the award of public funding to designated campaign organisations.
<P>
Under clause 3(1), the designated referendum campaign for each possible outcome in a referendum must receive the same level of core funding. I understand that there is a strong argument for that approach, which rests on the principle that the arrangements for the conduct of referendums must be scrupulously even-handed to each side. That is not a matter of contention between members of the Committee. In the case of core funding, even-handedness means that the same level of grant is given to each side.
<P>
Before accepting that argument, it is worth probing it a little further. We need to examine why the Neill Committee proposed that referendum campaign organisations should be publicly funded. In its report, the Committee expressed concern that, in any given referendum, what it described as the ``big battalions''--the governing party and possibly the main opposition parties, the bulk of industry and the trade unions--could be lined up on one side of the argument, while opinion on the other side could be fragmented, disorganised and unable to find a clear, single expression. That would not be satisfactory. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston described a similar possibility during his speech.
<P>
In the Neill Committee's view, it would be wrong if those who were less well funded and organised did not have a proper chance to make their views known. As a result of that analysis, the Committee concluded that there should be equal access to core funding. That is the difficulty with some of the proposed arrangements. In reaching that recommendation, the Committee commended the precedent set by the 1975 referendum campaign. As has been said, under the Referendum Act 1975, a grant of £125,000 was made to the two umbrella campaign organisations--Britain in Europe and the National Referendum Campaign. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield was an employee, or at least a supporter, of one of those organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> He has declared his interest.
<P>
The Committee will recall that, on Second Reading, I explained that the ability of campaigning organisations to raise additional funds from private sources varied enormously. As a result, although the Government grant represented 94 per cent. of the National Referendum Campaign's total income, it amounted to only 8 per cent. of Britain in Europe's income, but only 8 per cent. of Britain in Europe's.
<P>
If, as the Neill report suggests, the purpose of any grant is to ensure that each side has sufficient funds so that it can run at least a minimal campaign, it is worth considering whether the electoral commission should have a discretion to award different sums to different referendum campaigns, according to their means. The amendments offer one solution. Amendment No. 21 would set the range of the grant to be paid, but within that range it would be for the referendums commission to decide how much an organisation should be awarded. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe covered that.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As well as affording the commission some discretion in those matters, the amendment places a helpful cash limit on the total amount of any grant paid to one organisation. The Bill is silent on the amount of grant to be paid to designated referendum campaign organisations. Regard must be paid to what is reasonable and affordable and the amendment addresses that point. The proposed upper limit of £600,000 is, as members of the Committee will be aware, the figure suggested in the Neill report. The figure is the equivalent at today's prices of the £125,000 grant paid to the two umbrella organisations in the 1975 referendum. We should not forget that the Neill report suggested that designated campaign organisations should also receive other benefits, including a free mailing to all households--a considerable subsidy that is, as those of us who have fought general elections will know, applied even-handedly and is of benefit to all candidates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> A point about the press has occurred to me. The way in which the press report one side or other of a campaign is influential--an example is the headline of the 1992 general election:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If Kinnock wins today, would the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How does one achieve a balance between campaigns in monetary terms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Particular standards apply to broadcasters; as the hon. Member for Tatton will know, the BBC charter contains a provision about political balance. The medium of print is a different matter; the broadcasters I know are jealous about the circumstances of the press. Without trying to exert control over editorial freedom, which is a difficult area into which to stray, it is difficult to require the press to maintain balance in a general election or referendum campaign. The measure that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South asks us to consider would not be worth it--although it is of course unfortunate that the media can occasionally be entirely biased towards one side of an argument. That affects not only political parties but can have a profound effect on the important debates of a campaign.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> I am sorry if the Minister misunderstood what I was saying. I meant that one of the ways in which the prominence that the press give one side of a campaign is influential is because the other side of the campaign may then be reported in a short paragraph at the bottom of page 7. In the context of referendums, one must take account of that disparity of reporting.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask members of the Committee to bear in mind that although we must discuss broadcast coverage under the amendment, the broader questions of how, when and in what form broadcasting would be permitted is out of order.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Are there not reports of what the papers say every day on television--on early morning and late night programmes? That is why I brought up the issue. If there are prominent headlines and minimal reporting, the result is bias.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The question of the balance of press coverage is not in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am content to leave the issue with my remarks about broadcasters and not stray any further along the path that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South characteristically attempted.
<P>
I welcome the opportunity provided by new clause 5 to discuss the important question of expenditure limits. I agree that the matter requires careful consideration. For the purposes of comparison, the Neill Committee concluded in the context of general elections that expenditure limits were appropriate and should be applied. It suggested a figure of £20 million for parties contesting more than 600 seats. Many of the arguments advanced in favour of spending limits at election could equally be applied to referendum campaigns.
<P>
It is well worth recalling the Neill Committee's arguments. The first is that the absence of limits creates an unlimited demand for funds to pay for expenditure, and that such a demand would compel referendum campaigns to turn to wealthy individuals and organisations for donations. That would create at least the suspicion, however unfounded it may be, that influence or access is being bought. As the Neill Committee suggested, the full and prompt disclosure of donations would go a long way to addressing that concern. We should remember why the Neill Committee was set up and why we are debating the matter. We want things to be seen to be above board and on a proper basis so that no one can create the suspicion of improper influence in a campaign through donations. We should be mindful of what the Neill Committee said on the subject.
<P>
The Neill Committee's second argument was that extravagant spending by referendum organisations could bring the whole process into disrepute. That is where we come to some of the arguments. Referendum campaigns could turn from battles of ideas, which all members of the Committee would like them to be, into battles between advertising agencies. There is nothing wrong with the use of public relations to advance an argument--I am sure that both sides in any campaign will make intelligent use of such agencies--but that is different from the arguments being taken over entirely by the advertising industry, which I think none of us would welcome.
<P>
Having considered those arguments, the Neill Committee came to the view that, in principle, the case for imposing spending limits on referendum campaigns was a strong one. The Committee concluded that the attempt to impose such limits would be futile. The issue was therefore one of practicality and principle, about which the hon. Member for West Dorset argued. We can see why it would be important to set spending limits, but they would be difficult to apply in practice. The hon. Gentleman challenged my ingenuity to come up with a scheme. I do not have a ready solution to the problem; it needs continued consideration and, hopefully, we shall produce a formula. The draft Bill that we shall publish before the summer will enable us to have an intelligent debate on the subject.
<P>
It is right to submit the Neill Committee's conclusion to proper scrutiny. If there are, as we intend, ceilings on general election expenditure, it is only right to consider limits for referendum expenditure. We have not reached a conclusion on that, so, while it is interesting to do so, it would probably be inappropriate and futile for me to speculate now on how such proposals should be implemented.
<P>
If the balance of the argument is that there should be limits, we would have to decide what they should be. New clause 5 proposes a regime that has one limit for designated campaign organisations and another, lower limit, for all other participating organisations. That approach is interesting and it has been worth exploring in today's debate. It needs further consideration, even though it could give rise to problems.
<P>
As for designated campaign organisations, the limit is set at twice the amount of public funds awarded under clause 3. As I have said, the Bill gives no indication of the level of public funding and, consequently, we do not know what spending limit will apply. Neill proposed that core funding should be £600,000, which would mean a spending limit of £1.2 million. It is a matter of judgment whether that figure is the right one.
<P>
In a national referendum on, say, joining the single currency, the limit might be considered as being on the low side when set against the £20 million limit proposed by Neill for a general election. I accept, however, that an election and a referendum are not directly comparable. In fact, we could have an interesting debate on how far reaching the results of one general election might be compared with how far reaching the entry into the single currency would be. Setting one campaign against another gives us an idea of what must be taken into account.
<P>
Subsection (2) of the new clause would set a limit of £1,000 for all other bodies. It follows that all other campaigners must also be similarly circumscribed. I fear, however, that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe may have taken an unduly restrictive approach. An analogy can be drawn with the limit on third-party spending set out in the Representation of the People Act 1983, section 75 of which provides for a limit of only £5 on expenditure incurred by a third party--someone acting without the authority of the candidate or his agent, with a view to promoting the election of a candidate.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South said, the European Court of Human Rights ruled last year in the case of Bowman that the £5 limitation on third-party expenditure was equivalent to a total ban and constituted an unjustified restriction of Mrs. Bowman's freedom of expression. There is a danger that the courts would take a similar view of the proposed £1,000 expenditure limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That is the speech that I was going to make after the Minister had spoken. It is plain that that would be a serious danger, and I am interested to hear that the Minister's officials concur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is the case. We have thought about it and that is our conclusion.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Is it my hon. Friend's impression that the reaction of the court will differ according to the size of the limit? The court might feel that £1,000 is too low, but that £5,000 is reasonable, or will it say that any limit is against human rights law?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That would have to be tested in a court. If the courts have ruled on a £5 limit, it is possible that they could rule on other amounts, but I am not willing to speculate on that now. How the principle will be applied in the case of a different level of expenditure is not something on which I wish to speculate. The £5 limit, which Mrs. Bowman successfully challenged, applied to one parliamentary constituency. If we multiply that by 659, the equivalent national figure would be more than £3,000. Any figure provided for in this Bill would therefore need to be significantly higher, but again, I do not want to speculate on the amount of money involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> The Representation of the People Act 1983 is important, as is the Bowman ruling. After the recent shenanigans in Newark, that Act must be revisited, and the Bowman ruling is likely to be revisited as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I regret that the hon. Gentleman used the term shenanigans, whatever his opinion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> Legal shenanigans.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have permitted sedentary interventions in order not to be too restrictive, but they are severely disruptive to the progress of our business and quickly lead to the Committee being out of order. I ask all hon. Members to desist from making such interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Thank you, Mr. Wells. I shall try to heed your warning. On the situation in Newark, I think that the hon. Member for Blaby is aware that I chair a working party--
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Let me explain. I chair a Home Office working party consisting of representatives from the Conservative party, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party, electoral administrations and other professions, including local government. We are considering the electoral process and are trying to make it more friendly and reform it in a way that will benefit the electorate as a whole. We intend our proposals to be uncontroversial, which is why it is cross party in character and nature. As a result of the case in Newark, we may have further to consider the issue. However, I am not sure whether that case has a direct read-across to this issue.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It does not have a read-across. The Minister has been misled down this path, and the issue is clearly out of order. We are discussing referendums, not elections. I ask the Minister to return to the amendments that we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> the Neill committee gave a great deal of thought to local government and it makes a recommendation for general elections. However, we have to be realistic.
<P>
The clause is a helpful contribution to the debate on spending limits in referendum campaigns. As I have said, given the Neill committee's recommendation in favour of spending limits at general elections, we think it only right to consider the case for such limits in referendum campaigns---notwithstanding that that is a thorny issue to confront, as has been shown in this debate.
<P>
As part of our considerations, I will take great notice of this debate because it has been helpful in exploring some of the knotty and difficult issues involved in the principle of setting expenditure limits in referendum campaigns. Although I think that none of us is any clearer about the proper solution, it is only by dismissing suggestions that we can arrive at that point, and perhaps seek inspiration elsewhere.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> We have had a long and informative debate. We have carefully considered various issues on spending limits and other matters. The Minister's contribution has been helpful.  The Bill is not designed to be perfect. We are not in a position to do that; we cannot consider everything.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said, we should like a Bill to be introduced before the summer recess and enacted before any future referendum takes place. Such a Bill might deal with everything that has been mentioned; it might be more erudite than this Bill---it has rightly been described as a magnum opus. I look forward to seeing the Minister labouring to bring forward that magnum opus.
<P>
We cannot consider everything, and we do not think that we should do so. We have tried to deal with the Neill committee's  intentions. The Bill will make the position much better than it is now, and much better than that which Lord Neill identified in the Welsh and other referendums. That is our aim. I make no apology for introducing an imperfect Bill; I do not have the phalanx of civil servants that the Government employ, notwithstanding the best efforts of Mrs. Thatcher to cut their numbers.
<P>
I shall not dwell at length on amendment No. 7, because, as the hon. Member for Broxtowe has said, it has been negated by events. We can discuss broadcasting in future.
<P>
I shall deal with amendment No. 21 in greater detail. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston has returned, because he tabled that amendment. As has been said, the Neill committee suggested that minimum core funding should be £600,000. As Parliament will determine who spends the money, it should decide how much is made available for each referendum. Indeed, that happened in 1975---the amount was specified in the Referendum Act 1975. Several hon. Members have rightly said that £600,000 does not go far these days.
<P>
The Minister and other hon. Members have talked about dividing up the  money. I do not accept that point. I return to the argument that it would be up to grown-up political campaigns to sort out how that should happen, with the commission's discretion. It would be for Parliament and the commission to ensure that the money was spent sensibly. It would be for those involved in a campaign to determine how to spend the money. That would be much better than the present position. 
<P>
New clause 5 is a wider proposal and introduces some valuable points on spending limits. Although subsection (1) of  the new clause seems attractive initially, those who feel strongly about an issue would not be allowed to pursue it. Democratic rights were mentioned not only by Lord Neill, but by the Labour Government in 1975.
<P>
The Neill committee found that the Government were right in 1975 to decide that it would be a negation of free speech to limit the amount that people might wish to spend on a particular campaign. Neill was specific about that. In paragraph 12.46, he stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it would be futile and possibly also wrong to attempt to impose such limits in connection with referendums.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That backs up what the Minister said. Neill discusses that point and then, in paragraph 12.47, he states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Given this possibility, we believe that seeking to impose spending limits in referendums would not only be administratively impracticable but it would, or at least might, impose an unwarranted restriction on freedom of speech.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is also my view. For instance, if James Goldsmith---whom God preserve; may he rest in peace---wished to spend his money on something, surely that was up to him. Such spending must be determined by the owner of the money. That is why spending limits must be dealt with by the Government. I am sorry that the Minister is just stepping out, because it is not within the scope of the Bill to deal with spending limits.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston mentioned the Costa Rican £2 million. I share his grave concerns about large donations, especially foreign donations, whether they come from Asil Nadir or Bernie Ecclestone. We have all-party agreement that foreign donations and other large donations should be declared. We look forward to the Government bringing forward their provisions on that subject. I believe that it may also be included in the draft Bill. The amendments and the new clause should not be accepted. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to all hon. Members for their lively and varied comments on amendment No. 7 and new clause 5. I was also interested to hear their views on amendment No. 21. I shall seek to withdraw amendment No. 7 for the reasons that I mentioned earlier. As the hon. Member for Blaby pointed out, it has been overtaken by events. However, I shall continue to point out that the problem of multiple, incompatible campaigns for the same outcome has not been resolved.
<P>
We all agree that the possibility envisaged by the hon. Member for Blaby of there being two umbrella organisations working harmoniously together is desirable. We also agree that that will happen nine times out of 10. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield remarked, it happened on the previous referendum. It will doubtless be the rule rather than the exception. However, sooner or later, that will not happen. We shall then be left with a disaster because, according to the Neill recommendations, one side of the campaign will receive no public money. That is entirely unacceptable, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will review that, which he kindly offered to do in drawing up his draft Bill.
<P>
There is another substantial difficulty. The promoter and supporters of the Bill sought to argue that a quick Bill was necessary to cover the possibility of a referendum being held soon, but if they cannot deal with the problems of spending limits and multiple campaigns, the Bill will be defective because  it cannot guarantee a balanced referendum. That is a substantial snag. I wonder whether, during further consideration of the Bill, its promoter and supporters might introduce amendments to cover those points. I recognise, as my hon. Friend the Minister and hon. Members from both sides of the Committee explained, that new clause 5 contains substantial flaws. I recognise also that it is likely to be overturned by the courts.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> The debate has been illuminating. The hon. Members for Blaby and for West Dorset have acknowledged my anxiety that the Bill would not achieve the result that the hon. Member for Blaby described on Second Reading--referendums being conducted fairly. Regardless of the strengths and weaknesses of my amendments and of those that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe has tabled, there is an overwhelming problem that neither those amendments nor any of the ideas that we have bounced around have produced a solution to the overriding problem of imbalance.
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Minister publishes his draft Bill in the summer, the Committee should unite in suggesting that members of the public and organisations who want to respond to that Bill present ideas about how to create a balance, although I am not sure whether we can. Otherwise we shall end up not with the insurance policy that the hon. Member for West Dorset described, but with a defective insurance policy that will not deliver the equity that we are trying to instil in referendums.
<P>
To use the analogy that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South used, if we are not careful, we shall end up with another Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. I realise that that was not the intention of the hon. Member for Blaby, who has promoted the Bill in all seriousness. However, some difficult issues have yet to be grasped.
<P>
I shall not press amendment No. 21 because I acknowledge some of the sound points that the hon. Members for West Dorset and for Blaby made about my logic being defective, just as my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe has similarly acknowledged. We must all admit that none of us has invented a formula that could properly regulate the equity that is desired in referendums, whether national or regional.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

THE CHAIRMAN, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments and new clauses proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68 and Standing Order No. 89. That the clause stand part of the Bill:--

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 2, leave out lines 9 to 16 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1)Payment shall be made to the nominated treasurer of each designated campaign of the sums fixed by the Commission, provided that--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Commission invited applications for designation under section 2(1)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Clause 3 presents several difficulties, which I hope that the various options outlined in the amendment will enable us to explore. A curious feature of the Bill is the oblique and incomplete way in which it deals with the important matter of passing public money to an organisation to assist its campaign. The fundamental weakness of the clause is that it deals with what may not be done, rather than what will be done. The intention is that payments should be made to designated campaigns in certain circumstances and the Bill should clearly state that, which is the purpose of amendment No. 22.
<P>
The second purpose of the amendment is to make it clear beyond doubt that money is to be spent on the campaign, not on any other matter. That may seem a fairly obvious point, but it would be improper for public money to be handed over to an organisation without there being proper accounting procedure to ensure that it is used for the correct purpose. Before money is paid to campaign organisations, the commission should be satisfied that it will be deployed properly or that it has already been correctly spent.
<P>
Money should not go simply into the general balances of the organisation. I shall briefly illustrate my argument how public money should be handled properly. I am involved in the setting up of a conference that is using public money from both the Department of Trade and Industry and the European Commission. The body corporate that is organising the conference has rightly had to set up a separate internal organisation with separate accounting procedures, so that the application of funds can be clearly designated. That is especially important in referendum campaigns that could be fairly controversial.
<P>
I tabled amendment No. 23 to avoid any doubt that the accounts kept by a designated campaign organisation should cover not only what it has received and spent from public funds, but the sums that it receives from other quarters. I accept that that was the objective of the Bill's promoter, but there is no harm in making it clear. Neill laid great emphasis on transparency.
<P>
Amendment No. 24, the spirit of which I think the hon. Member for Blaby has accepted, would require the addresses of donors as well as their names to be recorded. Its intention is to ensure transparency in the procedure and, if we can stick with our Costa Rican example, that it is not a back-door way to receive money from this notorious person, yet to be named.
<P>
The point of amendment No. 25 is that there will inevitably be an interval between the beginning of a referendum campaign and the time when organisations are designated by the commission. It is desirable that the accounts of sums received from other sources than the public purse should run from the earliest possible moment. Otherwise, a large war chest could be built up in advance of the dates of designation, without organisations having to put those donations and expenditures into public notice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> Is my hon. Friend saying that if there is the possibility of a referendum, and donations are received towards that referendum campaign by any party in the period between the Bill reaching the statute book and the commission's designation, those contributions should be brought within the overall campaign?
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I think that the straight answer is yes, if I have understood my hon. Friend. We are trying to avoid the temptation of an organisation with an idea up its sleeve generating a referendum and building up a war chest, thereby ending up with a financial advantage over other organisations.
<P>
The amendment would substitute the date when organisations apply for designation for the date that they are designated. The amendment would improve the Bill as the question of whether a referendum campaign is regarded as open requires a great deal of thought.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. At this stage, it is customary for Committees to suspend for an hour and a half in order to be refreshed. I expect to resume at 8.30 pm.

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Because it has been a long day, may I propose that we adjourn the Committee until next Wednesday?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is customary for those in charge of the Bill to make such a motion. I cannot accept a motion to adjourn from those who are not in that position. I suspend the Committee and we will resume consideration at 8.45 this evening.

<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 2, line 21, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) A campaign shall forfeit its status as a designated campaign, and shall refund any moneys paid to it under this Act, if--
<P>
(a) it receives any money or goods or services (other than ones duly paid for by way of an ordinary commercial transaction) from individuals not entitled to vote in a general election or from companies not registered in Great Britain or Northern Ireland; or
<P>
(b) a donation which it received from a company has not been specially authorised by the company's shareholders.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the most important amendment that we have discussed so far today. It brings us back, tangentially, to our man from Costa Rica. As has already been pointed out, the Bill purports to implement the Neill Committee recommendations in respect of referendums. However, as I indicated at length, it does so in a partial and incomplete fashion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he believes that the amendment is tremendously important. He may--inadvertently, I am sure--have overlooked an important matter. The amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``individuals not entitled to vote in a general election.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are many people who are EU citizens and take a big interest in local elections, as I know from talking to a number of them during the campaign for last week's local elections. They are entitled to vote in those elections because they are EU citizens, but are not entitled to vote in general elections. Would the hon. Gentleman concede at the outset that the amendment, however great its merit, may be seriously flawed? As it stands, it would rule out donations from people who live in this country--and may have lived here for 20, 30 or 40 years--and are EU citizens and who are entitled to vote in local elections. The amendment would exclude them from contributing to a referendum campaign, and that surely cannot be right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In the course of the Committee's proceedings, I have tolerated long interventions, which should really take the form of separate speeches. I ask hon. Members to make their interventions short, succinct and to the point. Of course, if they wish to elaborate later on, they can catch my eye and make a separate speech. That would facilitate the Committee's progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I shall be short, succinct and to the point in responding to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. The answer is yes, I did consider his point, and I believe that the amendment's wording stands up to examination. I shall explain that to the Committee in a few minutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The other issue that does not appear to be addressed is that of Members of the House of Lords. Does the hon. Gentleman not think that the exclusion of the nobility from funding referendums could be in breach of their human rights?
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am planning ahead and looking forward to the next millennium rather than looking back on the past one. I expect Members of the second Chamber to be able to vote. There may be some quirky results following the vote last night, but Members of the second Chamber should have a right to vote. I do not know whether that will transpire, given the structure of the second Chamber that may result from the legislation that is being dealt with down the Corridor. I will, however, restrict my remarks to the words on the amendment paper.
<P>
The amendment is important. The principle behind it is to bring the Bill back towards the spirit of Neill's recommendations on referendums. In that way, we will remove at least some of the potential for partiality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I apologise for missing some of the hon. Gentleman's opening statement. Where exactly does Neill mention those matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> The point that I am making--the hon. Gentleman was present when I made it this afternoon--is that the whole spirit of Neill is one of fairness and impartiality in relation to the conduct of referendums. The flaw in the Bill is that that impartiality could be damaged. In particular, I can find no reference in it to the restrictions that the Neill Committee recommended for political parties and other organisations that take part in referendum campaigns. Neill recommended that all referendum campaign organisations, whether designated as umbrella organisations or not, should be required to observe much the same requirements as those that it recommended for political parties in election campaigns.
<P>
One relevant factor, which we discussed earlier, is the Bill's failure to place constraints on, for example, foreign donations. Donations must come from, what I think Neill describes as, permissible sources and donations from companies must be approved by shareholders. The amendment would add those sensible requirements to the Bill in the interests of making it as true a proxy for the proper Neill package as is possible, given its present limited structure.
<P>
In a properly structured Bill, it would, of course, be possible to go much further, but I shall not stray from the words on the amendment paper. The only sanction for non-compliance which can be readily applied under the present, limited Bill is the forfeiture of designated campaign status and its financial advantages, for which the amendment provides. That is a long way short of what Neill recommends, but it is better than nothing. I believe that the hon. Member for Blaby is serious about the Bill. If he cannot accept the wording of the amendment, given the interventions made by the hon. Members for Surrey Heath and for Beaconsfield, we may be able to agree an appropriate variant to consider on Report. The amendment would block one of the loopholes that we discussed earlier this afternoon, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall be brief. Amendment No. 26 is certainly an interesting subject for discussion, and may even have some merit. However, it appears to pre-empt the discussion that we know is already taking place about the funding of political parties. It would be a grave mistake for us to go off at a tangent on some of those issues.
<P>
The amendment would essentially limit funding to British nationals. I do not necessarily disagree with that, but we know that an exemption has been contemplated to the funding of political parties in Northern Ireland for people in the Irish Republic and the United States of America--a proposal that would excite a considerable amount of comment from me. However, that has been proposed and a justification has been given for it. It is perfectly obvious that in so far as that has relevance to political parties, it also has relevance to referendums. We can perfectly well imagine that referendums may take place in Northern Ireland, when the amendment's provision would be criticised. The amendment must be considered in relation to the funding of political parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify what he meant by the circumstances in Northern Ireland from which the provision would detract?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As I understand it, it has been suggested that in future there should be no foreign funding of political parties. However, I think--I may be corrected if I have got it wrong--that the Government have expressed some sympathy with the suggestion that special provision should be made for Northern Ireland to allow funding for political parties there from both the Irish Republic and the United States of America. That has been suggested, although I know that the subject is still under discussion. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would run counter to that provision, if the Government were eventually to decide to propose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if we debar people who can vote in local elections from participating in a campaign, we will be in breach of the European convention on human rights? Also, foreign nationals who vote in local elections often have a great interest in their locality and are used to local campaigns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right, and pre-empts my next topic. I have set out my first objection. I shall not repeat what the hon. Gentleman has just said, but he is right. My second objection is that, if the provision applies to local issues, debarring local people who have the right to vote in local elections has not been thought through.
<P>
I come back to the point on which my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath and I both intervened. The amendment would disqualify Members of the other place. I find that astonishing. The suggestion of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston that such a step has been thought through is even more astonishing. It is an interesting discussion topic, but the hon. Gentleman has not thought it through enough even for the purposes of this discussion.
<P>
When one considers the proposal against the background of the future funding of political parties, it is obvious that it has no place in the Bill. If, at some later date, the Government introduce a measure that affects political parties and the way in which they are funded, that will be the time to consider to what extent an amendment should be made to the Bill. Until that has happened, there is no call for making such an amendment to this piece of legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I will be brief. During the short speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, the hon. Member for Blaby asked where in the Neill report this issue was mentioned. I draw the Committee's attention to chapter 12 on referendums. Paragraph 92 on page 13 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Campaigning individuals and organisations taking part in referendum campaigns should be restricted to the receipt of donations only from a `permissible source'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston used the phrase ``a permissible source'' in his explanation. The report then refers the reader to paragraph 12.51 on page 171, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We have also set out in Chapter 5 our views about the inappropriateness of foreign donations playing a part in the politics of this country. In that chapter, we discussed the issue in relation to the funding of political parties, but the same arguments apply with equal if not more force to the funding of referendum campaigns, especially since these are likely to be concerned with major constitutional questions. We believe, therefore, that the same rules about `permissible sources' that we recommend should apply to political parties and others in connection with foreign donations should also apply to individuals and organisations, including political parties, taking part in referendum campaigns.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clear message is that Lord Neill and those on the cttee believe that this issue should be addressed in the context of referendums.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> I am puzzled about that, particularly as my hon. Friend the Minister and I both come from Merseyside. Merseyside has a lot of foreign investment, and we want more. If we are to have referendums in Merseyside, as we will from time to time, will foreign investors with material input into our area be denied any participation in an argument that has significance for the whole area?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will cover that point briefly in a moment as a general proposition, and then say why there may be room for further debate. I believe that those principles would, for the most part, apply as much to referendums of a national character as they do to the funding of political parties. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath said that some people may be eligible to vote in local but not national elections. The same would apply to European elections.
<P>
The crucial distinction between any issue that is to be decided by referendum on a national issue of any description is that those who are eligible to take part in national issues by virtue of the fact that they are entitled to vote in a general election are in a different category from people who, for different reasons, might be entitled to take part in European elections which, after all, are Europe-wide, and similarly might choose to be involved in local elections, in which the qualifications are different. There is good reason for that. Those who have a stake in this country, which can be expressed in the sense that they have made themselves eligible to vote in a national election, are obviously different in character and obligations and rights from someone else. That seems to be manifestly the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I very much follow the Minister's argument, but does he recognise the force of my earlier--perhaps too lengthy--intervention on the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, that those who have lived in this country for many years and taken the trouble to register to vote in local elections also fall within the category of people who have a stake in this country? That is why the amendment is defective.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am coming to that--I told my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South that I would respond to his point in a moment.
<P>
The general principle that Neill set out applies to any national referendum. The same goes for the second part of the amendment, which deals with donations from a company that has no special authorisation by shareholders. It is reasonable that a company's shareholders should be consulted in some way about such donations. It seems unreasonable for sums of money to be used for political purposes--whether that is in a referendum or to help fund a political party--without those who, through their shareholding, have a stake in that company being in any way consulted. That is an important principle, which Neill felt it necessary to address.
<P>
Regarding Members of another place, its future status and how Members will arrive there are now under discussion. Some principles have been established but others remain to be decided. If such an exclusion were to apply in this Bill or in a subsequent piece of legislation, clearly it would have to be put right in terms of the rights and privileges of Members of the other place. That will be determined by separate legislation, which is now under consideration. I do not think that it is an insurmountable objection.
<P>
I accept, however, that there may be a difficulty in respect of the eligibility of people who may not be registered to vote in a general election, but who are eligible to vote in a local election to take part in a local referendum. I can see some merit in that suggestion, but we would have to be very careful about the circumstances in which it were permissible. How strong a connection, in business, residential or other terms, would we look for? A series of factors would have to be taken into account, which we are not likely to resolve here and now.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Would it not be simplest to refer to individuals who are entitled to vote in this referendum? That will need to be defined at some stage, and they are the ones who have an interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That may be one way of looking at it. I can see merit in giving the issue further consideration.
<P>
I said that I would be brief. The point that I wanted to make is that the arguments behind the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the principles that he is trying to establish are good ones. Some of the issues that have been raised, particularly about local referendums, mean that further thought should be given to the application of those principles. However, we should not shy away from the fact that it is consistent with Neill.
<P>
I can hear the Division Bell ringing to tell us that the House has adjourned, so this is a good point at which to sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I can also be very brief. First, I want to adopt everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, but I also want to reinforce my concern that those who have been granted the right to vote in local elections should definitely have the right to participate in any referendum because they have, as I said, taken conscious steps to make known their stake in this country and in its electoral processes. Those who are qualified to vote in a referendum should be qualified to donate to it.
<P>
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Broxtowe that there could be separate rules for referendums, making the entitlement similar to that for general elections. That might rule out EU citizens who have lived in this country for 20, 30 or 40 years and who are entitled to vote in local elections. Many members of the Committee will have such people living in their constituencies--many live in mine. I am concerned that those citizens should have the right to vote.
<P>
It is with great pleasure that I adopt the views expressed in an intervention by the hon. Member for St. Helens, South. His independence of mind is greatly appreciated, not only in Committee but in the House generally. I frequently agree with him, especially when he is in disagreement with his own party. One reason why he is so cherished and respected as a senior member of the House, as well as a senior member of the profession to which I belong, is that he has always preserved independence of mind over party loyalty.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right that people running overseas companies that have invested in an area such as Merseyside should have the right to donate to a referendum campaign. They would satisfy a test of having taken a stake in this country. If managers of overseas companies who live here have been prepared to provide much inward investment and to employ many of our citizens, they should surely have the right to donate to a referendum campaign. The rules must allow for that possibility.
<P>
I perceive another drafting defect in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. It concerns a matter of company law, and may persuade the hon. Member to withdraw his amendment. If he looks into company law--and I defer to my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South if I am mistaken--he will find that there is no such thing in company law as ``specially authorised''. In order to fit in with company law, the amendment would have to talk about resolutions at a special, extraordinary or annual general meeting. I see my hon. Friend nodding to confirm that his interpretation is the same as mine.
<P>
Could I persuade the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston that, in both regards, his amendment does not fit the case? It would not implement the Neill Committee's recommendations, as Opposition Members at least wish to do, and it is defective. It would be better if the Bill were allowed to proceed without his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath that there is a defect in part (b) of the amendment. I nearly called him my learned friend, in the manner of the courtesies of the House. After he embarrassed me to the point of blushing in his praise, I thought carefully about how I might make my reference.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right--there is no such provision in legislation concerning companies. A decision on such a matter would have to be taken at a general meeting or at a specially convened general meeting. The spirit of the amendment is right. I have argued for many years that companies should not make donations to organisation X, Y or Z without the approval of shareholders. That would be logical, just as trade unions should only give from a political fund that is authorised by the trade union. I have argued that case for many years, too, as hon. Members will know, because it is only proper and democratic.
<P>
With part (a) of the amendment, we run the risk in Committee of running into a large bear pit. That pit represents the Neill Committee report, which is held up as the Gideon Bible of all good thinking. However, it is not--it is flawed. When we come to consider the provision for the funding of political parties, those of us who might be described as old hands, and who have probably been around the party machines across the House for too long, know how such matters work. We want honesty and integrity in political funding, but the report does not acknowledge the day-to-day effects of running a political party. The idea of placing ceilings on money is perhaps optimistic.
<P>
If we try to adopt the Neill Committee's thinking on referendums, we shall run into the same bear trap as it ran into on political funding. We must accept that there are two types of referendum--national and local. They will be interdeveloped in our system, and I am not adverse to either. Of course the major political parties will be involved in national referendums and we will have all the regulations that come from that. However, local referendums will, for example, affect Merseyside and Rutland water, where there has been an on-going row for some years, as my sister, who lives in the area, tells me frequently. The interests involved will, therefore, not necessarily be political, but cross-political. In environmental and other matters, people in an area often have a commonality of interests; they are not sectored and divided by political parties. We must, therefore, consider such referendums.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, European nationals who are entitled to vote in our local elections. To the surprise of some of the Scottish authorities, they are also entitled to vote in Scottish elections--a very fast ruling was made to that effect last Thursday. Do we, therefore, deny people who have a right to vote in the local parliamentary context in Scotland and Wales the right to take part in a referendum that relates to their area? That would be nonsensical and entirely wrong, just as it would be to deny them the right to contribute.
<P>
Many firms are, for example, headquartered in Germany and elsewhere. That is true of Mercedes-Benz and Japanese companies, all of which have massive investments in locales in the United Kingdom. I do not know how we would enforce this, but should we tell them, ``There has to be an order from your board before you can donate to the local campaign to save the Mersey basin''? The basin stretches up into Cheshire and has on-going effects there, and the hon. Member for Tatton will know about cleaning up the Mersey and restoring the mud flats. That is a local, not a national issue. Companies that are interested in the environment and their employees' workplace are as entitled as others to participate, even though their head offices and centres of operation may be many thousands of miles away.
<P>
I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston--I always call him the man from across the water--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> The king.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> The man from across the water. I urge him to withdraw the amendment. I urge the promoter of the Bill to take on board the points that Labour and Opposition Members have made. They are all aware of the distinction between national and local referendums and between the rights to participate in them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I shall not dwell long on the debate. It has been short, but it has raised some important issues. One extremely important matter, which I hope the Government will tackle, is the review of political funding. My point above all else is that that issue is extraneous to the Bill. The questions of political funding and foreign donations are extremely important, and we cannot deal with them sufficiently well in this small Bill. As the Minister and other hon. Members know, we want the Government to introduce their own full package as soon as possible. That is why we have written the Bill.
<P>
I stand corrected by the Minister on my comments about the Neill Committee and municipal sources. Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston was not as well informed as the Minister and was unable to correct me immediately. The Minister brought out the relevant chapter and verse, which is what I wanted.
<P>
The amendment is highly defective, as the hon. Member for St. Helens, South revealed. I agree entirely with him that the Neill report is not a bible and is not perfect. That is why we want the Government to introduce their proposals and to enact them before there is a further referendum.
<P>
Various aspects of the amendment are not perfect. Is a foreign company one that is registered abroad? Does the term include subsidiaries of companies that are registered abroad and subsidiaries that are registered here? We are getting very deep into a quagmire of legalise about which I am unable to make a judgment, although my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath and the hon. Member for St. Helens, South might be able to do so.
<P>
The hon. Member for St. Helens, South briefly mentioned unions. Why refer to companies, but not unions? That is a fair point. Incidentally, while we are discussing people who are not allowed to vote in this country, I recall from my British constitution alternative ``O'' level that madmen are not allowed to vote. However, merely to be registered mad does not necessarily mean that one loses control over one's moneys Could a designated campaign be thrown out because of some madman? There are many of those, I suggest, in this place.
<P>
The debate has raised some important issues that should be addressed by the Government. However, I contend that the amendment is not only extraneous to the Bill, but defective, and I urge the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I was about to seek your protection, Mr. Wells, when the hon. Member for Blaby talked about madmen and pointed his pen at me. This has been an interesting debate, and I shall respond to a couple of the points that were raised.
<P>
A distinction can neatly be made in respect of foreign companies--that is, to take into account not where a company is registered but where its capital base is located. In my constituency, General Motors is an example of a company that acts completely honourably in terms of political activities with a capital or small p. As everyone knows, Vauxhall, although it is a good British name, is ultimately owned by an American corporation. General Motors has a corporate policy not to interfere in the politics of any country in which it operates, and that would include referendums. That is an honourable position, which should be defended in the context of companies working within western-style democracies.
<P>
By foreign donors, I mean people who are resident abroad but sending money into the pot here. In terms of foreign individuals who live in this country, there appears to be general agreement across the principal parties that are represented in the House of Commons that some of those individuals, who may have been here for a long time, have not earned the right to hold a British passport. I am thinking of one chap with a small shop just down the road. It would be odd if we included him because he has been here for 35 years, while excluding people who are European citizens but have been here for only five years.
<P>
There are many potential anomalies, and I recognise that there is an element of right on all sides of the debate. I acknowledge that my drafting does not meet the views of all members of the Committee. I always bow in such matters to the legal expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South, who has advised me on more than one occasion. We should try to find a way of incorporating this principle into the Bill, and I hope that it will be possible to do so in a revised form on Report. In the light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up. and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The Bill's author has said time and again that it is an insurance measure--a fire measure--just in case the Government, whom he seeks to force to introduce legislation, do not do so. I am entirely in agreement with such a safety step. The purpose of new clause 2 is to give the Government sufficient time.
<P>
In January 2001, we will be approaching the next general election. As I understand it, the Government are bringing out a draft Bill this summer, so by January 2000 they will have had a year and a half to bring that legislation to the Floor of the House. Were they to fail to do that, the Bill of the hon. Member for Blaby would come in as a protective measure through the general election period and enable us to reconsider the issue in the next Parliament. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will agree that the new clause is a sensible, just and simple insurance matter, which comes within the spirit of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The danger is that the Government might bring forward measures that fell far short of implementing Neill's recommendations. We fear that they will choose not to implement all of Neill--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> It is not about Neill.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman said--I know that he was quoting my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby correctly--that he was concerned that the Bill was an insurance policy, in case the Government did not implement Neill. We, and I think perhaps the hon. Member for St. Helens, South, want Neill brought into law more or less in its entirety. That is what the Bill does. We fear that the Government's draft Bill, which we have not yet seen, will be partial, selective and choose only the bits of Neill that suit the Government. That was the tenor of the debate on Second Reading.
<P>
That is why we should implement this Bill as soon as possible--well in advance of any referendum that the Government may want to push through before 1 January 2001, before they implement even the bits of Neill that they think fit. The problem with setting the date suggested by the hon. Member for St. Helens, South is that we may have referendums before then, to which the Bill would not apply. Also, if we delay the Bill, we may find that the Government choose to push through a much watered-down version of Neill instead. It would be far better for the Bill to commence as early as possible, to catch any referendum that takes place before 1 January 2001. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will decide not to press the new clause to a Division; if he does, I shall certainly vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I will be similarly brief. I shall certainly oppose the new clause, for the second reason that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath advanced: there may be a stream of referendums that entirely change the character and constitution of the United Kingdom between now and l January 2001. Many hon. Members have pressed the Government to give an assurance that that will not occur, and the Minister has notably, repeatedly and elegantly refused to do so--as has the Prime Minister. We have no reason to suppose that there will not be such referendums between now and 1 January 2001. The insurance policy is therefore of the sort that insures someone against his death, as long as it does not occur in the near future. Alas, that is not good enough because, as we all know, deaths can occur at unpremeditated moments.
<P>
If the spirit of the new clause were translated into a new clause or amendment that specifically provided for the Bill to come into force if there were a referendum before its provisions had been implemented in another way, perhaps we could accept that--I should not speak for my hon. Friends, I mean that I could accept that. Exactly how we would phrase such a new clause or amendment, I am not clear; I do not know whether that is achievable in an enforceable, sensible and clean fashion. If it were, I should have absolutely no objection to that in principle. I understand that that would avoid the somewhat inelegant necessity of the Minister, were he to introduce his Bill, repealing this one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> If the new clause is added to the Bill, the hon. Gentleman will be quite entitled to table an amendment to it on Report. That is no problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes, except that we see no need to conspire with what we believe to be the Government's intention to cause trouble on Report by introducing clauses that we must amend. I should prefer not to see the new clause added to the Bill. If a hon. Member wants to table an amendment that would have the effect that I described, that would be fine. I have no objection to the principle that the Bill should not hang around needlessly on the statute book once the Minister has implemented a Bill to replace it--if he manages to do so.
<P>
However, the means of avoiding that, although slightly inelegant, are in the Minister's hands. He could easily repeal the Bill when he introduces his own Bill. There need be no uncomfortable overlap. I do not see the necessity for such a clause; it would merely be an elegant device. In the light of that, only if it worked perfectly would it be sensible to include such a clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Briefly, so that it is on the record, reference has been made on several occasions to the insurance policy. I suggest that the hon. Member for Blaby finds a new broker, because the policy seems flawed. Between now and the passing of Government legislation, the hon. Gentleman will have plenty of opportunity to influence the development of the Bill that my hon. Friend the Minister has promised will be forthcoming.
<P>
The new clause specifies 1 January 2001 because that will be before the next general election. It would be an unusual bookmaker who placed a bet against that. It gives plenty of time for the hon. Gentleman to influence the Government, and for the Government to bring forward legislation and get it on the statute book in a form that is acceptable to as many people as possible. With a constitutional measure such as this, that is important.
<P>
My belief is that in the interim, the insurance policy is the Neill report itself. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield laughs. The hon. Member for Blaby has prayed in aid that report on several occasions, as have my hon. Friend the Minister and other members of the Committee, including myself. It would be pretty unlikely for a referendum to crop up before then. I do not know what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has up his sleeve that I am not aware of. I cannot imagine a referendum coming up in which it would be considered appropriate or proper for the Government not to act within the spirit of the insurance policy that is already on the table.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> For clarification, do I take it that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston is joining me in a call to the Government to guarantee that they will not hold a referendum, except under the rules proposed by Lord Neill, until they have enacted legislation enforcing that result?
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, on Second Reading the hon. Member for Blaby introduced the concept of potential referendums below the parliamentary level. He referred specifically to regional assembly elections. The Government have already given a clear commitment that, should an area wish to hold a referendum to create a regional assembly--a number of people have referred to the north-east of England--that region should be given the green light to go ahead. Obviously, one hopes--I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister agrees with this--that any such referendum would be authorised only within the spirit of the Neill report recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> We have spoken about the Bill as an insurance policy. We said at the beginning of our deliberations that if and when the Government came up with more considered proposals, they would find a welcome response from us, and the Bill could well be improved. But we still believed that the Bill was valid in its own right and that it was good to have as an insurance policy in case there was a referendum.
<P>
What made me laugh was the suggestion that we do not need the measure to be in place until 2001 It is a jolly odd insurance policy whose start date is postponed for 18 months. In that case, there is no point in having it. As it is an insurance policy, and as we wait eagerly to see whether the Government respond in a comprehensive way, it will nevertheless be very useful to have the Bill on the statute book. It will provide an extremely helpful set of guidelines in the event of an unforeseen circumstance that takes the Minister by surprise and means that a referendum is held.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> The Bill may be on the statute book as an insurance policy and has yet to come into operation, but if the Government's legislation goes through, the Bill will fall. If the Government's legislation does not go through within the stipulated time, the Bill will act as both guidance and insurance policy in the intervening period, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Yes, but until it comes into operation, it ensures nothing. Until 1 January 2001, which is 18 months away, it would be open to the Government to hold a referendum. The Bill would be on the statute book, but it would not have come into force. That seems a poor reward for the effort of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby. I want to see the Bill on the statute book as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> The hon. Member for St. Helens, South is by far the most senior member of the Committee, as he has served for longer in the House of Commons than any other hon. Member present, including the Minister. He also has some legal knowledge, which is well beyond my own. I shall not make comparisons with any other hon. Members because I have no idea of the precise expertise involved.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right; the Bill is an insurance policy. As has been said, it is designed to ensure that no referendum is held under partisan, biased or interested rules before the Neill recommendations are enacted. As I have said, Lord Neill's report is not perfect. I am happy to debate Neill later, although not in the Committee. However, his recommendations were clear, and were agreed by hon. Members across all parties. The Bill has genuine cross-party support, which existed before it was promoted in the referendums campaign, which was a cross-party campaign.
<P>
During his long service in the House, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South must have seen cynicism and disingenuity under Governments of different hues, suggesting that one can be misled by Governments. I encountered such cynicism from time to time between 1992 and 1997, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman may have done so since May 1997. I do not want to speak about that too much, but I want to make clear that the insurance policy must be enacted as soon as possible. As the Opposition have said all along, we will be quite happy if the Government are willing to come forward in the form of the Secretary of State or the Prime Minister and state that no referendum will occur before the recommendations are enacted in legislation.
<P>
We have heard about the draft Bill. Draft Bills are the sort of proposals that are designed to fall through cracks in floorboards. They have done so in the past and I suspect that they may do so in future, although I do not doubt the Minister's honesty and good faith.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston seconded the clause. Of course it is not perfect, but the Bill is not perfect. That goes back to the main point: we wish the Government to bring forward their Bill and to enact it. If it is enacted during this Session, so much the better, although I think that that is unlikely. Stranger things can happen, as we saw today with the Northern Ireland (Location of Victims' Remains) Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston spoke of influencing the Government. I know that he is a man of the world, but I must tell him that my influence over the Government is very small. The influence of individual Labour Back Benchers is also small, judging by the way in which the Government seem to listen to them.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Gentleman spoke of regional referendums, about which the Deputy Prime Minister is already talking. There is no mechanism to enable a region to ask for referendum. It has to be done through this Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> If the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that his Bill is not perfect, how does he believe that such referendums will be conducted under it? Will not they be flawed in any case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been in the House for as long as I have--indeed, I think that we have been here for exactly the same time. He is well aware that much of the legislation passed by the House is far from perfect. My point is that the Bill, which is private Member's Bill, is better than what has gone before. It sets standards that should be adhered to and which the Government will be forced to live up to.
<P>
To return to my point about regions, there is no mechanism for calling a referendum across a region--county councils have no right to do so. What the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston was saying about referendums in regions is flawed. There can be no referendum in a region unless the House of Commons determines it. Of course, that might happen, but if it did, the Neill Committee recommendations should be enacted.
<P>
In summary, the new clause is defective; I do not like it, and I shall oppose it.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> I do not intend to withdraw the new clause for the following reasons.
<P>
The hon. Member for Blaby said that he had drafted the Bill and presented it to the House of Commons in good faith, and I do not question his good faith for one second. He also said repeatedly that the Bill was an insurance policy. Experience over the years has taught me that it is often as well to have an insurance policy, because it can force Governments to do things.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman knows, even with his short experience, the reality of parliamentary timetabling means that the Bill cannot possibly reach the statute book until the fall of the year--that is, October or November--because it must first go to another place. Thus, it could not come into effect until late 1999. As my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm, many a Home Office Bill has a commencement date six months, 12 months, 18 months or two years after enactment. That is not unusual.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to help the hon. Gentleman by mentioning something of which he may not be aware--the intense enthusiasm for the Bill in another place. There is a great likelihood that when it arrives there, as I hope it will--notwithstanding possible efforts on Report to prevent that happening--we may find that it passes through the other place at an unprecedented pace and comes back to us before the end of the summer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> Of course I am aware that the other place has on occasions what is best described as a speedy track record. I do not worry about that, because Royal Assent still cannot come until some time in the summer.
<P>
The Bill is basically a Home Office matter and, as I said, Home Office Bills can have a commencement date that lies some way ahead. This Bill is designed as an insurance policy, and the new clause proposes that it should come into effect after giving the Government a reasonable period in which to produce their legislation. If they do not, as the hon. Member for Blaby has said repeatedly, the Bill is an insurance policy against that.
<P>
I am at a loss to understand why there should be such Machiavellian thoughts on the Opposition Benches. After all my years here, I have learnt to be Machiavellian and I think matters through.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman remember how long it took the Government to get legislation for referendums in Wales and Scotland through Parliament--not just that, but also to get them held? The Government came to power on 1 May 1997 and the legislation was enacted and the referendums held in September 1997. Supposing the Government decided tomorrow to hold a referendum on a particular issue. Why should it take them any longer than to, say, September this year to get the necessary legislation through?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> If I may say so, that shows an absence of governmental experience on the hon. Gentleman's part, and a lack of understanding of parliamentary timetables. I suspect that the chance of getting a new Bill on to the Floor of the House in Government time at the moment is nil.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> What about the Northern Ireland (Location of Victims' Remains) Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> That was an emergency measure concerning a simple issue; this is not a simple issue. The Home Office will have bid for its places next year, and that is effectively where the parliamentary timetable now stands. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not appreciate that fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On the perhaps naive assumption that the hon. Gentleman is being entirely straight faced, I call into question whether he is adequately considering the nature of the referendums about which we talk, and the potential for them to be introduced by the most powerful members of the Government. We are talking about the Deputy Prime Minister in relation to the regions, about the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in relation to the euro referendum, and about the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister in relation to proportional representation. Those three groups could easily get whatever they wanted as Government business with five minutes' notice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman briefly. A referendum on the regions is not likely to come this side of 2003 or 2004 for good reason. The structures are not in place--the embryo structures in the north-west, for example, where we have an advisory council, and in the north-east, are only just formed. One must give them time, one must consult and take evidence. I do not see parliamentary time for that process during this Parliament, and the Minister, who is not allowed to respond facially or otherwise, will know what I am talking about.
<P>
A referendum on joining the European Economic Community--
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> We are members of the EC. It is no longer the EEC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> One day I shall give you a lecture on the Single European Act 1985, which was passed by--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Although that comment was not made from a sedentary position, it was none the less not authorised because the hon. Gentleman did not give way. I ask the Committee to be more disciplined so that we can proceed with business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bermingham:</B> Thank you, Mr. Wells, and I shall leave it at that--I have read the mind of the hon. Member for Blaby and he can read my mind for the response. There is little likelihood of membership becoming an issue before the House and, subsequently, before the country, this side of the next general election.
<P>
What more need I say about the third referendum--the one on proportional representation? The point is made by just the look upon my face. Proportional representation is like the Cheshire Cat--one sees the grin here, then the body there, the evidence elsewhere, and then that which has not been part of the evidence. We know the story.
<P>
I return to my simple reason for tabling the new clause. I hope that I am a man of principle, and I am grateful for the compliments that I received about my independence of mind. If the promoter and sponsors of the Bill are similarly principled, they will agree that the Government have to be given time, although not much time, to put their legislation to the country and into law. If they do not, the Bill will stand as a permanent reminder of both an insurance policy and the pressure to develop a regulated system of referendums that many hon. Members agree with.

<P>
For the most part, the Committee has been good humoured, with the possible exception of some of the comments that were made later on. I am sure that, on the part of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, they were brought out by tiredness. Uncharacteristically, the hon. Member for Blaby was a little curmudgeonly in some of his later comments. The hon. Member for West Dorset was his usual Delphic self when presenting his later arguments. That said, I thank you again, Mr. Wells, for the way in which you have conducted the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> As the person in charge of the Bill, I should say that I, too, welcome the helpful and sensible way in which you and your predecessor have run the Committee, Mr. Wells. The Minister believes that I have been difficult today. By God, he should see me on a good day.
<P>
We have had some important debates. I am delighted that we are finishing before 10 o'clock and that nobody, including myself, will be getting divorced as a result of arriving home late. The debates have been extremely useful, and I look forward, God willing, to Report stage.
