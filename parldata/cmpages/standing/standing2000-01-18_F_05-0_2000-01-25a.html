<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 106, in page 70, leave out line 10 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) is serving a term of imprisonment at a prison in the United Kingdom'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): These simple, probing amendments have been tabled to discover why the Government wish to have powers to exempt various categories. We have chosen the two categories in the explanatory notes. We want to know why students should be exempt. When you left the Committee, Mr. O'Brien, you probably tuned in to the television and you will have seen that the Cabinet is meeting soon to discuss student fees. Therefore, it is apposite that the Committee should consider the burdens on students. However, we have gone through them at some length, and I do not want to delay the Committee unnecessarily.
<P>
In view of the debate that the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) ably initiated this morning with regard to people on low incomes and the Under-Secretary's response, we want to know why prisoners are to be exempt. It is only a few weeks since we heard that a prisoner was running a major business undertaking in Her Majesty's cells and making many millions of pounds. Even if Her Majesty's prison officers were more punctilious in observing what was going on in the cells, it would be possible to earn considerable sums in prison.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): The Government will put in prison those who do not co-operate with the Child Support Agency, so we could get them twice: we could first put them in prison and then we could say, ``Just because you are in prison doesn't mean that there is a hiding place from the CSA''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I confess that that point had not occurred to me, but my hon. Friend is right: perhaps the easiest way to evade one's responsibilities is to get oneself into further education or into prison.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): They are the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is perhaps drawing too much on his military experience.
<P>
Given what the Under-Secretary said on the previous amendment about the need for people to make a contribution, which we support, it does not seem logical to exempt prisoners. If prisoners and students are exempted, will the Government make the exemptions more extensive? We accept that the amendments would mean that students and prisoners would be exempted, but we felt that it was the best way to get it on the amendment paper so that we could have a full discussion on the principles of who should pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Two contradictory motives are at work in the schedule. The first is the quite proper motive that was expressed to the Select Committee by Baroness Hollis that the agency should not expend its resources pursuing parents who had no money to pay for the child welfare. In other words, the objective was administrative efficiency. Secondly, the strong theme that runs throughout the Bill is the moral imperative that parents should be required to make a contribution to the upkeep of their children. In dealing with the amendment, we see the contradiction. We should accept that the moral imperative is the more important part of the Bill. Even where there is little money to be had by expending the agency's resources in pursuit of parents, they should still be required to make at least some payment. I do not doubt that it would be possible for both prisoners and students to make the minimum payment of £5. It would take a great deal to persuade me that that was not the case. If they could not pay £5, they should at least pay something. The moral imperative is the more important part of the principle here.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I support my hon. Friends, who find it inconsistent that the Government have excluded students from the orbit of the Bill—and, for that matter, prisoners, although there might be a better case for them.
<P>
In her last contribution the Under-Secretary rightly made it clear that the moral imperative behind the Bill was that the father or mother of a child should make a contribution and that the taxpayer should not be the first port of call. In bringing that child into the world, the parents must recognise the necessity to make a contribution and to maintain a link with the child until he reaches the age of 18.
<P>
I do not understand the logic behind the exclusion of students from the Bill. In the debate on the previous amendment we heard that the Government were keen to pursue people on very low incomes for a contribution to child maintenance—a very low contribution in keeping with the absent parent's relatively low standard of living—although the cost of administration may be more than the contribution to the family. The Under-Secretary said that that should be done so that taxpayers did not feel so aggrieved about being the first port of call in parental maintenance. Furthermore, a link should be established with the child, no matter whether the parent moves from benefit to work and perhaps back again. Although that is clearly not a desirable state of affairs, sadly it happens to some people. The continuity of making a payment for the child that one has brought into the world should be established and society's attitude should be changed. Again, I am paraphrasing the Under-Secretary's words. For all those reasons, extra administrative complexity was being introduced into the Bill with regard to welfare recipients, so that the link with the child could be established.
<P>
Given all those reasons, it seems extraordinary that students should not have to make a contribution. Those who go to university or become students later in life may see it as a way of getting out of making contributions to their child later, but most students are at the younger end of the age range. A student who has a child and continues to live with the other parent in a family unit would be expected to contribute to that child, perhaps by working, and to be financially responsible for him. Therefore, why should not a student make a contribution to the child if they are not living with the child? It seems illogical to say that being an absent parent and a student means that the burden of providing financial support is removed, and I believe it to be wrong. Students should be required to recognise the financial consequences of their actions, which bear most heavily on the taxpayer. In all cases where the absent parent or the parent with care does not have the financial resources to maintain the child, that child represents a huge burden on the taxpayer. The last figures that I saw showed that single parents represented a cost of some £10 billion to the Exchequer. That is a great deal of money that other taxpayers have to find.
<P>
I remind Labour Members that they introduced fees for students and abolished the maintenance grant. Part of the reasoning behind that change to student financial support was that although, under the old regime, many students were paid for almost completely courtesy of the taxpayer unless a parental contribution was required, and although some of them might have gone on to pay 40 per cent. tax later on, as a group of people they earned considerably more than their counterparts who did not go to university; their education gave them the benefit of being able to earn more money and thereby achieve a better standard of living.
<P>
If that was a relevant train of thought at the time of the introduction of student grants and the abolition of the maintenance grant, why should not the same sense of financial responsibility be required of students who father or ``mother'', for want of a better description, a child? Of course students are on a limited income and may have to take out a loan to pay their fees and maintenance, but many students work. If a student has become responsible for a child, I do not see why that responsibility should not weigh equally with their studies. Why should they not work part time to make a contribution to their child? Why should the state not expect them to make a contribution? Then it is up to them to decide whether to borrow the money and to pay it back later when they have a better job, or to work while they are a student in order to make a contribution to the child, so that the parent with care has a contribution from the absent parent. That is a matter of individual choice, but the idea that the state should not require that contribution seems bizarre.
<P>
The argument applies most strongly to students, but it also applies to prisoners. One of the Government's stated aims is to encourage more prisoners to work and to have a link with their families outside, so that when they go back into the community they do not return to the criminal ways that put them in prison in the first place. If prisoners were working or had other means of earning a living inside prison, I do not see why they could not make a contribution. Again I go back to the reasons that the Under-Secretary gave on the last amendment, when she said that there should be a link with the children and the expectation of continued financial support. Therefore, equally, I do not see why prisoners should automatically be exempt from the requirement to contribute to their child's support, even though their absence is perhaps less voluntary than other absences.
<P>
I am interested to hear how the Under-Secretary will justify the provision. It is always entertaining to listen to the Ministers and to hear their helpful remarks on the amendments that we are seeking to press or to probe. Perhaps we have persuaded them.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I did not think, when we embarked on what I thought would be a brief debate, that it would be such an interesting one. I found it fascinating to listen to my hon. Friends as they worked out the realities behind what appears to be a bland and reasonable part of the schedule. When we look behind it, the illogicalities emerge, many of which have been highlighted by my hon. Friends.
<P>
There seems to be an old-fashioned view that students tend to leave school, do a three-year or four-year course and exist on a grant. Most of us know that that is no longer the reality. Many students will have loans. More and more of them work in the holidays, so that they have an income, and there has been an enormous expansion in the number of people going to college or university later in life. Indeed, many go back for second degrees.
<P>
I read in the newspaper today or yesterday that the London Business School is one of the world's top 10 business schools. If students want to get a good degree, those who go to business schools usually already have business experience and an income and have planned their year or two years at business school so that they can manage not at a flush level but on a relatively reasonable income. Such people would be able, at a reduced level, to continue to pay maintenance, but, as I understand it, they are covered by the schedule as being in full-time advanced education. Greater thought needs to be given to this matter. Perhaps the Government will say that they will introduce regulations, although I see that it is not mentioned in either the explanatory notes or the Bill.
<P>
The university of Strathclyde is one of the leaders in taking an increasing number of older people—
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Mature.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Mature people—I thank my hon. Friend—who are coming back into education or even taking a degree for the first time. Their finances are as varied as they are, but I am sure that many of them will be able to contribute to some form of child support.
<P>
There is also an old-fashioned approach to prisoner pay, which is that, instead of getting enough to buy what they need in prisons—we shall not go down that route—they earn the going wage, and thereby cause all sorts of problems with trade unions, so they, too, have some income. As the Government are talking about a flat rate of £5 and the Under-Secretary said that the CSA has found that it benefits from establishing a habit of payment, prisoners who are earning could continue that habit, ensuring that they get into good habits for when they eventually leave prison.
<P>
There is another reason why I believe the Government have not specified in the schedule whom they intend to prescribe, but refer to them only in the explanatory notes. I have started to wonder what other groups could fall into the same category. I hope that whichever Minister replies, he or she—
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> We have just decided.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I hope that the Minister can give us some idea of whether the Government have any other categories in mind. It crossed my mind, for example, that people who are mentally ill and in secure or semi-secure hospitals would have an even worse problem than prisoners in terms of being able to contribute because they are unable to get benefits and although some do occupational therapy, I doubt that they earn much from it. They are not prisoners as such, because they are not all in state hospitals—if they are in state hospitals, they are prisoners, but if they are in secure or semi-secure hospitals they will be there under the Mental Health Act, 1983, probably having been sectioned, hence they are not prisoners. That is just one category, albeit small.
<P>
I also wonder—although this may not apply to schedule 1—what happens to European Union citizens or citizens from outside the EU who have children in this country and then go abroad or return to the continent. Is it worth the CSA's time to pursue them? We usually hear about such cases through the courts as the parent with care tries to pursue the non-resident parent, but of course we are trying to keep this measure out of the courts. Would prescribed parents include those who have returned to the EU or abroad and who cannot or do not want to contribute or where any contributions that they could make would be so low that it would not be worth the CSA's time pursuing them?
<P>
They are just two or three of the groups that came to mind when we were talking about prescribed groups. Can the Minister tell us whether the list of prisoners and students is definitive or whether it will be added to at some point and, if so, whether that will be done via regulation or merely through instructions to the CSA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall take this debate seriously, although I will have a job doing that, given some of the issues that have been raised.
<P>
I have never really thought of the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) as little Miss Gradgrind, but I probably will after today. However, I do not want to be offensive to her, as she is the only hon. Member who shares my birthday of 5 June—although she does not share my year of birth.
<P>
It is significant that both amendments would knock out line 10. I wonder why the Opposition did not suggest knocking out line 11, thus excluding anyone with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a net weekly income of below £5.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why not take the rest? Obviously, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said, they are probing amendments.
<P>
Before I answer the points that were made, I shall cost the amendments, which is useful, although I neglected to do it earlier. Amendment No. 105 would not cost anything, for reasons that I shall explain, but amendment No. 106 would have a cost because we would need to collect information about the income of non-resident parents. The information technology set up costs would increase by £200,000 and there would be up to £1 million in additional administrative costs. I accept, however, that these are probing amendments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) asked what other groups there were. We do not want to be unaccountable to the House. Paragraph 5 prescribes a nil rate for non-resident parents who do not have an income. Different rates apply to those earning more than £200 a week and those who earn between £100 and £200 and there is a flat rate for those on less than £100 or on benefit. However, those people all have an income stream. We envisage having to draw up regulations to prescribe people who would have nil liability because they do have an income stream.
<P>
It is true that the notes on clauses refer to students and prisoners. By students, we mean full-time students—obviously, that will be prescribed in regulations. The stereotypical full-time student aged 18 to 21 actually makes up a tiny minority of the total student population, which numbers some 4 million if one includes the further education sector. Of course, the fact that courses are now taught in modules blurs the distinction between full-time and part-time students.
<P>
I assure the Committee that we will introduce regulations prescribing non-resident parents who are liable to a nil rate. They will include students and prisoners, as set out in the explanatory notes, people receiving allowances in respect of work-based training for young people, 16 and 17-year-olds in receipt of income support and, indeed, children, as defined by section 55 of the 1991 Act. I was a little surprised that that issue was not raised. ``What about 14-year-old fathers? Shouldn't they be paying their whack?''—we did not hear that, not even from little Miss Gradgrind. Nevertheless, we need to prescribe non-resident parents who are also children under the terms of the 1991 Act—that is, under the age of 16.
<P>
Such a list needs to be transparent. Moreover, it must be possible for the parent with care, if they believe that the non-resident parent has an income stream—perhaps of up to £100 a week—to apply for a variation order. One of the purposes of this measure is to avoid the CSA having to collect the information when setting up the system—the extra costs that amendment No. 106 would involve relate in part to that.
<P>
I will share with the Committee the latest information that I have on student income. Figures for August 1999 suggest that the number of student non-resident parents in the current load on the CSA is 1,520. Their average income is £12.86 a week. Only 140 of those students have sufficient income to make them liable for maintenance and, of those, only 40 are fully compliant.
<P>
We intend to list groups of people whose income is nil and would be thought by a reasonable person to be nil. It is a difficult issue. I do not know the details regarding prisons, but we cannot accept the example that was given by the hon. Member for Beckenham; that was a criminal activity. I do not think that we can rely on the CSA organising its affairs based on criminal activity.
<P>
If the parent with care thinks that a person whom the list prescribes as having nil liability has an income, they can apply for a variation. There will be procedures for doing that. Someone serving a prison sentence could still be receiving pay from their employer, for example—[Interruption.] I did not hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) said. I can imagine a person serving perhaps a short term of imprisonment whose employer says, ``I will not only keep your job open, but I'll pay you while you're in prison.'' That is an income stream, no question, and the parent with care would be quite within their rights to request a variation order. However, it would be for them to apply. The CSA would thus be saved the administrative burden of considering all the prisoners. The same could also apply to a student who was doing a full-time course and being paid by an employer. Opposition Members are too young to remember sandwich courses. They were real courses: students did not have long vacations, but went back to the factory, when they were not at university or college, and did a proper job, creating wealth for the country. We old polytechnic and college of technology people must stick together: I sense a degree of support.
<P>
There can be an income stream that a reasonable person would recognise, not by doing part-time work to make ends meet, as students now are wholly dependent on the student loan system rather than a grant. The other categories that I have listed are young people of 16 or 17 who are in receipt of income support—being in receipt of it at that age makes them a special category, for reasons that everyone will understand—and children who are parents.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I took advice on the question asked by the hon. Member for Beckenham about mentally ill people. Life is such that a man may have become a father before he fell ill or while he was in hospital. The reason for making regulations rather than a provision in the Bill is to give Ministers and the CSA flexibility. We will account to Parliament—probably negatively, but the facts will be transparent. If we find other categories—the hon. Lady may have identified one—where, a reasonable person would say there is no income stream, they will be added to the prescribed list. That would be fair for everyone. Where parents think that there is an income stream, they can apply for a variation order. That gives flexibility, which hon. Members will agree, if they think about it for a few minutes, is reasonable and better than the present system. I hope that I have given a satisfactory reply and that the hon. Member will withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I thank the Minister for that full response. Never in my wildest dreams, when I made a brief contribution before lunch, did I imagine that the matter would develop into a full-blown debate. The Minister has raised important considerations, as have Conservative Members. Occasionally, we may have sought to illustrate them in more stark terms, but that does not mean that there is no serious issue behind them. The Minister's descriptions of income streams and the use of variations would answer most of my hon. Friends' points. We realise that some fortunate students at Nottingham university have just become millionaires 10 times over. We wish them well. If their previous circumstances applied now, variations would meet them.
<P>
In an earlier amendment, the Under-Secretary made an important point about getting into the habit of payment. I said at the outset that the Minister would have to be extremely provocative to force the amendment to a vote and, despite what he said about my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove—we shall be taking instructions on that—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 70, line 20, leave out from beginning to end of line 5 on page 71.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 99, in page 70, leave out lines 21 and 22 and insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`7.—(1) This paragraph applies only if the calculation is made pursuant to section 6 of the 1991 Act as amended'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 107, in page 71, leave out lines 9 and 10.
<P>
No. 69, in page 71, line 14, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) Where the shared care ceases, amendments to maintenance will be backdated to the date of cessation of shared care.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 108, in page 71, line 25, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) Such Regulations as the Secretary of State shall make under this paragraph shall make provision for the obtaining of information from the parent with care as to the number of nights during which non-resident parent has care of the child overnight'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> This is a probing amendment. Its purpose is to probe whether the Government can have a second look at the clause, because it could have dramatic and unintended impacts on children. Child contact is about children and does not take into account the interests of the adults.
<P>
I accept that the clause has an honourable intention. I suspect that all hon. Members will have received representations from non-resident parents that they have contact with their child but that it is not taken into account. They want that demonstration of their love for their child—their taking them out and giving them treats and Christmas and birthday presents—to be recognised in the formula. I fully accept the basis of that, but it fundamentally changes the tenet of child contact. It could contradict the tradition that contact is solely for the benefit of the child and would have other serious knock-on effects for the child. It could result in many frivolous, time-wasting and vexatious attempts by non-resident parents to seek contact with their child, thereby generating a great deal of vexatious and expensive court battles to demonstrate and secure that child contact.
<P>
An unhelpful message could be sent out that resulted in the non-resident parent believing that because he is paying maintenance he should have contact. Conversely, if one follows the assumed logic, the parent with care could feel that, as the non-resident parent is not paying maintenance, he should not have contact. Some have effectively argued—the point was made by the National Council for One Parent Families in its evidence to the Select Committee—that if a child spends two or three nights away from the parent with care, that does not necessarily amount to a two-sevenths or three-sevenths reduction in the cost to the parent with care. The clause's calculation of one night away, and therefore a one-seventh reduction in maintenance, is rather crude and does not take into account the fact that the predominant carer will have on-going costs for the seven days—when the child is not there.
<P>
A further point made in the Select Committee report by the National Council for One Parent Families was that it is predominantly better-off families who enjoy shared care because they generally live in larger houses. I do not know what other correlation was found. Sometimes it is true that poor fathers who love their children deeply and spend long days with them to positive effect for all concerned go back to their bedsits unable to offer accommodation for the night.
<P>
On a different point, the Family Policy Studies Centre is reported on page xx of the Select Committees' findings as saying that there could be situations in which increased contact between a child and the non-resident parent would not be in the best interests of the child. It suggested that there should be monitoring of cases where a non-resident parent who had previously not had contact requested shared care on what appeared to be purely economic grounds.
<P>
Serious questions need to be answered because, despite the honourable intentions of the Government, there may be damaging, vexatious and expensive consequences. The Minister needs to consider those because the Bill could become a charter for vexatious and frivolous claims.
<P>
Linking contact with maintenance could damage children because it would increase disputes. The proposals fly in the face of the well-established principles of the Children Act 1989 and family legislation generally—that contact and maintenance are separate issues and are for the benefit of the child alone, not the parents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I should like to speak to amendments Nos. 99, 107, 69 and 108, because they are linked. In many ways, amendment No. 81 must be seen as being hand in glove with amendment No. 99. They offer the Committee an alternative way of achieving what the Government wish.
<P>
Payments made for children are not applied directly to them; we shall make that point throughout our debates. They might fund, say, a mortgage for a larger house to accommodate the child or the hire of a car to transport it. Such costs do, of course, continue regardless of whether the child is at a particular location. Viewed from the perspective of the parent with care, there is no obvious requirement to link overnight stays to the reduction of maintenance. It is important that we deliberate on that, especially as the Committee was very lively during the cross-examination by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). The non-resident parent may face increased costs through spending time with the child. By setting out a financial incentive to seek such contact, we might send the wrong message. We are most worried that payments may become the cause of friction between the two parties.
<P>
The Committee will recall our discussions last week when members of all parties were keen to find a way of ensuring that the new system did not increase friction between parents. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said that conflict was inevitable, and he was wise to point that out to us. However, we do not want to put into the hands of those with a history of conflict a perfect weapon with which to beat one another. That would not benefit the child.
<P>
Parents with care would see their payments drop from 25p in the pound to 21.5p in the pound if a child was kept back by the non-resident parent for, say, Sunday night, to return to school on the Monday. We do not want to see people keeping children for financial gain as a result of the split between non-resident parents and parents with care. Thus, a provision that is designed to provide fairness could affect behaviour, with the risk of children being caught in the middle of financially motivated squabbles between their parents. That does not seem sensible.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There was a long struggle through the 1980s to ensure that, in their child care arrangements, parents focused on their children's welfare and what was in their children's best interests. As the hon. Member for St. Ives hinted, the struggle has been won largely because parents can be brought to see that there are no financial side effects from arranging things in the child's best interests. There is concern among practitioners in the field that this measure could return us to the ``Kramer v. Kramer'' access battles of the 1970s and 1980s. People in the profession told me that they were extremely difficult to cope with.
<P>
Amendment No. 81 offers the alternative of omitting the provision entirely. Amendment No. 99 offers the second option of applying it only when it is unlikely to cause any damage, that is, in cases where benefit is involved—the parent with care is unlikely to be financially motivated to object to any reduction and is less likely to be affected by net receipts.
<P>
I was struck, as we have all been in our deliberations on this issue, by the findings of the Select Committee on Social Security. It takes a third way in paragraph 45 on page xxi of its report, where it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We recommend that the Department of Social Security should commission research jointly with the Department of Health and the Lord Chancellor's Department into the consequences for the well-being of the children of linking child support liability to overnight contact of non-resident parents with their children.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am concerned, as are those who work in the field and those who research these issues, that despite our best endeavours, we are creating a system that will be used as an instrument of conflict between couples. Surely that cannot be desirable. Professor Jonathan Bradshaw of York university gave evidence to the Select Committee. He states in answer to question 355 on page 142 of the report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I think there are going to be caring parents and non-resident parents who attempt to manipulate caring arrangements in order to maximise their benefit from it which I think will be a very bad behavioural result, and not the only unintended behavioural result of child support policy, which we do not really know anything about because no one has done any work on it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So what York university tells us, and the hon. Member for St. Ives backs it up on the basis of other research, is that those involved in shared care are less likely to be the products of out-of-wedlock conceptions. It is very unlikely to involve people on low income and more likely to involve what researchers at the university of York call ``better-off people''. Not only were concerns raised by the hon. Member for St. Ives and the eminent professor at the university of York about the possibility of conflict, but worries were expressed by the Family Policy Study Centre. They submitted evidence of this in a couple of sentences in their review which appear at page 165, paragraph 13:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The reduction in liability for shared care appears likely to increase contact in marginal cases, but there are situations in which this would not be in the best interests of the child. This is therefore another area which would require monitoring, especially in cases where a non-resident parent who has previously had no contacts requests this on what appear to be purely economic grounds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I said on Second Reading that we are all experts on this, because people have come to our surgeries to discuss precisely this issue. One of my first cases involving the CSA was that of a chap who had had virtually no contact with his child. In his opinion he had been badly done by—the CSA had ``picked on him''. I started to make notes and to find out what he had been doing. I said, ``How much is your total payment?'' This man was on a reasonable wage. He said, ``I'm paying £10.'' I said, ``Do you mean you pay £10 a week?'' He said,``No. I'm paying £10 a month.'' I said to him, ``I think you have to brace yourself. Maybe you should think about paying quite a bit more.'' He said, ``In that case I'm going to see the kid.''
<P>
This kind of person causes me to worry about section 81. He has not cared two hoots about his child. He has done his best to avoid all contact and is making a paltry payment. Now, as part of the deal, he thinks to himself, ``I can maybe add to the misery of the situation. I want to see the child once a week; that will reduce a little the amount I am currently owed.'' The poor little mite will be subjected to a man she has not seen for the best part of eight years. She will be taken out by a complete stranger, not because he wants to see her—he could always have seen her—but because he can use the system to beat his former partner.

<P>

<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): This is an important part of the Bill. I spent many years practising child law in Scotland before I was elected to the House. The hon. Gentleman's example is all too familiar to many hon. Members, as it was to me when I practised law.
<P>
It does not necessarily follow that it is not in the best interests of that man's child to have contact with her father and get to know and understand, as part of the maturing process, who that person is. The continued division between fathers and their children is also bad for children by and large. Time and time again, research shows that fathers who have contact with their children pay more maintenance and do so regularly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is right. I am sure that he is a great loss to Scottish legal services. He speaks with great wisdom, and I do not disagree with him. The point that I am trying inadequately to get across is that fathers who see their children regularly are better people. I am almost beginning to recall that speech by Don Corleone in ``The Godfather'' in which he says that someone who does not look after his family can never be a real man. There is an element of that. [Interruption.] Should our system be based on the Mafia? I think not, but at least they all stick together.
<P>
A person should want to see his children because he wants to be part of their growth and development. He should want to see their excitement as they experience new things and share in their sheer joy at being at the beginning of their lives. That is wonderful. A person should not see a child in order to reduce his financial commitment or, more importantly, to reduce the amount that is going to the parent with care.
<P>
These are probing amendments. This is a legitimate concern. I referred a number of times to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, but I am particularly obliged to him for his examination of Mr. James Pirrie of the Solicitors Family Law Association. When my hon. Friend suggested that conflict is inevitable and that it is probably right to link contact to the amount of money that is paid across, Mr. Pirrie replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The second that we are having to accept, `It is about the welfare of your child and by the way there is a financial knock-on', it is much more difficult and it is vastly more difficult when you have the mother and father facing those issues. That is the conceptual problem, actually how it works in practice is frightening. Do we have tribunal hearings focusing on what contact was ordered or agreed or what actually took place? Do we have Mum, if Little Johnny stays with Mum, saying to Dad, `It is all right, you can see your son for the day but only if you bring him back by 6 o'clock because I want to clock up the next night'? How it operates in practice means you will have enormous conflict.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to refer to evidence from the United States from which he sought to show that that is precisely what has occurred.
<P>
We have also tabled amendments on matters where we seek clarification. How will nights be worked out? What evidence will be required? In the event of a conflict would the parent with care adjudicate these figures? We also have to recognise that where that breaks down and the non-resident parent ceases to have contact, it can be backdated to the last date of contact.
<P>
I have covered all the amendments and we look forward to a response on what are important issues; we do not want the system to lend itself readily to conflict.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh :</B> This is one of the most interesting parts of the Bill and it goes to the heart of what we are trying to achieve. I welcome what the Government are trying to do in terms of reducing liability following shared care. If possible, I should like them to go even further.
<P>
The Minister made the fair point that we cannot change people's behaviour—we cannot make people love or visit their children or parents stay together; we can only talk about money. However, money speaks powerfully and is a weapon that the state can use to good effect, although in recent years it has been used to bad effect in terms of promoting family life. So many parts of our benefits system, including the CSA, have discouraged good practice, encouraged bad practice in family life and been a prime motivator, particularly for people with limited resources, in breaking up families and discouraging traditional family life.
<P>
I make no secret of, and do not apologise for, my belief that the traditional way of going about things is best for children—and for parents. That seems to be supported by independent research. However, I know that that is not always possible. It would be lovely if everybody just fell in love, got married, had children, and stayed married, and if all fathers had steady jobs and the family had enough resources for the mother to stay at home; Dad would help get the children breakfast, go off to work and come back in time to give them supper and Mum would be around when they got back from school. All those things are lovely—but that is not the real world in which we live, where people are under enormous financial pressure and feel that even if they have a normal relationship, they cannot necessarily live that sort of traditional life.
<P>
So how do we meet the CSA problem? The CSA should not be primarily concerned with money. One of its primary purposes should be to deal with the iniquitous and terrible situation of modern society: that fathers see too little of their children. Even when the father lives with the mother that is the case because fathers work too long hours. However, it is when the relationship breaks up that the situation becomes dire. We know all the statistics, which we continually quote, of the large numbers of fathers who do not see their children at all. That is appalling for the children and I believe eats into the soul of the father. We have to do something and the Government were right to encourage absent fathers to see more of their children. I agree that the question of how one does that is difficult.
<P>
The point that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar is making—I accept it; it is made by lawyers and many others—is that once the Government have embarked on that route, we will get a lot of difficulties and rows. It is far easier to say, ``you're a father—you've got to pay 15 per cent. of your income to the children and that's that''. Once one starts fiddling around and saying, ``Well, if the child spends a minimum of 52 nights with you, that will reduce the liability'', one will get all sorts of difficulties. My hon. Friend is right: some fathers will doubtless cynically use the measure as a means of continuing disputes with their former partner. Others will be intent on reducing their financial liability and will use the provision to increase contact with their children, but so be it. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) made the point wisely and with the experience of having practised law in Scotland. Whatever a father's motive, the job will be well done if it results in his seeing his child. That is why the Government are right to persist with the provision.
<P>
My concern is whether people will understand the provision and how it will be policed and carried out in practice. In an ideal world where resources allowed, I would like there to be a simple system: for every night that the child spends with the father, the father's liability is reduced by one 365th. If the child spent half the year with the father and half with the mother, the cost of bringing up the child would be shared. I would like there to be a judgment of Solomon in such cases. People should come to understand that we have moved away from the traditional world where mothers stay at home and watch the children while fathers work. Mothers now want to work, so fathers must take a fair share in looking after children. 
<P>
I have recently been appointed to the Childcare Commission, which has been set up by the Kids Club Network to consider child care. When people are asked what they consider important by public opinion surveys, they talk about child care, not about joining the euro or other such issues that occupy us so much in the House. How do we share the burden of looking after and bringing up children? That is what worries people in the modern world. We cannot and do not want to go back to the old days when women stayed at home, because women want to and have to work. The only way to move forward is to change the attitude of fathers, whether they are married, living with partners or absent. They must share the burden of bringing up the child, and not simply leave it to the mother in the traditional way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I appreciate the sincerity with which the hon. Gentleman makes his case, and I go along with it in spirit. In practical terms, a poor non-resident father who lived in a bedsit and had full, honourable and loving intentions towards his child would be unable to fulfil his role and therefore reduce by one 365th his contribution to maintenance. Even though he might provide long days of care and love for his child, he would have no financial benefit or incentive to do so. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that his proposals are fine in an ideal world, but would not be good enough for many poor families?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am an incurable romantic, so I think that material comforts are not everything. Of course, I do not suggest that a child should live in unsanitary conditions. To take the hon. Gentleman's extreme example, I think that it is better that the child should live in the bedsit with the father in difficult circumstances than not see him at all. In modern society, we focus too much on material considerations, and too little on the need for people to see, communicate with and try to understand one another. Even the poor can do those things, and even a poor person living in a bedsit would be better off in those circumstances than if he were separated from his children.
<P>
We cannot provide moral leadership effectively from the House. We can make 1,000 speeches saying that it is important that fathers look after their children and so on, but we know that that will not work. The Minister is right: people will not listen. If they will not listen to the Archbishop of Canterbury or Cardinal Winning, they will certainly not listen to us. I shall not discuss Cardinal Winning, who is rather an embarrassment to the Government at the moment. They should not worry; he has been an embarrassment to us in the past. He is a great man who has his own point of view.
<P>
We cannot provide moral leadership: no one will listen to us. However, people will listen if we provide a firm financial framework. If we make it worth while for fathers to have their children to stay, children will stay with their fathers. That is good for the father and for the child, too.

<P>

<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> It gives me great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, who is clearly not only an incurable romantic, but a model husband, and we are proud to claim him on the Opposition Benches. Perhaps he might like to give a few lessons. However, the subject is the amendment, not my hon. Friend's good parenting.
<P>
It is difficult to decide to what extent to provide incentives in the system in order to allow shared care. The system will be abused, given what we all know only too well about the darker and more unkind side of human nature that often materialises in our surgeries. We all share the distaste of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar for people who protest about what they have to pay.
<P>
On first reading the discount to which absent parents will be entitled for having their children to stay, I was unsure whether it was a good idea. I have had heated discussions in my surgery with members of the public who pay considerably more than the £10 that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar mentioned towards the upkeep of their children, and perhaps even as much as £100. They protest that the mother cannot possibly spend £100 a week on their child, asking, ``How much do their teas cost? Egg and chips does not cost £100 a week. How would I spend £100 a week on a child?'' I am not sure that I have ever been able to persuade any absent parents that, in fact, £100 is not a great deal of money for looking after a child, bearing in mind that electricity bills, rent and council tax have to be paid even when the children are not there. Such bills are hidden. Looking after a child involves more than the cost of trainers and egg and chips. However, I suspect that, despite the interventions of Labour Members, I shall have more luck in persuading members of the Committee of that fact than in persuading members of the public. When I dealt with some CSA cases, I make sure that my assistant is with me and that the lights go out at a certain time, because it is difficult to persuade some absent parents of the relevance of their contribution when they believe it to be too high.
<P>
It is frustrating to encounter cases in which a deliberate attempt has been made to gain access to the children in order to persuade the CSA to agree to a diminution in the parental contribution. Parents with care face immovable bills that cannot be adjusted according to the amount of time that the absent parent has custody of the child.
<P>
I sympathise with the Government in trying to reach a reasonable decision on such a difficult matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough made a powerful case that, even if the reason for shared care of the child is perverse—to try to reduce the bill from the CSA—that perverse judgment may have a welcome outcome. I find it hard to argue against him. The irreconcilable interests of the parent with care and the absent parent has been brought starkly into focus by relevant arguments from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I found the case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough quite interesting and, although it is not particularly relevant to the amendment, he makes a valid point. However, his suggestion will never be fairly applied, nor will there be as many model fathers as we would like in society until the presumptions of other areas of the law are adjusted. Many distressed fathers whose wife has run off with another man and taken his beloved children find that the law completely favours the wife, no matter how badly she has behaved. As long as the wife—the mother of the children—can provide proper care for her children, the court's presumption is that the children will follow the mother, and the case of a father who might have an equal claim to the care of the children is very much secondary. If we are to reach the state that my hon. Friend describes, which would be ideal for all of us and certainly for women, although men have something to gain as well, we must consider the wider issues.
<P>
In reaching a conclusion on these matters, Ministers should remember that, in most cases where a split is involved, the court's presumption is that the children will go with the mother. The father's rights are secondary. However, I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply to what has been an interesting and relevant debate on a difficult issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I knew that this would be a difficult but important debate. While I have profoundly agreed with much of what my hon. Friends have said, I have also disagreed with them. The slightest nuance changes the perception. It is therefore little wonder that the CSA is hated with such a passion by so many people. I often think that we should abandon the nonsense of talking about the agency in the language of customer satisfaction and clients, because it falls between two parties who often hate one another passionately and dispute the arrangements of access to the children and, more importantly, given the amendments that we are discussing, the financial ramifications of that access.
<P>
However, this is an important part of the Bill because, under the current caseload, where the reduced rate is limited to children who spend 104 nights a year with the non-resident partner—even when that means having to spend 104 nights away from home—fully a quarter of the caseload qualifies for those financial considerations. What estimate has been given of the caseload that will be eligible for abatements in the Bill, as we reduce the threshold from 104 nights to 52? Will it double from a quarter to half the caseload? What are the implications?
<P>
I agree entirely with my hon. Friend about what I would call overheads: an abatement of one-seventh to the parent with care is an unfair concept, because they have ongoing costs that are not reduced by the children being out of the home. But that case contrasts starkly with the one that was put to the Select Committee by Families Need Fathers. That group believed that, in the absence of benefit paid by the state or, indeed, a payment from the parent with care on the basis of an assessment of income,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it introduces the rather perverse outcome that it is always going to be cheaper for fathers to abandon their children and never to see them again than it is for them to care for their children''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears on page xxii of the Select Committee report.
<P>
Baroness Hollis was right when she said that Families Need Fathers had overstated that case and she defended vehemently the provisions in the Bill, which the amendments address, saying that the abatements provide a genuine economic incentive for parents to proceed with arrangements for shared care. In other words, she accepted that there was an incentive for parents to seek shared care on the basis of the available abatements. She did not shy from that. She did not accept that it was perhaps an undesirable incentive that we should not hold out in front of fathers, and she went on to say what she regarded as the positive benefits that would flow from those abatements. In doing so, her language did not differ significantly from that used by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun in his brief intervention. She said on page 199:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are trying to get out of people's lives. We are saying, `It is up to you and ultimately the courts as to what contact and access arrangements you negotiate, but if you do and if he is properly taking some financial responsibility in his own home for the care of the child, it is proper and decent that his maintenance should be abated to reflect that.' Insofar as that is an encouragement for him to have the child every other weekend and so on, frankly I would be very pleased. I think children do value their father's contribution''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, she was clear that there was a financial incentive and she regarded that as a positive benefit.
<P>
I accept the argument that incentives should reinforce what we regard as socially desirable behaviour. I am not, like the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, an expert in family law. I have no experience in family law other than the cases that have been brought to my constituency advice sessions by aggrieved parents. I thought that the case made to the Select Committee by the Family Policy Studies Centre was persuasive. It was clear that this was not an appropriate area for an incentive and that the abatement would tempt fathers who would not otherwise seek contact with their children to pursue the incentive for financial gain—or a reduction in their financial loss.
<P>
Baroness Hollis rejected that argument. In answer to a question that I put to her—again on page 199—she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``But it will only happen and the courts will only agree to it if those relationships are decent and civilised. If there is any risk of impropriety or violence, of course that will not happen.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In some respects I accept that reassurance, but the hon. Member for St. Ives was right to say that an element of vexatiousness is involved. The court might not grant the order if there was any doubt, but the existence of the abatement provides the incentive for the father, or the partner without care, to pursue such demands vigorously in the courts. No doubt other hon. Members have had my experience of parents with care coming to surgeries to complain that they are being pursued vexatiously in the courts, often when the partner who seeks an order for access is—sometimes by his own admission doing so as a means of persecution, having previously not shown interest in access to the children. They have the benefit of legal aid, whereas parents with care may not have that benefit and will feel that they are being persecuted as a means of prosecuting an old grievance. I suspect that the provisions may add another grievance to be pursued vexatiously. This is a difficult issue and I am glad that we have been able to air it. I am not sure that the debate has come up with any solution. I am not at all confident that the amendments to which I have put my name offer one. However, this is an area on which the Select Committee report was also at its weakest. If ever there was a cop-out it is in the recommendation at the top of page 21:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We recommend that . . . the Department of Health and the Lord Chancellor's Department should commission research . . . into the consequences for the well-being of the children of linking child support liability to overnight contact of non-resident parents with their children.''<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman. I felt that he was about to present his peroration and sit down. Given that he was, and with his hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, still is, the only consistent member of the Select Committee since its formation in July 1997, perhaps he can help the Committee.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): No, he was not. He is a new member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I apologise. But perhaps the hon. Gentleman can help the Committee in relation to the evidence of the Family Policy Studies Centre. Its memorandum of evidence on page 165 of the Select Committee's report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are in favour of the proposals for reducing liability in respect of shared care, except where care is shared equally.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understood the hon. Gentleman's reference to its contribution to come from his questioning of Baroness Hollis. Will he expand on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that I was drawing to a conclusion. I will not detain the Committee by thumbing through the report to find the evidence, but the hon. Gentleman is right. In the same way that we have had mixed evidence in the Committee, there was mixed evidence from witnesses. I am clear about this: the Family Studies Policy Centre argued that it might be inappropriate to provide an incentive for parents who otherwise would not seek contact with their children to do so for financial gain. I am certain that that is in the evidence although, I cannot put my hand on it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): The hon. Gentleman has done the report of the Select Committee a slight disservice by quoting only one of its recommendations on the issue. It would also be fair if he quoted a little more from Baroness Hollis, who also said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``what matters is the well-being of the child.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She also said in her evidence at the end of the report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``What matters, I have to say, is not whether he is worse off or better off, or even whether she is worse off, what matters is the well-being of the child.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman give the page number for Hansard ?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> It appears on page 199, Mr. O'Brien—it is the completion of the same quote to which the hon. Gentleman referred briefly. Paragraph 48 completes the Select Committee's analysis of the issue with the following:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We would expect that in most cases it would be in the best interests of the child for both parents to share responsibilities for care. We support the White Paper proposals to reduce the non-resident parent's liability in shared care cases.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is correct to say that we suggested that further research be undertaken into the long-term implications of that, but, having analysed the evidence, we firmly supported the White Paper, which, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, was quite full on the issue.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman and I certainly had no malevolent intent in curtailing my quotation from Baroness Hollis. I was concerned that I was testing your patience, Mr. O'Brien, with such a long quotation. For that reason, I truncated it.
<P>
On the Select Committee's findings, I agree with the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). We agreed with that conclusion, but it is at variance with the evidence given to us about the wisdom of providing a financial incentive to parents who otherwise would not seek contact with their child. Our reaction to that evidence, of which we clearly took account, was to regard it as a cop-out. However, I accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I listened with great care. None of us would disagree with the idealistic argument that fathers, or a parent without care or non-resident parent, should be able as far as possible to participate in helping to bring up a child, or children, by looking after them at weekends or during the week. We all know instances of that working well because, parents who cannot live together can be sufficiently grown up to come to an amicable arrangement and children benefit from easy access to both parents, when they are sufficiently adult to be able to discuss how to organise things. In the past in my dealings with the CSA, parents have sometimes agreed on something but the agency has messed it up, but let us hope that that does not happen again.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar emphasised, children may be used as pawns in a game. What concerns me and other members of the Committee is the effect that that has on the children. We are aware of arguments about the CSA and the sheer hatred displayed in surgeries about a missing partner. We are also aware of the way in which a child is frequently manipulated in an attempt to make the position worse. In many instances, such a child is just a victim, but children can be manipulators as well and they may want to make a situation worse. Equally, many wish to try to make things better. Some situations may deteriorate because either or both sides can use the child and the child can itself make life between two parents difficult.
<P>
What concerns me most about the laudable aims of the Bill to make shared care easier is the way in which it interacts with how parents wish to cope with the children and with any spill over into courts' and social service casework negotiations that are set up to try, as far as possible, to help a dysfunctional family. If the Bill's provisions on the CSA exacerbated tensions in, say, a family in which the non-resident parent had a low income and was unable to look after a child overnight at any time, would that fact be introduced into any case conference about the care of the children? Could it distort what could be a better result merely because there is a provision in the Bill for a financial incentive?
<P>
The CSA is not known for its sensitivity and, because the Bill is so prescriptive, it will be easy for rough justice to be meted out and for children to suffer under the shared care provisions. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the Bill will be flexible enough to focus on the care of the child as opposed to a financial incentive for the non-resident parent?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> We have had an interesting debate and the Members who have spoken have done their best to wrestle with a difficult balance. There is wide recognition—although that is not always expressed in the amendments—that it is good to encourage shared care. It is unsurprising that people have tried to think about the problem from the perspective of the worst rather than the best cases but that is not always the best way to do so. The Government are attempting to reform the Child Support Agency, which intervenes in emotional turmoil that involves love, but also hatred. We have to find a balance in the vast majority of cases that is defensible to a fair-minded person who is not wrapped up in the emotional tensions that we sometimes see in our surgeries.
<P>
The Government intend that the interests of the child should be central to all our deliberations on these delicate issues. The arrangements for shared care are the best that can be achieved to strike the right balance between recognising the additional costs of looking after a child for non-resident parents, while not being so generous as to discourage resident parents from allowing care to be shared.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough talked not only about his nostalgia for the way families used to be, but about an ideal world that we might want to create. I am not sure that I share his vision, but that is a debate for another time.
<P>
The Government believe that shared care is beneficial for children. We could all give examples to the contrary from those who have attended our surgeries, but as a general principle shared care is in the interests of children from broken families and families that have re-formed into different shapes, with which social policy has to deal these days.
<P>
I also agree that any arrangements could be subject to vexatious activities and claims or could be used by those who wish to prosecute old grievances as the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) said. In my experience, those who wish to do so will always find a way, irrespective of the structures that we set up to regulate these affairs, but we must try to minimise that. However, few of us imagine that we can eliminate, through legislative action, the emotions and grievances of people who have lived together in a relationship when it goes wrong and breaks up acrimoniously. It is for the Government to decide how best to deal with the hopefully larger numbers of people who have been through a break-up, but have managed to remain civil and amicable about it. Parliament has to decide how best to regulate the different experiences of different people.
<P>
I agree that we cannot eliminate vexatious and expensive wrangling. However, there are existing provisions for shared care on the statute book. The arrangements that we are debating today would reduce the number of nights per year—from 104 to 52—that are required for shared care to affect maintenance liabilities. We believe that shared care is important and we want to establish it as desirable.
<P>
The CSA already has to deal with many dispute on these matters. We should attempt to define shared care: I noticed that members of the Committee often used the terms ``shared care'' and ``contact'' as if they were interchangeable. They are not, and the Bill does not make them so. It distinguishes between shared care, defined as overnight care, and contact, which are two different things.
<P>
The hon. Member for St. Ives made a reasonable point about the problems of bedsit man—someone who is poor, may have left the family home and can only afford to live in a bedsit without his children staying with him. We have tried to make allowance for poorer people who wish to share the care of their children by ensuring that those on benefits will face nil liability if they accommodate their children for only one night. That is a concession. Someone on benefit would normally be liable to pay £5 a week, but if he shares the care of the children for only one night a week, he will have, as I said, nil liability. I referred earlier to this balancing act.
<P>
The hon. Member for New Forest, West asked about the number of people likely to be affected. Currently, it is 7 per cent. of the caseload—65,000 people who fall under the shared care category, for which it is harder to qualify under existing law. We cannot predict people's behaviour, but on the basis of a caseload of 1 million, as many as 170,000 could benefit. We are therefore assuming an increase in shared care which, as I said earlier, we want to encourage.
<P>
I wish to spend some time dealing with the probing amendments. If taken literally, some of them would have odd effects, which Conservative Members should know about before deciding whether to vote for them.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 81, 99, 107, 69 and 108 all relate to adjustments of maintenance liability when the non-resident parent shares the care of his child. Amendments Nos. 81 and 99 relate to cases in which the non-resident parent is liable to pay the basic or reduced rate because he has a net weekly income of more than £100 a week. Amendments Nos. 107 and 69 relate to cases in which the non-resident parent is liable to pay the flat rate, either because he is receiving social security benefit or because he has an income of £100 or less. Amendment No. 108 is a general provision, about which I hope to satisfy hon. Members.
<P>
It may help if I quickly go through the basic ground rules that we are introducing. Our starting point is that it is desirable to encourage fathers, to use the language of the hon. Member for Gainsborough, to have contact with their children.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The current rules do not recognise the cost incurred by a non-resident parent when he has a child to stay for less than two nights a week on average. As I said, we have decided to reduce the threshold at which shared care arrangements reduce maintenance liability from 104 to 52 nights a year. Where care is shared for at least 52 nights a year, non-resident parents who do not receive social security benefits will have their liability reduced in proportion to the number of nights that the child spends with them. We recognise the special circumstances of non-resident parents who provide equal care for their children—an issue that has not been mentioned. The new rules therefore provide for maintenance to be reduced in such cases by an additional £7 for each child for whom care is equally shared. The thinking behind that figure is that it is approximately half the child benefit rate. Non-resident parents who receive social security benefits will have no liability. Research suggests that up to 30 per cent.—about 170,000 people—of non-resident parents will benefit from the planned relaxation of the threshold. I hope that that principle will be generally welcomed.
<P>
Amendment No. 81—amendment No. 100 has been superseded by amendment No. 69—calls for the wholesale removal of any shared care provisions where the non-resident parent is in work. That does not encourage shared care and would be bad for fathers, in terms of keeping in contact with their children, and also for children.
<P>
Under amendment No. 99, the shared care provisions would be retained, but would apply only where the parent with care was herself in receipt of income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. That means that non-resident parents who share the care of their child will pay less in child support where the parent with care is on benefit than when she is not, even though the non-resident parent's own income and circumstances—which is what the new scheme tests—have not changed. That cannot be right, is not consistent with the new formula and, apart from anything else, is discriminatory. The circumstances of the parent with care should make no difference to the non-resident parent's liabilities. We want to encourage the sharing of care in every case, not just where the parent with care is on benefit. Amendment No. 107 seeks to delete the condition that non-resident parents liable to pay the flat rate will qualify for a nil rate liability only where they receive a social security benefit.
<P>
The effect of that would be to give all non-resident parents in that category a nil liability where they share the care of their child—including those on a low income. Non-resident parents on benefit are inevitably amongst the poorest parents in the country—a point made repeatedly by the hon. Member for St. Ives. In the interests of the children, we think it right that in those circumstances shared care should lead to a removal of their maintenance liability of £5. However, non-resident parents in work will generally be better off and have more control over their income. In those circumstances, we have concluded that the minimum liability should remain due.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 relates specifically to cases where the non-resident parent is on benefit and has a nil rate liability because he shares the care of his child. The amendment would require that, where the shared care arrangements cease, instead of flat rate liability becoming due from the date that the agency is notified of the change, the revised liability would be backdated to the date that shared care ceased.
<P>
We intend to provide in regulations that parents will be required to notify only a limited number of changes to the new scheme—changes to the number of children in a family or to the status of a child, where a qualifying child ceases to be one. Changes to liability in those limited circumstances will take effect from the actual date of change.
<P>
Other changes will normally take effect only from the date that they are reported to the agency, usually by the parent with care. We do not consider that the cessation of shared care, or indeed any changes to shared care arrangements, should be treated differently from any other change of circumstances that the parents are not required to report, or which take effect from dates different to those set out in the normal rules. It creates more complexity if we begin to backdate and it could lead to the build-up of arrears that are not the fault of the non-resident parent. We are trying to eliminate that from the system.
<P>
It will be the responsibility of the parent with care to notify the CSA of any changes to shared care arrangements. Clearly, we should expect that to happen. If the shared care arrangements ceased, the parent would benefit from letting the agency know as quickly as possible.
<P>
Amendment No. 108 requires that regulations provide for the parent with care to be approached for details of the number of nights of shared care. I confirm that that is what happens now and that we do not intend to provide otherwise. However, we have radically simplified the information gathering process. The agency has to deal with innumerable disputes between parents about the extent to which either party provides overnight care. We are therefore introducing the broad band width approach to the relevant calculations, which is designed to avoid the need constantly to recalculate liability to reflect minor changes. The 365 nights a year mentioned by the hon. Member for Gainsborough would be much more complex, because they would have to be tested in every case and, no doubt, wrangled about in some circumstances; hence the broad band width approach.
<P>
We need to remember that the shared care provisions could be used to gain access to a child, even if the non-resident parent was not really interested in gaining access. In the end, the courts will make the decisions. All decisions about shared care will be made with the agreement of both parents. Only then will the CSA provisions kick in. We need to bear that in mind.
<P>
We want to move to a child support system that is simple, efficient and comprehensive and which contains minimum complexity or opportunity for dispute. As families change shape, we also need to recognise that the presence of fathers, their care for and contact with their children—and we hope, shared care—is desirable and we wish to encourage it. These changes do that, and I commend them to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> The Minister's closing remarks emphasise that no one would argue that shared care is undesirable: it is very desirable. All hon. Members who spoke in this interesting and, at times, impassioned debate made important and relevant points.
<P>
The amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) was intended to be a probing amendment. It would be wrong, in scrutinising the Bill clause by clause, to flit past this important clause without debating it. It contains an important change in law and an important and significant change in the role and reaction of the Child Support Agency. It is appropriate that hon. Members have a moment to dwell on it, to consider its implications and to ask Ministers to see whether there are opportunities for a little tweaking here and there to tighten the Bill and take account of the important points that have been made.
<P>
One benefit of the clause might be that more fathers would seek to share the care of their children. That implies that fathers need a financial incentive to do that, which may create residual resentments. Fathers who previously may not even have met their child or taken any interest could seek access and share the care. As the Minister rightly said, some people will always want pursue their grievances and the clause provides them with another angle and mechanism to do so.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right, but in circumstances when no interest had previously been shown in the child by the non-resident parent, shared care would have to be agreed with the parent who had care or the case would go to court. Surely the court would consider whether there was a dispute between the parents before it made a decision. The shared care provisions would come into play after the decision on whether any more contact or access had been made, not before.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I entirely accept that, but the provisions provide an incentive towards the vexatious court battles that many hon. Members are concerned might happen.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I should gently like to remind the hon. Gentleman that the Child Support Agency exists because courts favoured men. We could find the problem of odd decisions re-emerging with shared care.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> Earlier, the hon. Lady referred to the child perhaps becoming a pawn in a game, which we clearly want to avoid. Our attention has been drawn to hindsight, and we can only speculate on whether a reversion to court welfare would favour men.
<P>
The hon. Member for New Forest, West, in his characteristically eloquent way, made a point about the Child Support Agency being hated with a passion, and passions are involved in the issue of child contact. The schedule brings the Committee to a subject on which we are not simply considering cold financial calculations. The fact that we are considering passions and relationships should not be overlooked. Some consequences will inevitably add to pursued grievances, especially in relation to access to children.
<P>
If it were possible for parliamentary draftsmen to draw up clauses that distinguished between genuine, loving intentions and vexatious intentions, we could overcome many problems that the debate has identified. The hon. Member for Gainsborough described himself as an incurable romantic, but we all are, in the sense that we do not want to generate unnecessary additional battles. However, we accept that they will happen. At the same time, we want to encourage fathers to have additional contact with their children in a positive, loving way.
<P>
We have had a positive and enlightening debate, and I hope that Ministers will reflect on it in relation to our future debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I just want to make a brief point. We tabled a number of probing amendments; the Minister satisfied us on just about every point with the exception of amendment No. 69, which we therefore want to put to the vote.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) the income of the parent with care is high'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Amendment No. 67 is wide-ranging; we have table it to raise several issues in connection with the last matter of substance arising from schedule 1.
<P>
You may recall, Mr. O'Brien, that on Second Reading I referred to the American singer-songwriter Randy Newman singing about an uptown, uptempo woman and a downtown, downbeat guy. It is better to see the amendment in those terms. I regret that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee sometimes refer to the little woman trading up for a new man with more money who has a BMW car. That is not the reality now; that is not what it is about. Families have changed; incomes are different. It is true, by and large, that men earn more, but, thankfully, the disparity between the sexes among those who earn substantial sums of money is diminishing. A number of high-flying women earn considerable sums of money. I think of my contemporaries when I was a member of the Young Conservatives, some of whom are now Members of Parliament—but we do not want to go down memory lane. Nevertheless, some people in their thirties or forties are high-flyers, earning vast sums of money. Those who make the law must recognise the new realities.
<P>
The amendment seeks to do a number of things. It considers how investment income is achieved and it tries to ensure that the incomes of the parent with care and the non-resident parent are both taken into account. Occasionally during our deliberations, hon. Members are tempted to make moral judgments about the break-up of families. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West was most keen to emphasise that. Indeed, he sometimes sounds like a Scottish elder admonishing the flock for drinking a little too much sherry at a Hogmanay party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> What kind of Hogmanay party is that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The kind that they might enjoy in Morningside.
<P>
Other moral perspectives can be taken on the break-up of families and child support arrangements. We might wish to change the divorce laws, to make it a little harder. We might consider how couples should best arrive at a settlement. The Bill may try to put the child first, but we should not use the child as a moral hammer with which to break more rules. The trend is for greater liberalism. Only today, we have heard that the Church of England wishes to change its stance on the remarriage of divorced persons. Our legislation should reflect what takes place in society. However, there is a moral dimension.
<P>
I have always been careful to quote only small parts of various documents. During our two and a half sittings, no mention has been made of Mr. Justice Kay. We should make amends. The question of whether the income of both parents should be considered was examined by him. On page 74, in the anti-penultimate paragraph, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``factoring in''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—taking into consideration—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``some income of the carer are seen as being entirely consistent with two underlying essential bases of the scheme namely:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a)that children have their proper needs met from reasonable and adequate shares in the income, earning capacity, property and financial resource of both of their parents; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b)that parents share equitably in the support of their children''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> This argument has been examined in the Select Committee, but I am at a loss to understand how the hon. Gentleman's amendment would achieve such an objective. Baroness Hollis told us that only 200 of the parents with care dealt with by the CSA have an income of more than £500 a week. On present estimates, only about 200 people are affected by the amendment. If my schoolboy arithmetic is correct, even if the parent with care had an income of £50,000 a year, which is double the amount in the amendment, it would make a difference of only £5 a week. Does he seriously suggest that his amendment would achieve the objectives described by Mr. Justice Kay?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Yes, I am. The hon. Gentleman must not see the matter in a solid state way, to use a phrase from the computer world. He must not assume just because of the situation now that when the Bill is enacted it will not be part of some form of social engineering. I shall shortly demonstrate how things will change considerably.
<P>
The amendments may affect only a small number of individuals, but we are really talking about introducing a change in the CSA. If the procedures are to bed down, the public must have confidence in the CSA. Unless we get it right for people not just on low, but on high incomes—I concede that we are talking about a relatively small number of people—considerable bad publicity will surround the new CSA system. That is not in my interest; is not in the interest of Ministers or anyone who deals with such matters through their constituency surgeries. We must ensure that the system is fair.
<P>
Why should a non-resident parent pay the same when the parent with care is earning nothing or, say, £200,000? A powerful parent with care, who has considerable financial resources, can turn the screws hard on bed-sit man, as the Under-Secretary described him. The hon. Gentleman is right that there will probably not be many cases, but the law must be just and be seen to be just.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dismore rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman is about to tell me why bed-sit man, formerly married to a lady earning £200,000 a year, should pay her the same as if she was earning nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Actually I was about to make the following point: the hon. Gentleman argues that without his amendment the whole system would fall into disrepute and lead to bad publicity. Would not an amendment that docks by £20 a week the benefit of a woman earning £200,000 a year be seen as equally nonsensical by the general public?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not want to address that question. Frankly, it is illogical. The amendment seeks to be the framework for fairness. If it is defective in some small way, we shall be quite happy if the Minister wants to reconsider the matter on Report or in another place. However, we prefer the old system that allowed the income of both parties to be taken into consideration. The proposals will cause resentment and non co-operation, and in our experience, non co-operation does not result in less payment, but no payment whatsoever. That would be in no one's interest.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The parent with care will always have an interest in involving the CSA, because that parent has the certain knowledge that his or her income will be ignored. Mr. Mostyn, the eminent Queen's counsel who gave evidence to the Select Committee, spoke on that point and provided a short quotation from Families Need Fathers, which appears on page 70 of the Select Committee Report at paragraph 24. It may send a shiver down the hon. Gentleman's spine, because it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We therefore foresee the volume of new cases coming onto the CSA's books, articulate `middle England' who have never before had to engage with benefits-driven legislation or agencies, as the new explosion of discontent with the CSA.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will be no use the hon. Gentleman saying that he loyally supports the Government when middle England starts to mobilise. If we pause and listen carefully, we can almost hear Mr. Alastair Campbell turning on his word processor and sending out e-mails to Ministers, telling them that they will be in serious trouble if they bring about a new middle class revolt. It is surely not in the interest of the CSA, which is drinking at the last chance saloon, to do that.
<P>
Thanks to the Under-Secretary, we now have copies of the Child Support Act 1991 in its full form. Hon. Members will recall that section 1(1) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``each parent of a qualifying child is responsible for maintaining him.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As we move into the first year of the first century of the new millennium, it seems a retrograde step to revert to a system in which only one party is responsible in law for the financial well-being of the child. That step should be avoided, and it seems reasonable that the obligations should be shared equally between two parents.
<P>
I shall explain the mathematics, in an English as opposed to a Scottish variation. The attempt, albeit perhaps an inadequate one, is to try to achieve the Australian system. A pound of gross income is 60 pence of net income, which, divided by 52—converting annually to weekly—gives, approximate, a 1p reduction. It is effectively a dollar for dollar reduction, as in the Australian system, which works well there. Under it, when the income of the parent with care rises above a certain level—which we are happy to debate—there is a dollar for dollar reduction. That is seen as very fair in Australia, and I suspect that it would be seen as very fair in the United Kingdom. We look to the Government to explain why it is not regarded as very fair in the context of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, in Australia—where a higher rate is paid—it is paid on gross, rather than net, income. Should his argument not take account of that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Perhaps it should, but the amendments were tabled to allow us to debate whether the income of one parent in the relationship should be ignored. Ignoring one part of a relationship is unreasonable. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham intends to make a point about that in due course, but I cannot read her handwriting. [Laughter.] However, I am sure that if we went round the corner to Boots we could get a prescription made up.
<P>
I return to the subject of earned and unearned income, on which, as hon. Members will recall, we spent some time on Second Reading. During the debate, the Under-Secretary of State asked me to name the women to whom Bertie Wooster had been engaged, and I was happy to do so. I rather regret that, because I recognise that the code of the Woosters would not have allowed Bertie to get into such a situation.
<P>
Nevertheless, the point remains the same, whether one refers to unearned income or investment income. As I understand it—and I have been briefed by an eminent QC about the matter—the Bill does not include unearned or investment income. That is completely illogical. Honourable Members on both sides of the House agree that we should encourage people to have investment income. Surely, however, we should not use that argument to omit it from the Bill as that would act as an enormous disincentive on people to save out of fear that if they did, their savings would be taken to support their children.
<P>
The whole purpose of saving is to have money to use for other purposes—and what better purpose than the upkeep of one's child? It is wholly reasonable to encourage people to have investment income—to take out wise investments and receive dividends. However, they should not be encouraged to do so in order to avoid their responsibilities. The Bill contains a provision with regard to avoidance—I think that it is in schedule 4. It states that if a person knowingly denies themselves—or evades—income in order to reduce its level, the Secretary of State can, rightly, take action.
<P>
I shall cite again an example about the self-employed that I used on Second Reading, because it is apposite to the debate. We have seen at our surgeries the problems, writ large, that the self-employed have in defining their income. Let us imagine that a plumber decides not to take any wage from his company and that all his drawings from the company are by way of dividend, which he controls. I am advised by an eminent QC that—the Bill would not catch him. That is not acceptable. People should not be able to shirk their financial responsibilities for their families simply by switching between income, capital and dividend. We want the Government to say that they will close this loophole. I am sure that they intend to do so. I cannot believe for a moment that it is Government policy.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Before my hon. Friend sits down, could he ask the Minister to assure us that IR35 does not apply to his plumber, because his plumber is not working for just one employer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, which is worthy of an answer from the Minister. I have no idea what the answer is, but I thank her for what I think was meant to be a helpful contribution. Now that I think about it, she is absolutely right.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The penny has dropped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The penny has dropped. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I feel embarrassed that I had not thought of it at the start of my speech. No doubt the Minister, who I suspect will have a little time to think about that point, will reply to it in full.
<P>
I have roughly covered the points that I wanted to make. This important amendment offers the possibility of being able to take both parties into consideration and it closes a major loophole.
