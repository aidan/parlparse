<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000358"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> These amendments would postpone a number of
aspects of the schedule. I also tabled amendments Nos. 263 to 266; I
thought that it was best to table a complete list, but they could not
be selected, because they were not covered by the future years
resolution. However, the amendments that have been selected are
sufficiently coherent to stand on their own. I point out that, although
the amendments selected would be sufficient to postpone a number of
aspects of schedule 20, they would not have an impact on the operation
of accumulation and maintenance trusts or the commencement date for
provisions relating to such trusts as are set out in paragraphs 2 and 3
of the schedule; those paragraphs are not amended by the
amendments.</div><a name="06061539000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would postpone the operation of schedule 20 in relation to
setting up life interest trusts, and would also mean that the schedule
applied only to deaths after 6 April 2007. Although it now looks as
though a number of major flaws in the schedule will be resolved, or at
least mitigated, as a result of the amendments tabled by the Paymaster
General, I still urge the Committee and the Government seriously to
consider a postponement.</div>
<a name="06061539000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to use this
debate on the amendments to highlight the plight of those bereaved
since Budget day. They have been subjected to a sustained period of
anxiety and uncertainty. On top of the distress that accompanies
bereavement, they have had to wait to discover how they will be
affected by the changes in schedule 20.</div>
<a name="06061539000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute of Chartered
Accountants points
out:</div><a name="06061539000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It has
long been the convention that legislation will only take effect from
Budget Day if sufficient information on the legislation can be made
available to enable taxpayers to have reasonable certainty as to their
position.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 645</div><a name="06061539000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">This convention was not observed
in this case, and this must have caused real difficulty for bereaved
relatives at a difficult
time".</div><a name="06061539000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who knows how much money
such people have wasted on legal advice during that limbo period on
trying to find out what their position was, and on making sense of the
obscure and opaque drafting of the
schedule?</div><a name="06061539000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
postponement would provide time to analyse the schedule and work out
how it would operate in practice. Above all, it would lift a huge
burden from families affected by recent bereavement. Those people have
not been served well by a Government who published flawed proposals
without consulting on them, and without thinking them through properly.
The Government&#146;s failure to mention those proposed changes
during a lengthy and detailed consultation on the modernisation of
trusts has caused huge resentment.</div>
<a name="06061539000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">When John Cullinane of the
Association of Taxation Technicians addressed the House of Lords
onschedule 20, he said that if the Government&#146;s
intention</div><a name="06061539000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;was to change
the principles on which this tax operates then clearly governments have
a perfect right to do that...but then you would normally expect
them to
consult.&#148;</div><a name="06061539000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">John
Whiting of PricewaterhouseCoopers made the same point in his evidence
to that same House of Lords Committee. He expressed concern that the
changes had come out of the blue. He repeated his concerns following
the publication of the Government&#146;s amendments last week, and in
a press release
said:</div><a name="06061539000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many of
the anxieties and uncertainties that ordinary people have been
experiencing since Budget Day could have been avoided if the Government
had consulted on this in advance. People were put in the completely
unacceptable position that they did not know the IHT that would affect
their estates if they died after 21 March. The changes affecting deaths
could have been delayed to allow for proper consultation and we very
much hope this mistake will not be
repeated.&#148;</div><a name="06061539000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute
of Chartered Accountants weighed in again,
saying:</div><a name="06061539000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
wrong in principle that the most significant change to the IHT
treatment of trusts for over 25 years should be introduced without any
consultation.&#148;</div><a name="06061539000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chartered Institute of Taxation said:</div>
<a name="06061539000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Bill includes a
substantial tranche of legislation....that has been introduced without
consultation and is deeply flawed...The non-attributed comments in
the press by HM Treasury spokespersons that the professions and the
life industry do not know what they are doing...only serves to
undermine the consultation process on all matters, not just
trusts.&#148;</div> <a name="06061539000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
<i class="I">Financial Times</i> described the lack of consultation as
&#147;gratuitous and
offensive&#148;.</div><a name="06061539000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have little doubt that if a consultation had been carried out, the
Government would not have felt forced to introduce so many complex
amendments to correct their own legislation. As I told the Committee on
Tuesday, groups such as Mind have called for postponement of the
proposals in order to reassess the definition of
&#147;disability&#148; and its impact on those with mental health
problems. We will hear later today that insurance industry
representatives have also called for a delay to rethink the
schedule&#146;s highly problematic impact on life
policies.</div><a name="06061539000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">A delay
would also assist in resolving other problematic issues relating to
capital gains tax and income tax treatment of trusts, which I
highlighted during debate on clauses 88 and 89. It would allow time 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 646</div>to assemble a comprehensive and comprehensible corpus of law on the
taxation of trusts based on the principles set out in the modernisation
of trusts project, and to get to grips with a new regime for taxation
of trusts that remains deeply flawed despite the Government&#146;s
welcome if last-minute attempts to remedy its major
failures.</div><a name="06061539000053"></a>

press them to a Division today, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose
them.</div> <a name="06061539000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s amendments suggest that we should delay. As Committee
members will be aware, the legislation took effect for new settlements
from Budget day. The reason, as I have said a number of
times&#151;individuals quoted by the hon. Lady know it full well and
will recognise what I am about to say&#151;is that the Government
recognise that provisions have already been made for trusts existing
before Budget day. We have provided a generous two-year transition
period for pre-Budget trusts that will allow people to make changes to
existing trusts until 6 April 2008. As long as people continue under
the arrangements in place at the end of the transition period, the
trusts will continue to receive pre-Budget treatment.</div>
<a name="06061539000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, there is no reason
to postpone introduction. It would simply create an opportunity to set
up trusts in the intervening period solely in order to benefit from the
pre-Budget laws. That is commonly known as forestalling. Where
avoidance is being dealt with, no Government consults before taking
action. The previous Government did
not.</div><a name="06061539000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
continues to disagree with the central point: the legislation before
the House clearly lays out the main rules that will operate in
inheritance tax, and the schedule will ensure that they operate. There
is good reason for it, and there is no reason to delay. I reject the
hon. Lady&#146;s amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000360"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I am grateful for the Paymaster General&#146;s
remarks in response to my amendments. On the matter of forestalling,
the Government had the option to do what they did in relation to the
taxation of leases, for example. They could have announced that they
intended to change the rules and that those changes would take effect
from a certain date, thereby preventing any option to forestall. Then
they could have published draft legislation for consultation, debate
and discussion that would subsequently be enacted in legislation
backdated to the earlier announcement.</div>
<a name="06061539000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is one way that the
Government could have prevented any forestalling and ensured at the
same time that effective consultation had taken place. Even leaving
that aside, one has to wonder how much forestalling would be enabled by
the amendments. The Government&#146;s only justification for their
assertion that trusts are being used to shelter the wealth of the rich
from inheritance tax has related to A and M trusts. As I pointed out,
the proposals would not cover such trusts; they would still be covered
by schedule 20 from the same date as is set down in the
schedule.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 647</div><a name="06061539000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government believe that only &#163;15 million will be raised by the
proposals, the revenue lost as a result of forestalling could not be
significant in any event. Most seriously of all, the key, most
important group, which I have highlighted, are those who have died
since Budget day. I simply cannot believe that people are so anxious to
forestall legislation that they would be prepared to bring forward the
date of their own deaths to come under the old regime rather than the
new one. For those reasons, I should like to press my amendment to a
Division.</div> <a name="06061539000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000390"></a>The

may I just apologise and note your

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000392"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> May I also join my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) in offering my profound apologies?
I was in receipt of notes that I had requested, and I can only put that
down to the fact that I was unaware of the rules on this matter. I am
grateful to the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) for making the
point of order and to you, Sir John, for pointing out the error that I
have made.</div><a name="06061539000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return
to the subject of the amendments, self-settled trusts attract the new
charges because, for obvious reasons, they are set up during the
lifetime of the settlor. Schedule 20, as drafted, applies the 20 per
cent. entry charge and the 6 per cent. periodic charge to all such
lifetime trusts. As we have discussed in the debate on the disability
amendments, Government amendment No. 388 allows for self-settlement in
certain limited circumstances, but few people will be able to rely on
that provision. Only those who can demonstrate that they are within the
narrow definition of &#147;disabled&#148; contained in section 89,
or have a condition that will lead to their falling into that category
in future, will be able to do so. The amendments in this group would
allow anyone to self-settle without attracting the schedule 20 charges.
Self-settled trusts would thus stay out of the new regime and remain
governed by the old
regime.</div><a name="06061539000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
301 introduces a new section 49D, setting out the concept of &#147;an
immediate self-settled interest&#148; as a further form of trust
exempted from the proposed new IHT charges. Like immediate post-death
interests, the trust property in an immediate self-settled trust would
be deemed to be part of the estate of the settlor/beneficiary and IHT
would be paid on the death of the beneficiary, as it is with
life-interest trusts at
present.</div><a name="06061539000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems odd,
to say the least, to apply IHT&#151;a tax based on instances where
property passes from one person to another&#151;to the situation
where no genuine transfer of ownership is taking place at
all.</div><a name="06061539000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061539000393"></a><b class="B">Rob

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000394"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I shall come to that to explain people&#146;s
motivation in such
situations.</div><a name="06061539000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
face of it, hon. Members might wonder why people would want to set up
those trusts, but many vulnerable individuals find the option of
self-settlement helpful. The Chartered Institute of Taxation
says:</div><a name="06061539000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are many categories of person who, for their own protection (and not
for any tax reason), wish to settle assets on themselves, giving
themselves an immediate interest in possession. This may be desirable
for example for people suffering from mental or emotional instability
(falling short of mental incapacity) and also for persons facing
advancing age and early signs of degenerative
illness.&#148;</div><a name="06061539000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems unfair
to impose punitive extra charges on vulnerable people who are doing
their best to manage their condition and provide responsibly for their
future.</div><a name="06061539000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">People who
struggle with addiction often use such trusts to stop themselves
dissipating their assets when they face times when they are unable to
control their addiction. The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) was
justified in labelling schedule 20 as a possible charter for drug
dealers.</div><a name="06061539000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
with degenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, HIV and
Parkinson&#146;s, may also wish to place their assets in a trust for
themselves to provide for instances where their capacity to manage
their own property in the future may be diminished. As I said, this
problem seems to be mitigated by the Government&#146;s amendments,
but, as has also been discussed in relation to the debate on section 89
trusts, those with fluctuating conditions, such as manic depression or
schizophrenia, may also wish to self-settle to provide for periods when
their capacity is
impaired.</div><a name="06061539000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Paymaster General asserted that such cases could be covered, because
the trust could be set up during a period of impaired capacity. That is
helpful when a third party sets up a trust for a person with a
disability or impaired capacity, but we are discussing situations in
which people decide to set up the trust themselves. They will only
qualify for the carve-out when their capacity is impaired, but if their
capacity is impaired they will not be able to set up the
trust.</div>
<a name="06061539000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000395"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> What is to stop someone saying, &#147;I get a
bit depressed from time to time, so I shall declare myself vulnerable
and set up this kind of trust, and avoid some
tax&#148;?</div><a name="06061539000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000396"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> Setting up the trust will not avoid any tax at
all. All that such people are trying to do is to protect their assets
when their condition affects their ability to manage their property
effectively. Irrational and exuberant spending that is completely
unrelated to the individual&#146;s budget is a recognised symptom of,
for example, manic depression&#151;that has been medically proven as
a symptom of depression in many cases, and a self-settled trust is an
important way of dealing with such problems. The hon. Gentleman may
recall my quotation from the charity Rethink, which emphasised the
serious debt problems in which the mentally ill can find themselves as
a result of their condition. Such problems would be significantly
mitigated by the ability to
self-settle.</div><a name="06061539000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Others
who might wish to self-settle include those who have unexpectedly
inherited a large sum of money 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column650" />Column number: 651</div>and are concerned that they may not be able to manage it properly or
that they could fall prey to pressure from friends and relatives to
give it away. Such people should be able to retain the option of
self-settlement without incurring a tax
penalty.</div><a name="06061539000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">A solicitor
who responded to the Law Society survey on schedule 20 recounted a
cautionary tale concerning an 18-year-old who inherited a large sum of
money from her father. The father died intestate and the funds passed
to her absolutely. A year later she had managed to get through
&#163;750,000 of the inheritance with virtually nothing to show for
it at the end. The lawyer was concerned that it had all gone on
&#147;loans&#148; to people who claimed acquaintance with the
beneficiary and her family. In the light of such cases the Government
should be encouraging self-settlement, rather than penalising
it.</div><a name="06061539000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Self-settlement is
also highly important for US citizens who work in the United Kingdom.
US citizens tend to be advised to settle their assets on the basis of
what is called a living revocable trust. Again, that has nothing to do
with tax&#151;it is to avoid extremely complicated probate
procedures. On the death of the settlor, such trusts typically confer a
life interest onthe surviving spouse, with gifts into certain
trusts for the benefit of children. The difficulty caused by schedule
20 relates to the timing of inheritance tax liability, because as
drafted the schedule gives rise to problems both for Americans who had
a living revocable trust in place before Budget day, and for those who
might wish to set one up in the
future.</div><a name="06061539000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those who
already have trusts the problem is twofold. The life interest granted
to a spouse under such a trust would invariably be too flexible to
comply with condition 4 of section 49A. Under schedule 20 as drafted,
that would be enough to take it outside the definition of an immediate
post-death interest. The spouse exemption would be lost and the new, 20
per cent. entry charge and 6 per cent. periodic charge would be
triggered. The problem would be resolved by the amendments that I and
the Paymaster General have tabled to section 49A to delete that
condition.</div><a name="06061539000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there is a further problem that the amendments will not solve. On the
death of a first spouse, the second spouse gets her life interest to
the assets by an appointment under the trust, not under the
husband&#146;s will. Although the spouse is setting up a life
interest for his spouse that takes effect upon his death, that cannot
be an immediate post-death interest because it does not arise under the
will, nor is it a transitional serial interest, so the new charges
would apply.</div><a name="06061539000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
is also relevant to amendment No. 229, which will be addressed later.
However, that amendment would solve the problem only for trusts already
in operation. Those US citizens who did not have living revocable
trusts set up before Budget day face a further difficulty. They are
settling assets on themselves and thus the act of setting up the trust
will trigger the new charges, because it is a lifetime
trust.</div>
<a name="06061539000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="06061539000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
we have another example of where the spouse exemption is undermined
because the inheritance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column651" />Column number: 652</div>tax charge is brought forward to the point at which the trust is set up.
Rather than applying on the death of the second spouse, it will apply
on the death of the first spouse or when the trust is set up, depending
on whether it post-dated or predated Budget day.</div>
<a name="06061539000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The loss of the exemption could
cause all the harsh results that we will no doubt examine in relation
to the amendments on the definition of &#147;immediate post-death
interest&#148;. Another particular problem is caused in this context.
Under the pre-Budget rules, US estate tax and UK IHT arose at the same
time. No tax was payable on the death of the first spouse but both bit
on the death of the second. Under the double-taxation treaty between
the UK and the US, tax paid in one jurisdiction could be credited
against the tax liability in the
other.</div><a name="06061539000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
explained, schedule 20 operates to bring forward the liability to UK
IHT, either to the date when the trust was set up or on the death of
the first spouse. At that point there is, as yet, no liability to pay
US estate tax, because that does not arise until the death of the
second spouse. Therefore there is no US tax liability against which to
credit the UK IHT paid, and the effect of the schedule is to leave US
citizens working in the UK with a double tax charge&#151;to both IHT
and estate tax.</div>
<a name="06061539000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000397"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Surely the cases that the hon. Lady is outlining
involve US citizens who are habitually resident in the UK. In those
circumstances, could they not rewrite the will within two years of
death, just as any habitually resident UK person could do? That would
get around this.</div>
<a name="06061539000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000398"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> That would not be effective in getting around
things, because these trusts are set up before the death takes place.
If they are contained in a will, they go into probate. That is the
problem. It is not a tax issue for Americans; the probate issues are
the problem. They have to take the assets out of their estate before
they die. I understand that in many circumstances US citizens remain
subject to tax in the United States despite the fact that they are
working in the UK.</div><a name="06061539000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rules provide a further problem for UK-based Americans, if they are
married to non-US citizens. Where an American is married to a
non-American spouse, US tax law provides that the spouse exemption will
not apply to bequests under a will that passes property outright to a
spouse. For the spouse exemption to apply, the property that is to go
to the spouse must be placed into what is known as a qualifying
domestic trust&#151;or QDOT&#151;the purpose of which is to keep
the assets within the US tax regime and prevent their going
offshore.</div> <a name="06061539000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original draft of Schedule 20 gave rise to a problem, since the type of
life interest set up under a QDOT would be sufficiently flexible to
fall foul of condition 4. While that problem would be resolved by the
amendments tabled by myself and the Paymaster General, the bar on
self-settlements causes a problem and has yet to be
addressed.</div>
<a name="06061539000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a QDOT is
not set up in a will, US law permits the surviving spouse to transfer
the assets received on the death of the US spouse into a QDOT. That
takes effect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column652" />Column number: 653</div>as a result of self-settlement, because the assets
are passed to the spouse and she therefore sets up the QDOT over them
to bring them into the tax law regime.</div>
<a name="06061539000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the surviving spouse is
faced with an inheritance tax charge at that point, because she has
self-settled, there is again a disjunction between the US tax
liability, which arises on her death, and the UK IHT liability, which
arises immediately on entry to the QDOT. Hence, the spouse in that case
could be left facing a double taxation bill.</div>
<a name="06061539000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appeal to the Government on
this issue for the sake of many vulnerable people who simply wish to
act responsibly to protect themselves from their own weakness. I urge
the Committee to accept the amendments that have been tabled in my name
and those of my hon. Friends.</div>
<a name="06061539000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000399"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> In speaking to the amendments, the hon. Member
for Chipping Barnet made a special case for the provision for
self-settlement trusts. It is worth reminding the Committee of the
context of such matters. Clause 157 and schedule 20 are being
introduced to counter IHT avoidance. Trusts set up during a
person&#146;s life have been used for such avoidance, so the
Government are restricting the situations in which they can be set up
and receive tax-favoured treatment. I am not saying that the trusts
cannot be set up in the circumstances described by the hon. Lady; that
is a matter for the individual. The question is whether they should
receive special tax treatment, but she has not made a case for that. My
constituents would be interested in the concept that rich drug addicts
require special treatment and tax relief. As tragic as that is, I do
not undermine its importance because I know from experience in my
constituency how drug addiction can destroy individuals&#146;
families and communities and none of them has had access to tax
relief.</div><a name="06061539000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000400"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> The Paymaster General persists in saying that
schedule 20 charges bring the treatment of certain trusts into line
with the mainstream treatment of trusts. That is not the case. It has
been a long-standing provision of tax law that the law should look
through the trust and treat the transfer in the same way as the
transfer outright. Hence, life interest trusts of the sort that we are
discussing today have always been treated in the same way as outright
transfers of assets. Therefore, the inheritance tax bites on death. I
am not asking for special treatment for those who wish to self-settle,
but for them to remain within the mainstream rules and not be subjected
to harsh new punitive measures designed for discretionary trusts, which
are quite
different.</div><a name="06061539000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000401"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I beg to differ from the hon. Lady. I have made
my point clear about the discretionary trust rules. She is entitled to
repeat her argument and I am entitled to repeat the Government&#146;s
position regardless of her views and the views of members of the legal
profession who advise clients. I repeat that a case has not been made
for special
treatment.</div><a name="06061539000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Lady identified, in the past self-settlements have been used for
various reasons. She referred to wealthy drug addicts who put money
away to prevent it from being used to fuel their addiction. They are
not prevented from taking such
action&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column653" />Column number: 654</div><a name="06061539000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000402"></a>Mrs.
Villiers</b>
<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div><a name="06061539000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000403"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> No. I shall finish my point and then the hon.
Lady can reply. However, the trusts are used in other ways such as to
prevent creditors from having access to individuals who become bankrupt
or to prevent taxation burdens in other countries from applying and
setting up trusts to shelter on that basis. If people decide that that
is what they will do, the central question is whether they should be
entitled to special tax relief. The Government&#146;s view is that
they should
not.</div><a name="06061539000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady explained at length the difficulty of some United States
citizens, although they would need to be particularly wealthy. She said
that they might be exposed to both US and UK taxes. I understand her
point. She talked about QDOTs, too, which take us into the highly
complex area of what US legislation requires. However much we share
those concerns, surely we cannot allow them to pull all of the UK
regime out of shape. Our rules are designed primarily for UK citizens.
The majority of people will not face US tax issues. Further, I say to
the hon. Lady that I do not believe that it is impossible for a US
citizen to find adequate solutions to the tax matters that she has been
discussing.</div> <a name="06061539000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I do not accept the central proposition that we should amend UK
legislation for that area, despite my sympathy for the complexities
that those individuals face. It is not the only area of the tax system
in which the interaction between what the US requires of their
citizens, wherever they are in the world, and whatever the tax regime
is, whether it be the UK or any other European one, throws up huge
complexities. However that is not a matter for this schedule. If people
want to use trusts for other purposes, they can still do so.</div>
<a name="06061539000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We remind the Committee that
with regard to those arrangements about the actual sum going in, no IHT
is due if the assets in the trust are less than the zero threshold,
that is &#163;285,000 rising to &#163;325,000 in 2009. We are not
talking about small amounts of money.</div>
<a name="06061539000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the Government agreed
that the subject of the disabled was different and we have had debates
on that. We had that debate during our discussion of Government
amendment No. 388. I was clear on the question of particular examples
such as degenerative diseases. Manic depression was another example
that Opposition Members gave. The question was whether the individual
&#147;expected to&#148;. The phrase relates to someone simply
&#147;expected&#148; not to be able to make financial decisions in
the future on wealth. That is covered in Amendment No. 388 and we have
discussed that extensively.</div>
<a name="06061539000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, I regret to tell
the hon. Lady again that I cannot accept her amendments. Lifetime
settlements can be used for avoidance. I see no reason at all why
self-settlements should receive tax-favoured treatment. The non-tax
favoured trusts are quite suitable and we have explained why that is so
under special circumstances and that is entirely appropriate. If the
hon. Lady does want to press her amendments to a Division, I will ask
my hon. Friends to oppose
them.</div><a name="06061539000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000404"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> As I said in my intervention, the Opposition are
not asking for special favourable treatment for those trusts, merely a

served this country for many years.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column654" />Column number: 655</div><a name="06061539000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat that people&#146;s
motivation for setting up trusts is to enable them to protect their
property from themselves and not from their creditors. The Insolvency
Act prevents such attempts from being successful anyway. Therefore, I
cannot see that that would be a motivation in setting up self-settled
trusts. The Paymaster General asserts that such trusts have been used
for avoidance but has produced no evidence as to how they could
possibly be used for avoidance.</div>
<a name="06061539000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster General rightly
says that we should not draft our tax system based solely on the needs
of US citizens. However, it is an important matter for our
competitiveness to ensure that our tax system does not unnecessarily
penalise US citizens, many of whom are important to maintaining the
competitiveness of this country by bringing inward investment into the
country. The Paymaster General said that it was unreasonable to ask for
the law to be amended to deal with problems faced by US citizens. I am
not calling for the law to be amended at all; it should stay as it is.
All I ask is that the Government do not bring in legislation that puts
those practical difficulties in the way of not only Americans, but a
number of the most vulnerable people in our
society.</div><a name="06061539000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

General also referred repeatedly to the fact that the nil rate band is

that once the nil rate band is used, it is gone for ever. If a trust
has been set up and the nil rate band has been used up, there will be
none left on the death of the individual; inheritance tax at 40 per

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000434"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> With the changes proposed inschedule
20, there is a danger that an inheritance tax bill could be added to
all the other deep pain and suffering caused by divorce and
relationship breakdown. Trusts set up on a relationship breakdown
cannot fall within the new charges&#146; immediate post-death
interest exemption because they are set up inter vivos&#151;during
the lifetime of the settlor, when both partners are still
alive.</div><a name="06061539000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems that
section 10 of the Inheritance TaxAct 1984 will prevent the
imposition of the 20 per cent. entry charge to a trust set up on
divorce, although I would be grateful if the Paymaster General
confirmed that understanding. However, section 10 does not appear to
save such a trust from the periodic 6 per cent. charge or the
proportionate exit charge when the trust comes to an
end.</div><a name="06061539000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
319 to 337 seek to prevent the imposition of any new IHT charges in
that context by providing that trusts set up as a result of a
relationship breakdown will be covered by the old regime. Amendment No.
320 would add a new section 49D containing a further category of life
interest trust in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column657" />Column number: 658</div>addition to the immediate post-death interest, which would continue to
be treated as part of the estate of the life tenant, taxed accordingly
and dealt with by existing rules for life interest trusts. That would
place such trusts outside the scope of the new charges proposed in
schedule 20.</div><a name="06061539000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts
are an important and useful tool in dealing with the sad consequences
of relationship breakdown. They can be set up by the courts under
section 24(1)(b) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 or schedule 1 of
the Children Act 1989. Trusts have been used in the divorce courts for
many years, and will no doubt be of assistance when the courts
adjudicate on the breakdown of civil partnerships as well. They are
particularly important for those of middle incomes and modest means who
have children to maintain but insufficient assets to allow for a
clean-break settlement.
</div><a name="06061539000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Christopher McCall,
the Queen&#146;s counsel to whom I referred in Committee of the whole
House, is a man with a long and distinguished record of assisting the
Revenue in preventing and clamping down on artificial and aggressive
avoidance schemes. He is quite clear about trusts&#146; usefulness in
the family
context:</div><a name="06061539000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
profession is clear that [trust] arrangements are very far from being
strangers to the family courts. Such arrangements are not so much the
province of the very wealthy (who, having adequate assets for the
purpose, may be expected to prefer the form of capital provision which
maximises the advantages of the clean break approach) but those who,
though they have enough money to worry about matrimonial rules for
financial provision, lack the means to do so on the basis of pure
outright provision. Such individuals are of course those in the poorest
position to meet extra burdens of costs, let alone taxation arising out
of the tragedy of matrimonial
breakdown.&#148;</div><a name="06061539000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
most common trust used in the divorce courts is the Mesher order, which
gives the spouse with primary responsibility for the children the right
to live in the former matrimonial home or a new home bought under the
divorce proceedings until any one of three triggering events occurs:
she remarries, she dies or the children finish their education. I am
told that the Revenue has indicated that such situations could be
covered by granting a charge over the property in favour of the
non-resident spouse that can be enforced in the event of one of the
three triggering
events.</div><a name="06061539000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tim Galloway,
a trusts expert from the leading firm of solicitors Charles Russell,
wrote to me:</div>
<a name="06061539000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Legal charges are not
suitable to deal in all circumstances with provision for minor children
on relationship breakdown, particularly in cases involving unmarried
couples. In those circumstances, trusts provide a vital and flexible
means of balancing the conflicting needs and wishes of those
involved.&#148;</div><a name="06061539000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
charge route can lead to a greater capital gains tax charge, leaving
fewer resources for a family already facing the financial penalties of
divorce. The family courts might also make arrangements that, although
not expressly labelled as such, involve a trust and would therefore
fall foul of the new rules.</div>
<a name="06061539000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some lawyers certainly believe
that any arrangement giving a spouse occupation rights terminating on a
particular event will be viewed as a trust and taxed accordingly,
whatever label the court chooses to place on that arrangement. Even if
the court calls it a charge, it might well be considered a trust by the
Revenue and taxed
accordingly.</div><a name="06061539000221"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000435"></a>Rob

tax?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column658" />Column number: 659</div><a name="06061539000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000436"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I am not sure on the detail of that; I am happy
to come back to the hon. Gentleman on that point, but I am advised that
the charge can lead to capital gains tax
problems.</div><a name="06061539000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
Mesher orders, there are two other ways in which the new inheritance
tax regime could hit divorcing couples. First, existing family
settlements may need to be varied so that property can be divided
between the spouses&#151;for example, in order to appoint one of the
spouses to a life interest in the fund. It seems that the new
inheritance tax charges would apply in that case. Indeed, such
arrangements would attract a more significant penalty, because section
10 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 will not protect such a variation
from the 20 per cent. entry charges, so the trust would bear that
charge as well as the periodic
one.</div><a name="06061539000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem might
be mitigated by amendmentNo. 229, which would allow someone to
appoint a spouse to a life interest within the transitional serial
interest regime. Secondly, trusts can be used to help resolve disputes
between divorcing spouses and civil partners before they get to a
courtroom. One spouse may be more willing to reach an agreement that
involves transferring assets if the other spouse does not have
unrestricted control over them. I know that the Paymaster General is
particularly concerned about arrangements that pass assets but retain a
degree of control, but such a facility can help couples to reach an
agreement, particularly in cases where one spouse has met another
partner. For instance, someone may be prepared to agree a transfer of
significant assets to their ex-spouse if a trust is set up to ensure
that those assets eventually pass to the children of the
marriage.</div> <a name="06061539000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, divorce and relationship breakdown already cause enough
misery. I appeal to the Paymaster General and the Government to make
absolutely sure that they do not inflict an IHT bill on those going
through that difficult and distressing
process.</div><a name="06061539000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000437"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> There has been a great deal of declaring of
interests this morning. I am not sure whether I have to declare one, as
I am divorced. I absolutely concur with the hon. Lady that divorce is a
difficult and emotional period, and at no point was it suggested to me
that I use a trust. In fact, it was a clean break, which I have to
recommend. A clean break is the way to proceed. That goes to the heart
of the matter.</div> <a name="06061539000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">In one
of the hon. Lady&#146;s arguments, she pleaded legal advice. I am not
a lawyer, but the legal advice given to me was of the contrary view,
although I do not think that it particularly advances net understanding
of the issues around divorce. Every Committee member will either know
someone who has experienced divorce or, if they are unlucky, have
experienced it
themselves.</div><a name="06061539000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is clear: the hon. Lady says that trusts are a vital tool,
essential in the handling of divorce settlements. I do not deny that
some people might say that it is useful, but it is not essential, and
that is the point&#151;whether it is essential. There are clear
reasons, normally advocated by Opposition Members, for sticking to the
principle enshrined in the schedule. That principle is to recognise the
exceptions, and to recognise that trusts are useful&#151;people use
them for a variety of reasons&#151;but not essential, and so should
not be in an exceptional regime. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column659" />Column number: 660</div>I shall tell the hon. Lady the legal advice that I heard from family
lawyers with extensive experience of handling divorce and related
issues. Also, we need only consider the cases that occasionally hit the
headlines, where the question is how much that clean break should cost.
The lawyers tell me that trusts are seldom used in modern divorce
settlements and are not part of standard
practice.</div><a name="06061539000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06061539000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not deny
that a trust might be used on divorce, but it would be likely to be
chosen to deliver the outcome sought and to provide the additional
benefit of saving some inheritance tax. I understand that. However, the
hon. Lady&#146;s central argument is that it is essential and
unavoidable. It is not essential. That choice is rarely made, but when
it is made, it is for the precise reasons that I have continued to
advance in respect of some uses of the exemptions that are rather wider
than the legislation intends. I do not accept her argument and I will
ask my hon. Friends to oppose the amendment, should she choose to press
it to a
vote.</div><a name="06061539000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000438"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I think that I understand the arguments advanced
by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet, but there seems to be a slight
contradiction in Conservative party policy. Party policies change over
the years, of course. However, the proposal appears to be aimed at
helping the rich. I know that the hon. Lady said it was for
middle-income families, and so on. I am not talking about the
super-rich, but about what I shall call the well-to-do.</div>
<a name="06061539000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The previous Government, led by
the party that the hon. Lady now supports and may have supported then,
abolished tax relief on maintenance payments for children, which did
not just affect the very rich or well-to-do, but almost anyone with
taxable income. That measure went way down the income scale. That tax
assistance for families who were sadly getting divorced was withdrawn
by her party when it was in government. It seems that she is advancing
proposals today that might at least suit the well-off. I suspect that
only the pretty rich would have such spare assets around. That is what
the Conservatives want to stand for&#151;the rich. When there was a
tax relief that affected almost everybody, they withdrew
it.</div><a name="06061539000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I bow to the hon.
Lady&#146;s legal knowledge on this matter, about which she has been
briefed, although she did not know the answer to my previous question.
However, I should like to know whether a Mesher order is legally for
tax purposes a trust. It is many years since I practised family law,
but I understand that Mesher orders are going out of
style.</div><a name="06061539000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000439"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first
question is yes. When there is a Mesher order, it is legally for tax
purposes a trust. The point that I was making is that any similar
arrangement where there isa right to occupy the property that
terminates when a certain event happens is, arguably for tax purposes,
a trust as well.</div><a name="06061539000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman criticised a previous Conservative Administration for
their approach on child maintenance. It lies ill in the mouth of
someone on the Labour Benches talk about this issue, given the disaster
at the Child Support Agency.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000442"></a>Mrs.

the CSA, which I recall that they voted for in the first
place.</div><a name="06061539000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the
Paymaster General&#146;s comments, I agree that a clean break is the
most desirable outcome. I am not divorced; I soon shall be. I shall
have a clean-break settlement. People who have the assets available to
make outright provision for a clean break will do so as a matter of
preference for all sorts or reasons&#151;emotional and
financial&#151;but for many people, that is not possible.</div>
<a name="06061539000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster General says that
such a trust is useful but not essential. I contest that, because of
the possibility that I mentioned that the replacement arrangements that
perform a similar function might be construed as trusts by the Revenue
anyway. If that legal understanding is right, the tool in question is
indeed an essential one. Even if that understanding is incorrect, it is
still unnecessary, unwise and undesirable to impose new penal tax
charges on a useful tool that assists people in dealing with the
misery, unhappiness and financial difficulties that are caused by
divorce.</div> <a name="06061539000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I close by
repeating that we do not seek special tax treatment in this case; we
are merely trying to retain such trusts in the tax regime as it has
operated for many years, for the sake of helping civil partners and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000469"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> This group of amendments concerns paragraph 5 of
schedule 20, which would insert a new section 49A into the Inheritance
Tax Act 1984. The new section is of crucial importance in schedule
20&#146;s proposed new system for the taxation of trusts, because it
contains the definition of the immediate post-death interest to which
reference has been made several times in the debates on the schedule.
Schedule 20 provides henceforth that any life interest trust that falls
outside the definition of an immediate post-death interest will be
brought within the punitive tax regime that operates for discretionary
trusts&#151;namely a 20 per cent. charge on capital when the trust is
set up, with a further 6 per cent. periodic charge every 10
years.</div> <a name="06061539000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I set out
at some length in debate in the Committee of the whole House, the
restrictive definition set out in the new section 49A&#151;and in
particular conditions 3 and 4&#151;will mean that virtually every
single will across this nation that left property to a spouse for life
would fall outside the IPDI definition and would therefore be subject
to the new charges.</div>
<a name="06061539000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster General dismissed
my concerns about conditions 3 and 4 outright. What is more, as I set
out in my introductory remarks, she dismissed them in very robust
terms. She said that there was nothing in the Bill that affected the
spouse exemption under normal inheritance tax rules. On the amendments
to protect the spouse exemption she said:</div>
<a name="06061539000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All the new clauses and
amendments before us are unnecessary, because what is asserted will
happen will not, in fact.&#148;</div>
<a name="06061539000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">She said of the life interest trust for
spouses:</div><a name="06061539000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
further flexible power is necessary in the trust, because it has
delivered its objective.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 2 May
2006; Vol. 445, c.
870-1.]</div><a name="06061539000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">She said, of my
remarks:</div> <a name="06061539000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
hon. Lady does not know what she is talking
about.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 2 May 2006; Vol. 445, c.
868.]</div><a name="06061539000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was therefore somewhat
surprised to see the Paymaster General table amendment No. 359 last
Thursday because its effect is identical to that of my amendment No.
226.</div><a name="06061539000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000470"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> May I put it on record that I apologise to the
hon. Lady? I think that I should have phrased my remarks better. That
is a point to
her.</div><a name="06061539000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061539000471"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I very much appreciate the Paymaster
General&#146;s gracious comment. Indeed, I would very much welcome
her name on my amendment. I welcome her change of heart for the sake of
millions of ordinary people who, were it not for the amendment, would
face the hassle of rewriting their will and huge anxiety about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column662" />Column number: 663</div>the new tax charges that could have forced their
bereaved spouse to sell their home to pay for this latest hit on
hard-working and prudent families in middle England.</div>
<a name="06061539000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments that the
Paymaster General and I have proposed are important because they will
preserve the long-standing principle that inheritance tax should not be
paid on property that passes between husbands and wives. That principle
has been a fundamental part of the way that the IHT regime has operated
since 1894 and reflects the recognition of the harshness of forcing a
bereaved spouse to sell the family home to meet an inheritance tax
bill.</div> <a name="06061539000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The importance
of the spouse exemption has recently been recognised in its extension
to the gay community with the introduction of civil partnerships by
section 103 of the Finance Act 2005. Contrary to the Paymaster
General&#146;s assertions, the existing law does not grant privileged
tax treatment to life interest trusts. Under pre-Budget rules, in line
with another long-standing principle of tax law, they are taxed in the
same way as outright gifts.</div>
<a name="06061539000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a will sets up a life
interest for a spouse, it is treated as part of the estate of that
spouse. It therefore receives the protection of the spouse exemption
and the property is subjected to IHT on the second death, not the
first. Far from, as the Paymaster General initially claimed, aligning
the treatment of life interest trusts with the normal tax regime for
trusts, schedule 20, as drafted, would bring them within the so-called
&#147;relevant property regime&#148; and subject them to the
punitive tax regime used for discretionary trusts.</div>
<a name="06061539000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">For many years, there has been
a special regime for discretionary trusts because, under such trusts,
there was no triggering death to which to pin the IHT charge as the
property could not be identified with any one particular beneficiary.
No such problem arises in the case of interest in possession trusts.
The impact of schedule 20 would therefore have been to impose a harsher
tax regime than would have applied had the property been transferred to
the spouse outright. That goes against the long-standing principle,
recently reaffirmed by the Treasury in its consultation on the
modernisation of trusts, in which one of the Government&#146;s stated
goal was:</div> <a name="06061539000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
tax system for trusts that does not provide artificial incentives to
set up a trust but equally, avoids artificial obstacles to using trusts
where they would bring significant non-tax benefits.&#148;</div>
<a name="06061539000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts are
typically used, for example, in the instance that we are talking about
here, when a second marriage has taken place. A standard will that is
made by thousands, if not millions, of people in this country provides
that the assets are left on trust for the widow&#151;the second
wife&#151;during her lifetime. On her death or remarriage, the assets
pass to the children of the husband&#146;s first marriage. Unless the
amendments are adopted, the spouse exemption will be lost in this case,
and tensions between step-parent and stepchildren could make it
impossible to agree a variation of the will to try to retrieve the
spouse exemption.</div>
<a name="06061539000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06061539000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
debate in the Committee of the whole House, the Paymaster General
asserted that the spouse 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column663" />Column number: 664</div>exemption would not be affected by schedule 20. I am
pleased that she has changed her approach. Presumably her initial
statement was based on a belief that such an arrangement could be made
to comply with the six conditions included in the definition of
immediate post-death interest that are set out in new section 49A.
</div><a name="06061539000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the
problematic conditions 3 and 4, it is essential that the Committee
adopt either my amendment or that put forward by the Paymaster General
to delete them. Those conditions would prevent any but the most
inflexible trust from qualifying as an immediate post-death interest,
and some professionals believe that it would be virtually impossible
for any trust to satisfy those conditions. Condition 3 provides that
the life tenant must have the power to veto any proposal by the
trustees to terminate her life interest. I shall explore that later. It
poses particular problems for the Muslim community, which we shall
consider in relation to amendment No. 359.</div>
<a name="06061539000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition 4, however, causes
even greater difficulties, not just for minority communities but for
society as a whole. It provides that a trust will count as an immediate
post-death interest only if one of four events occurs when the life
interest comes to an end: the property must pass to a charity, a trust
for a bereaved minor, a trust for a disabled person or&#151;this is
the key problem&#151;a person who will become absolutely entitled to
the property in which the interest subsists. The problem with that
definition is the absolutist way in which it is phrased.</div>
<a name="06061539000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation is drafted in such a way as to impose a charge not when an
offending event actually happens but when it is a mere possibility. So
if there is any possibility that the property might not vest in
somebody absolutely when the life interest comes to an end, the new
charges apply. A number of professionals have expressed doubt as to
whether condition 4 can ever be satisfied. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants gives the following example to illustrate the problem: W
leaves his property on trust for his second wife with the remainder of
his estate going to his adult children. At first sight, that looks to
be within condition 4, but can we say that the children will definitely
become entitled to the remainder estate? What happens if they die
before their stepmother? It is difficult to say that they will become
absolutely entitled.</div>
<a name="06061539000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">An even more serious concern
arises in relation to section 32 of the Trustee Act 1925. I acknowledge
that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West caught me out on
capital gains tax, but I think that I was able to give him pause for
thought when we discussed section 32 on Tuesday. The problem, as I
adverted to then, is that, unless it is specifically excluded, section
32 inserts a term into all trusts giving the trustees the power to
advance up to half the capital.
</div><a name="06061539000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case of
Pilkington <i class="I">v</i> IRC established as far back as 1964 that the
statutory power gave trustees the right to transfer up to half that
capital into a new trust. Section 32, therefore, authorises the
application of trust property in ways that go beyond those permitted by
condition 4, including postponing vesting of the interest in remainder
beneficiaries. On the face of it, that would seem to be enough to cause
condition 4 to be breached. As I said on Tuesday, that is of crucial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column664" />Column number: 665</div>importance because section 32 applies to the statutory trusts that arise
on intestacy.</div> <a name="06061539000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless
the section 32 point is dealt with, the new charges will bite on trusts
set up on intestacy. There is explicit provision in schedule 20 to
prevent section 32 powers from causing a problem in the context of a
trust 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column665" />Column number: 666</div>for a bereaved minor in new section 71A(4), but there is no express
provision to make the same saving in relation to IIP trusts.</div>
