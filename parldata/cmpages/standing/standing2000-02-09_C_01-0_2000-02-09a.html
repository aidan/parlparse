<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we start the formal proceedings, I shall make a couple of housekeeping announcements. I apologise for suspending the Committee for 15 minutes, but it seemed the intelligent thing to do as there was a Division in the House at 29 minutes past four.
<P>
Hon. Members have my permission to remove their jackets if they want to do so, and they should consider permission granted in future. In case there is any confusion, as we appear to be in three different time zones, the official clock that I shall use is the monitor to my right.
<P>
The Minister sends her apologies. She intends no discourtesy, but she is giving evidence to a Select Committee. She aims to join us before the sitting ends and expects to be with us at the next sitting.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton </B>(Congleton): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Medical Treatment (Prevention of Euthanasia) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a great pleasure to know that you are in the Chair, Mr. Gale, to preside over the Committee stage of the Bill. I shall be slightly rusty so far as procedure is concerned, as I have not been on this side of the fence for a long time. I am sure that you will be patient and will point me in the right direction from time to time. I am equally sure that you will be firm but fair in all your dealings with the Committee.
<P>
This is the first private Member's Bill for which I have been responsible, and I hope that I can shepherd it over the many hurdles in its way. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) had that experience last year. She is sitting right behind me; I hope that she will not hold a gun to my back. Perhaps she will mutter a little advice from time to time.
<P>
I was much encouraged by the tone of debate on Second Reading. Many hon. Members contributed, and some on the other side of the argument put their cases forcefully and clearly. Overall, it was a wide-ranging debate of a high standard. Many concerns were raised in speeches and interventions, and it is my intention that they should be thoroughly aired in Committee. No doubt we shall discuss many amendments.
<P>
Given the nature of the Bill and the reassurances that I gave on Second Reading, it would be wrong to bounce the Bill through, which I could do. Hon. Members' concerns on Second Reading should be aired properly and voted on in Committee if necessary. In addition, we should have sufficient time for mature reflection and debate on many vital issues, and hon. Members framing amendments will no doubt reflect on them carefully.
<P>
The best way to proceed is to try to make good progress. It is to that end that I tabled a sittings motion to sit on Wednesday mornings and afternoons. I hope that hon. Members will agree to the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Joe Ashton </B>(Bassetlaw): I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady, but unfortunately her actions in setting up the Committee did not match her words. The Bill's Second Reading was unopposed. We said, rightly, that the Bill should be probed, analysed and examined, because it involved serious recriminations.
<P>
I understand that the Selection Committee rejected the original proposed membership of the Standing Committee on the grounds that it contained two Ulster Unionists and no Liberal Democrat. I do not regard the composition of this Committee as impartial. On Second Reading, in column 733 of Hansard, I referred to the fact that the Deputy Speaker had called nine people to speak in favour of the Bill and only two to speak against it. At the time, several hon. Members were waiting to speak against the Bill, including my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon--Mrs. Drown--and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon--Dr. Harris--a doctor and member of the British Medical Association ethics committee, who subsequently spoke. I hope that the Committee will forgive me for referring to hon. Members by name, but that will remind the Committee better than if I do so by their constituency, although it may be out of order.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am afraid that it is out of order. Hon. Members may refer to hon. Members only by constituency. It is the privilege of the Chair to refer to them by name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) is a doctor with extensive medical knowledge of the subject. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) was called to speak against the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick) and the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) wanted to speak against the Bill, but they were not called. I wanted to speak and sat through the entire debate, but I was not called. A closure was moved, against which we put up a token opposition, because we were annoyed that so many hon. Members who would have made important contributions--I promoted the Doctor Assisted Dying Bill as a ten-minute Bill two years ago--were not called. We were not especially swamped in the Chamber. Hon. Members who supported the Bill certainly outnumbered those who opposed it, but not by nine to two. The way in which hon. Members were chosen to speak was most unparliamentary.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not wish to interrupt the hon. Gentleman too frequently, but I am sure that he is not challenging the manner in the way in which the Chair selected hon. Members to speak on the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I am not challenging anyone. The House prides itself on allowing the expression of the opposition view, even when it is the minority view. We regularly witness Divisions in the Chamber such as the one last night, the result of which was 326 to 11, but people such as those 11 Members are allowed to speak.
<P>
The Committee contains no doctors who specialise in the field, so they cannot table amendments, and we shall not have the benefit of their expertise. Of 16 members, with the exception of the Minister and the Parliamentary Private Secretary, only two--the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand), who spoke on Second Reading, and myself--oppose the Bill. We are expected to put up a probing opposition in analysing and investigating the Bill, but we are hopelessly outnumbered and that will continue for several sittings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): If it is a question merely of arithmetic, will the hon. Gentleman undertake to give the Bill a fair wind through to Report? The House can determine what it truly thinks when it votes on Third Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> We will give the Bill a fair wind everywhere, provided that it is properly analysed and investigated--by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. It is pointless our opposing the Bill and, with only two members against it, we cannot talk it out. That is nonsense. I want it reported in Hansard that the analysis and discussion that were spoken of on Second Reading will be severely hampered. This is a partisan Committee, heavily weighted in favour of various religions and faiths. It does the Bill's cause no good to insist on swamping the Committee.
<P>
I understand that the membership of this Committee was sent back to the Committee of Selection on Monday, yet on Tuesday we received notification that the Committee would meet today. I have served on hundreds of Committees, but I have never been given such short notice. Hon. Members opposed to the Bill could do nothing; the card said that we were meeting tomorrow afternoon and that we would be outnumbered--take it or leave it. That is all we can do.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): I am pleased to support the sittings motion. I remind the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) of what often happens in the House. Not long ago, the Committee of Selection was asked to organise the membership of a Committee to consider the Terrorism Bill. I happen to represent a part of the United Kingdom where terrorism is rampant. The names submitted to the Committee of Selection did not include a member of the Ulster Unionist party or of any other Northern Ireland party, although I had submitted one name. In its wisdom, the Committee of Selection decided that it could not accept that name--which is what seems to have happened on this occasion. However, the Committee of Selection finally altered the membership of that Committee so that an Ulster Unionist party member could serve on that Committee. Such things happen regularly in the House; one should not run away with the idea that they do not.
<P>
All hon. Members come to Committees with their own baggage; but as parliamentarians, we listen to the arguments, even though we do not always win. As a member of a minority party, I was disappointed that yesterday's business in the House was guillotined, which meant that we did not have the opportunity to explore the Northern Ireland legislation. This Bill was not guillotined on Second Reading and it is not guillotined in Committee, and I like to think that there will be no playing with language on Report. The Bill may yet have a fair wind.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I was minded to oppose the Bill on Second Reading because I thought that it would be difficult to amend, especially as the explanatory memorandum does not match the Bill's provisions. However, in a spirit of co-operation and reasonableness, we decided not to divide the House on Second Reading, because we would then have the chance to discuss matters in Committee.
<P>
I share some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw. One would have hoped for a slightly more balanced Committee, so that various aspects of the Bill could be explored more fully. I have no doubt that we need to explore the issues raised by the Bill, but I am not sure whether the Committee is the right vehicle; it may be better done on Report on the Floor of the House. It saddens me, because a spirit of openness would have enabled the Committee to do some excellent work.
<P>
The hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton) will have listened to the debate, especially the advice given by the Minister, and I wonder whether she intends to move any amendments to make the Bill match the explanatory memorandum. If the hon. Lady undertook to do that, we could have a meaningful discussion. However, I share the anxiety of the hon. Member for Bassetlaw that the Committee may not be the most fruitful place in which to have an informed debate.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> I shall respond briefly to the hon. Members for Bassetlaw and for Isle of Wight. The choice of speakers in the Second Reading debate was made by the Deputy Speaker; it was not my responsibility nor that of any other member of the Committee. As an hon. Member of long standing, the hon. Member for Bassetlaw knows that. The Deputy Speaker confirmed, however, that the membership of the Committee was entirely a matter for the Committee of Selection. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the list that I first submitted to the Committee of Selection was wrong. When it was pointed out to me that I misunderstood the advice of the Clerk to that Committee, I immediately changed it to conform exactly to the way in which the Committee should be drawn up. Not only did I do that, but I asked the hon. Member for Isle of Wight whether he would be interested in serving on the Committee. He said that he would. I also took the precaution of checking my second list with the Government Whips Office and the Liberal Democrats Whips Office. I was as open as I possibly could have been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Will the hon. Lady confirm whether she refused to accept the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon as a member of the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> No, I cannot do that, because no one requested that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon be a member of the Committee. What I said a few moments ago is true. It is a fair record of what happened.
<P>
For the hon. Member for Isle of Wight to say that the explanatory memorandum does not marry up with the Bill was extraordinary. It was drafted by Professor Finnis who, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is a distinguished man and it reflects precisely the contents of the Bill. The matter can be debated if the hon. Gentleman wishes to table an appropriate amendment. Mr. Gale, I understand that hon. Members who are not members of the Committee can also table amendments during our proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> indicated assent.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> Thank you. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw is not alone. Many organisations support his case and other hon. Members will assist him in tabling amendments. Indeed, I am sure that amendments will be tabled.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Medical Treatment (Prevention of Euthanasia) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.
<P>
