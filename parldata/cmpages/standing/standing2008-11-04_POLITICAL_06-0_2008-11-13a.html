Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): On a point
of order, Mr. Atkinson. During the evidence session on 4
November, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor said
that it would be possible to provide information on companies and
unions having to vote when a donation is received. The Committee has
still not received that information. As it is important to our
deliberations, I ask the Minister to seek clarification of when it will
arrive.</div><a name="08111376000011"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000232"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Welcome to the Committee, Mr.
Atkinson. In an attempt to redress the balance on the retention of
documents, amendment No. 28 would require the commission to furnish
people from whom documents have been seized with copies of the
documents. My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight raised that
issue in earlier deliberations, and I am pleased to be addressing it
formally as he
wished.</div><a name="08111376000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would enable people to minimise any disruption or financial
loss during the period in which their documents were retained.
Furthermore, the possibility of an individual or an organisation
wishing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>to seek legal advice when they find themselves in such a position is
high, so by providing them with copies we would allow them to seek that
advice straight away and ensure that their rights were observed in any
redress processes available to them. In retrospect, I would redraft the
amendment so that a person had to request documents before they needed
to be given, but the principle is the same and, I believe, still
valid.</div><a name="08111376000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 29 would provide for a copy of the warrant authorisation to be left
with the person on whom it was served. It follows a similar vein to the
amendment that I proposed to paragraph 4 of schedule 1, but it deals
instead with paragraph 5. It is important that individuals or groups
subject to the power of the commission have the ability to access
avenues of appeal and redress, which provide vital safeguards to
prevent abuse of the powers by the
commission.</div><a name="08111376000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
copies of relevant documentation at an early stage is vital if such
avenues are to be utilised effectively and employed in a manner that
protects the individual or group, as well as calls the commission to
account for its actions. Furthermore, leaving a copy would allow for a
cool and considered review of the warrant away from the heat of the
moment, and would prevent a simple flash of paper with the recipient
possibly in shock from the entry process. Perhaps another measure
covers that point, but I would be grateful if the Minister explained
the
position.</div><a name="08111376000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 30 concerns the word &#147;any&#148;. It is far too broad a
word when describing what a person must do in the context of an entry
situation. Do we expect a wheelchair-bound donor to climb a flight of
stairs or an arthritic party officer to press keys on a computer
keyboard? It is easy to assume that those caught by the provision will
be able-bodied or computer literate, or have any other skill set that
we consider commonplace. Hon. Members will know from experience,
however, that that is not the case in many local party offices or
organisations, let alone in respect of individual donors. The
amendment, therefore, by inserting the word &#147;reasonable&#148;,
would force the commission to take account of the circumstances of each
case and act accordingly. Again, we feel that this is a question of
balance and proportionality.</div>
<a name="08111376000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000233"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I start by apologising to the Committee and to you,
Mr. Atkinson, for my slightly late arrival. I am
afraid that the Mayor of London has not yet succeeded in getting a grip
on London&#146;s transport. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
Well, in this case, the blame lies where it lies. My apologies to the
Committee.</div><a name="08111376000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand entirely why the hon. Member for Huntingdon has tabled these
amendments. We are sympathetic to the concerns that lie behind them,
but I hope that when he hears what I have to say, he will feel that he
need not press them. He has set out clearly the reasons behind the
amendments. In relation to amendment No. 28, I can see exactly why he
has proposed it, but a blanket 24-hour requirement would be too
inflexible.</div><a name="08111376000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am willing to consider whether we might insert in the Bill a
requirement that, if requested by those whom the documents were taken
from, the commission would have to copy and return the documents within
a reasonable time frame. That would ensure that only where the
individual needed the copies to be returned to them the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>commission would be required to do so. Otherwise, it would be an onerous
burden on the commission to do that in all circumstances.</div>
<a name="08111376000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
expect the commission&#146;s guidance on the use of its powers to
include a policy in relation to seized documents, not least because of
the concerns raised in the Committee. I am sure that hon.
Members&#146; concerns will have been noted by the commission. I hope
that, on that basis, hon. Members feel satisfied and will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="08111376000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 29 would oblige the commission to leave with the person to whom it
applied a copy of any warrant obtained to enter and search premises,
but paragraph 7 of proposed new schedule 19A to the 2000 Act, as set
out in schedule 1 of the Bill, requires a person to produce a warrant
when searching premises. I believe that that is adequate protection to
ensure that the person understands the grounds on which a search is
taking place. I cannot understand why someone would need to retain a
copy after the search has ended and I am not aware of any precedent for
that.</div>
<a name="08111376000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000234"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Why would not someone whose house has been
entered want to receive a piece of paper showing the warrant? When
entry is made, they may be in a state of shock and things may be
flashed in front of them. Is it not the correct procedure to leave them
with a copy of the warrant that can be reviewed at a later
stage?</div><a name="08111376000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000235"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As I said in relation to the previous amendment, I
am perfectly happy to look at the issue and talk to the commission
about whether the guidance could include such a provision, but I am
reluctant to load the commission down with the onerous burden of doing
that in all circumstances. I understand what the hon. Gentleman is
saying in relation to those particular circumstances, and if necessary
we will return to it on Report, but I hope that he is satisfied that
the commission will produce guidance on that particular issue. There is
no cause for the commission to be unreasonable on that
point.</div><a name="08111376000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111376000236"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): I am interested in
how the Minister is following matters. He seems to be saying that the
measure would burden the commission. In fact, the trial lies with
members of the public, who take higher priority than the members of the
commission. He has it rather
topsy-turvy.</div><a name="08111376000200"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08111376000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000237"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but
the point I am making is that we should not unduly burden the
commission. In the end, the commission is funded by the taxpayer and if
we put undue burden on it the taxpayer will bear the cost, which we all
agree should be avoided as far as possible. Of course, if it is
reasonable for the commission to protect the interests of those subject
to the search, it should do so. This is not about not putting any
burden on the commission&#151;we are not reluctant to do that. It is
a question of placing an undue burden and precisely where the balance
is struck. However, we shall look at the issue&#151;I am perfectly
happy to do so. We shall talk to the commission 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>and see how it would regard such a thing, or possibly get some assurance
that it will provide for that in
guidance.</div><a name="08111376000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intervention of the hon. Member for Huntingdon was perfectly reasonable
and we should see how we can take account of it in the best possible
way&#151;without putting undue burden on the
commission.</div><a name="08111376000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
completely understand the aim behind amendment No. 30. We do not want
the schedule to be overly onerous, and we want the powers to be used
reasonably and sensibly. There is consensus in the Committee on that.
However, amendment No. 30 is not necessary, because it would duplicate
what is already in the
schedule.</div><a name="08111376000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule stipulates that, where an inspector is inspecting documents in
electronic form, the person on the premises in question will be
required to give any assistance that the inspector reasonably requires
to inspect documents or to check the operation of any computer or
associated apparatus. Therefore, the Bill already provides that, before
it can be requested, what may be required must be reasonable. That test
already includes an assessment of whether the substance of the
requirement is reasonable, and also whether it is reasonable to require
it to be
done.</div><a name="08111376000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must not forget that the powers must be exercised in a way that is
consistent with public law principles of reasonableness. We are
fortunate in having the protections of the European convention on human
rights in this matter, including the right of respect for private life
under article 8 and the right of enjoyment of property under article 1
of protocol 1. I am sure that the whole Committee is glad that we enjoy
the protections of the European convention on human rights, embodied in
UK domestic law under the Human Rights Act 1998. Therefore, I hope the
Committee agrees that we have already provided that an inspector will
not be allowed to make unreasonable demands. With those undertakings, I
hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="08111376000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000238"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are certainly pleased that the Minister has
seen the sense of our amendment No. 28. We agree that things should be
done by way of request, rather than the other way
around&#151;conceptually, we are in agreement on that and I look
forward to seeing the ensuing Government
amendment.</div><a name="08111376000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 29, again, I am pleased that the Minister has said that
he will review the issue of leaving a copy of the warrant. We shall see
how that progresses. On amendment No. 30, I thank him for his
clarification, which seems to be in order. On that basis, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08111376000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000241"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under the
chairmanship of a former fellow councillor, Mr.
Atkinson&#151;I hasten to add, before anyone worries, that it was in
a split
ward.</div><a name="08111376000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
amendments concern the issue of unintended errors and honest mistakes.
The current law states that
a</div><a name="08111376000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;person
who fails, without reasonable excuse, to
comply&#148;</div><a name="08111376000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">commits
an offence. One could argue that any unintended error is,
automatically, a reasonable excuse, but this has led to a lot of
problems with the
legislation.</div><a name="08111376000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
evidence, we heard descriptions of unintended errors. The treasurer of
the Conservative party, Ian McIsaac, was asked what happens if the
party worker whose job it is to list the donations accidentally drops a
page behind the cabinet and discovers it six months later&#151;that
is a late declaration. It seems ridiculous that the Electoral
Commission could regard that as an offence, whether there was intent or
not.</div><a name="08111376000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
Members have probably had similar experiences, and I had a late
declaration myself&#151;of a trivial nature, I thought. The reason
for the lateness was to do with whether a hotel bill would be more than
&#163;1,000. At first, it seemed that it would not, but in the end it
was, so the declaration was late. I apologised to the Electoral
Commission and received a stiff letter in reply. According to the
letter of the law, I did not have a reasonable excuse and it could have
been regarded as an
offence.</div><a name="08111376000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all know of other more serious cases where declarations of donations
have been made many months too late and the Electoral Commission,
rather than disregarding the incident, has referred it to the Crown
Prosecution Service. The whole machinery of the law can be set in
motion over an error that was not only unintended, but which nobody
believes was intended or deceitful, or born of any lack of good
faith.</div><a name="08111376000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support action against failure to declare where it involves deceit or
intention. I can point to my record on this matter, having been on the
sleaze-busting team at <i class="I">The Guardian</i>, and having written a
pamphlet about money and votes in the 1990s. I fully
support&#151;indeed, I played a part in&#151;bringing about this
legislation on disclosure. I would be the first to say that people who
try to conceal donations should be prosecuted, but, equally, I do not
want the police, the CPS or the courts to be clogged up with unintended
errors and honest
mistakes.</div><a name="08111376000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is some evidence that the Electoral Commission has prosecuted, even
when it believes that there is no deceit or lack of good faith. That is
not my target. I was trying to introduce into the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000 a measure like the one that is
already in the Representation of the People Act 1983. I shall briefly
quote from section 167 of the 1983 Act, if I may. One may, in respect
of any electoral offence that one commits, which is an offence under
the Act, go to a court&#151;a High Court or an election court,
sometimes even a county court&#151;and
argue</div><a name="08111376000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the act or omission arose from inadvertence or from accidental
miscalculation or from some other reasonable cause of a like nature,
and in any case did not arise from any want of good
faith&#148;.</div><a name="08111376000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
one persuades the court that that is
true,</div><a name="08111376000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
court may make an order allowing the act or omission to be an exception
from the provisions of this Act&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div><a name="08111376000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, the
court can wish the Act into nothingness&#151;it disappears
completely&#151;under a process known as seeking relief. That
provision was not imported into the 2000 Act. So if one commits an
offence under that Act, in respect of the late declaration of
donations, one cannot go to the court and seek
relief.</div><a name="08111376000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
1983 Act also has lots of provisions allowing candidates to be relieved
of the consequences of the Act where an agent or a sub-agent is unable
to do something because of death, illness, misconduct, or whatever
reason. That is what the law should do; it should prosecute the guilty,
not those who have no intention to break the law. I confess to the
Minister that I really intended this amendment to apply not where the
commission believes there was no intention, but where the court
believes that. There should be a provision allowing someone, as soon as
they discover that they have made a late declaration, to go to a court,
seek relief and have the offence disregarded by the court before the
Electoral Commission is in a position where it has to consider whether
to
prosecute.</div><a name="08111376000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a problem that most people acknowledge and there is more than one
way of resolving it. I should like some assurance from the Minister
that he is aware of the problem and that he will seek some way of
getting round it. I should not agree with him if he were to say that
there is no problem at all, because the record so far shows very
clearly that the Electoral Commission sometimes proceeds on unintended
errors. A lot of police, CPS and even court time is wasted on offences
that would have been serious if there were intention to deceive, but
are not really serious in the absence of that intention. We need a
system in which the court can intervene at an early stage to avoid
that.</div><a name="08111376000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111376000242"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I have great
sympathy with what my hon. Friend has said about his amendments,
particularly the idea that the Bill must be consistent with the
Representation of the People Act. In his opinion, was the 2000 Act
unintentionally or intentionally lax in that matter? A clause ensuring
consistency between the Representation of the People Act and future
legislation was omitted from the Act, so including it in the Bill would
simply put matters right rather than create new
precedent.</div><a name="08111376000051"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000243"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I was a member of the Committee that considered
the 2000 Act, and I do not recall any Minister or member of the
Committee suggesting that there should be a prosecution in a case in
which there was no intention to deceive. I certainly do not think that
that was the intention. Page 18 of the Bill
states:</div><a name="08111376000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person who fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply...commits
an
offence.&#148;</div><a name="08111376000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister might argue that that gives the Electoral Commission
sufficient leeway to decide whether to prosecute, but there are two
problems with it. First, &#147;reasonable excuse&#148; does not
cover the same ground as an unintended error. If somebody were late for
the Committee, even if they did not intend to be, one could argue about
whether their reason for being late was a reasonable excuse. That is
not the same thing as an unintended
error.</div><a name="08111376000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
could easily get into a situation where somebody makes a very late
declaration of a donation, and their only excuse is that they forgot.
One might well say that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>that was not a reasonable excuse, but that given that it was an
unintended error, an honest mistake not motivated by any desire to
withhold information or to deceive, it would be a waste of time to
prosecute. I do not think that the intention behind the 2000 Act was to
catch honest mistakes, but that may be the outcome. The 1983 Act
creates a far better of range of cases in which it can reasonably be
argued that a mistake was unintended and should not be subject to
prosecution. I hope that we can put that
right.</div><a name="08111376000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much
as we need tough legislation, it should not be so tough that it tangles
itself up in unnecessary prosecutions. Many people have said that we
must have laws that apply to politicians in exactly the same way as to
any other section of the population, and that the regulator must have
the same powers over politicians as over anybody else. I fully
subscribe to that, but we must surely bear in mind the fact that the
consequences of prosecution for an unintended error are great for
politicians. In fact, the further up the political tree, the greater
the consequences. Many of us would admit that we have seen
politicians&#146; ministerial careers ended prematurely not because
of any intended error but because of an unintended failure. We lose
enough people from politics who are prosecuted for good
reasons&#151;that is how it should be&#151;but to lose people who
have not acted in bad faith is a great waste. Without asking for any
special treatment, I simply suggest that the provision in the 1983 Act
that relates to avoiding errors over unintended prosecutions should
effectively be imported into the 2000 Act so that we have the same
regime for both
Acts.</div><a name="08111376000201"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="08111376000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111376000244"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): It is a great pleasure,
Mr. Atkinson, to serve under your chairmanship; I think it
is the first time that I have done so. I fully support the intention
behind the amendments. However, there is a technical problem with them,
as the hon. Member for Battersea mentioned; namely, that it is a bit
odd to make the legality of a prosecution subject to the opinion of the
commission itself. I presume the Government will point that out.
However, that technical defect does not take away from the important
principle that crimes of negligence are difficult to justify. The
question is under what circumstances should a negligent act&#151;an
unreasonable failure that was not intentional&#151;be criminal? That
should be the case only in exceptional circumstances. I have spent much
time in other circumstances trying to argue against the imposition of
the criminal law for negligence.</div>
<a name="08111376000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
us back to the question of what is the intention behind schedule 1? It
should be made clear that the amendment applies only to the schedule 1
requirements; it is not meant to cover the whole of PPERA. In other
parts of PPERA, there are serious offences&#151;for example, section
61 relates to the evasion of restrictions on donations. Those offences
are made explicitly dependent on someone knowingly, or intentionally,
doing something. The amendment applies only to failing to comply with
requirements under schedule 1, which, apart from the aspects of
investigating criminal offences, is about inspection and audit. That
was the point of our debate last week. Schedule 1 is not really about
the heavy criminalisation of political parties or those involved with
them; it is about regulation, inspection, audit and getting
compliance. Ultimately, at some point we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>need&#151;I think I said this last week&#151;to have some sort of
criminal back-up for those kind of powers. However, that should not be
heavy-handed. How the amendment has been drafted might not be quite
correct, but I am confident that if the intention of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment were to be inserted into the Bill, it
would improve it and make it clear that schedule 1 is more about
regulation and audit than
criminalisation.</div><a name="08111376000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000245"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> In principle, we support amendments Nos. 118 and
119 tabled by the hon. Member for Battersea. He talked about them fully
and eloquently. The hon. Member for Cambridge considered the clause
from the point of view of putting negligence into a criminal context
and whether that is right in the context of the Bill. That is an
important argument to have had; he made a good point. However, I shall
consider the measure in its criminal context.</div>
<a name="08111376000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">A basic tenet of UK criminal
law is that to be guilty of an offence, the person must have both the
mens rea and the actus reus, as prescribed in law. In short, that
relates to the mental decision to commit the crime and the physical act
of committing the crime. If we consider the offence that the amendment
would deal with, we can break it down into the mens rea and the actus
reus. The offence is the failure to comply with investigation
requirements. The mens rea is the decision not to comply and the actual
non-compliance is the actus reus. The amendment would carve out a
defence that acts on the mens rea element of the crime. It seeks to
clarify that a positive decision not to comply is necessary for the
individual or group to be found guilty of the offence. It is not
sufficient for the document to have slipped down a crack in the desk;
rather, it must have been placed there with the intention of
concealing it.</div>
<a name="08111376000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It must be
said that the Electoral Commission does not support these amendments,
as it believes that the provision in paragraph 12(1) is relevant. That
provision is that there is an offence only if it is done
&#147;without reasonable excuse&#148;. That point has been debated,
not least by the hon. Member for Battersea. The other difference is
that his amendment applies to the Act whereas paragraph 12(1) applies
only to schedule 1 of the Act, so his principle is much wider, but just
as important for that.</div>
<a name="08111376000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if the Minister could explain what might constitute a
reasonable excuse in the context of these amendments and the difference
between them. However, the Government need to take heed of these
amendments. Not only are they sensible but they show the breadth of
concern that exists about the Bill and many of its new powers, and also
the ease with which volunteers and junior party officials could fall
foul of its provisions in what would be a very costly way. To that
extent, we would be minded to support amendment No. 118 in a
Division.</div>
<a name="08111376000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000246"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course I understand all the concerns that have
been raised here. I hope to reassure the Committee that it will not be
necessary to press amendment No. 118 to a Division, but if my remarks
do not reassure the Committee I am perfectly happy to look at this
issue again. However, we have already looked at it quite
carefully.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div><a name="08111376000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody wants
to pass into law something that would make politicians liable to be
needlessly subjected to sanctions for what are genuine oversights. My
hon. Friend the Member for Battersea gave some good examples of how
such oversights might happen and to make politicians liable for them is
certainly not the intention of this
measure.</div>
<a name="08111376000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000247"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister will appreciate that this measure
goes much further than
politicians.</div><a name="08111376000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000248"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course I do. No one should be needlessly
subjected to sanctions for what are genuine oversights; that would go
against the spirit of the Bill. We have made it clear all along that we
do not want to put onerous burdens on volunteers who are performing a
public service in the spirit of public duty.</div>
<a name="08111376000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, we have
to be careful about this measure and we have looked at it carefully. I
start by reminding my hon. Friend that it derives from the 2000 Act and
not from the 1983 Act, which is based on a different model. With all
respect, we should not go back to the 1983 Act. We moved on with the
2000 Act, so we must look at starting from 2000 rather than
1983.</div>
<a name="08111376000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the
offences in the 2000 Act are worded to provide that a person commits an
offence if he or she does something, or fails to do something,
&#147;intentionally or recklessly&#148; or &#147;without
reasonable excuse&#148;. In cases where a person inadvertently
breaches the law, in the way that my hon. Friend has mentioned, it will
rarely be the case that an offence of the type outlined in the 2000 Act
will have been committed. Accordingly, whether this amendment is
necessary hinges to a large extent on the extent to which the
&#147;reasonable excuse&#148; defence allows for honest mistakes to
be judged a &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;.</div>
<a name="08111376000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
can reassure my hon. Friend that this amendment is not necessary. There
are two principal types of offence in the 2000 Act. One is where
someone does something &#147;recklessly or intentionally&#148; and
the other is where an offence is committed if something is done
&#147;without reasonable excuse&#148;. The former case is where
someone intentionally does something wrong or should have known that
what they were doing was wrong but went ahead and did it anyway. That
sort of behaviour is not what this amendment would appear to be
concerned
with.</div><a name="08111376000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second category offence is where a person commits an offence if he or
she did something &#147;without reasonable excuse.&#148; That is
what the amendment is concerned with. There is nothing in the 2000 Act,
or in the Bill to require law enforcement agencies or the commission to
investigate or sanction apparent breaches of the rules. In all cases,
the provisions are permissive. Where the commission is satisfied that a
breach was genuinely inadvertent, it may not always be in its interests
to use its powers and resources to conduct a full investigation or to
sanction that person. That will be a matter of discretion. That is
why&#151;if the hon. Member for Huntingdon will forgive me&#151;I
will not take up his offer to specify the circumstances in which action
will be taken. That is a matter for the commission, and we must trust
it to use its judgment appropriately. To some extent, it would still
have to do that under the amendments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div><a name="08111376000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a person
has claimed on several occasions to have forgotten to comply with a
significant request from the commission, we might expect it to be more
sceptical about the claim of an &#147;honest mistake&#148;, than it
would be in the case of someone who had failed to comply for the first
time about a less significant request that was easier to forget
about.</div><a name="08111376000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000249"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> My right hon. Friend says that the commission is
under no obligation to proceed against somebody in cases of an
unintended error or an honest mistake. However, under the current law,
there is nothing to stop it from doing so. As he says, it is a matter
of discretion. I have heard of cases where the commission has proceeded
against somebody, even though there has been no suggestion of an
intention to deceive or an act of bad faith. I am concerned about
that.</div><a name="08111376000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000250"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point. The
commission has said that it will write to the Committee, setting out
its intention to take a risk-based approach to regulation. That ought
to militate against the kind of risk that he has outlined, where cases
will be pursued that are not in the public interest or, in particular,
that are disproportionate. Following that letter from the commission,
if the Committee and my hon. Friend are still concerned, we will be
happy to look at the matter again. I hope that that will reassure him.
We want to reassure everybody involved in politics that the kind of
disproportionate action that he is concerned about, does not take
place.</div>
<a name="08111376000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000251"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> My right hon. Friend has made a kind offer for
the Committee to receive communication from the Electoral Commission
about its intentions in this matter. Has he considered that redress for
an act by the commission in respect of a fine imposed under the
schedule, appears to be an appeal to a county court subsequent to
action taken by the Electoral Commission, if that act is felt to be
unreasonable? The amendment suggests that relief may be obtained before
the Electoral Commission&#146;s action. Therefore, the long process
that might be started even if the eventual outcome is clear, could be
averted. Would a communication from the Electoral Commission reflect on
that, or would it reflect only on the extent to which its actions are
reasonable or otherwise, even if they could still subsequently be
tested in the courts?</div>
<a name="08111376000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000252"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns, but
there is another side to that matter, to which I will return. In the
opening sitting, the hon. Member for Cambridge said that we should
steer between two poles. I agree with that and I will address that
particular point.</div>
<a name="08111376000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
way that we can avoid having the Electoral Commission make those
judgments. Sometimes people who engage in political activity will have
to go through that process, and we cannot avoid it. I understand my
hon. Friend&#146;s concern and the concerns of other hon. Members
about trying to strike a slightly different balance, and that is what
we seek to do.</div>
<a name="08111376000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, following
the Electoral Commission&#146;s communication to the Committee about
its planned risk-based approach, the Committee still has deep concerns,
I will return to the matter, but I want to explain the other side,
because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>it is important to remember that as we deliberate we have a duty to look
to the public and their confidence in the way in which we do our
business.</div>
<a name="08111376000202"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="08111376000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must strike a balance between the two. Of course, we do not want to run
the risk that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea so graphically
outlined. That would be in no one&#146;s interest, it would not
generate public confidence, and it would discourage people from taking
part. However, we must remember that if we allow someone to escape
liability on the basis of an honest mistake, that could&#151;not
would, but could&#151;give carte blanche, and encourage people to be
ignorant of the law and to feel that they can take risks with their
observance of the duties to which they should be properly subject. That
would not help to inspire public confidence in our political system,
and is not that sort of defence.</div>
<a name="08111376000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">In contrast,
the defence of reasonable excuse that we have put in allows someone to
say that they forgot to comply, and why. There is a defence for the
sort of behaviour that my hon. Friend described. If they have a good
reason, they will not be liable, and the sort of cases suggested by my
hon. Friend would fall into that category.</div>
<a name="08111376000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000253"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08111376000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000254"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Let me finish my point, and then I will give way
because I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea also wants
to intervene. I shall give way to him first, and then to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08111376000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
mere forgetfulness is allowed to pass every time with no sanction, of
course the controls will fall into disrepair over time, and that is in
no one&#146;s interest, not least because it is difficult to prove
whether someone who says that they genuinely made a mistake and forgot
actually did
so.</div><a name="08111376000081"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000255"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I thank my right hon. Friend for the full
consideration that he is giving the matter. My hon. Friend the Member
for Southampton, Test makes an important point about timing. If there
is an allegation of impropriety against an elected representative, the
Electoral Commission will consider it, perhaps for months. During that
period, they may have the press camped on their doorstep, the local and
national papers may be full of speculation about the outcome of the
investigation, and their surgery may be picketed by the press or the
public just because there is a suspicion. None of us is arguing against
due process. We all want the guilty to be punished and the innocent not
to be prosecuted, but because of the nature of the offences a process
that gets to the truth quicker might be better for all
concerned.</div><a name="08111376000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
elected representative, treasurer or whatever who finds that they have
omitted to declare something that should have been declared six months
previously may think, &#147;Oh my God, I shall have to take this to
the Electoral Commission.&#148; Their life will be on the line while
the commission considers the matter, and if it decides, even without
evidence of ill faith, to refer it to the Crown Prosecution Service,
speculation will build up over many months. Surely, it is better for
that person to be able to go to the court and seek relief before the
process gets under way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div><a name="08111376000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000256"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I will happily address that point, but before that
I give way to the hon. Member for
Cambridge.</div><a name="08111376000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000257"></a>David
Howarth:</b> My point goes back to what the Minister said
about undermining the process if there were no possibility of
prosecuting other than for intentional offences. The amendment would
simply require an extra step by the commission. Instead of just saying
what the requirement is, and leaving it at that, so that if the person
who is subject to the requirement forgets to comply they will be in
danger of committing an offence, the commission would have to write
again to that person and say, &#147;You must comply now; otherwise,
you will intentionally be disobeying the commission and breaking your
obligations.&#148; All that is required is that extra, more specific
step for the commission. In the interests of fairness, the commission
should be required to do that before someone is prosecuted for a
criminal
offence.</div><a name="08111376000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000258"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> There are two separate points here. First, on
timeliness, I understand the Committee&#146;s scepticism about some
of the delays that might occur, given the Electoral Commission&#146;s
history to date. That is a fair point, and I am happy to ask the
commission to include a comment about timeliness in the letter that it
has said it will write to the Committee. I believe that it is due this
week or possibly at the beginning of next week. I would ask the
Committee to consider that letter and the way in which it addresses the
particular concerns about the risk-taking approach, which ought to be a
mitigation of the kind of risks that have been described, and also
timeliness. All regulatory bodies, including the commission, ought to
act in a timely fashion. If they do not, they have problems of their
own.</div><a name="08111376000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure that I share the interpretation of the amendment given by
the hon. Member for Cambridge. The amendment may introduce an extra
step, but that will not actually deal with the problem. In the end, the
commission will still have to make a decision. A concern that I have
not yet addressed, because I do not want to diminish the real concerns
that the Committee obviously has, is that by accepting the amendment,
we might push the commission to make a judgment on the good faith of a
person who protests that he made an honest
mistake.</div><a name="08111376000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that the commission act proportionately. That is the
essence of a risk-taking approach. The kind of occasion that my hon.
Friend the Member for Battersea described must fall within that
requirement. It cannot be thought proportionate to go through the whole
process for a return that is a few days late. That would not be
proportionate or consistent with a risk-taking approach, in my
judgment. That cannot be the case&#151;it would not fall within the
intent of the Bill. However, it is something that we will have to leave
to the
commission.</div><a name="08111376000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have considered the matter. Given that we believe that the
2000 Act controls allow for an honest mistake to be taken into account,
we must be extremely careful about creating a charter for widespread
avoidance, whereby the controls could be avoided without a person
having to demonstrate that there is a good reason why they were unable
to comply. That might be the case if the amendment were to go through.
We do not allow that in other contexts&#151;for example, in respect
of tax returns&#151;and I am not convinced that we should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>take a different approach in this case. However, as I said, we must
ensure that people are not penalised unnecessarily. That is in no
one&#146;s interest, and it would go against the spirit of the
Bill.</div><a name="08111376000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no compulsion on the commission to sanction breaches. That has been
said many times, and it is well aware of that. The element of a
reasonable excuse definitely allows the commission or the court to be
lenient if they judge that a genuine oversight rather than an
intentional obstruction has taken place, and that applies from the
start of the process. There is no requirement to take someone through a
public process with the kind of deplorable consequences that my hon.
Friend
described.</div><a name="08111376000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must be careful about this. Everything should be proportionate, and
each case must be judged on its merits. It might be proportionate to
take action in respect of late reporting of even a few days if a large
sum of money were involved, but I do not think that it would be
proportionate in the kind of cases to which my hon. Friend referred. It
is a matter for the commission to
decide.</div><a name="08111376000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000259"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The Minister appears to be saying that if the
offence is minor, we will let it through. The issue is whether an
offence was committed, not whether it was big or small. Either a
criminal offence was committed or it was
not.</div><a name="08111376000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000260"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000262"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Let me deal first with the point that the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight made. What he says is right, but the question
is whether the commission should take action against the breach and
apply a sanction, or accept that there was a reasonable excuse for
committing it. That is the point of the measure.</div>
<a name="08111376000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.
Member for Huntingdon&#146;s point, that is precisely what I was
saying. The amendment does not get away from the need for the
commission to make judgments. It would introduce a different test,
which, for the reasons I have given, we think less satisfactory. We
accept that there are concerns about the measure and the commission is
aware of those concerns. It will be even more aware of them after it
reads the <i class="I">Hansard</i> of these proceedings. It has said that it will
write, and we hope that the commission&#146;s letter will reassure
the Committee regarding these points. I therefore hope that the
amendments will not be pressed today, and I will be happy to return to
this issue later if the Committee still has
concerns.</div><a name="08111376000097"></a>

Government amendment No.
126.</div><a name="08111376000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 14, in
schedule 1, page 19, line 6, at

Commission shall lay before Parliament, on a quarterly basis, reports
specifying how it has exercised its powers under this
Schedule.&#146;.</div><a name="08111376000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000284"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I shall deal with the Government amendments first.
Government amendment No. 125 will impose a duty on the Electoral
Commission to publish guidance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>on its use of investigatory powers. It specifies the information that
must be set out in guidance. We will also impose on the commission a
requirement to consult such persons as it considers appropriate before
publishing guidance or revised guidance. Those provisions will help to
ensure that guidance is comprehensive and covers all relevant aspects
of the commission&#146;s investigatory powers.</div>
<a name="08111376000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the guidance will be published and the commission is required to have
regard to it in exercising its functions, the amendment will ensure
that regulated individuals and other persons who may be subject to the
commission&#146;s investigatory powers are aware of the manner in
which those powers will be used. In addition, if the commission departs
from that guidance by using its powers without objectively justifiable
reasons, its actions could be judicially reviewed in the
courts.</div>
<a name="08111376000203"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="08111376000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the amendment is necessary to address the concerns
expressed on Second Reading about the lack of certainty on how the
commission will exercise its new powers. We hope that the Committee is
reassured by the amendment, and we will work with the commission with a
view to ensuring that its guidance is produced before its investigatory
powers are commenced. We understand that the commission is already
starting work on the guidance required by the Bill and will publish it
as soon as
possible.</div><a name="08111376000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 126 will require the Electoral Commission to report, in the annual
report that it lays before Parliament, on its use of the investigatory
powers in proposed new schedule 19A to the 2000 Act, which is in
schedule 1 of the Bill. That will make the commission directly
accountable to Parliament for each case in which it uses its
investigatory powers. However, it will not require the commission to
report any information that, in its opinion, is inappropriate for
inclusion because that would be unlawful or would prejudice a
continuing investigation. That is important, because it would be
undesirable to oblige the commission to reveal details of continuing
investigations. To do so would undermine the prospect of a successful
outcome.</div><a name="08111376000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee will welcome the amendment, because it is
intended to address the understandable concerns that were raised on
Second Reading. I hope that it will also help to allay Members&#146;
concerns about the possible misuse of the powers, some of which have
been expressed today. The Bill already includes a similar provision
requiring the commission to report from time to time on the use of its
sanctions.</div><a name="08111376000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000285"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Government amendment No. 125 will insert a new
sub-paragraph into the schedule, placing a duty on the commission to
publish guidance on its proposed use of the powers in the schedule.
Hon. Members will note the overlap between that and our amendment No.
14, although I hasten to add that the Government amendment is
significantly more comprehensive. I will therefore stick to the
Government amendment for the purposes of the
debate.</div><a name="08111376000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome the amendment, as it will add much-needed clarity and certainty
to the process. The Bill is extremely complicated and places
significant burdens on those in the party structure, who are often
volunteers and would disproportionately bear the penalty for any
breach. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>Guidance is therefore essential to determine where, when and how the
commission will interpret the law and what it expects from individuals
or groups in complying with its
provisions.</div><a name="08111376000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that the Electoral Commission welcomed the amendment in its latest
paper, noting that it parallels the need for guidance on its civil
powers set out in paragraph 25 of schedule 2. In the Committee&#146;s
second evidence session last week, Peter Wardle, the chief executive of
the commission, highlighted its own emphasis on the need for
guidance:</div><a name="08111376000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are lots of questions about the Bill at the moment. We are already
beginning to try to work out what our guidance would look like and we
would hope to have that guidance in the public domain by January. I do
not think that it is possible to get anything useful and in detail in
the public domain before then.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Political Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>6
November 2008; c. 47,
Q113.]</div><a name="08111376000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister agree with the Electoral Commission&#146;s position on
the timing of the guidance? Perhaps he will give us an update on the
timing
issue.</div><a name="08111376000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 126 will place a reporting requirement on the commission
to act as a check and balance on the use of its investigatory
powers&#151;a self-auditing requirement. We certainly support that
principle, and the amendment somewhat copies our own amendments Nos. 61
and 62 on civil sanctions under schedule 2. The requirement to report
in a publicly accessible fashion is an important tool in ensuring the
fair and proportionate application by the commission of its powers. The
opportunity for media and public scrutiny cannot be downplayed and
should act as an impartial way for performance to be monitored and any
possible over-zealous activities of the commission checked
on.</div><a name="08111376000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are concerned about the extent to which the process might be used to
name and shame. It is not that that would necessarily be wrong in all
situations, but it should not be used in respect of minor situations.
Will naming and shaming be for only bad cases or is it the intention to
mention names in respect of every investigation, even perhaps where
investigations do not lead to charges, let alone convictions? It would
be helpful if the Minister elaborated on the proposals in that
regard.</div><a name="08111376000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Electoral Commission, in a note provided yesterday or a couple of days
ago, came at this matter from a slightly different
viewpoint:</div><a name="08111376000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
principle the Commission supports Government amendment 126, requiring
us to publish information on the use of our supervisory and
investigative powers in our annual report. Sub-paragraph 3 of the
amendment enables the Commission to omit from such reports information
that it could be unlawful to include, and information that might
adversely affect any current investigations or proceedings. We believe
it is also important that we should not be required to include
information that would enable the identification of subjects of
specific supervisory or investigation activity, since this may be
prejudicial to individuals and organisations who are asked for
information on a routine basis, or where an allegation is investigated
by the Commission and found to be
groundless.&#148;</div><a name="08111376000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the same point that I have made in relation to whether people should
be named or not, but it is made for a different purpose. It would be
helpful if the Minister addressed that
issue.</div><a name="08111376000136"></a>

the
Bill.</div><a name="08111376000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000289"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I do not intend to speak for long, because we
have had significant debate on the schedule. However, given the number
of issues that have arisen, it is worthwhile summing
up.</div><a name="08111376000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Chichester hit the nail on the head on
Second Reading, saying
that</div><a name="08111376000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
proposals look extremely heavy handed...We cannot possibly
implement the proposals in the Bill as drafted, so we must look at them
again.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 20 October 2008; Vol.
481, c. 105.]</div>
<a name="08111376000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is entirely
understandable that the Electoral Commission&#146;s investigatory
powers should be enhanced, but the way that the Government propose to
implement this idea is flawed. The commission&#146;s powers to demand
the production of relevant information on pain of a fine and its
ability to search premises and seize documents must both be subject to
proper judicial control, as is the case under statutes conferring
similar powers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div><a name="08111376000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also
uncovered, through the debates, various deficiencies in administrative
aspects of the schedule, which will need to be urgently addressed. The
Minister has said that he will discuss these issues with the Electoral
Commission. I hope that will be done urgently. Given the Bill&#146;s
tight timetable, it would be helpful if he set out how he proposes to
do
that.</div><a name="08111376000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission will have the power to order anyone to produce any document
or give any information that it believes is relevant to a suspected
contravention of the legislation. The commission will also have the
power to fine people who fail to do so. These powers can all be
exercised without a judge being involved. The power to make orders for
the production of documents and information could be exercised without
prior notice being given to the person concerned. The only judicial
control proposed is that the person charged, prosecuted, convicted and
fined by the commission under these powers will have a right of appeal
to the court after the
event.</div><a name="08111376000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission will have extensive powers to obtain search warrants to
allow it to enter and search premises to seize documents that are
considered relevant to an investigation. Those intrusive powers, which
can cause immense damage to businesses and reputations, might be
exercised without prior notice being given to the people whose premises
are to be entered and whose documents might be
seized.</div><a name="08111376000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no requirement for the commission first to try to use its powers to
require documents to be produced before seeking a warrant. If no
attempt has been made to use those powers, there is no requirement for
the commission to explain why and satisfy the court that issuing a
search warrant is necessary. The Bill provides for these warrants to be
issued by magistrates and we are relieved that the Government have now
accepted that that aspect of the Bill needs to be reviewed. We look
forward to receiving their proposals on that. We also note the
Minister&#146;s agreement to review aspects of the guidance process
and powers of entry. We look forward to receiving their proposals on
that,
too.</div><a name="08111376000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the last sitting, I have been approached by a Queen&#146;s counsel
who works in the criminal law and who has been following our
proceedings. He asked why the statutory formulation for the
commission&#146;s power of entry was not modelled on the same powers
of entry for the police under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984, which have been tried and tested through the courts. Apparently,
under PACE, the warrant is issued to a constable or individual.
However, under the Bill, the warrant will be issued to the commission.
The QC to whom I spoke thought that might be wrong&#151;in other
words, how can the commission have reasonable belief? Surely, only a
person in the commission could have such
belief.</div><a name="08111376000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
matter brought to our attention during proceedings on the Bill relates
to the media. One feature of the Bill is that it gives the Electoral
Commission a power to demand information and documents from the media
and fine them for not providing it. Worse, the commission will have the
power to obtain a search warrant from a magistrate to allow it to enter
and search a media organisation&#146;s premises and seize documents
found there.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div><a name="08111376000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point was
made that there is a need to respect journalistic confidentiality and
that that is something recognised throughout Europe as a precondition
to a civilised society. Apparently, information of that kind is
expressly protected by detailed safeguards under PACE, but there are no
restrictions at all on that in the
Bill.</div><a name="08111376000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
to return to the schedule, I reiterate our agreement and support for
the improved role of the commission as a regulator. However, the devil
is in the detail in these matters and the number of amendments tabled
to the schedule shows our concern. In the Committee&#146;s first
evidence session, Sir Hayden Phillips
said:</div><a name="08111376000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is very much up to the Committee to try to find the sorts of amendment
that will make everyone feel comfortable that the powers are not
excessive.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Political
Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>4 November 2008; c.
32, Q79.]</div><a name="08111376000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not yet think that that position has been reached in the Bill, and
that has not been helped by the lack of preparation time&#151;I say
that again because is it a
fact.</div><a name="08111376000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
things stand, we consider today and the previous sittings to have been
a good opportunity to get the issues out on the
table&#151;particularly in relation to schedule 1. We have
had some movement from the Government in terms of amendments and what
they intend to do. The Minister&#146;s approach in that regard is
welcome. These issues will almost certainly be returned to in later
stages of consideration and in the other place. We therefore hope to be
told at the earliest opportunity what the Government&#146;s position
is so as to give all hon. Members and Members in the other place time
to think the matter
through.</div><a name="08111376000204"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000290"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> This has been a useful debate. I hope that the
Committee agrees that our proposals in respect of the schedule and the
contributions made by all hon. Members have helped to improve the Bill.
We certainly feel that they
have.</div><a name="08111376000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
area is difficult. There is no question but that, if the Electoral
Commission is to be the effective regulator that we all want it to be,
it must have credible powers of enforcement. We believe that the powers
broadly outlined in the schedule are designed to that effect, and we
fully accept that we have to be extremely sensitive in how we move
forward with
them.</div><a name="08111376000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
originally drafted, the Bill had a significant number of safeguards. In
our view, they were much more balanced and proportionate than the
powers available to the commission under the 2000 Act, but we have made
further progress. For example, we have signalled our willingness to
have a higher degree of judicial oversight, as we have that the chief
executive should approve the application of some of the
powers.</div><a name="08111376000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make it clear that we regard the power to enter premises very much as a
last resort. In most of the cases that we have discussed, we have
talked about extreme circumstances. We see the powers as much as a
deterrent as a backstop enforcement
measure.</div><a name="08111376000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon asked why the powers are not based on PACE.
It is precisely because they are based on the Regulatory Enforcement
and Sanctions Act 2008, which governs similar regulators such as the
Health and Safety Executive and the Financial Services Authority. We
thought that that was an appropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>model. As amended, the powers are not exactly the same as those under
the 2008 Act, but they are based broadly on it. I hope he is reassured
by my
explanation.</div><a name="08111376000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Electoral Commission has to request the documents before it can apply
for a warrant. It cannot use the powers under paragraph 3 without
having taken that first step. I do not want to take up much more of the
Committee&#146;s time. We have a lot to get
through.</div><a name="08111376000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000291"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I would appreciate it if the Minister addressed
my point about the media, which concerned there not being an exclusion
in respect of investigatory powers and the media, as there is under
PACE.</div><a name="08111376000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000292"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As I have said, there is no desire for those
engaged in political activity to go through the public exposure to
which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea referred. It is not
necessary to change the provisions in that
respect.</div><a name="08111376000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111376000293"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Turner:</b> My concern is different. Let us suppose
that there is a knock on the door and someone is standing in the
passage waiting to enter the house, and that the person inside the
house does not know the law. Will the person inside the house know that
they have the right to say no or will they be inclined to let the other
person into the house, so the commission will then have the right to
find things that otherwise it would not have been able to
find?</div><a name="08111376000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the person who wants to enter the premises explain to the person inside
his rights, or will the representative of the commission simply assume
that the other person knows the law and go into the house not needing a
warrant? That is the
difference.</div><a name="08111376000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000294"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I gave way to the hon. Gentleman because I assumed
that he would make a similar point to that made by the hon. Member for
Huntingdon. If I may, I shall finish responding to the previous point
before I come on to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight.</div><a name="08111376000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was hoping to reassure the hon. Member for Huntingdon on the media
question. The circumstances are not analogous, for all the reasons that
I have given. However, as I said, if there are still genuine concerns,
I am happy to consider them. If the hon. Gentleman has a particular
view on how the matter should be handled, I would be happy to talk to
him and, if necessary, table amendments on Report. We do not think that
will be necessary, but I will consider suggestions from him or anyone
else.</div><a name="08111376000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. Of
course the circumstances should be explained to the
person.</div><a name="08111376000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been an important debate. We have had to strike a balance between
giving the commission sufficient powers to act as a credible
investigator&#151;I believe the Committee agrees that that is
important&#151;and putting appropriate safeguards in place. We
believe that the Bill now contains those safeguards, but, as I said
before, I am happy to address any remaining
concerns.</div><a name="08111376000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000295"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in clause 3,

of State, after consulting the Electoral Commission, shall make an

the Electoral Commission under Part 2 of Schedule
19B.&#146;.</div><a name="08111376000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000296"></a>The

as specified by virtue of section
147(1A).&#146;.</div><a name="08111376000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000297"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Clause 3 deals with the new civil sanctions
regime, and so we move to a new aspect of the Bill. Amendment No. 77
and its consequential amendment, amendment No. 85, are probing. They
would delete paragraph 5(5) of schedule 3, which defines what is
considered a discretionary requirement for the
commission.</div><a name="08111376000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim of the amendments is to strike out the definition of what can be
considered a discretionary requirement that may be imposed by the
commission under part 2 of schedule 2 so that a further review can be
undertaken of what discretionary requirements it is appropriate for the
commission to
impose.</div><a name="08111376000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall raise our concerns about the wholesale adoption of the Macrory
review proposals in the Bill during our discussion on clause 3 stand
part, but I have to say at this early stage that we are not convinced
that the Government have got this right, in the same way that we remain
to be convinced in respect of schedule 1. We believe that there is a
need to review what is meant by &#147;discretionary
requirement&#148;.</div><a name="08111376000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition in paragraph 5(5) is very broad. Phrases such as
&#147;such amount&#148;, &#147;such steps&#148;
and</div><a name="08111376000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;within
such period as they may
specify&#148;</div><a name="08111376000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">are
vague and offer no guidance to the commission or safeguards to those
who are subject to such
requirements.</div><a name="08111376000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is inadvisable to have a penalty regime without parameters or guidance:
not only could it be less workable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>in practice, but it offers the potential for abuse of power by the
commission. There would be a real problem if we ended up with a public
perception that the party finance and electoral system regulator was
worse than the system it was there to regulate. We support in principle
the idea of flexible sanctions, but not at the cost of proportionality
or
reason.</div><a name="08111376000180"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111376000298"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Amendment No. 85 would require the Secretary of
State, having consulted with the Electoral Commission, to specify in an
order the type of discretionary requirements that may be imposed by the
commission under part 2 of proposed new schedule 19B. The discretionary
requirements are set out in paragraph 5(5) of the schedule and they
are</div><a name="08111376000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
a requirement to pay a monetary penalty to the Commission of such
amount as the Commission may
determine,</div><a name="08111376000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
a requirement to take such steps as the Commission may specify, within
such period as they may specify, to secure that the offence or
contravention does not continue or recur,
or</div><a name="08111376000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) a
requirement to take such steps as the Commission may specify, within
such period as they may specify, to secure that the position is, so far
as possible, restored to what it would have been if the offence or
contravention had not
happened.&#148;</div><a name="08111376000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
size of a monetary penalty or the type of steps that are needed will,
inevitably, depend on the nature and scale of the offence committed.
The clause necessarily leaves the decision about the precise nature of
a penalty or the steps to be taken in each case to the commission. That
is sensible, as it would be impossible to try to anticipate every step
or penalty that the commission may wish to impose. Trying to draft an
exhaustive list of what the commission may or may not do in different
circumstances risks omitting things that subsequent cases will
demonstrate should have been
available.</div><a name="08111376000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
penalty or steps contained in any notice must be set out precisely when
the requirement is imposed. If not, or if the steps are uncertain, the
requirement will be susceptible to appeal&#151;for example, on the
ground that it is
unreasonable.</div><a name="08111376000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
