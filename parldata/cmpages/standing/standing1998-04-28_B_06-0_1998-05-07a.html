<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 332, in page 5, line 41, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) In making an order under subsection (2)(a) above in the case of a sex offender order the Crown Court may make any order which could have been made by the Magistrates' Court and may vary any order which was made by a Magistrates' Court.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 333, in page 5, line 46, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) Without prejudice to the power of the Crown Court to give leave for an appeal to be abandoned, in the case of an appeal against the making by a Magistrates' Court of an anti-social behaviour order an appellant may abandon an appeal by giving notice in writing at any time before the hearing of the appeal.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 332 concerns what happens when there is an appeal to the Crown court against a sex offender order from the magistrates court. When the Crown court upholds such an order, will it be able to impose any additional terms that it thinks fit after hearing details of the case? Will it be in the same position as the magistrates court in the first hearing, or will it be restricted to confirming the terms of the order that the magistrates court made? We want the Crown court to be able to impose any terms that it thinks fit to protect the public.
<P>
Amendment No. 333 deals with a small point. Will the same rules of court for criminal cases apply to the Crown court against anti-social behaviour orders from the magistrates court? There are different sorts of appeals from magistrates courts to Crown courts; sometimes non-criminal cases are appealed. I shall understand if the Minister is unable to provide a considered reponse today, and wishes to write to me instead.
<P>
We are also worried about liability for costs. In an appeal to the Crown court, an appellant may be made liable for costs unless he abandons the appeal by giving three days' notice in writing. Amendment No. 333 would increase the time during which an appellant could abandon the appeal. There may be many appeals against anti-social behaviour orders, for reasons that we have already outlined and that I do not propose to repeat. In those circumstances, there should be flexibility for appellants who wish to abandon their appeals. Costs should not weigh too heavily on their minds. We wish to avoid appeals that appellants wished they had abandoned but with which they felt obliged to go ahead because they believed that they were already liable for costs.
<P>
We want to promote the most efficient use of court time. If an appellant to the Crown court has second thoughts, as sometimes happens, he should not simply plough ahead with the appeal and thus take up court time becuase he believes that he will be liable for costs. We invite the Government to consider allowing an appellant to abandon an appeal at any time up to the calling on of an appeal in court so that he does not feel constrained by costs. An appellant would be protected against a costs order by abandoning the appeal.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will write to me if he does not wish to reply now. There may be some factors in my explanation that he did not apprehend, and I understand if he prefers to write.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins (Woking):</B> I shall set out briefly points that the Minister may wish to tackle in writing. Is legal aid available for an appeal to the Crown court? Can legal aid be granted by the magistrates court or the Crown court to an appellant? I am sure that that is so, but can the Minister confirm that important point of principle?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): I am grateful to the hon. Gentlemen for the way in which they made their points, which we clearly need to consider.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), who leads for the Opposition, that Crown courts need the powers that amendment No. 332 sets out. However, the amendment is unnecessary, because it is clear from clause 5(3) that the Crown court already has them. Under clause 5(2)(a) the Crown court
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to its determination of the appeal''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would allow either a new set of prohibitions--provided that those fulfilled the criteria in clause 2(6)--or variation of existing ones, by amending an order or making a new one.
<P>
Section 48(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 applies. To enable the Crown court, on hearing any appeal, to confirm, reverse or vary any part of the decision that is being appealed against; to remit the matter, with its opinion, to the authority or court that made that decision; or to make any such other order as it thinks fit, thereby exercising any power that the other authority might have exercised. That provision would apply to both anti-social behaviour and sex offender orders. That is why the amendment is unnecessary. The hon. Member for Hertsmere tabled it quite properly as a probing amendment, and I hope that my response has dealt with his queries.
<P>
Amendment No. 333 is also unnecessary. An appellant would already be able to abandon an appeal by the means set out in the amendment, under rule 11(1) of the Crown court rules 1982, except that that requires notice to be given not later than the third day before the day fixed for the hearing of the appeal. That would apply to both anti-social behaviour and sex offender orders.
<P>
We expect that under the Crown court rules the normal provisions as to costs would apply. I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument that there might be some constraint on someone who wanted to abandon an appeal after the three-day limit. Some constraint is useful. The setting up of an appeal which is then cancelled entails costs, and when I and the hon. Gentleman practised law we no doubt were both aware that all too often appeals were cancelled at the last moment. We need to ensure that the court can decide whether costs should apply after considering all the circumstances. I should not want to prevent the court from imposing any constraint that it might want to impose in the case of anyone who could have written an appeal before the three-day limit but chose not to. Removing the three-day limit would be an encouragement to wait until the last possible opportunity before withdrawing an appeal.
<P>
I am not without sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's argument. The court's discretion as to costs would to some extent deal with the matter.
<P>
I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's points further, and shall write to him about any matters that seem to warrant that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> What about legal aid?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Legal aid will be available as normal for appeals in this context, and we do not propose to place constraints on the normal legal aid that would apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am content with the Minister's response to amendment No. 332. He knows why it was tabled.
<P>
I agree, with respect to amendment No. 333, that the costs thrown away in bringing an appeal at all must be borne in mind. However, they should be weighed against the costs of taking up court time on appeals that might have been abandoned if an appellant had not felt constrained by the possibility of being made liable for costs in any event. The Minister indicates that he is prepared to think again about the matter. That was the purpose of the amendment. I look forward to his further consideration of the matter, and hope that, if necessary, he will write to me.
<P>
On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 5 provides for an appeal against anti-social behaviour orders and sex offender orders. That is an essential part of the fair and proper operation of the orders in clauses 2 and 3.
<P>
The appeal is to the Crown court. When the Crown court makes an order on appeal, it will be treated as if it had been made by the magistrates' court for any subsequent application for variation or discharge.
<P>
The provisions of the clause are necessary to provide proper recourse for the defendant against any civil order made against him.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Authorities responsible for strategies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 6, line 13, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) every police authority and every council any part of whose area adjoins the area'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 45, in page 6, leave out lines 16 and 17.
<P>
No. 47, in page 6, leave out lines 20 to 23.
<P>
No. 49, in clause 7, page 6, line 38, leave out `and' and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ca) consult local Police Consultative Committees and local representatives of neighbourhood watch, crimestoppers and victim support'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 50, in clause 7, page 6, line 41, after `meetings', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in more than one location in the area, or through focus groups'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We come now to the subject of strategies to tackle crime and disorder. The amendments are designed to explore those matters.
<P>
Conservative Members are anxious that the establishment of strategies against crime and disorder should not be seen as an end in itself and as the solution to all the problems. We are concerned about what benefits might result from them. Will there be any benefits, and if so, how are they to be measured? We are concerned about practical achievements, not theory.
<P>
Clause 6 provides that local authorities and the police will be responsible for formulating and implementing strategies, acting in co-operation with other persons and bodies in the local authority area.
<P>
Amendment No. 44 is designed to explore the position of adjoining police and local authorities. We want to find out how they fit into the picture. What co-operation do the Government expect to take place between them?
<P>
Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 deal with the definition of the responsible bodies which will co-operate with the police and the local authority within a local authority area. Clause 6 specifies that such bodies should be police authorities, probation committees, or health authorities. Subsection 2(c) states that the Secretary of State may designate other bodies. Will the Minister of State tell the Committee more about that? He is indicating that he is willing to do so. I look forward to his comments.
<P>
Amendment No. 47 relates to subsection (3), which sets out the Secretary of State's power to require local authorities and the police to invite other organisations to participate in the process. What will be the difference, in practice, between the co-operation required under subsection (2) and the participation required under subsection (3)? What type of bodies will be involved in such participation?
<P>
We welcome the fact that local businesses and the voluntary sector will be involved. Does the Secretary of State also intend to include representatives of victims? The voices of victims should be heard throughout the formulation of the crime and disorder strategies.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We also want consideration to be given to the position of the elderly. Elderly people are more apprehensive about crime than other sections of the population, a matter I shall raise when we debate a later amendment. We want local business people, victims, the voluntary sector, which may have a very important role, and the elderly to have a real say, and we look to the Minister to state what form their participation, as set out in subsection (3), might take.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 relate to the process to be undertaken in the formulation of a strategy on which much activity will be expended. As I said, we hope that it will prove worth it; we shall be looking closely at what benefits accrue in practice.
<P>
We want to know what role the police consultative committees, to which amendment No. 49 relates, will play in the scheme of things. They are an important factor in many constituencies; I am pleased to be part of the Hertsmere police consultative committee and I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are likewise members of such committees in their constituencies.
<P>
Amendment No. 49 would require police consultative committees, crime prevention and victim organisations, to be consulted and we attach great importance to their views. Members of the Committee will wish the neighbourhood watch organisation, one of those mentioned, a fair wind in its endeavours. It works on the ground, involving millions of ordinary citizens and householders in fighting crime.
<P>
Amendment No. 50 relates to the consultation process outlined in clause 7(2)(d). We want to know how the Government intend such consultation to be carried out.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> For the benefit of the Committee, I should point out that in a slip of the tongue, the hon. Gentleman mentioned amendment No. 46, which is not in this group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): We welcome clause 6, which will give local authorities a statutory duty to consider crime and disorder strategies.
<P>
The amendments throw up some interesting questions, especially on the issue of adjoining areas. We encourage local authorities to become involved in crime and disorder strategies even though, at present, they have no statutory responsibilities to do so. A survey of its residents by the London borough of Sutton showed that crime and the fear of crime was the number one issue, which the local authority has done much to tackle.
<P>
In the London boroughs, ordinary citizens often cannot tell when they move from one area to another and crime does not respect borough boundaries. There are serious questions to be answered about how their responsibilities will be exercised. My presumption is that local authorities will act responsibly, mesh their plans and consult each other across the borough boundaries, but it would be useful to know the Minister's view on the matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 47 would delete subsection (3) which covers the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``person or body of each description which is for the time being prescribed by order of the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be useful to know the nature and type of bodies that the Government envisage will take part in drawing up the strategies.
<P>
The general principle is best described in terms of the policing plans, which already exist. They have done a tremendous amount of good, both in the large area and, as these are developed, the smaller area policing plans. I hope that the crime and disorder strategies will complement those policing plans and work strongly with them to give local authorities a significant new role which will bring real benefits to the residents of their areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): My local authority area of Barnet has had a community safety strategy since March 1998 and a few lessons were learnt in preparing it. Partnership is clearly the key to success, but there are a multitude of organisations, groups and individuals dealing with community safety. Barnet feels that it would have been helpful to have had some guidance on best practice and how to achieve that. The information exchange has helped local organisations to understand better how they can work together, and our local victim support group is already involved. One of our problems has been trying to involve other organisations such as housing associations, and we are still having great difficulty persuading the local health authority to participate.
<P>
In the short time since the strategy started it has also become clear that the police and local authority structures are extremely complex. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere will know, we have some cross-border interests on that. There are two police divisions in Barnet, one of which includes Hertsmere. Although there are plans to merge them into one division, the fact that the Metropolitan police spills over outside the Greater London boundaries may perpetuate the problems.
<P>
If the staff in community safety partnerships can work closely together, the sharing of expertise between the police and the local authorities can be very successful. I should like to give a plug here for our collaborative bid by the police and the local authority to the Home Office for a closed circuit television project.
<P>
We should also make sure that the consultation envisaged by the Bill dovetails with that undertaken by the police and local authorities as duplication could cause problems. The hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned police and community consultative groups. We need to have a substantial rethink about them. Barnet has not really achieved its objective of linking into the community which from my experience as a Westminster councillor I know happened there. We need to see how we can make them much more representative of the local community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): Will the hon. Gentleman accept that despite his experience which has clearly jaundiced his view of police and community partnership groups, in many areas of the country they work exceptionally well? I have now had experience of these groups in three different areas of the country, before I became an MP and since. In each of those they worked well and were genuinely representative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Clearly they can work well. Perhaps one way forward is to look at those that are working well and see what lessons can be learnt to assist those which have not been working quite so well.
<P>
It is important to devise methods of measuring the success of the safety strategies. If local people are to have confidence in them, there must be a common method of measuring their approach and of crime recording so that valid cross-boundary comparisons can be made. Perhaps the Audit Commission could play a useful role in providing some good practice guidance on common recording methods.
<P>
The Barnet strategy includes clear targets, such as an action plan, that can be measured over time. It is early days yet, and we may need to adjust it in the light of experience. This is an issue that I have raised before, but until we have common methods of intercommunication between computers and common standards of software, there will be a problem building these links and carrying out statistical analysis.
<P>
Finally, the Barnet experience has shown that the strategy must be designed for the preventative approach envisaged by the Bill. The strategy includes a series of action areas which include anti-social behaviour; the physical environment and the need to combat vandalism and graffiti; the need to make people feel safe in their homes, working perhaps with the local media; and the need in the cities to further multicultural harmony by reducing racial and religious crime and harassment as envisaged in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> In one sense I welcome the policy of a crime and disorder strategy, but part of me asks whether there are not sufficient such groupings in the country already. Are we not dealing with a very bureaucratic and cumbersome animal here, and will the financial resources be available for it?
<P>
The National Association of Probation Officers, which looked carefully at the clauses 6 and 7, strongly supported the key role of local authorities in co-ordinating anti-crime strategies. Local authorities have a role. Does the Minister think that the parish council, which is so close to the ground in many of our villages in the more rural constituencies, has a role to play?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> The answer is a simple yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> They would have much that is useful to say. In welcoming the strategy, NAPO expresses the hope that local authorities will receive the appropriate level of central Government support to enable them to perform those duties effectively. When a strategy like this is set up, one wonders whether there will be huge cost and staffing implications, either for the local authority or the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman, who is asking some reasonable questions. The NAPO representation should be set to one side. The point it makes concerns local authorities. Many local authorities have said they recognise that there are new resources and welcome the opportunity to become involved in this work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> That is a fair answer from the Minister, but he will understand why we have concerns about possible extra expenditure. At the end of the day, the result must be worth the effort put in and the money spent. If it is worth the effort, it is all to the good.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere talked about consulting police consultative committees, neighbourhood watch and victim support groups. That is a sensible thing to do. The Minister will know that there are various groupings in our communities that are extremely concerned about crime and whose views it would be beneficial to hear. Apart from neighbourhood watch and victim support groups, there are magistrates courts committees which see crime first hand and will have something sensible to say.
<P>
In most towns, the magistrates licensing committee is another group of people with first-hand evidence of what goes wrong in the town. They ought to be involved. Chambers of commerce, local businesses and representatives from the teaching profession should also be involved. I will not stray into an amendment which could relate to the clause but which comes up under the next clause, but representatives from the ethnic community are also important. In my constituency, the community relations forum is a powerful influence for good and spends a great deal of time on local crime and unrest problems.
<P>
In one sense I am arguing against myself. I am worried about too much money being spent and too much bureaucracy. The Minister was doubtless going to say that but he will understand that I tend to feel that. However, if we are going to go ahead with these strategies, the result must be worth the effort. There are key groupings in communities, apart from local authorities, that are at street level. Their views and aspirations are worth while and welcome.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest):</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) has already made some of the points about which I am worried. The Minister gave an immediate answer to one question, but I still want to consider the extra burdens that the clause will place on local authorities, and question the wisdom of making something that already happens satisfactorily throughout the country a statutory obligation.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a difference between serving the community voluntarily and being required by law to act in a particular way. There is also a difference in the financial burdens that the different sorts of duty impose on a local authority.
<P>
In my constituency, regular meetings of a liaison committee already take place. The committee works well. I recently discovered that I was a member of it, and I send a representative to meetings to tell me what happens. All the members already work well together. About 20 representatives of different community bodies are members of the committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) highlighted the problem, which does not exist in all parts of the country, of cross-border responsibilities. That problem is exacerbated by another. My constituency is in Essex, but is also on the outskirts of London. The bodies whose involvement the clause would require are: Epping Forest district council, Essex county council, the Essex police force and the Metropolitan police force.
<P>
If, depending on the events of the next 24 hours, a government of London is established, the Metropolitan police force may be brought under the control of the new Greater London Authority. In theory, that is not a bad idea, but in an area such as Epping Forest, which is on the outskirts of London, yet another statutory body will become involved in the activities that we are discussing. It means that not only the bodies that I have already mentioned, but the Greater London Authority, will have to be involved.
<P>
We will build up a massive bureaucratic organisation, which is unnecessary because a voluntary organisation does the job perfectly well. I appreciate the Minister's rapid answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Woking about funding such activities. He said that there would not be extra funding for local authorities. He said that there would not be extra funding for local authorities, but that they had expressed a willingness to take on the duty, even though they would receive no extra funding to do it. That is all very well, but local authorities, no matter how good their intentions, or those of the Government or the Committee, have only a finite amount of money to spend in a financial year. If my local authority has to spend more money because of the statutory obligation that clause 6 imposes on it, it will have to cut some other activity. I see that the Minister disagrees, and that is good; I am glad if there is another answer. I do not want my local authority to have to cut its housing or social services budget to fulfil a statutory obligation to do something that is already being done voluntarily.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): Over the years I have been privileged to serve on several Standing Committees. It has become almost a fashion for a Bill--usually at about the stage that we have reached--to proclaim the need for a co-ordinating strategy and to place a statutory duty on local authorities or public bodies to undertake functions that they had probably already been performing satisfactorily in a voluntary capacity.
<P>
It is difficult to argue against the clause, because it obviously makes sense for local government--[Interruption.] What did the Minister say?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I notice that despite that difficulty, the hon. gentleman is going to argue against it anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister should not anticipate what I intend to say. I was going to say that, at first sight, like many similar provisions over the years, the clause seems reasonable. Why should anyone want to argue against requiring local authorities to adopt a strategy to deal with crime? However, as my hon. Friends the Members for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) and for Woking, among others, have made clear, there are cost implications. Before the clause becomes law, the Minister should explain what consultation he has undertaken.
<P>
It would be interesting to know, for instance, what response has been received from local authorities and their associations, and what shortcomings the Minister has identified. Are some local authorities refusing to take any interest in a crime strategy for their area?
<P>
For the sake of argument we could consider the area in Lincolnshire that I represent. The county council liaises closely with the police authority, which operates a strategy. What would be achieved--and what further burdens would be imposed on the county and district councils--by the clause? Should a district council, whose resources are minimal, have such duties imposed on it by law? Where has the police authority in Lincolnshire been falling down? I do not want to be ruled out of order, but clause 7 will impose very heavy duties on local authorities to formulate strategies, prepare analyses and publish reports; all fine stuff, but where will it lead us?
<P>
There is crime in this country. Sadly, there always has been crime and always will be. Will we stop it by publishing more reports? Do not police authorities already produce reports? If not, which ones are falling down?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): The hon. Gentleman seems to be adopting a rather lackadaisical and loose approach to combating crime and disorder. Some local authorities, such as the new unitary authority in Peterborough, are already succeeding in operating the proposed strategy provisions. In one great trouble spot, the Welland estate, where there was a tragic murder recently, crime has been cut by 27 per cent.
<P>
The reason for the strategy provisions is that it is no good to say, ``My area is doing nicely, so that is all right.'' Another area might not be doing so well. We want co-ordination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is fine. We know that the Peterborough authority is doing frightfully well and that the Lincolnshire police authority is carrying out its function adequately. I shall now give way to any member of the Committee who can provide an example of a local authority or police authority that is not performing its function--or not co-ordinating. Clearly, the Minister has done his homework and great shortcomings have been found.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I rise simply because no one else has risen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No one else dares to rise--
<P>
Mr. Allan
<P>
: In Sheffield, we have a long way to go, as the local authority has recognised. Part of the reason for that is that it had no statutory duty. It has been so focused on its statutory duties that it has had neither the time nor the resources to indulge in non-statutory activities. It will welcome a statutory provision, as long as that is followed by resources.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> They are probably all focused on ``The Full Monty''.
<P>
As usual, the Liberal Democrats come to the Government's rescue. I did not quite understand the intervention made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), but perhaps I am a slow learner. He seemed to be saying that local authorities were so focused on their statutory duties that they were not focused on their non-statutory duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman might focus on the position of the youth service. That has been damaged over the years because it is not a statutory service.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough seems to want members of the Committee to name and shame individual authorities. The Government want to bring all local authority and police responses to this major problem up to the standard of the best.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Good I am glad that we have established that.
<P>
Will the Minister explain exactly what research has been undertaken into this subject by his many officials, and where the shortcomings are? That was the purpose of my intervention. I am not asking him to name and shame particular authorities. Will he tell the Committee why it is necessary to impose yet another statutory obligation on local authorities? As my hon. Friend the member for Epping Forest has said, local authorities already have to carry many burdens.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said that he was unable to understand the provisions under subsection (2)(c). I share that difficulty. The subsection refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``every person or body of a description which is for the time being prescribed by order of the Secretary of State under this subsection.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who are these persons or bodies? Why are they necessary?
<P>
Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The responsible authorities shall also invite the participation in their exercise of those functions of at least one person or body of each description which is for the time being prescribed by order of the Secretary of State under this subsection.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another clear example of precision in parliamentary drafting, the sense of which will be apparent immediately to all those who read it. However, it is not apparent to me. Who are these people? What is the reason for these subsections? We deserve an explanation from the Minister. That is why the amendment is apposite.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not present us with the normal, general run around the course, during which he explains that there is a problem with crime and that something must be done. We want to know why we have to impose additional statutory duties upon authorities and where they are failing in carrying out those duties voluntarily. Most, if not all, local authorities are already fully aware of the problem and are consulting and co-operating very well with the police authorities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister replies, I advise the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) that I have noted that he has made his down payment on the clause stand part debate, which has not yet been moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am glad to respond to a constructive debate. I especially welcome discussion of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere through his amendments. The hon. Member for Hallam put a number of questions, but also made it clear that he supported the general thrust of the Government's policy. It is a flagship policy that offers everyone an opportunity to participate in the serious task of ensuring that we cut crime. It allows communities' experience of crime to be addressed effectively.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon referred to his experience of the partnership strategy that has been developed in Barnet. Recently, I visited a school in that area, where I listened and talked to young people about their experience of crime. That raised a number of issues and demonstrated the practical contribution that so many people have to make. Such contributions will be widely welcomed.
<P>
Several hon. Members spoke about the practicalities of the process. However, no one argued against an inclusive approach to the way in which we tackle this great project. Indeed, Members of Parliament will want to contribute to the process and will have a significant role, using their constituency experience of organisations and individuals.
<P>
Hon. Members asked about the Audit Commission, which will certainly have a role. We want to ensure that the various ways of scrutinising efficiency, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon mentioned, are lined up to reinforce each other so that the inspectorate, in considering how the police work, will examine local government, probation and other organisations. In that way, the Home Secretary's key objectives and the policing plan will work together towards the prime objective of reducing crime. During the past 12 months, with the co-operation of organisations such as the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Local Government Association and others, we have made great strides in developing the practice that will enable the policy to work.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Audit Commission is considering a variety of relevant issues, especially partnership indicators, which show what has been achieved by organisations putting their hands together to pursue joint objectives. That is extremely relevant to the reduction of crime; it is something in which the Local Government Association and the Association of Chief Police Officers have expressed much interest, and it is a very positive development.
<P>
Good work has been done in many areas: Islington is one of the London boroughs in which the police and the local authority together have designed an effective way of tackling crime. Northumbria has shown particular success in recent years in this respect.
<P>
The recent appointment of John Stevens as Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan police is extremely welcome. He was the chief constable of Northumbria when massive strides were made in developing partnerships and reducing crime. He is the author of a thematic report on Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary entitled ``Beating Crime'', on the partnership approach to crime reduction, which I commend to hon. Members. That document is complemented by the document ``Getting the Grease to the Squeak'', produced by the police research group of the Home Office. There is massive detail in those documents, which I ask hon. Members to commend to their local authorities and police commanders as they show how the policy can be made to work.
<P>
The hon. Member for Epping Forest referred to extra burdens, but only those councils that regard crime reduction as nothing to do with them, and hence do nothing about it, would think of the proposals as an extra burden. The majority of local authorities recognise that if their work and that of voluntary organisations and those concerned with probation and the police can complement each other, resources can be used far more effectively, and not wasted as many are at present.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon was right to refer to cross-border arrangements. The Metropolitan police area and the county of Essex are outside the area that will be part of the new London assembly, which I confidently predict will receive a ringing endorsement in the referendum being held today. My hon. Friend raises an important matter; although cross-boundary issues can be addressed and dealt with successfully, as I shall explain in a moment, it is difficult. I give an undertaking that we will consider the issues raised by my hon. Friend in the light of the decision on the assembly and the coterminosity of boundaries necessary in respect of crime reduction partnerships.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough was the out-of-step contributor to the debate. He maintains his characteristically negative attitude to anything that smacks of co-operation and partnership. The test of the partnerships will be whether they succeed in reducing crime, not the amount of time spent on bureaucracy and paperwork or in considering the shape of the partnership. Cutting crime is the objective. The hon. Gentleman asked if I would make our approach clear; obviously he has not been listening for the past seven years because ever since the Criminal Justice Act 1991 we have argued for the approach now proposed, supported by the police and local authorities. It is a matter of regret that the previous Administration did not accept the need for this approach and enshrine it in legislation, as they had the opportunity to do year after year.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> In which parts of the country is partnership not taking place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I said earlier that that is a silly question. Authorities such as Peterborough and Sheffield, for example, which already understand the need for partnership, welcome the Bill because it will give them the authority and the structure to establish effective partnerships to cut crime. They have been crying out for that for years. Has the hon. Gentleman been deaf? It is ridiculous for him to stand in the way of progress in this way.
<P>
In contrast, the hon. Member for Hertsmere asked reasonable questions about the practicalities involved. On the subject of boundaries, we recognise that crime and disorder do not respect agency boundaries and that people in adjoining areas need to talk to one another. That should happen informally, as a matter of good practice. It would be a recipe for meddling to require consultation by police and local authorities across boundaries and involve them in strategies for areas about which they may know little and for which they have no legal or administrative responsibility. I recognise the need for the amendment in the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described and we would encourage it. However, if necessary, clause 6(2)(c) will ensure that essential partners are keyed into this work.
<P>
I am confident that common sense will enable partnership across boundaries, with consultation only where it is needed. I give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking to keep the matter under review; the subsection to which I referred gives us the capacity to move quickly, if necessary, to achieve effective reduction in local crime and disorder. We have consulted interested parties to see whether, and if so how, this provision should be used in the short term, but we have no intention of using the provisions to impose unnecessary boundaries.
<P>
Clause 6(3) simply allows the Home Secretary to specify which people or bodies must be invited on to the board in every area and provides an opportunity to vary those requirements as circumstances dictate. They are likely to be used to ensure that the voluntary and business sectors are involved and those on whom it would not be appropriate to impose legal duties. The named organisations are those whose primary responsibilities lead to their being essential members of the partnership.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked what would be the difference between those that were named, those that were required to be involved by the Home Secretary and those that were simply involved on a voluntary basis. It may well be that the involvement will be similar in organisations in each of the three categories; it is for local partnerships to determine. We envisage organisations such as neighbourhood watch, residents groups and victim support groups being involved.
<P>
The problem with the amendment is that it may result in some key partners being left out in some parts of the country if people interpret the proposal as saying that if they are not named they do not have to be included. The proposal to include police consultative committees is open to question as a requirement because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said, in some areas the consultative committees are not good and effective organisations, although they work extremely well in others. There is a simple test: if they represent the needs of the community, they should be used. We will set that out in guidance. Requiring their use would mean sometimes using ineffective groups; nobody supports that.
<P>
Neighbourhood watch has been involved in discussions about the development of the programmes. I anticipate that it will play an important role, especially as it is developing new work, for example, with young people. That is welcome, and I am pleased that it is trying to extend its work in high crime areas, especially in inner-city London. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis not only commended that approach, but put me in touch with a baby meerkat. I recommend that experience, but I shall not go into it now.
<P>
Victim Support should also be involved. It has reacted positively to the clause. We want to identify instances of repeat victimisation. I recommend the report ``Biting Back'', which examines the reduction of repeat victimisation in Huddersfield. It describes not only how victimisation was reduced, but how the percentage of prosecutions was increased. Those two ends are greatly desired. Considerable gains can be made by exchanging examples of good practice and building them into the partnership approach.
<P>
Naming individual organisations is arbitrary. The proposal leaves out, for example, magistrates and chambers of commerce, which Conservative Members have mentioned, and which would play a part in the partnership. The wider voluntary sector, which includes youth organisations, drug action teams and registered social landlords, could also be left out. The list is long. The important players should be identified locally and everyone should have an opportunity to participate. The process should be inclusive. I am pleased that hon. Members from all parties support that approach.
<P>
Business and the voluntary sector may be configured differently, but community consultation on the finding of the audit should be thorough. We shall argue strongly for that in the guidance.
<P>
We are not convinced that requiring public meetings in more than one place, or the use of focus groups is necessary. It may be useful for developing knowledge locally, but the Bill avoids prescribing in detail the way in which the responsible authorities should involve others and fulfil their new duties. Such detail is best tackled locally.
<P>
Examining what happens in different areas, sharing successes and accelerating partnership is important, as many hon. Members suggested. We want to accelerate the partnership process, and ensure that it happens everywhere. The success of new partnerships will be judged by results in reduced crime and disorder, not by the mechanism for that reduction. Benefits include the use of different organisations' resources in a co-ordinated and effective way.
<P>
Evidence shows that too much money is spent on processing rather than on co-ordinating the resources of different organisations at the clear target of reducing crime and disorder, improving the quality of life in local communities, and ensuring that the work of different departments is well targeted. That was emphasised in the consultation paper, ``Improving local services through best value'', which explains how we judge the effective use of finance and resources.
<P>
We want to develop guidance on best practice, and to tackle the points that the hon. Member for Hertsmere raised. I hope that after those assurances the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, so that the debate can close in the spirit that has characterised it--one of welcome to a general strategy and of wanting to get the detail right and make the policy work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his full response and courteous remarks. I was pleased to hear what he said about the involvement of the voluntary sector, business and, perhaps above all, victims and the elderly. We want those groups to play a full part in what is being discussed.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister was not being entirely fair to the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. To introduce a slight note of discord, I think that it is reasonable to pose the question--as I tried to do initially--of results. We want benefits to flow from the measure. Setting up strategies is not an end in itself. We shall closely scrutinise some of the measurements that the Minister mentioned.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> In addition to the measurements that I have mentioned--this does not relate specifically to the amendments--we are asking the local partnerships to set targets themselves; local targets, owned and measured locally, to encourage the success of the partnerships.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate that, but it is reasonable to pose the questions that I have referred to. A great deal is to be required of local authorities under the provision, by way of participation, consultation and co-operation. There will be many bodies to co-operate with and consult. We want something to emerge at the end of it. My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest made a very fair point.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Yes, when I have finished making this point. My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest made the point that with no extra resources to cover the work by local authorities, the measure will be implemented at the expense of the other services that they provide. That heightens the need to demonstrate that there will be benefit.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is not aware that the Conservative party, when in government, ring-fenced housing revenue accounts, so housing services could not be raided.
<P>
An example of the cost savings that would be possible is provided by the &#163;100,000 of damage caused when a child went on the rampage in a children's home in Southwark, where I used to be council leader. Anything that could help to control very difficult children and reduce crime would massively reduce the costs of local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I must confess that not long ago I spent many happy hours pondering the mysteries of housing finance. It is one of the pleasures of my life that I no longer have to do so. The Committee will get the drift of my sentiments about that. I do not want to be tempted too far along that line of thought, however, important though the subject is.
<P>
I was a little concerned by the Minister's use of the term ``flagship'' in describing the crime and disorder strategy. I think that the jury is out and we shall wait for results, but we should not want too much weight to be placed on the establishment of the strategies. I instinctively shy away from the use of the word ``flagship''. The last policy to which I applied it was the community charge, when I was standing in a by-election not that many years ago. I have not used it since. I thought that the charge was a flagship policy. You, Mr O'Hara, know as well as I do, where that happened, and that although I was very enthusiastic about the flagship, not many other people were.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the difference on this occasion is that we have the wholehearted support of local government and the police, as well as many other organisations? I do not recall his flagship having such general support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We were convinced, but there we are. I do not want to go over old history--but history does show that not every flagship gets out of the harbour.
<P>
We take the subject seriously, but want some benefit to result from the activity and endeavours that are being required of local authorities.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister. The only remaining point on which I want to take him up is about police consultative committees. In my experience they do an excellent job; they certainly do in my constituency. I am not aware of general discontent with them. I am tempted to undertake the exercise that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough engaged in, and ask any hon. Members who are unhappy with their police consultative committee to let us know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> In my constituency they are not working too well. I should not want them to be depended on there. I want them to be improved to the standard of the better PCCs. They are structured wrongly and that is part of the problem. The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that the consultative committee in his area is effective and has community support. That is the way in which such committees should be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Certainly, that is the case in my community. The police consultative committee is listened to. It is an important and valuable means by which ordinary members of the public and people representing different sections of the community can express their views. They include churches, youth groups and citizens advice bureaux. Some of these groups might not be heard under the Government's proposals.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the Minister's comments, and although Conservative Members still have some long-term concerns, I do not intend to press the matter to a vote.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the amendments covered the whole of clause 6, I hope that the clause stand part debate will be brief.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Briefly, the purpose of the clause is to introduce crime and disorder strategies, which are to be the joint responsibility of local authorities and the police. I want to emphasise that the responsibility is shared jointly.
<P>
In a unitary authority area, it is a simple and straightforward matter. In a two-tier area, in which there is a district and a county council, the district council--the most local area--will have the responsibility, but the county and the district councils will be equal partners with the police in those areas. The issue has been referred to on several occasions during our debate and I wanted to clarify the Government's intentions. The participation of the county will be important, although local boundaries will be used in designing the local strategy.
<P>
We have used the word ``strategy'' rather than the word ``plan'', to demonstrate that it is not the document itself that is important. This part of the Bill provides for a strategy for successful action by partners working together to reduce crime and disorder. I am at one with the hon. Member for Hertsmere when he says that we do not merely want a bureaucratic process. We want effective partnership, leading to a reduction in crime and disorder.
<P>
In view of our wide-ranging debate on the amendments, those are the only points to which I want to draw the attention of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Bearing your comments in mind, Mr. O'Hara, I would like to make a brief comment on resources.
<P>
Liberal Democrats support the clause and the establishment of the strategies. However, if a job is worth doing, it is worth doing well. That means that it must be the responsibility of highly skilled, senior local authority officers, who will be able to ensure that the partnerships work by liaising with senior officers in other agencies, and that the strategy permeates throughout the policies of the local authority.
<P>
The resourcing of many community safety strategies is cobbled together from bits of safer cities money or bits of single regeneration budget money. In most cases, the strategies are not integrated into the mainstream of council funding. I hope that although the Government are currently maintaining their spending straitjacket, they will review the resources that are needed. Local authorities could be given the money to implement their new statutory responsibility through mechanisms such as the revenue support grant. The Government should not rule out that option, even though they say that there is no more money available because of their self-imposed spending limits.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Formulation and implementation of strategies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 340, in page 6, line 32, after `disorder', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the fear of crime and disorder'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with the problem of the fear of crime. Members of the Committee will be aware that the fear of crime can have a negative impact on the quality of life, but it is especially worrying to elderly and disabled people. Such people may fail to play a full role in society because of the fear that, if they leave their homes, they may be subject to an attack against their person or property.
<P>
In some areas, fear of crime is especially prevalent in the evenings when many older people are unwilling to venture out to the cinema or to attend social events. A survey of 20,000 Post Office and British Telecom pensioners found that 56 per cent. of respondents go out less at night than they might do because of fear of crime.
<P>
Fear of crime is not necessarily directly related to the absolute level of crime, but it is an important consideration. It can be combated. Over recent years, one of the most successful ways in which that has been done is through the use of closed circuit television. As the Minister will know, that development began under the previous Government and many local authorities joined in the scheme. In Borehamwood, in my constituency, closed circuit television has made a great difference. Business people and ordinary citizens, especially elderly people, feel much more secure in the areas in which it is used. We want the use of closed circuit television to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I agree entirely with the spirit of the amendment. Fear of crime is damaging to people, especially to the elderly. It can seriously compromise the quality of people's lives. However, I am not persuaded that effective measures to reduce the fear of crime can be dependent on a specific reference in the Bill. The Government want to reduce crime and disorder, and when the threat from crime is reduced, there will be a reduction in fear.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere rightly states that the fear of crime in particular localities should be addressed. Such fear would emerge during the audit and the public consultation that will be integral to the audit process. The audit will not take account only of the figures of recorded crime but will consider the experience of the community. The necessary strategies will be drawn up to address situations in which the fear is disproportionate to the actual threat. However, if the fear is based on reality, then that reality has to be dealt with.
<P>
The idea behind clause 7 is that the process should be driven by what matters to local people. The amendment could distort the strategies. Areas expressing a strong fear of crime, where that was not justified, might be given priority; partners would want to combat the fear of crime because it was an explicit legal responsibility under the Bill. That could result in an inappropriate diversion of resources away from high-crime areas. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hertsmere does not want that, and I urge him to withdraw the amendment. I agree that the fear of crime should be tackled, but as part of a reasonable response to the audit process, not in a way that is disproportionate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response. In my opening remarks, I pointed out that fear of crime is not necessarily directly related to the level of crime in a particular area. None the less, Conservative Members hope that those who will be responsible for the strategies take account of the fear of crime, especially among elderly people.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappision:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 6, line 32, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which shall include a strategy for addressing the problem of drug abuse involving controlled drugs in the area'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall listen carefully to the Minister's comments on the amendment. Conservative Members have strong view on drug abuse and the link between drugs and crime. The Minister may be tempted to say that we should not single out drug abuse and not mention other problems, but we do not hesitate to do that because drug abuse is an important factor in fuelling other types of crime besides the abuse of controlled drugs themselves. It is fuelling a growth in crime at the moment.
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
While the overall level of crime is falling, there is an ever stronger link between crime and drugs. That has been shown repeatedly by research, and there are fresh pieces of evidence every day showing the extent of drug abuse. A worrying trend which has been noted in many quarters recently is the growing use of class A drugs, the most serious and most addictive drugs. They have the greatest potential to fuel additional crime among those who are unfortunate enough to take them.
<P>
If the Government set up this strategic framework, tackling drug abuse should be part of it. We want the Minister to tell us how he sees tackling drug abuse fitting into local authority strategies. Drug abuse is an apt area to tackle through a partnership approach. The strategy of the last Government, ``Tackling Drugs Together'' was a great success because of the partnerships it engendered between bodies. It brought together the voluntary sector, health authorities and the police. Collaboration is needed on law enforcement, education, prevention and treatment. Those elements were brought together successfully through ``Tackling Drugs Together''. Although that has had many successes the problem of drugs continues to grow.
<P>
We appreciate that there is no magical or complete answer to the problem of drugs but we must do all that we can. A strategy to tackle drugs should be at the heart of the clause, and we seek to give drugs the prominence they deserve. We will not be happy with the response that the amendment is unacceptable because it has not been subject to the full rigours of consultation with every possible body. We are not happy with that doctrine and we hope that it will not be given an outing today. Nor will we be happy to be told that the Government already have a drugs strategy which was produced by the anti-drugs co-ordinator and so they do not think measures like this are necessary.
<P>
Drugs must be tackled in a number of different ways. The recent strategy unveiled by the Government set itself forward as no more than a guide to action. We would be wrong to see it as a substitute for action in itself. The question of tackling drugs needs to be brought into all the measures put forward to tackle crime. If the Government are relying on crime and disorder strategies as their flagship, a drug strategy should be given a prominent position on its deck. We look forward to hearing that that will be the case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> We touched on the subject of drugs a day or so ago. There is huge amount of common ground between the Minister and Opposition Members on the problems of drugs. I referred the other day to the fact that drugs are responsible for a huge amount of crime. I do not want to go over that ground again, but want to give other illustations.
<P>
The Select Committee on Home Affairs has been taking evidence over the past few months from a number of people, ranging from a stipendiary magistrate, the head of the lay magistracy, the judiciary and the probation service. When asked, ``What do you think is the biggest factor in crime?'', every witness replied, ``Drugs.'' The Minister will also know that recent figures show that this country is top of the league table in Europe in terms of young people's involvement in crime. It is a serious problem.
<P>
I was enjoying listening to the debate a moment or two ago when I came across the Howard League magazine in my papers. There is a most impressive photograph on the front page showing our Minister at work in a most dramatic way. It is extremely fetching; he is wearing a different tie, possibly the same shirt and no glasses. It is a pose that shows him at his most commanding.
<P>
The Minister and his colleagues on the Home Affairs team take the issue seriously. They are sensitive and thoughtful. Am I going too far? I could be in serious trouble with the Opposition Whip and my hon. Friends on the Front Bench for saying that. They recognise the problems. The magazine relates the Minister's comments about getting young people involved and making them part of the solution, not just part of the problem. He was talking about a project aiming to reach thousands of school children between the ages of 13 and 14 in London over the next three years to foster a sense of citizenship and to help to reduce crime.
<P>
No one will object to that and the Minister is right to do it, but it takes me back to my earlier point: young people and drugs are getting very close. This is not a problem of a single sector of our society. Youngsters from all sorts of backgrounds are dabbling in drugs. I have said enough to confirm what we all know: drugs are the most important problem facing the criminal justice system. Why not therefore accept this amendment which specifically states that the strategy will address
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the problem of drug abuse involving controlled drugs in the area''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may reply that any strategy will involve discussion of drugs. He may say that it is not possible to discuss crime without bringing up the question of drugs because we all know that drugs are involved. The Minister may almost say that the amendment is unnecessary because it follows as night follows day that drugs will be discussed, but it is necessary because it gets it on the record and in the Bill that drugs are the critical issue. They stand alone in needing 100 per cent. commitment and concentration.
<P>
There is benefit to be gained from the amendment. Those who act under the Bill will know that drugs come first in their deliberations. There is no harm in including the amendment; indeed, it is likely to foucs the minds of those who are having disucssions about drugs. A strategy for addressing the problem of drug abuse is a useful policy for a local area. If the clause related only to drug strategies there would be some merit in that alone.
<P>
I ask the Minister not to dismiss the amendment out of hand. He should recognise that the Opposition are telling him that drugs are so significant that the amendment should be accepted. We could then send a signal, through the Bill, that drugs are to be the priority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I rise briefly to support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. It is important for the matter of drug abuse to be included specifically in the clause. My hon. Friend drew attention to the amount of common ground that exists between all parties in the House about the need to tackle the drugs problem.
<P>
We spoke earlier this morning about the importance of police advisory groups, police consultative committees and police and community partnership groups. I drew attention to the fact that in the areas in which I have worked, before and since entering the House, they have worked extremely well. It is fair to say that all those who work with the police, whether in successful or less successful arrangements, would share our concern about drugs as the biggest problem.
<P>
A requirement in the Bill for a strategy specifically on drugs to be included in the strategy for tackling crime and disorder would be very useful. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking may be right in anticipating that the Minister will respond that it is not necessary because drugs would be dealt with as part of a general strategy. However, because drugs cause so much crime, they are the biggest issue. Stating the need for a strategy in the Bill would help enormously--it would not be an unnecessary adjunct.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will either accept our amendment now or at least reflect on the matter further and accept it later in the Bill's progress.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I agree with all that my hon. Friends have said about the importance of drugs and of recognising their role in much crime. The Minister and other hon. Members have in various Committee sittings quoted statistics that show incontrovertibly that the proportion of crimes due in one way or another to drugs is extremely high. It must therefore surely be right for the Bill to acknowledge the importance of tackling drugs.
<P>
What people call drug use or drug abuse encompasses hugh variety. The spectrum ranges from heroin users who are capable of nothing but using heroin, to people taking what might be described as socially acceptable drugs. Medical evidence has shown--although I know that the arguments will continue ad nauseam--that taking socially acceptable drugs is the thin end of the wedge, which leads young people into serious drug abuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> What does the hon. Lady mean by ``socially acceptable drugs''?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I am coming to that. I am not suggesting that the Government have used that phrase or that any Committee member would consider the use of any drug socially acceptable. That was the point that I wanted to make.
<P>
The medical evidence is that the use of so-called soft drugs leads, because of their addictive quality, to the use of hard drugs, so it follows that any strategy for tackling drugs as a source of crime should from the outset tackle soft drugs as well.
<P>
In a previous sitting several hon. Members said that they were not part of a generation that was involved in taking drugs, or that viewed drug taking as part of everyday life. I am part of that generation. When I was a student, the use of drugs was considered normal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Careful!
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> The hon. Gentleman says ``Careful'', and I shall be. I hasten to explain that I have never tried drugs, unless alcohol is counted as a drug. I do not consider it to be one. I have never been interested in trying drugs, but I know plenty of people who have taken them. That is what I mean by ``socially acceptable''. I want to draw a parallel with society's attitude to drinking and driving.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, although it was not legally acceptable, it was socially acceptable to drink a little too much and risk being caught driving by the police. The hon. Member for Peterborough (Mrs. Brinton) looks at me askance. I assure her that that was not my attitude, but that of society in general. The Government tackled the problem of drinking and driving through series of adverts and public information programmes, which were designed to teach people that driving a vehicle after consuming more than the legal amount of alcohol was neither socially acceptable nor responsible, and could lead to tragic consequences.
<P>
I want drugs to be mentioned in clause 7 because we should start a campaign to change people's attitudes to drug taking. The Minister was right to question the phrase ``socially acceptable'', but I hope that I have explained my use of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I do not want to detract from the hon. Lady's argument about the use of illegal drugs, and I shall not discuss what my generation got up to. However, does the hon. Lady agree that although alcohol is legal, it is a major factor in criminality, and that controlling alcohol abuse will be an important part of any crime and disorder strategy?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. However, consuming a reasonable amount of alcohol is not illegal, unlike the use of proscribed drugs.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): I thought that consuming alcohol under a specific age and in certain circumstances was illegal.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct.
<P>
In the past 20 years, Government action to change attitudes towards the irresponsible consumption of alcohol before driving has succeeded remarkably well in reducing the accidents, crimes and tragedies that can follow alcohol abuse.
<P>
We can begin a public information campaign by including in clause 7 a strategy to tackle drug taking and thus start to highlight the dangers of drugs. If we condone the use of socially acceptable, so-called ``soft'' drugs, we do not tackle the problem. If the Government are serious about tackling the root of the drugs problem, including, therefore, even the softest of soft drugs, they cannot reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The simple message from all members of the committee, which cuts across politics, is that we need to crack down on drugs, by catching and prosecuting those who profit from drug trafficking and by using education on health and environmental matters to encourage people not to start taking drugs in the first place.
<P>
I agree about the importance of tackling drugs because of the damage caused to people who take drugs and because of the impact on crime. The problems involved in tackling drug-related crime are likely to arise in most, if not all, areas of the country to a greater or lesser extent. Strategies to cope with the problem will be part of the profile of the crime and disorder orders in most parts of the country.
<P>
However, the drugs problem is not the only thing that must be tackled if we are to have any impact on levels of crime. Two other obvious elements in the fight against crime, which were hinted at by Opposition Members, are crimes involving young people and alcohol-related crime.
<P>
Any strategy to deal with crime will need to tackle the involvement of young people in criminal activities. I venture to suggest that most areas will come up with specific, although different, ways in which problems involving young people should be tackled if any significant impact is to be made in reducing crime.
<P>
The second element--alcohol-related crime--has already been touched on. It is a particularly serious problem, which must be tackled, as crimes of violence have continued to rise to a serious and worrying extent in recent years. I would be amazed if it were not included in the analysis of crime and disorder in an area and the subject of strategies to deal with it.
<P>
One chief constable told me that he was more worried about the violence associated with alcohol and alcohol-related crime in his area than with drugs. The answer is simply that drug-related and alcohol-related crime should be tackled as part of the strategic development.
<P>
We agree that tackling drug-related crime should be part of the strategy. It would be inappropriate for the Bill specifically to mention drug-related crime, not just because it would appear to downgrade the importance of alcohol-related and other crime but because a vehicle already exists to do what the hon. Member for Hertsmere wants. He has overlooked the fact that the previous Government set up drug action teams to co-ordinate action to tackle drugs in an area. We supported the previous Administration in that respect; they were right to take such a step to tackle the drugs problem. The task of the Government's drugs co-ordinator is to use every method available to tackle drugs and drug-related crime, including the existing drug action teams.
<P>
One difficulty with requiring the problem to be dealt with as part of the strategy referred to in the clause is that the existing mechanism is organised on the basis of district health authorities areas. We have made it absolutely clear that developing the strategic proposals and responding to crime and disorder audits must be done in conjunction with drug action teams, using the strength of their experience over recent years and integrating that work with the strategic local approach.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am surprised that the Minister quotes a chief constable saying that in his area the problem of alcohol-related crime is more worrying. He must be a very rare chief constable; all the senior police officers to whom I have spoken say that drugs are by far the greatest problem. To reinforce my argument, has the Minister seen the most recent edition of ``Police'', the voice of the Police Federation, which arrived this morning? The whole of the front cover is devoted to ``Fighting the drugs war''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Yes, indeed. Most chief officers will agree that tackling drugs and drug-related crime is paramount. That is precisely why my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made it a priority for this Government. My point is that most chief officers, when asked where in the list they would place alcohol-related crime, say that that, too, is a difficult and challenging matter, especially in respect of crimes of violence, which are on the increase.
<P>
The chief constable whom I mentioned would say not that drug-related crime is unimportant but that there are people of violence in the streets of the towns for which he is responsible. That causes him great concern and the problem needs to be tackled.
<P>
The prominence given to tackling the issues will depend on the facts that relate to an area. The core principle is that the strategy must be based on what emerges from the local crime and disorder audits. If we specifiy that tackling drugs must automatically be included, we appear to downgrade the importance of the drug action teams which, as I said, were established by the previous Government. We do not want to downgrade those teams. It is important, in working with them, that the local strategy reflects what is necessary at local level to deal with drug-related crime.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking mentioned the article in the Howard League magazine and I commented on young people being part of the solution, not just part of the problem. That remark was made in a school that I visited in Barnet, to which I referred in an earlier debate. Youth action teams are an extremely important part of the strategy. They have been developed primarily by Crime Concern, with the support of the Prudential, which has funded national awards to show the remarkable initiatives of young people in the fight against crime and disorder and associated social problems.
<P>
I had the privilege, with the previous holder of my office, of judging those awards--it has been done on a cross-party basis for several years--and seeing how the fight against drugs involves young people in a positive way. For example, young people from a school in Holyhead produced a video which won the national award. It was a sort of Oprah Winfrey show; the children spoke in the most magnificent American accents which one would not expect in the streets of Holyhead. It was a brilliant performance. I visited the school last year to see what had happened after they won the national award, and found that the young people were taking their film to primary schools to persuade younger children that they should not get involved with drugs. What is so striking is that the stars of the show talk to the children after they have seen the video. Can you imagine the impact of youngsters only a few years older talking to children about the dangers of drugs and the importance of staying away from them, compared with the impact if someone of our advanced years in a suit goes to talk to them? It is immensely powerful. Young people are involved in fighting crime through the youth action teams, in schools and in youth clubs, and I am delighted that neighbourhood watch has agreed to join us in trying to promote youth action teams in local areas, as has at least one organisation of youth clubs with the support of colleagues at the Department of Education and Employment.
<P>
There is an immensly powerful weapon. It is not an alternative to tackling crime up front and chasing, catching and prosecuting, but it is a powerful instrument that must be integrated. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Woking for giving me the opportunity to make clear just how important it will be in tackling both drug-related crime and drug use and the problems of young people generally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a good debate, and one of our best so far. It has had a constructive tone. Having said that I am not entirely satisified with the Minister's response. I do not disparage all that he has said because he touched upon some important and valuable points. We support the Government in principle as the then Opposition supported the previous Government in their endeavours to tackle drugs. However, the Minister has not given me a reason not to seek to include a drugs strategy in the Bill, giving it the prominence it deserves and sending the correct signal.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I listended carefully to what the Minister said. Some of the points he made were fair, which strengthened my conviction that it would be right to have a drugs strategy set out in the Bill. The Minister said that drugs were a problem throughout country. There is plenty of evidence that drug taking and drug-related crime is a problem in inner city areas and all over the country. There is a worrying trend that people in rural areas are taking drugs too. The problem is troubling communities, schools and families throughout the country. It would be a rare police chief or headmaster who was not worried about the problem of drugs in his area.
<P>
The Minister made the fair point that drug action teams set up under the ``Tackling Drugs Together'' initiative are already up and running. As I said in my opening remarks, it is important to recognise that a number of different bodies and persons have to come together to tackle drugs. It has to be a co-operative venture. That strengthens my belief that it should be included in the Bill. If the Government's chosen flagship for dealing with crime is to set up crime and disorder strategies to govern co-operation between different bodies surely drugs, which need that type of approach, should be at the forefront.
<P>
The Minister also mentioned alcohol, as did the hon. Member for Hallam. It was said, and here I paraphrase, that if we are to mention drugs, why not mention alcohol too because that can also be a cause of crime. That is right. A trend has been observed of alcohol being related to certain types of offences. The Minister mentioned the link between alcohol and violence. That link has been with us for many years. There is an undoubted link between alcohol and domestic violence in some circumstances.
<P>
I have no firm evidence to put before the Committee on this but I would make a reasonable guess that the situation is not significantly worse today with alcohol as it is with drugs. The Minister looks surprised. I am only making an educated guess. The problem of alcohol-related crime is not growing as fast as that of drug-related crime. I quoted the written answer which the Government gave me only a few days ago about the link shown by a Cambridge university study between arrestees and their consumption of drugs. That was for a number of different offences. I may be wrong but I think it showed that nearly half of those arrested for shoplifting tested positive for drugs.
<P>
I shall give the Minister three ways in which the problem of drug abuse is different from that of alcohol and so needs to be tackled differently. First, drug consumption is related much more to spiralling offending of different types. A number of studies show how people taking drugs can be responsible for a huge amount of crime because they steal to fuel their addictions. Someone with a drug problem can be responsible for a huge amount of other crime to pay for his addiction. That is one difference.
<P>
A second important difference is that the alcohol industry, whatever one's moral views about alcohol, is entirely legal and is part and parcel of our national life. The drug industry is wholly illegal. Drugs are responsible for a business which we all condemn. People make large amounts of money illegally through supplying and pushing drugs. They range from the big fish at the top of the chain down to the little fish who are supplying at the bottom end of the chain.
<P>
The third difference is that the use of alcohol is legal whereas the use of controlled drugs is illegal and an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and there are controlled drugs of different classes. Alcohol can be associated with health problems but drugs tend to lead on much more readily to addition than alcohol and can give rise to serious health and other problems.
<P>
The drugs co-ordinator found a link between drugs and all sorts of problems such as social exclusion, homelessness, unemployment, prostitution and young people being brought into an undesirable way of life. Those are all things that we would want to condemn. The Government report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``For older teenagers and people in their twenties, there are strong links between drugs problems and unemployment, homelessness, prostitution and other features of social exclusion.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why the use of controlled drugs is illegal and why we rightly set our face against the legalisation of controlled drugs because it leads to those terrible problems for far too many individuals.
<P>
What my hon. Friends have said in this debate has been entirely right. We have had some thoughtful speeches from my hon. Friend the Member for Woking, who sees the drug problem in his day-to-day experience of the Crown court. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) has also had experience in the courts and has seen the problem at first hand. My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest made a very sensible speech. She was right: drugs are too much part of the culture of many people in this country.
<P>
We need to start sending strong signals now. I have not been entirely convinced by what the Minister has said. I do not want to disparage anything he said but nothing has dissuaded me from pressing this amendment to send a signal in its own way. I shall be pressing it to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I regret the way in which the hon. Gentleman has responded to the discussion. I made it absolutely clear that the core principle is that the contents of the strategy must be based on what emerges from the local crime and disorder audits. It is unthinkable that that strategy would not deal with drugs and drug-related crime certainly in the immediate future, but it is a strategy with a long-term future too.
<P>
It is rare to find a place where drugs are not a cause for concern but it is also rare to find a place where violence and alcohol-related crime are unimportant. Violence is increasing at about 10 per cent. a year, which is a worrying rate of increase. That is recorded crime and does not include incidents of disorder, some of which are alcohol related which are not recorded because they are not reported.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman diminishes his argument by not recognising that a number of factors contribute to crime. The Government have made it a major priority to pinpoint and tackle the problem of drugs and drug-related crime comprehensively. He knows that we supported a policy of integration across government by the previous Government and have taken that a stage further. I would have expected that to have cross-party support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We are trying to have a constructive debate. I do not disagree with the Minister. Alcohol is a factor in crime and it may even be a growing factor. Does he agree that drug consumption is now the most significant factor in the growth of crime? We know that crime levels are falling, but it is now the most significant growth factor in crime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks about growth factors in crime. As I have just pointed out, crimes of violence represent the fastest growing area of crime. That is extremely worrying. Alcohol-related crime is an especially important aspect of crimes of violence and the police are increasingly highlighting that fact. We must tackle that so that it does not continue to grow out of all proportion. That is a matter of concern in several areas of the country.
<P>
The important principle set out in the clause is that the strategy to tackle crime and disorder in an area should be based on the facts in that area. The hon. Gentleman knows full well that the amendment would not advance that principle one iota.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I understand that what is proposed in the amendment already occurs. In Northamptonshire, such a partnership already exists to apply for funding. I understand that it has some statutory status, so would simply be absorbed into one of the local partnerships that the Bill will create. Can my hon. Friend tell me if that is accurate? If so, the amendment is completely unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The amendment is unnecessary. The partnership approach to drugs was proposed by the previous Government and supported by us. The work of drug action teams will be complementary to the work of the local partnership strategy. We do not intend to dismantle drug action teams. They provide a focus on the particular problems of drugs, which should continue and be encouraged. They should be integrated with the strategic approach.
<P>
I regret to say that the hon. Gentleman is choosing to indulge in an outrageous piece of opportunism in trying to write into the Bill something that he knows will have no effect, purely to make a spurious political point. That is regrettable, in view of the approach taken to the rest of our debate, but perhaps he is under instructions from those who do not share his general welcome for the way in which the Government are trying to tackle crime and disorder.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I listened with care to the Minister. His last few sentences were outrageous. To suggest, as he appears to be doing, that we are trying to make party political points is nonsense. We now know what is the difference between our view of the amendment and that of the Government. Hansard will record that the Minister said a moment ago that the fight against drugs was ``a major priority''. He seems to think that it is only ``a'' major priority; we intend by the amendment to make it ``the'' major priority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I presume that that explains why the previous Home Secretary ignored the increase in crimes of violence in every complacent message that he gave before the general election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The previous Home Secretary did an enormous amount to help reduce crime figures over several years--[Laughter.] Yes, he did. Those of us who sat in the courts could see the effects of that work.
<P>
The difference between us is that we regard the battle against drugs as the major priority, while the Government say that it is only a major priority.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman say that mugging an old lady for a new pair of trainers was better or worse than mugging an old lady for money to buy drugs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The question is misconceived. The reason for the mugging does not matter to the old lady who is mugged. Mugging is a serious crime and, whatever the motivation, the result for the old lady is the same.
<P>
Conservative Members are clear that drugs constitute ``the'' major problem, whereas the Minister classified it as ``a'' major problem. I am disappointed that the Minister has not recognised the special evil of drugs, and has tended to bracket together drug-related and alcohol-related crimes, as though they were similar.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman's comments are outrageous. He obviously ate the same porridge as the Member for Hertsmere this morning. I have explained clearly our focus of tackling drugs and drug-related crime. We are doing more than the previous Government. However, we were courteous enough to acknowledge the work on a comprehensive strategy that was started under the previous Government. The hon. Gentleman is playing with words and abusing his experience in the courts to twist the truth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Not at all. Hansard will show that the Minister described drugs as ``a'' major priority. Our amendment shows that it is ``the'' major priority. The Government have failed to grasp that in the debate. I hope that the amendment will be pressed to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, although the reason for the crime does not matter to an old lady who has been mugged, the motivation--drugs or trainers--matters to the young person who carries out the mugging? If the assailant wants a new pair of trainers, he probably does not need help, but if he wants the money for drugs, he need help. The Government do not make that important distinction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I take my hon. Friend's comments on board. I shall allude to the consequences of crime shortly.
<P>
My next comments are anecdotal, and there are exceptions to what I am about to say. Although the Minister is right to describe alcohol-related crime as a serious, rising problem, those who commit crimes because of alcohol tend to commit the brawling type of offence, such as domestic violence--[Interruption.] Perhaps Labour Members should try to intervene during my comments instead of simply shouting, ``Ridiculous''. I am stating facts. If the experience of Labour Members, who have been fairly silent during the debate, is different, and they wish to correct me, I should be happy to give way. I am looking to see who wants to stand up and intervene instead of shouting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is playing games. He suggests that he and his colleagues are not interested in tackling crimes of violence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I was looking more to the Government Back Benches when I issued my invitation for interventions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understood the hon. Gentleman to be inviting interventions. Therefore, I assumed that he was giving way when the Minister rose. I apologise if he was not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I was looking at those on the Back Benches who had earlier shouted ``Ridiculous'' rather than at the Minister.
<P>
By and large, alcohol-related crimes might generally be described as those of brawling, domestic violence, actual bodily harm, criminal damage and public order offences. Those crimes are most commonly related to alcohol abuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We both obviously share experience of such matters and I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, but does he agree that the Minister is trying to set up a wholly artificial and incorrect comparison? Every member of the Committee wants to tackle crimes of violence and those relating to drugs. It is only the Minister who wants to draw such a specious and sophistic comparison between the two crimes and make allegations against the former Home Secretary. My experience of the courts and that of my hon. Friend shows that to be wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Generally speaking, the crimes that result from alcohol are those to which I have referred. But crimes relating to drugs, and hard drugs in particular, are more frequently associated with the more serious crimes of night-time domestic burglary and robbery from the person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Stinchcombe </B>(Wellingborough): Given that drug-related crime is prevalent and that local audits will, therefore, uncover it and devise strategies to deal with it, what difference would the amendment make other than to downgrade violent crimes just as the hon. Gentleman's contribution has downgraded them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes his point, but the purpose behind the amendment is to show that drug-related crime is the single, most important issue. I accept that other crimes are important, and they are not being downgraded--least of all by me. I recognise, as others do, that drug-related crime is the most serious problem. In 1994, the former Home Secretary was asked whether he agreed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that there is no more serious cause of crime than the link between crime and drugs and drug abuse''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That question was asked by the Prime Minister when he was shadow Home Secretary and it was the Labour party's view then. It seems sad that--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman quote my right hon. Friend correctly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I have quoted the question correctly. I shall gladly repeat it. When he was shadow Home Secretary, the Prime Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Does the Home Secretary agree that there is no more serious cause of crime than the link between crime and drugs and drug abuse, particularly among young people? Is he aware that the police estimate that in certain parts of the country, 70 per cent. of crime is linked to drugs.''--[Official Report, 13 January 1994; Vol. 235, c. 318.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the Government's view when they were the official Opposition. That such crime is most serious remains the position today.
<P>
It is so disappointing that, in a debate on such important issues, the Government have failed to say that the drug aspect is most serious. Drugs give rise to a desperate need for money. A burglar who steals &#163;700 or &#163;800 a week does so for drugs. Has any member of the Committee thought about the further impact on crime? When a burglar steals videos from houses, he must fence them so, for each burglary, there must be a handler of stolen goods. Such crime reverberates; it has a huge knock-on effect.
<P>
Given that the drug addict requires such huge sums of money, the criminal justice system is dominated by drug-related crime which, by its very nature, is ruinous to society. Opposition Members recognise that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am certain that that contribution will arouse hon. Members' admiration for the hon. Gentleman's skill at advocacy and making bricks without straw, in trying to pretend that the amendment would have an impact. It has been made clear to him that it would not. He has clearly not read the amendment, which requires
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a strategy for addressing the problem of drug abuse''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not for tackling drug-related crime. Did he realise that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister makes a fine point of words, but a strategy that addresses
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the problem of drug abuse involving controlled drugs in the area''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
boils down to the same thing, because drug abuse gives rise to crime.
<P>
If, at this late stage, the Minister wants to give an undertaking that he will draft a wording along the lines of what he thinks I am saying, to be added to the Bill, that is a matter for him. I remain unhappy that the Minister, while recognising that drugs-related crime is a major priority, has not accepted the Opposition view--which I think the Prime Minister expressed some years ago, as the then Opposition spokesman--that it is the major priority. The amendment would send the clearest possible signal to the people who have to deal with these matters that the House of Commons considers drugs the major priority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I shall make only a brief contribution because as you know, Mr.O'Hara, I am a gentle soul. It upsets me that we seem to be descending into party political controversy. The Minister seems to be getting very steamed up. There is no need for that. I recognise the efforts that the Government are making to tackle drugs, just as the previous Government did. We acknowledge that there is unanimity in the Committee and in the House about the need to work together on that.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister and take the view that it does not much matter whether one views drugs as the most important issue facing us, or one of many serious issues. For the sake of argument I shall accept the Minister's point that tackling crime is a complex business of interrelated issues, and that we should not focus on just one issue and ignore others.
<P>
This morning I said that I was not entirely convinced that merely requiring authorities to produce strategy papers would make much difference. However, tackling drugs is one context in which that might be most useful. As has been mentioned, the courts are very experienced in dealing with traditional crimes, such as crimes of violence, which are often caused by drink or burglary. Drugs form a much more complex area, which we have to feel our way around. Traditionally, a criminal class tried to promote a certain standard of living by indulging in crime. Burglary is an obvious example. Crime is now much more complex.
<P>
A couple of weeks ago I listened to an interesting statement on drug abuse by the Leader of the House. Other hon. Members may have been present for it. The entire purport of her statement was that drug abuse was a complex area and that all agencies should work closely together to tackle it. I suggested to her that we were not putting sufficient emphasis on deterrence. I do not blame the Government who, like all Governments, have difficulty in balancing resources. My view is that the real problem lies with drug pushers and that we should try to deal with the problem by giving prisons more resources to permit longer, more effective, deterrent sentences. The Leader of the House chided me on the point. She told me that I was wrong, that my solution was too simplistic and that we could deal with the problem only if all the agencies worked together. The sort of work that will be undertaken--local authorities working with police authorities and so on--will try to deal with just one part of a complex problem, and a special statutory injunction should be laid upon such bodies to work closer together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The whole purpose of the strategy is to tackle crime and disorder by preventing and reducing it. That is why the experience and knowledge of the courts, although important in itself, it not the only aspect to be taken into consideration. We want to prevent and reduce crime, not simply punish it.
<P>
I recognise the importance of the hon. Gentleman's argument that crime and disorder partnerships must focus closely on what is happening in their areas, and on the precursors and feeders of crime as well as the recorded crime that the police have to deal with. That is why we shall be making it absolutely clear that those bodies must work closely with the drug action teams and on their work on preventing and reducing drug-taking, thus helping to prevent drug-related crime. That is a central part of the strategy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I have no doubt that he will be giving advice to local authorities and requiring them to address the drugs problem. Drugs have always been with us, but the seriousness of the problem is relatively new. When my hon. Friends and I started working in the criminal courts, it was not as big a problem as it is today. It is so complex.
<P>
I recognise that the police deal with drug-related crime, and that circulars will, of course, be issued by the Home Office, but the Minister has not convinced me that the complexity of the drug problem makes it wrong to include a strategy in the Bill. For instance, drug-taking starts at school and local authorities run schools. The Leader of the House, in a statement, emphasised the role of schools, but schools have traditionally not been involved in criminal matters. The right hon. Lady also emphasised the role of health authorities in dealing with drug addiction. The courts obviously have a role in providing deterrent sentences. The police, not only the ordinary police authorities but the more specialist police squads, often deal with organised crime, which is heavily involved in drug pushing.
<P>
Those areas, precisely because they are so complex and difficult, involve many authorities and provide many new challenges. The Minister is more convinced than I am that we should require local authorities, by statute, to draw up such plans. Surely, drug taking should be drawn to their attention in the Bill?
<P>
Drug taking is one of the most serious problems that we face. The Minister has not convinced me that mentioning a drugs strategy in the Bill would cause any harm. It cannot possibly cause harm; it might do some good. That is why I believe the Committee should accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We want to press the amendment to a Division.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to improve the strategies. Amendment No. 337 deals with ethnic monitoring and would ensure that strategies took account of the ethnicity of victims of crime. Recent reports from such august bodies as the Home Office research department have shown that members of our ethnic minority communities suffer disproportionately from the effects of crime and from the fear of crime. There is currently wide variation in the extent to which criminal justice agencies record the ethnicity of victims. They are often far more ready to record the ethnicity of offenders.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 338 and 339 relate to the consultation mechanisms. The knowledge and experience of persons in a particular local authority will vary according to the specific part of the authority area in which they live. In the London borough of Greenwich, for example, there are huge differences between one part of the borough and another. Amendment No. 338 would ensure that attention is paid to the patterns of crime in each part of an area as well as in the area as a whole.
<P>
Amendment 339 would ensure that organisations such as local race equality councils and community groups are consulted. In many areas there are already good partnerships. For example, racial equality councils and similar bodies are often well integrated in existing partnerships in the metropolitan areas and London. However, Liberal Democrat Members are concerned that the interests of minority ethnic communities might be overlooked in more rural areas, where such communities are smaller.
<P>
Consultation is important so that when strategies are introduced they have wide acceptance and they work. There are already tensions between the police and some sections of the community, especially young, black males. That is well attested. Disorder strategies must seek to reduce that tension which, if not adequately addressed, will lead to increased disorder. The key to getting the disorder strategies right is consultation with groups which are often not part of the mainstream model of formal partnerships. The strategies should reflect the interests of particular groups in particular areas.
<P>
I hope that the Government share our concerns and that the Minister will respond to the points that I have raised.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I have much sympathy with the points made by the hon. Gentleman and hope to reassure him. We want to avoid specifying the types of crime to be addressed by audits and strategies. That was brought out in the earlier debate.
<P>
The strategies must focus on local needs as identified by audit. However, the hon. Member for Hallam is right to say that we must listen to each part of the community, not just to the loudest or most numerous voices in some sort of cacophony. Some communities are more vulnerable than others. They might be defined by ethnic origin, sexual orientation, age or in a variety of other ways. The audit process should be sensitive enough to pick that up and ensure that each group has an opportunity to comment on its experience and the way in which it might need protection.
<P>
I am happy to give an undertaking that the guidance will draw specific attention to the importance of addressing crime and disorder patterns as they affect different ethnic groups. That, together with provisions in other clauses, will make absolutely clear our abhorrence of racial violence and the need to tackle it as being damaging to the whole community as well as to the victims of such violence and other, more specifically targeted, types of offence. I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will accept that that is a strong assurance, which will be backed up specifically in the guidance, and that he will not press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
On amendment No. 338, it is obvious that public consultation during the audit process must be focused on geographical areas smaller than a whole district or borough to build up an effective borough-wide analysis and strategy. I have made that clear to every local authority, police force and conference to which I have spoken in recent months, and I know that it is well accepted. Indeed, much thought is being given to how to do that effectively and locally. The work being done by the University of Salford with the Greater Manchester police and Salford city council is a good example--perhaps the hon. Member for Hallam is not aware of it. Again, guidance will stress the need for partners to find ways to identify such problems.
<P>
Amendment No. 339 makes a good point about the active involvement of the ethnic minority community in this vital work. We are considering which bodies should be required to be part of the consultation process. Race equality councils appear obvious candidates, and other representative groups should be considered. I undertake that that point will be taken on board and will be part of the guidance. For the reasons that I have given, the amendment would blur the clear focus of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased with the specific assurances that the Minister has given. They take us a long way towards achieving our goals and intentions. The specific assurance that the audits will address the patterns among individual ethnic groups deals with amendment No. 337. The key assurances on the nature of the consultation and the way in which the plan will be built up deals with amendments Nos. 338 and 339. Many issues will be dealt with in guidance rather than in the Bill. Given that the Minister gave assurances in Committee, we are confident that those matters will be dealt with in the guidance, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
