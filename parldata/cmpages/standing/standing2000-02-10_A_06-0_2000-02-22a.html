<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 3, line 16, at end insert,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and

<P>
(c) the operation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Authority and the Council'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 225, in clause 87, page 93, line 28, at end insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and

<P>
(c) the operation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Authority and the Council'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendment No. 219, which relates to energy centres, would amend clause 5, and amendment No. 225, which relates to telecommunications centres, would amend clause 87. They would require the regulatory authority to include in its annual report to the Secretary of State an assessment of the operation of the memorandum of understanding between an authority and the relevant consumer council.

<P>
We have already discussed the memorandum of understanding. It is difficult to overemphasise the industry's concern about the fact that competing regulatory authorities, consumer councils and the Secretary of State will clamour for information from utility companies. There is a real danger of duplication and of the expensive absorption of management time.

<P>
The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State are quick to condemn British management, which they see as the source of all Britain's economic ills. This country will never have super-efficient, consumer-focused and innovative management if the Government continue to pile more demands on industry, which is required to fulfil requests for information and to complete a host of Government forms. Managers have to spend hours reading new, complex and often ambiguous regulations with which they have to comply. Those problems are compounded by the requirement to meet duplicate requests for information from Government quangos. Those requests are received at different times, when the relevant files may have been returned to their shelves. The Government quangos and authorities make no effort to co-ordinate their requests for information.

<P>
Increasing demands will also result from the terms of the Competition Act 1998 and from the Director General of Fair Trading. No one questions the Government's motives for seeking to introduce new legislation or for making regulatory demands. We need more competition and a better deal for consumers. However, the method by which the Government are seeking to deliver those objectives—greater regulation—has proved, time and again, and in many countries, to be counterproductive.

<P>
The amendments would minimise those problems by ensuring that the regulatory authority carefully considers how well the memorandum of understanding, which we have seen in draft, is functioning. We should clarify how many complaints have been received from beleaguered utility companies that are seeking to cope with a plethora of competing demands for information.

<P>
I am sure that the Minister could accept the amendment if he were minded to do so. It would demonstrate his understanding of the difficulties that industry fears and would show a sensible and pluralistic approach to the Bill's progress through Committee.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I share the concern of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) to see an effective working relationship between the authority and the council, based on the memorandum of understanding. Where we differ is on the extent to which it is necessary to surround what is intended to be a flexible working relationship between two public sector bodies with a lot of due process. We have confidence that the parties will put in place a satisfactory framework for co-operation between them. They are both public sector bodies, answerable ultimately to Parliament. There will be strong operational and other pressures to make sure that the relationship works.

<P>
The Bill sets out a core minimum requirement on the parties that they must agree a memorandum between them and, once agreement is reached, it must be put on the public record. We do not believe that further statutory provisions are necessary, as they would compound the iniquities of over-prescriptive regulations that the hon. Gentleman sees in everything that the Government do.

<P>
The amendment would amount to an unnecessary over-elaboration of the authority's annual reporting requirement. The aspects that the authority should be required to report on should be restricted to its outputs. In other words, it should report on what it has achieved in the year under review. The operation of the memorandum of understanding does not fall into that category, but is a means to an end, a means by which the authority and the council can more easily fulful their respective functions. It is an important piece of bureaucratic procedure, but it is not a goal in itself.

<P>
If the Government had serious concerns that the memorandum of understanding was not working as effectively as it should, a number of levers could be brought to bear. Principal among those would be the budget-setting process; another would be subsection (2)(d), which gives the Secretary of State a power to ask for

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a report on such other matters as the Secretary of State may from time to time require.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
If there were concerns about the operation of the memorandum of understanding, the Secretary of State could require a report on it to be included in the authority's annual report.

<P>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider whether that reserve power is sufficient to allay his concerns and to accept that the annual report should be seen primarily as an opportunity to focus on outputs rather than on the procedures that help the parties to achieve those outputs. I urge him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister seems happy to burden the private sector with due process but reluctant to impose it on the regulator. The regulations that he is imposing on the private sector will probably diminish its innovation and expansion and its ability to create more growth in the economy. The lack of due process that he wishes to impose on the regulator will encourage it to expand and grow, which will diminish the capacity to generate wealth.

<P>
We should try to stifle the growth and expansion of these organisations and ensure that they do not impose unnecessarily burdensome constraints on the private sector. The Minister said that the memorandum of understanding was not an output of the authority. I believe that it is. How well it functions is very much an output of the regulator; how burdened the industry feels is an output of how well the regulator is functioning. That is why a reporting requirement of that kind should be in the Bill.

<P>
Again, the fact that the Minister is resisting the amendments indicates a lack of understanding of these issues and of the effect that regulators and Government authorities have on the way in which the private sector functions. However, as we shall return to these issues throughout our consideration of the Bill and on the next few groups of amendments, I shall not delay the Committee by pressing the amendment to a vote. It is an important issue, but, to speed the Committee's deliberations, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 3, line 19, leave out from `functions' to end of line 22 and insert

<P>
No. 108, in clause 87, page 93, line 36, at end insert—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(
{**EN**}) a report on implementation of guidance issued under sections 9 and 13.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall begin by outlining the arguments in favour of amendments Nos. 5 and 9 and move on to amendments Nos. 105, 107 and 108 after the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has spoken to them. [
Interruption.] I am sorry, I mean the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker). He did not have a chance to wink at me.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 5 and 9 adjust the list of activities on which the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and the Telecommunications Authority must report annually. Subsection (1)(a), and new section 55 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, which is inserted by clause 87, require GEMA and the Telecommunications Authority to report on their activities during the year. Because both authorities have the principal objective of protecting consumers wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition, they are already under an obligation to provide an account in their annual reports of activities that they have undertaken during the year to promote competition.

<P>
The requirement for GEMA and the Telecommunications Authority to report on developments in the ``promotion of effective competition'' under subsection (2)(a) and section
{**JU**}
55(2)(a) of the Telecommunications Act 1984, which is inserted by clause 87, duplicates the requirement for the authorities to report on activities that they have undertaken during the year—which I have just described—and is therefore unnecessary.

<P>
The Government wish GEMA and the Telecommunications Authority to report more generally on the development of competition in the gas and electricity industries, and in the telecommunications industry. Given the principal objective of each authority to protect the interests of consumers, where appropriate, by promoting effective competition, it is important for the annual report to set a marker as to the development of competition. That will provide the context in which the regulators' actions may be understood. That goal is achieved through amendments Nos. 5 and 9, which will require GEMA and the Telecommunications Authority to report on the development of competition in their respective sectors.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Why do the amendments replace the words ``promotion of effective competition'' with ``developments in competition''?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We believe that reporting will be much clearer if it takes into account the whole process, including the outcomes in so far as the success of the policy is concerned. That is why the word ``promotion'' remains in the other clauses, where it is needed.

<P>
Amendment No. 5 incorporates a technical measure to remove an unnecessary reference to the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989. There are no references to the Telecommunications Act 1984 or the Water Industry Act 1991 in the equivalent provisions for the Telecommunications Authority and the Director General of Water Services.

<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): I want to speak to amendments Nos. 105, 107 and 108.

<P>
The fact that the Government have tabled amendments to this part of the Bill indicates that they have reconsidered it. I find that somewhat worrying, because their amendments do not deal with the effect on social and environmental factors, which are a key element in what the Bill is designed to achieve. The Minister referred to the need to protect the consumer by the promotion of effective competition. I entirely understand that that can be a secure way of protecting the consumer.

<P>
Although competition in an open market can have that effect in many circumstances, we had a philosophical discussion earlier in our deliberations about whether it can always achieve the ends that the Government, and my party, desire, especially in relation to looking after the environment and looking after those consumers who might not benefit from direct, open competition in the way that most consumers would. I repeat the point made a few sittings ago that the interests of consumers complement, rather than oppose, the interests of the environment. There is no long-term benefit to the consumer in having a degraded environment. It is in everyone's interest to get the environmental aspect right.

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Under clauses 9 and 13, the Secretary of State will be required from time to time to issue

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``guidance about the making by the Authority of a contribution towards the attainment of any social or environmental policies set out or referred to in the guidance.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
However, I see no requirement in the Bill for reports on the implementation of that guidance to be published. The amendments would rectify that omission.

<P>
Allowing competition to be the sole arbiter of what is good for the consumer may work against the interests of certain consumers or of the environment. I shall give the Committee an example. If the intention were simply to cut prices, with no other considerations attached, that could lead to an increase in energy consumption, whereas we need to achieve a decrease in the number of cold homes and in fuel poverty. That is not necessarily the same as an increase in fuel consumption. There are other ways of achieving that—for example, through energy efficiency. We must not allow our understandable desire for our constituents to benefit from a cut in price to take precedence over our consideration of the environment.

<P>
Equally, a business consideration for a private utility in the open competition market may require, for example, certain business policies to be adopted to encourage consumers to switch to a particular company, assuming that there is competition in the relevant sector. It may not be in the interests of those companies to look after those whom we would wish to look after: for example, those who do not want to use large quantities of fuel, who are suffering from fuel poverty or who have disabilities or special needs. Those people might require more per head to be spent on them by a private utility company than would the average consumer. In this era of open competition, the Government must be clear and upfront about the measures that they will take to protect those who may be socially disadvantaged by the new regime, and to protect the environment, which could otherwise easily become degraded.

<P>
The amendments relate to an issue that is central to the Government's approach to the Bill. We welcome their reason for introducing the Bill, as I said on Second Reading, but we are worried that it could produce a detrimental spin-off that they have not yet addresses, in terms of its impact on those who are socially disadvantages, or on the environment. I hope that the amendments make it plain that the issue can be addressed, and that the Government will give serious consideration to them, or to some other formulation that would acheive the same end. We must require the private utilities—and, through them, the authority—to make it plain to Members of Parliament and to the wider world what they are doing to protect the environment and socially disadvantaged consumers. I see no requirement in the Bill for that to happen in as upfront a way as the amendments would require. I hope that the Minister will respond seriously to this key issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendments Nos. 5 and 9 remove any reference to the promotion of competition in the requirement for the annual report. It is the final confirmation, if that were needed, that the Government are not interested in the promotion of competition in those industries. They fail to understand the prime importance for the consumer of competition and of delivering lower prices and better services. Instead, they are putting their faith in a greatly expanded regulatory authority and in a series of consumer councils to work in the interests of consumers.

<P>
Which does the Minister think will act in the best interests of the consumer—a well-run company facing fierce competition from other well-run companies offering cheaper and better products, or 400 civil servants sitting at desks firing off questionnaires, writing reports and issuing press release? Will he confirm that the real purpose of the amendments is to remove any reference to promotion of competition from the annual reporting of the authority?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I hope that I am not being too pedantic in my reading of amendment No. 5. Parliament is charged with passing legislation that cannot be misunderstood by the courts. Will the Minister comment on the wording of the proposed new subsections? A lot of commercial activity—I apologise for being somewhat pedantic—involves people using gas. Most compressed gas goes through a pipe, although the amendment does not specify a pipe in the ground. In relation to the distribution or supply of electricity, I want to cite a ridiculous case to make my point. Kebab vans operate in all our constituencies. Those kebab vans used bottled gas—

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have never heard of kebab vans.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister has not lived. Instead, I shall use the example of fish and chip vans, which are universally known throughout the country. I may be subjecting the amendment to a pedantic reading, but my intention is to obtain accuracy. Do the Government intend authorities to monitor the competition and environmental aspects of fish and chip vans? That is a serious point, in terms of energy efficiency. As I read it, such operators would come within the ambit of the amended clause, as would anyone who uses electricity in part of their operations. I am sure that the Government would not want the clause to apply to all such people.

<P>
I want to deal with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Lewes, and to touch on the comments made by my hon. Friend the Minister for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. What should the report tell the public, Parliament, and the Secretary of State? We know that the Government intend the Bill to introduce stealth taxes and environmental and social measures without telling the public how such measures will be funded. The Bill will not say it is a tax; it will already have been added on. In effect, it will be invisible.

<P>
The hon. Member for Lewes is right to say that he wants more and more social and environmental activities to be included in the Bill. Clearly, Liberal Democrat Members would call for that. Conservative Members, however, prefer light touch regulation, with as little social and environmental interference as possible. Whichever route is taken, it is important to know what the consumer is paying for. Many of us were surprised when Ministers rushed to say that under legislation passed by a Conservative Government, each consumer pays about £1.40 or £1.60 a year. Clearly, that is a small sum. The Minister's officials have been asked in previous sittings whether that will rise under the Bill and the answer was yes. When we asked by how much, which was the more interesting question, there was a stony silence. The officials did not want us to have that information too early and did not want to start that hare running because it would be a lot of money.

<P>
Clause 5 refers to the reports that will be given by the authority and what they will include, but does not require it to explain how it is using the licence fee and its ability to take money from generators and other licence-holders for social and environmental purposes. There is no requirement to report on how that is happening. I suspect that the hon. Member for Lewes believes that the mechanism will do some good, but I am not so trusting. I do not believe that it will do any good, but I want to know whether it will or not and what it will cost.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will not remain in his seat as he has when we have discussed earlier amendments, but that he will jump to his feet and tell us what is happening. The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Ms Perham), who is a member of the Committee, said on the Floor of the House today that the Opposition are sad to want to discuss these matters. I notice that she is no longer in her place in the Committee. She has obviously has a word with the Whips and decided that being sad and discussing such matters without a timetable was the right thing to do, but we already know where we intend to get to this afternoon. It is very sad that an hon. Member should be so disinterested on behalf of her constituents that she has absented herself from the Committee after saying on the Floor of the House how terrible it is that we are discussing these matters at all.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I apologise to the hon. Member for Lewes. I did not realise that the amendments that we are discussing were tabled by him and not by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> There is a difference.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> There is a subtle textual difference, as there is between Stendhal and Tolstoy—or Mickey Mouse.

<P>
I have great sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Lewes. I had the good fortune to go to school next to Europe's largest smokeless fuel plant. The smoke landed on us in the Cynon valley and the smokeless fuel went to London. We are paying for that now because that was the core of Britain's energy production. We put the the residue from the coal mines on tips on the mountains, sometimes with tragic consequences. We polluted the air and poisoned the ground, which has still not been cleared because it is enormously expensive to do so. The hon. Gentleman was right to refer to that. We must always ensure that provisions require environmental and social considerations to be taken into account.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 105 and 107 would place on the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council a duty to report on the environmental and social aspects of its work and on the implementation of any policies covered by the statutory guidance on social and environmental matters. Amendment No. 108 would place on the Telecommunications Authority a duty to report on the implementation of policies in the telecommunications statutory guidance on social and environmental matters.

<P>
The Government have always made it clear that the authority should, as a matter of course, report on the social and environmental aspects of its activities. We stated in the environmental and policy appraisal for the Bill that the Government expected all regulators to report annually on all aspects of their performance, including environmental aspects and aspects affecting the potentially disadvantaged as appropriate. I sympathise with the aim of encouraging the authority to report on environmental and social matters, but the amendments are not necessary to achieve the desired outcome. The Government believe that the authorities will, as a matter of course, demonstrate good practice and report on the social and environmental aspects of their activities, without the need for a specific duty that obliges them to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> May I ask a naive question? If the authority is to report on these matters in any case and if the Minister agrees that it should do so, what is his objection to including my amendment in the Bill?
3 pm

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As I have tried to explain on previous aspects of the Bill, whether on the memorandum of understanding or the annual report, we want the regulator to have the flexibility to report as effectively as possible. However, he is accountable to the House, via the Secretary of State. If he does not heed the responsibility to report on environmental and social matters, the levers are there to require them to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am sorry to press the point, but the tone of the Bill is important. When the Bill has completed its Committee stage and received Royal Assent, an aura will surround it.

<P>
The word ``competition'' rightly appears in many places throughout the Bill. The word ``environment'' appears far less often. It is all very well to say that the regulator will report on those matters and that he will be supervised by and accountable to the House, but the Government should make their commitment to the environment clear by writing some of these requirements into the Bill, which the Minister does not seem prepared to do.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will forgive me, but at the start of the proceedings on the Bill we had what appeared to be a Dutch auction to see which political party could provide the lowest energy prices—whether it would be the Conservatives by light-touch regulation or the Minister through his proposals. I am a little concerned about that. I would not regard the Bill as a success if its object were solely to produce low energy prices. Among other things, it should eradicate fuel poverty, which will help those who have difficulty paying bills, but not necessarily in that way. The Government can achieve many of their aims through environmental means, as well as through the competition that the Minister is so keen to promote. There must be a balance between the two.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he is making an intervention, not a speech, and I ask him to draw his comments to a conclusion. He will have an opportunity to make a speech later on this issue, if he wishes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Thank you, Mrs Roe. I was getting carried away by my enthusiasm for the point that I was making. I had almost concluded my remarks.

<P>
I re-emphasise that the tone of the Bill is important, and its emphasis is on competition, not the environment. I hope that he will correct that as we consider the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I take on board the hon. Gentleman's important points. We shall have ample opportunity to discuss the tone of the Bill. However, neither the authorities nor the council should be bound by inflexibility in the way in which they report. The Bill includes the authority's social and environmental functions as well as the implementation of any social or environmental policies set out in the statutory guidance. The amendments simply duplicate what is already provided for in the Bill.

<P>
The kebab vans and chip vans mentioned by the hon. Minister for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) will not be caught by the clause, as I am sure he knows, but it is worth a crack, I suppose. I also hope that those terrifying sounding vans will be kept within the confines of his constituency.

<P>
The hon. Minister for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked why we had replaced promotion of competition with development of competition. The amendment would require the regulator to include in his annual report a survey of developments in competition on the ground, not to establish what he has done to promote competition; that central feature will remain.
 
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Lewis, it is important to bring down prices, but not at the expense of the environment or by socially excluding those who are least able to pay. We should have a more equitable arrangement for establishing the amount that we pay for energy in this country. Energy should be generated, used and transported more efficiently. Ultimately, however, I want people to pay less for it in real terms.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> For the record, I, too, want people to pay less for energy. I also want them to use less and to achieve their energy-use ends.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This is cross-party co-operation in action. Nothing divides the hon. Gentleman and me in this regard.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about the 400 men and women who, as he put it, shuffled paper to impede the progress of our great innovators and captains of industry. What have they been doing for the past eight or nine years? It was the previous Government, whom the hon. Gentleman supported, who put those regulators in place and appointed the 400 or so civil servants who, for the most part, have done a sterling job ensuring that people were not ripped off by big companies when proper markets did not exist.

<P>
Although it is easy to suffer from temporary amnesia, it should be possible to have honest discussions in Committee. The hon. Gentleman should admit that the existing regulatory functions, which we are seeking to simplify—we want to make regulation more consistent and predictable—will reduce the cost of capital for many energy companies, which will make energy cheaper. It ill becomes him to make allegations about people who have done a good job.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am sure that the Minister has good intentions, but the reality is that the Bill will increase the uncertainty of regulation. A host of clauses say that the Secretary of State will issue new guidance, but we have seen no sign of that guidance. We should also consider unlimited fines in that context. Those matters will increase the regulatory risk and the cost of capital. I am sure that the Minister appreciates that the Bill will have that effect. Higher costs will be passed on to the the consumer.

<P>
The Minister asked what had been done during the past 18 years. The regulators were put in place to mimic competition where it did not exist. As competition creeps into those markets, it should be the Government's role to withdraw regulation, not to increase it, as the Bill will do.

<P>
I am concerned about the Minister's comments on the promotion of competition. Government amendment No. 5 would replace the phrase

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``developments in the promotion of competition''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
with a reference to developments in the marketplace. The Government's preferred phrasing should have been in addition to the original phrase. Why do the Government want to remove the requirement on the regulator to report on the promotion of competition? Their approach signals to the regulator that promoting competition is no longer a matter on which he needs to report to the Secretary of State, and should therefore no longer be a priority for him.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The duty to report on developments in competition between persons who are engaged in, or on commercial activities that are connected with, various gas industry activities is worded broadly so as not to limit artificially the scope of the obligation. I hope that that deals with the point that was made by the hon. Member for South Dorset. For example, there may be developments in the competition for metering, which is connected with gas supply.

<P>
For those reasons, I reject amendments Nos. 105, 107 and 108, which are unnecessary and over-prescriptive. I hope that they will not be pressed to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker rose—</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said at the start of this afternoon's sitting that if Committee members wanted to catch my eye, they should rise in their place. It is difficult for me to discern whether they wish to speak, are only thinking about doing so, or are making signals to someone else in the Room.

I do not doubt that the Government believe that the Bill incorporates their commitment to social and environmental ends. However, I should like to see those ends more strongly defined, and I give notice to the Minister that we shall pursue that point continually until we receive satisfactory assurances that it has been properly addressed. In the meantime, I shall not press the amendments to a vote.

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments enable a serious debate to take place over some of the Bill's fundamental principles. Amendments Nos. 123, 124 and 128 relate to clause 5 and the energy sectors. Amendments Nos. 129, 130 and 131 would have the same effect, but relate to clause 87 and the telecommunications sector.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 123 and 130 would require the regulator, in his annual report to the Secretary of State, to include an estimated timetable as to when, if at all, he expects competition in each sector to be sufficient to enable the authority to withdraw from regulating that sector. That goes to the root of the question why the regulator is necessary, which we have already touched on this afternoon. Why have a regulator in these four utility sectors, given that there is no such regulator in most areas of private commerce, other than a general competition regulator for all sectors?

<P>
The proper purpose of a regulator, from a Conservative philosophical perspective, is to provide a proxy for a competitive market in a sector where no competitive market exists. That may be because sufficient relaxation of the legal protected monopoly has not taken place; because, despite the relaxation of the rules, no competition, or too little competition, has emerged; or because a service is a natural monopoly—for example, the utility distribution networks.

<P>
In performing the duty of providing a proxy for competition, the regulator must ensure that consumers are receiving a fair deal and are not being exploited by the monopolist. He must also ensure that the elderly, the disabled, the chronically sick and those in rural areas are protected from such exploitation. When competition is allowed, and subsequently materialises—as in electricity and gas supply and telecommunications—it is appropriate, after a convenient interval, to withdraw the regulator from the sector and let competitive forces deliver the benefits to all consumers.

<P>
That is why we support the new separate licensing arrangements for electricity supply and distribution. There is massive competition in electricity supply, but none in distribution. It therefore makes sense to try to narrow the focus on the monopoly that exists, so that the regulator can withdraw from the segment of electricity supply and confine himself to the distribution sector. That makes perfect sense.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): How does the hon. Gentleman envisage dealing with the monopoly, or dominant, position of a company such as BT, with regard to emerging new technologies that would result in a monopoly if the regulator was not there to provide a proxy for competition, as he put it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> While BT still has 80 per cent. of the domestic market, there is a role for the regulator, but as the rules change and more companies enter the market to compete with existing services, the regulator should eventually withdraw. That is the view of David Edmonds.

<P>
With regard to new services that are provided thorugh innovation and new technology, the telecoms industries are no different from others—for example, software businesses such as Microsoft—in which the competition authorities would seek to provide a remedy to any monopoly that emerged as a result of new technology. There is no need for a specific telecoms regulator because a competition regulator exists to cover all forms of commerce. The purpose of these regulators is to manage the transition from a state monopoly into a fully competitive market.

<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am surprised by the intervention of the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White). I am sure that he remembers that, before the general election, no less a person than the present Prime Minister had a meeting with the chairman of BT. He promised that, in return for BT's wiring up of schools, he would remove the restrictions on BT in relation to sending entertainment down telephone lines, stating that he could remove such regulation because competition was up and running. It was mainly BT that was being regulated.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that observation. To contradict myself slightly, I felt that it was too soon to allow BT to have access to the new market under the previous Administration. It had just emerged from a being a state monopoly, with all the protection, legal and otherwise, that that entailed. It should not have been allowed, at that early stage, to compete freely against new entrants to the market.

<P>
I have tried to summarise the Conservative approach to regulating the utilities, the reason why the regulator was put in place and the role of a regulator in an emerging competitive market. As I have hinted, that view is shared by David Edmonds, the telecoms regulator, who stated in a press release of 18 January 2000:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``At the heart of the strategy is a rolling back of formal regulation where competition is effective and already protects consumers.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is the view of an experienced regulator in one of the four sectors. His press release went on:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As telecoms markets become more competitive, Oftel needs to review its approach to regulation.''

<P>
He concluded by saying:

<P>
``Over-regulation distorts markets and disadvantages consumers. Regulation should be appropriate to the level of competition.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is the Conservative view, and the view shared by the Opposition. However, my reading of the Bill leads me to believe that it is not the Government's view.

<P>
<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a feature of the competitive market is product differentiation? In relation to electricity and gas, where, in his view, does product differentiation come in, apart from in price differences?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady makes a good point, and I shall give the Committee an example of some innovative product differentiation that has emerged in the marketplace. I am not making a personal criticism of Labour Members. However, there is a philosophical different that makes me a Conservative and makes the hon. Lady a supporter of the Labour party. Labour Members do not have the same faith in the private sector, or in the ingenuity of people in a free market environment to innovate and provide new products. There are many examples of innovative products emerging in the utilities sector as competition comes in.

<P>
The Government's approach is different from that of the Conservative party. The Bill contains a new approach to utility regulation that will take it down a completely different route. It is a legitimate approach, especially for a Labour Administration, but we should be in no doubt that it is different from that taken in the years since the first utility privatisation in 1984. The new approach states that competition is all well and good, while asking how one can ensure that, in a fiercely competitive market, the more vulnerable in society will benefit from that competition. That refers especially to those on low incomes, the elderly, the chronically sick and the disabled.

<P>
The Government's argument is that the regulator needs to be kept in place and should continue to regulate, even in a competitive environment, in order to protect the vulnerable. That is a perfectly respectable, well-intentioned argument. It cites the example of those on low incomes who have been forced to install pre-payment meters, perhaps because their payment record was not exemplary. Those meters were considerably more expensive than payment by means of a quarterly bill.

<P>
Page 34 of the Green Paper illustrates how horrifyingly expensive the meters are. It states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A recent Offer study found that these generally range from approximately £9.50 to £27.50 per annum, although one company had a negative charge of around £4.50. The median surcharge is between £14 and £15 per annum.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
That is an unacceptable charge, which harks back to the era when those utilities were state monopolies. I remember when they were all state monopolies. I applied for an electricity account for the first time as a new tenant of a flat in Islington, and was made to pay a £100 deposit. In those days, that was a lot of money.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. White:</B> I am slightly confused by the hon. Gentleman's argument. Debt management policies have changed in the past 20 years, across the whole range of private and public companies. Debt is dealt with on an individual basis, instead of the blanket approach that operated 20 years ago. Why does the hon. Gentleman recognise that in private companies, but not in public companies?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The private sector has done an enormous amount to improve debt management control in the utilities. Much has been done to help people with payment difficulties. Utility companies make extortionate charges for prepayment meters. The charges might reflect the cost of those meters to the companies but, none the less, those charges are too high. Why should people pay an extra £27 a year for their electricity simply because they are poor payers? That is intolerable. It reflects the same old attitude of the utilities when they were state controlled.

<P>
We are considering the one area that has not yet been opened up to competition. Once the companies are fully competitive, they will deal with the problems innovatively. At the moment, they are dealing with a throwback to the old era of utilities, when they were run by the state. In a truly competitive environment, in which companies clamour for every single customer—even those on low incomes with erratic payment records—all customers will be seen as valuable customers. Competition will result in more cost-effective ways of assisting such customers to pay their bills, and a cheaper way to enable those who cannot manage their finances well to pay their bills and stay out of debt. One example—which I hinted at when I responded to the intervention by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs Gilroy)—is the scheme developed by PowerGen and Age Concern, which has produced a brochure entitled ``Better Deals for All Concerned''. That is a new scheme, and does not deal solely with people who are necessarily more vulnerable. PowerGen and Age Concern have realised that many elderly people are a better bet for utility companies in commercial terms, as they have very good payment records. The deal offers lower standing charges, exclusive cold weather rebate, free carbon monoxide detectors, free early warning hypothermia thermometers and free energy efficiency advice. That is one of many innovative products that will come with fierce competition. Utilities are desperate for custom, and will have to develop competitive product differentiation to attain a better share of the market.

<P>
If competition is allowed to flourish without the dead hand of over-regulation, it will continue to dominate. Once competition is fully established, it will lead to innovative products that provide a much better service to the most vulnerable groups than if the regulator had continued to regulate in a fiercely competitive market. Ample evidence exists to prove that, and there are reams of textbooks that explain why.

<P>
None of us is omniscient. It may be that all the experiences in other sectors of the economy and all the theories of economists simply do not apply to the utility sector. I do not claim to be the fount of all knowledge, but if that were the case—if there were no sign of innovative products helping vulnerable customers and they were getting an unacceptable deal—there would be a role for the Government to intervene, but it should be through the Department of Social Security, the Department of Health or the Department for Education and Employment, instead of through a burdensome regulatory framework that is stuck on these industries solely to deal with certain groups in society. That is a much more transparent and democratic way of delivering subsidies or social policies. It enables society to see what subsidies are being paid and to which groups, instead of their being covertly imposed through electricity and gas bills, particularly as those bills are paid according to the usage of fuels. They are not paid, as taxes are, in a progressive way carefully devised by tax experts to enable taxes to be raised in the fairest way possible. I hope that the Committee will accept that that is a fair summary of the difference between our perception of the way in which the regulator should function and the perception of his role in the Bill.

<P>
More difficult to ascertain is the position of the Government. In an invervention on Second Reading, the Secretary of State was asked whether there was still a role for the regulator when the utility sector involved was fully exposed to fierce competition. His response was:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There may be a limited role, but it would depend on the specific circumstances. As a general rule, my personal view is that regulators are not appropriate in those circumstances, and I should much rather have the discipline of an effective market.''—[Official Report, 31 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 793.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Therefore, the Secretary of State seems to be taking the first view of the regulator's purpose, which is the Conservative view, rather than the second view, which the Bill provides. He may be acting as the face of the Prime Minister, presenting to the public the new Labour image, while concealing the fact that the reality is a different and more regulatory old Labour approach—the old belief that new Labour says one thing and does another. On the other hand, it may have been a slip by the Secretary of State when replying to an intervention on Second Reading.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 123 and 130 seek to elicit from the Minister the Government's true intention behind their approach to regulation. Is it the Conservative approach of mimicking competition or the new approach of providing permanent, regulatory protection for consumers in all sectors over and above the general consumer protection legislation of the Fair Trading Act 1973, the Sale of Goods Acts, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the Competition Act 1998, which was introduced by this Government?

<P>
Amendments Nos. 124 and 131 require the regulatory authority's annual report to the Secretary of State to include a regulatory impact assessment of the additional costs imposed on licence holders as a result of the exercise by the authority, the consumer council and the Secretary of State of powers in the Bill, with an assessment of the extent to which those costs will be borne by consumers.

<P>
Anna Bradley, director of the National Consumer Council, has voiced her concern that the tougher penalties in the Bill could end up on customers' bills. The Opposition are worried that the whole paraphernalia of new regulatory powers, which will be implemented by guidance issued to the regulator, who in turn will issue new and revised licence conditions, will be passed on to the consumer. All those extra burdens and costs may be legitimate and worth while, but it is imperative that the Government and the public have a clear understanding of them. We can then make an informed judgment about whether they outweigh the benefits. Without a regulatory impact assessment, we cannot make that informed judgment. The amendments seem perfectly reasonable, therefore, and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively to them.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 128 and 129 require the regulatory authority's annual report to include an assessment of the purpose and justification of any existing regulatory requirements and the extent to which the authority believes that they may no longer be required. We seek a mechanism to get rid of regulations and licence conditions that no longer fulfil a useful purpose, but are merely a costly burden on the companies and their customers.

<P>
When the Secretary of State issues guidance to the regulator and the regulator changes conditions in the licences or otherwise imposes new regulation on utility companies, the objective of the requirement must be clear to all involved. It is imporant that the objective can be measured and a clear assessment made on whether it has been acheived so that consideration can be given to whether the requirement or regulation is still needed.

<P>
The amendments would put in place a mechanism to assess the existing regulatory requirements and I hope that the Minister will respond positively.

<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> We must return to first principles and remind the Committee and especially the Government exactly how we arrived at the present position. The Minister referred to the past 18 years and asked how we could allow 400 people to regulate the utility industries. Parliament often forgets who many people get jobs and keep them for a long time when it legislates.

<P>
The more fundamental question was why a Conservative Government who were intent in privatisation and deregulation put in place so many rules and regulations giving rise to all those regulators. We must remind the Minister and the Government where we started. I did an Industry and Parliament Trust year when the Central Electicity Generating Board was being broken up. Lord Marshall said that that natural monopoly could not be broken, but we demonstrated with a 30 per cent. cut in electricity prices that that was the right thing to do and the Treasury has received far more in tax revenue from dividends and capital gains on shares than it ever received when it owned those businesses outright.

<P>
There was some competition between the generators in that natural monopoly and they operated within a pool system that is being modified by the regulations. The regional electricity companies, which owned the grid company and were all shareholders in it, had a monopoly in their own regions and no one else was allowed to supply customers. The Minister said that 150 staff were required by the electricity regulator but the grid company was sold off some years previously so it was independent and not under the control of the generators or the regional companies—the rise in the value of shares in regional electricity companies was partly a result of that sale. Those regional electricity companies must allow anyone to deliver electricity over the local loop or the local delivery line to people's houses, so there is now competition.

<P>
It may be argued that these are early days for the market and that there may be unfair competition with deals being done behind the scenes. Under the amendments, and now that there is real competition between the various electricity and gas companies—I admit that I do not have the same detailed knowledge of the way in which the gas companies have become competitive—there should come a time when we can say that regulation should be removed.

<P>
Those are important issues. The Whip is telling the Minister not to get up again, because he wants to make progress, but the Minister is listening carefully.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 129 to 131 relate to clause 87, which deals with telecommunications. The Committee will know that I declared an interest in owning some BT shares. I should make a fresh declaration, because yesterday I bought some more BT shares. The Committee will be pleased to know that they have gone up by about 80p since I bought them, so I have a commercial interest.

<P>
I also have some inside knowledge, which I shall declare. For greater accuracy, I asked the Library for a copy of the Chancellor's speech. Having read that, I realised—this is my inside knowledge—that the Chancellor does not have a clue what the regulation of BT is all about and that, eventually, the City would realise that and BT shares would go up again. Therefore, I am glad that I bought some more yesterday. I am being honest and open about it, because no doubt I would be criticised if I were not.

<P>
Let me describe what the Conservatives did when we privatised BT. We were worried about BT's natural monopoly, because only one wire went into everybody's houses, so we devised a mechanism called the duopoly by which we would give a special deal to Cable and Wireless, in which I have already declared an interest in that I own shares in it. That was why BT's shares went down for many years. It would be constrained and Cable and Wireless would be given a special deal so that it could break up BT's monopoly.

<P>
By common consent that had little effect on BT's stranglehold on the local loop. After Cable and Wireless had had its seven years of duopoly, however many it was, we had to reconsider the matter, because it had not broken up BT's monopoly or brought in the competition that we sought. Therefore, a Conservative Government, believing in competition and in making the market work, realised that they had to open up the market completely.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. White:</B> Surely one reason for that was that, in privatisation, the Conservative party concentrated on ownership rather than on liberalisation and on opening up competition. The hon. Gentleman's amendments repeat that, because the Conservative party is concentrating on the dogma of privatisation rather than on opening up competition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman could make a wonderful speech, but I shall not follow him down that route, nor is he accurate. He does not do the Committee a service in stopping the flow, other than to allow me to have a drink of water so that my larynx is better lubricated for further speech.

<P>
The Conservative party decided that the duopoly needed a great deal of work and needed something extra. Again, we decided to open up the market and give new entrants an unfair advantage. BT was enraged that it would be forced to allow people to say, ``I have now signed up one of your customers. I have not provided any wires between me and anybody else, but now that those customers are paying their bills through me, I can obtain a discounted price from BT and pass that on to the consumer.'' We all know what the effect was: it drove prices down. BT's profits, which would have been very high, were constrained, although they still went up. It was still growing the marketplace.

<P>
Then mobile phone systems came into the marketplace. I suspect that that was the most successful launch of a new product since marketing began. It seemed, at first, when we were lugging around those thumping great telephones, that it would perhaps not be an area in which people would make money. We started off with two or three mobile phone operators—there are now four—and with the introduction of third generation mobile there will be five or more. Now, we all carry these cute little phones.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That is small.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> It certainly is. I am not sure how Hansard will report this, but I think that I had better put it away.

<P>
The product has been very successful, which will generate further competition. Many younger people setting up their own homes are not now buying a fixed-link telephone. They each have a mobile phone, and that is the direction in which the market will move. There is now enormous competition in that marketplace.

<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to show that regulation, especially of competition and of quality, will be unnecessary, because that will be a function of the marketplace. Many members of the Committee might think that Vodafone, BT Cellnet, small cable telecoms operators and international operators are controlled by Oftel. They are not. They can set up a service, charge what they like and provide whatever quality service they like to whom they like, because they have a free, open market. They are, in effect, allowed to go out and attack BT's monopoly, and as long as they do not acquire a very high percentage of the traffic in a particular market sector, regulation through Oftel does not apply.

<P>
One of the restrictions on BT's using its local loop was put in place so that it would not be in competition with cable operators bringing in entertainment and telephone services, effectively creating a duplicate local loop. That has been very successful in some areas, and less so in others. There is now a consolidation within the cable industry, giving competition to BT.

<P>
BT is very keen, because it has a number of new products, such as the asymmetric digital subscriber line, which will enable it to broadcast television programmes down its telephone lines. However, it is restricted in that aim, as I said earlier in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I often get tongue-tied when referring to his constitutency, because I want to call it Melcombe Regis. That was the first Regis to be used by royalty for swimming, but it is part of Weymouth.

<P>
The marketplace has become competitive, and BT was promised that, at that point, the Government would remove the restrictions on it. There is nothing in the Bill that resembles the Chancellor's words about BT having its monopoly loop taken away. There is already legislation covering access to the local loop. One can dial a different number and get out now. Number portability is also available. Its non-availability was one of the things stopping people changing to a different operator. The suggestion that we should now introduce more regulation is an anamoly, when the marketplace should be fulfilling that function. It is nonsense.

<P>
According to the original legislation, regulation of BT was to be reviewed in about 2001 or 2003, and the Prime Minister said that that would happen. Conservative Ministers, when questioned before the general election, said that the ban on BT broadcasting entertainment down its telephone lines would be lifted sooner rather than later. The cable industry has consolidated and become highly competitive in the marketplace, and many people now get their telephone along with their entertainment. The mobile phone has also played a role in breaking down the monopoly.

<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Perhaps the regulator still needs to be there to ensure that people are getting access to BT's operations. However, BT should be placed under increasingly less stringent controls, because controls prevent innovation. The company would claim, for example, that if there had been no caps on the way in which ADSL was to operate, it would have arrived more quickly. I suspect that when the Government and the regulator consider the matter, the result will be less regulation. We want to known when, under subsection (2)(e), that will happen.

<P>
This is a good amendment. It does not, like previous amendments, which the Government rejected, involve an abolition after five or 10 years. It simply asks for an estimate of when, if at all, competiiton in each sector is expected to be sufficient to enable the authority to withdraw from regulation.

<P>
Companies in the the UK market want to be able to progress on the assumption that they are in a completely free market sector. Unfortunately, that is not the message that they are currently getting from the Government, especially if they are thinking of going for third generation licences. Such a company, having looked at the Bill, might say, ``We're going to bid and give £1 billion''—I can use the word billion now—``in licence fees to the Treasury. We're going to put massive investment into installing the technology''. The people at the new Oftel will then say, ``Hang on a minute: for environmental reasons, we're not going to have masts any more'', or, ``The masts are going to have to be in a different place'', or, ``For competition reasons, every poor person must have a third generation mobile phone''. Companies should know that the authority can determine that there will be no further need to regulate in a particular sector. That would be a much better situation. The Bill would then send the right signals from the Government to the industry instead of the wrong signals that are currently being sent.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman—The Gordon Gekko of South Dorest—for his short history of privatisation and the many benefits that enlightened regulation have brought to consumers. However, I fundamentally disagree with the final passages of his speech. I believe that the added certainty, transparency and predictability of regulation will be a boon to those who seek to invest in these sectors.

<P>
The Government are entirely committed to encouraging competition as the consumer's best friend in the utilities markets. The primary objective that the Bill gives the authority makes it absolutely clear that competition is to be encouraged whereever appropriate. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State explained the Government's belief that with the advance of competiiton in the utilities sector, the regulator's role will diminish.

<P>
However, arguing that the regulator's role will diminish is not the same as saying that we can preduct that it will ultimately disappear, or even how rapidly it will diminish. Personally speaking, I should like to see regulation disappearing rather more quickly, as perhaps would some of my right hon. and hon. Friends. I believe that consumers, including the less well-off, are best defended through enhanced competition. We have seen that in other sectors and will see it in these regulated sectors.

<P>
In each utility, there will continue to be some sectors where competition is either non-existent or as yet highly imperfect. For example, electricity distribution is likely to remain a monopoly activity for the foreseeable future, while supply, although in theory now fully open to competition, still reflects the historical dominance of the public electricity suppliers. It is imporant to promote competition as the best way
{**JU**}
of protecting consumer interest, but it is equally important not to build in a bias, which would abandon regulation before the market is ready. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would support that.

<P>
We have recently debated a Government amendment that would clarify the obligation of the authority to include in its report an assessment of developments in competition in the relevant markets. If the authority believed that competition had reached the stage at which regulation was not longer desirable in a particular sector, it could say so in that assessment. However, we expect that, at least in some sectors, regulation will continue to be necessary for the foreseeable future. It would be articificial to submit the authority to an obligation to set a timetable for the withdrawal of regulation.

<P>
Similarly, I would expect the annual report to describe areas in which regulatory controls had been relaxed, and to explain why they had been relaxed, and why they had not been relaxed even further. It would be unnecessary to require the authority to go further and identify and justify every regulatory requirement that had not been relaxed. The report will provide the basis on which those who do not feel the authority has gone far enough in loosening the ties can make their arguments. Some will take the opposite view. Consumer representatives might take a different approach to utility companies and regulatory requirements are relaxed.

<P>
While I share the hon. Genteleman's desire for a relaxation of regulatory constraints as competition expands throughout the utility sector, his amendments would do nothing to hasten that process. Instead they would subject the authority to the considerable burden of preparing an entirely arbitrary analysis to no good purpose.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 124 and 131 would require the two authorities to include in each of their annual reports an assessment of the costs of performance of functions under the legislation by the authority, consumer council and Ministers. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who tabled the amendments, purports to be motivated by a desire to minimise regulatory burdens. It is ironic that the principal effect of his amendments would be to saddle the authority with a bureaucratic chore that would do little or nothing to reduce those burdens. Taken together, the arrangements that I have described amount to a comprehensive scheme for keeping the regulatory burden to a minimum. The amendments would result in no significant enhancement; they would divert the energies of the authorities to preparing reports simply for the sake of it. All of us have suffered enough from that, and we should not allow consumers to suffer from it. How will the authorities prepare such reports? Presumably, they will duplicate what is already known, or make demands on licensees for new information. Such reports will be old news, or will impose a regulatory burden for no good reason. I ask the Committee to resist the amendment.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I wish that the Minister were as concerned to protect the utility sector from increased burdens as he is to protect the authority from burdens. Some burdens on the bureaucracy are important—they impose a limit, and force it to assess what it is doing and precisely what effect it has on the private sector. I am especially dismayed that the Minister wants to reject amendments Nos. 123 and 130. The authority should be subject to discipline in assessing the level of competition in the market, and in terms of the timetable for withdrawing completely from regulation. That is a useful recommendation. In view of that, I should like to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>

<P>
To avoid duplication of reporting, the amendment provides for the disapplication of the duty of the Director General of Fair Trading to report on those matters that are covered by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority in its report on the Competition Commission's activities. In that regard, the amendment will replicate the reporting arrangements under current utilities legislation.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments would impose on the regulatory authorities a requirement to request the National Audit Office to investigate and to report on the extent to which the regulatory authority is achieving its objectives in the most cost-effective manner.

<P>
We had an interesting debate this morning that revealed two key issues: first, that Ofgem is refusing to carry out cost estimates of the projects that it intends to adopt, and, secondly that, despite an existing combined staff in Offer and Ofgas of 402 people, Ofgem expects to occupy luxury offices in London that will accommodate 450 people and to maintain offices in Leicester and Glasgow. That is an extravagant use of other people's money, as is the expenditure of £450,000 on refurbishment and £2.9 million a year in rent.

<P>
During our third sitting, we debated Ofgem's forecast expenditure of £64.5 million for 2000–01, compared with the combined spend of Offer and Ofgas of £29.8 million three years earlier. Those figures were first revealed by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) during the Select Committee's deliberations. In response, the Minister said that £13.2 million of the £64.5 million related to costs that were incurred in establishing the new electricity trading arrangements. If £29.8 million is the usual annual running cost, the £64.5 million that is the forecast for 2000–01 constitutes an extra £34.7 million. We should subtract from that figure the £13.2 million for NETA, which leaves £21.5 million extra expenditure in 2000–01 to account for.

<P>
Callum McCarthy said in his evidence to the Select Committee that the extra cost was largely due to redundancy payments to Offer's staff who were unwilling to move from Birmingham to London. According to the Minister, Offer currently employs 252 staff. Let us assume the worst case scenario: that they are all in Birmingham and that they are all leaving, which of course is not the case. If so, £21.5 million should be divided by 252 staff, which gives a redundancy payment of £85,300 per staff member. That is an extraordinarily high figure for redundancy payments—or for relocation costs for those who move to London. If the redundancy payment is not £85,000 per person—I hope to goodness that it is not—that means that Ofgem's running costs are rising significantly faster than inflation.

<P>
When we combine that prima facie evidence of profligacy with the fact revealed this morning that Ofgem has been lobbying Ministers to take out of the Bill any requirement to estimate the cost of its future programme, we can see how the authorities' costs will escalate and that value for money and cost control do not appear to be a high priority of the authorities or of the Government in their stewardship of the public funds that pay for the authorities. Consequently, our proposal for matters to be scrutinised every two years by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee is highly pertinent and eminently sensible. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendments.
4 pm

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> In resisting the amendment, the Minister may wish to tell the Committee how efficient the authority is in terms of the number of people employed and the amount of space that it currently takes up. He may also be able to give us the figures that he did not have this morning—I understand his difficulty in standing in for a colleague who is ill—instead of trying to slip them through.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the number of people coming from Birmingham to London, which I had not picked up. Not one of the 20 members of the Committee comes from anywhere near Birmingham, which shows the Whips' skill. I see the Whip nodding vigorously. Clearly his career is on an upward path.

<P>
It is incredible that we should be asked to accept these clauses with a minimum of debate given the great empire building that is going on and the appalling situation that, in the midlands, people will be sacked or told to get on their bikes and go to the overcrowded south-east. That flows in the wrong direction on 101 different policies that the Government say that they are promoting. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will either agree to an Audit Commission report on both authorities, so that they know that, in two years' time, they will be closely scrutinised, or that he will come clean on the Government's intentions with regard to sacking all those people in Birmingham or shifting them into luxury blocks in the capital.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have nothing to come clean about. As I said this morning, if I had the figures I would give them to the Committee. I shall supply the figures to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and to other members of the Committee.

<P>
Like the hon. Gentleman, we are determined to ensure that the regulatory offices are run as efficiently as possible. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury plans to subject them to independent external efficiency reviews at intervals of about three years, with the first starting later this year. I hope that that goes some way towards allaying Members' concerns.

<P>
My right hon. Friend is keen to ensure that the regulators and the industries that they regulate have a say in the content and format of any review as well as who should undertake it. The reviews would include benchmarking the regulators against one another and against comparable organisations in the United Kingdom and abroad. However, I differ from the hon. Gentleman on whether it is necessary to prescribe in the Bill the intervals between such reviews or the external organisation that should undertake them. Such decisions are an administrative matter. For that reason, unless the hon. Gentleman seeks to withdraw the amendment, I shall ask my hon Friends to resist it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is not a satisfactory response. Again it reveals the complacency that the Government have demonstrated throughout our deliberations in the Committee. The costs that the organisations will absorb will be passed on to the utilities and then to consumers. Members of Parliament are free to refer organisations to the National Audit Office and I am sure that they will do so, especially with the figures that have already been revealed to Ofgem. In view of that, and the Government's keenness to adjourn the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
