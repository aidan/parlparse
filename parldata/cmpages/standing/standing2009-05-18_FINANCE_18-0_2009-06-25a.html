<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000527"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b>
Welcome back to the chair, Mr. Atkinson. There are a couple
of points I wanted to conclude with. The clause simply corrects a
deficiency in the original legislation for remote gaming duty to ensure
that the original policy intentions are delivered.</div>
<a name="09062577000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for South Derbyshire asked about the ability of bingo
clubs to provide terminals, in order to offer, within the club, remote
bingo from operators based in the UK or elsewhere. That is an
interesting but complex area and we will continue to explore it. I
thank my hon. Friend for raising the issue. We will look at it in more
detail, although the social regulation falls under the remit of the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Gambling Commission,
and we will continue to work closely with
them.</div><a name="09062577000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth asked about companies moving
offshore and offering gambling products to UK residents from low-tax
jurisdictions. When we introduced remote gaming duty in 2007, we looked
closely at options for taxing such operators on the basis of the place
of consumption, but concluded at the time that it would be difficult to
ensure compliance with any such regime without co-ordinated
international agreement.</div>
<a name="09062577000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noted
before the Adjournment that the DCMS is soon to conduct a review of
remote gambling legislation in the UK to report to Parliament before
the end of 2009. The review will explore ways to make the system of
gambling regulation in Britain fairer to ensure a more level playing
field between British businesses and their overseas counterparts, and
we will continue to look carefully at that from a tax
perspective.</div><a name="09062577000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
114 removes inconsistencies in legislation to bring remote bingo within
the scope of remote gaming duty. Without it there is a danger that
remote bingo offered from the UK could be left
untaxed.</div><a name="09062577000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): Clause 115 is
purely technical and relates to the meaning of the terms &#147;gaming
machine&#148; and &#147;gaming&#148;. The intention is to amend
the definition of those terms in the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981
so that any cross-references to the definitions in that legislation are
no longer required. Will the Minister clarify that it has no wider
potential impact? If she can assure us of that, we will have no problem
in supporting the clause. Can I also ask her briefly about a written
parliamentary question on the subject of taxation of gaming machines? A
question was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), and the Minister&#146;s
predecessor, the hon. Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher)
said:</div><a name="09062577000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
impact assessment, including an assessment of compatibility with
Hampton principles, will be published alongside the consultation
document on moving gaming machines taxation to a gross profits regime.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000529"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am listening carefully to the hon.
Gentleman and he seems to be straying very wide of the clause, which

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000531"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It may please the Committee to hear that
this is the final clause on gambling taxation in this year&#146;s
Finance Bill. We have had interesting debates in the proceedings that I
have been involved in. The first part of the clause concerns the excise
definition of a gaming machine, the second the definition of gaming. At
present, the definitions read from the VAT law. The clause amends the
Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981, so that it contains statutory
definitions of &#147;gaming machine&#148; and
&#147;gaming&#148;. The change simplifies and clarifies this area
of the gambling tax legislation and I am pleased to confirm that,
beyond the clarification, there will be no impact on the
industry.</div><a name="09062577000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000532"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I must say that I am a little
surprised that the Minister has not risen to introduce clause 116,
which, like clause 117, is on the climate change levy. However, I will
try to explain what clause 116 is all about. I will briefly explain the
climate change levy, because when we come to discuss exactly what has
been changed we must understand the context for that change.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 633</div><a name="09062577000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Normally
the Government love to talk about and defend the climate change levy,
so, as I say, I was slightly surprised by the Minister&#146;s
reluctance to talk about
it.</div><a name="09062577000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000533"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I shall be speaking on
it.</div><a name="09062577000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000534"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister says, from a sedentary position, that
she will be talking about the clause, but I was under the impression
that, when we are debating a clause, normally a Minister would first
seek to defend what the Government are
proposing.</div><a name="09062577000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
climate change levy, as we know, is a tax based on the quantity of a
commodity supplied. The levy is charged on taxable supplies, which are
supplies of what is called a &#147;taxable commodity&#148;, as
defined in the legislation and on which climate change levy is due to
be paid. The definition of a taxable commodity is also found in
paragraph 3 of schedule 6 to the Finance Act 2000. According to that
measure, the following are taxable
commodities:</div><a name="09062577000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
electricity;</div>
<a name="09062577000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
any gas in a gaseous state that is of a kind supplied by a gas
utility;</div>
<a name="09062577000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
any petroleum gas, or other gaseous hydrocarbon, in a liquid
state;</div>
<a name="09062577000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d) coal and
lignite;</div>
<a name="09062577000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">(e) coke, and
semi-coke, of coal or lignite;</div>
<a name="09062577000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">(f) petroleum
coke.&#148;</div><a name="09062577000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
3(3) of that schedule
says:</div><a name="09062577000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Treasury may by regulations provide that a commodity of a description
specified in the regulations is, or is not, a taxable commodity for the
purposes of this
Schedule.&#148;</div><a name="09062577000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will come on to discuss the reduced rate. It is a relief that is
intended to operate for a 10-year transitional period, to allow
businesses to make energy efficiency savings. The 10-year period is a
condition of being given approval by the European Commission under the
state aid rules; there must be a 10-year transitional period for these
energy efficiency savings. Paragraph 44 of schedule 6 to the 2000 Act
makes provision for an 80 per cent. reduction in the levy
for energy-intensive industries that have entered into a negotiated
energy efficiency climate change agreement. Those CCAs will be referred
to in the course of our debates on clauses 116 and 117 and
the relevant
schedule.</div><a name="09062577000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Energy-intensive
users are those who operate a part A process listed in schedule 1 to
the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations
2000, which is Statutory Instrument 2000 No. 1973. In return for the
reduced rate, targets for energy efficiency or emissions reduction are
set. In other words, because of the state aid rules, so long as a
company states over the 10-year period how it will become more energy
efficient, as part of the CCA, at the end of that period it gets a
reduced rate.</div>
<a name="09062577000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until now,
the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been
responsible for classifying a facility as being eligible for the
reduced rate under a CCA. I am assuming that the Department of Energy
and Climate Change is now responsible for making such classifications,
but it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that. At the same
time, however, HMRC is given access to the variation certificates, to
enable verification of the legitimacy of any claims that are made under
the relief. Examples of industries included are: energy industries;
production and processing of metals; the mineral industry; the chemical
industry, and waste management.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column634" />Column number: 634</div><a name="09062577000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 44
of schedule 6 refers to paragraph 45 of the same schedule, which deals
with variations in terms of notices and establishes the power of the
commissioners to make regulations covering whether or not a supply of a
taxable commodity is made to a facility covered by a notice, including
specific provision to determine whether a supply is delivered to a
facility.</div><a name="09062577000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
variation certificate may be issued, which either removes or adds to
the entitlement of a facility covered by a CCA, or amends the period to
which a CCA applies. That is my understanding of the background to
clause 116. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that my
understanding is correct.</div>
<a name="09062577000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
clause 116 itself, which is entitled &#147;Taxable commodities
ineligible for reduced-rate supply.&#148; As I have mentioned, the
reduced rate provided by CCAs is classified as state aid. New community
guidelines on state aid for environmental protection were issued in
2008, and, as I understand it, provide the background to the clause.
The energy product directive 2000/96/EC provides minimum rates unless
the European Commission can be satisfied that additional relief is
proportionate and necessary. It would be helpful if the Minister could
confirm whether the issue under discussion is solely due to that
directive.</div><a name="09062577000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
climate change levy reduced rates for gas and solid fuel are below
those minimum rates, hence the need for the clause. The clause ensures
that the Secretary of State can vary existing certificates to make
eligible taxable commodities ineligible, and vice versa, with the
consent of HM Treasury, and provided that the provision is in line with
the Commission&#146;s state aid rules. Sectors that do not meet the
necessity and proportionality test entitlement to claim the reduced
rate on gas and electricity will be denied relief, thus ensuring
compliance with the state aid
rules.</div><a name="09062577000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thus,
sectors can still be within the rules on a CCA, but can only get the
reduced rate on other taxable commodities, such as electricity. That is
my understanding of the issue, and it would be helpful if the Minister
could confirm that that is the case, and that the issue arises solely
as a result of the European Union directive that became live last
year.</div><a name="09062577000065"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000535"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The new state aid guidelines on
environmental protection were introduced in 2008, as the hon. Gentleman
has said. The guidelines stipulate that if, after the tax reduction,
the tax payable on any taxable commodity is above the minima set out in
the directive on the taxation of energy products, a notification can be
approved without considering new and challenging necessity and
proportionality tests set out in the guidelines. The rates of levy for
all taxable commodities are comfortably above the directive minima, as
are the reduced rates of levy for electricity and liquefied petroleum
gas. However, the reduced rates of levy for solid fuel and gas are
below the
minima.</div><a name="09062577000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Plastics Federation represents a new sector wishing to join the
scheme, but it has been unable to satisfy the Commission that the
reduced rate is necessary to its members. The Department of Energy and
Climate Change estimates that the plastics sector&#146;s entry to the
scheme would provide annual savings of 32,000 tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>against the 2006 baseline. We have therefore looked at
alternative methods of admitting the sector to the scheme.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column635" />Column number: 635</div><a name="09062577000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
discussions of the plastics sector&#146;s application to join the
climate change agreement scheme, the Commission indicated that the UK
could limit aid given through the scheme to those commodities for which
the UK&#146;s reduced rate is above the minimum set out in the
directive on the taxation of energy products. In those circumstances,
the aid would fall within the provisions of a block exemption and could
be introduced without first being subject to scrutiny by the
Commission. The Government therefore intend to limit the
sector&#146;s entitlement to claim the reduced rate of levy to its
use of electricity and liquefied petroleum gas.</div>
<a name="09062577000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
electricity use accounts for around 80 per cent. of the sector&#146;s
energy use, the restriction will still make a significant difference to
the sector&#146;s energy costs. Moreover, despite the restricted
entitlement to the reduced rate, the DECC will not alter the targets
originally negotiated with the plastics sector, which were based on
entitlement to the reduced rate for all taxable commodities. There will
therefore be no weakening of the environmental benefits accruing from
the sector&#146;s membership of the
scheme.</div><a name="09062577000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause enables entitlement to claim the reduced rate of climate change
levy to be restricted to certain taxable commodities. The restriction
will be given in certificates issued by the Secretary of State for
Energy and Climate Change with the agreement of HM Treasury, which I
think answers one of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions. Where no
such restriction is specified, businesses participating in the scheme
will be able to claim the reduced rate on all taxable commodities used
in processes covered by their agreements. Limited entitlement to claim
the reduced rate will therefore be focused on members of the British
Plastics Federation who would otherwise be unable to comply fully with
the state aid rules. The entitlement of other sectors already within
the scheme will be
unaffected.</div><a name="09062577000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will allow businesses in the plastics sector to enter into
climate change agreements, providing relief from the climate change
levy to energy-intensive industry, while at the same time delivering
significant environmental

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000540"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I did. The Minister was not here in the earlier
stages. When we have a simple one or two-line clause introducing a
schedule, the tradition is to debate the two together, so if the
Minister would like to speak to the clause and the schedule, that would
be fine.</div>
<a name="09062577000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000541"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I will broadly introduce the schedule and
will then welcome debate.</div>
<a name="09062577000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The climate
change agreements scheme is a state aid scheme. It was designed to run
for 12 years, until 2013. When the UK notified the scheme as state aid
in 2001, we made that clear to the European Commission. However, in
accordance with the prevailing Community guidelines on state aid for
environmental protection, approval could be given for 10 years only.
Therefore, the Government intend to seek a two-year extension to the
state aid approval before the current approval expires in
2011.</div><a name="09062577000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
scheme is structured around two-year certification periods, within
which are 12-month target periods. If a sector passes its targets, all
facilities within that sector are certified as entitled to pay the
reduced rate for the subsequent two years. If a sector fails to meet
its target, facilities within that sector that also fail their
individual targets lose their right to the levy reduction for the
subsequent two years. Currently, the only consequence of failure, and
therefore incentive not to miss targets, is prospective loss of the
levy reduction.</div>
<a name="09062577000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">A condition
of state aid approval for the scheme in 2001 was that for the last two
years of the 10-year approval&#151;2009-11&#151;the UK must
introduce a mechanism to recover tax from facilities that fail to meet
their targets during the period. The recovery of levy must be
proportional to the missed
targets.</div><a name="09062577000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000542"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="09062577000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000543"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I will not give way. The hon. Gentleman
asked me to introduce the schedule and he will have ample opportunity
to respond.</div>
<a name="09062577000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
requirement reflected the Commission&#146;s concern that the levy
relief for 2011-13, which participants would expect to receive for
meeting targets during the 2010 target period, falls outside the period
of current state aid approval. Consequently, if the UK did not seek, or
was unsuccessful in securing, an extension to the state aid approval
beyond 2011, it would weaken the incentive for businesses to meet their
2010
targets.</div><a name="09062577000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
introduction of the recovery mechanism represents a fundamental change
to the scheme. The Government are introducing the necessary legislation
now to ensure that participating facilities are aware of the new
consequence of missing their targets before those targets are agreed
with the DECC later this year.</div>
<a name="09062577000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 59
introduces a mechanism to enable HM Revenue and Customs to recover the
climate change levy from facilities that fail to meet the agreed
targets and are in sectors that miss their sector targets for the same
period, proportionate to the facility&#146;s extent of shortfall
against their target or targets. I will leave it there and let the hon.
Gentleman come back with his comments and
questions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 637</div><a name="09062577000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000544"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I apologise for trying to
intervene but I was confused about one point. It may be a
misunderstanding, but my information is that we are talking about a
10-year process, which ends in 2011. I think that the Minister said
that it was a 12-year process, also ending in 2011. To rephrase that as
a question: did the process start in 1999 or 2001? We seem to agree
that it ends in 2011.</div>
<a name="09062577000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister says, the measure is being introduced due to state aid rules.
As I understand it, a condition for the Government receiving state aid
approval is that for the last two years of the 10-year approval, a
mechanism must be in place to receive tax from facilities that failed
to meet their target as set out under the particular CCA. The tax is
proportional to the extent that the targets are
missed.</div><a name="09062577000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was of the view that the recovery mechanism applies to certification
schemes beginning on or after 1 April 2009 because the last two years
of the 10-year period run from April 2009 to 31 March 2011. As the
Minister said, the measure will be a further incentive for businesses
to meet their CCA targets because they will incur a financial cost if
they fail to do so. However, she did not mention that it will introduce
a further level of complexity to the administration of the climate
change levy. Businesses will have to consider the potential
implications of this measure when they negotiate their climate change
agreements and energy consumption
targets.</div><a name="09062577000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify whether we are talking about a 10-year or a
12-year period? What consultation was undertaken prior to the
introduction of the measure? What studies have been done of the cost of
the new measure compared with the tax that it is predicted
to
raise?</div><a name="09062577000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000545"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I confirm that climate change agreements
were introduced in 2001. We intended for there to be a 12-year scheme
that ran until 2013, but under the guidelines, approval could be given
for only 10 years. We will seek state aid approval for the final two
years of the scheme because we intended it to go up to 2013. It was
announced in the 2007 pre-Budget report that the Government intend to
extend the climate change agreements scheme until 2017. That, too, is
subject to further state aid approval being
secured.</div><a name="09062577000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall explain how the mechanism will work. The DECC will notify Revenue
and Customs when a facility meets the criteria. Revenue and Customs
will then inform the facility that repayment of the levy is required
and confirm the amount that is
due.</div><a name="09062577000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sector
associations involved in climate change agreements have been consulted
informally by the DECC about the new provision. The sectors accept that
this action, which is taken to ensure that the UK complies with its
state aid obligations, will enable the climate change agreement scheme
to continue, along with the corresponding entitlement to claim the levy
reduction. They understand that, based on performance against targets
in the last target period, the recovery of levy is likely to apply for
a limited number of the 10,000 or so facilities in the
scheme&#151;about a quarter of 1 per cent. There has been no impact
assessment of this measure because the administrative impact on the
voluntary and private sectors and on Government will be
negligible.</div><a name="09062577000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

tax: prescribed landfill site
activities</div><a name="09062577000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="09062577000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000546"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The clause deals with a fairly localised issue
relating to landfill tax. It will introduce changes to landfill tax
legislation from 1 September 2009. The changes originated from the
Court of Appeal&#146;s judgment in the Waste Recycling Group Ltd case
of 2008, commonly known in the industry as the WRG case. The case
related to certain materials that would otherwise have gone to landfill
being used by the site operator to improve the site; for example, to
maintain roads or for daily cover requirements. The court ruled that
such materials were not subject to the landfill tax. In other words,
landfill materials used on the infrastructure of the site were not
subject to the
tax.</div><a name="09062577000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislative changes in the Bill are intended to clarify the law by
restricting the scope of the court decision so that landfill tax will
continue to apply in the majority of circumstances. In other words, an
activity on a landfill site will be subject to landfill tax, and HMRC
has wider powers to make any provision to ensure that such an activity
is subjected to the tax. In fact, under the provision, an order can be
made to vary almost anything except the rate of landfill tax
itself.</div>
<a name="09062577000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
couple of questions from the explanatory notes. I am sure that there is
a perfectly good reason for this, but why the need for the different
introduction dates? Generally, most paragraphs take effect from the
date of Royal Assent, save for paragraphs 10 and 11, which take effect
from 1 September. Is there any basis for that date? Paragraph 17 of the
background notes
says:</div><a name="09062577000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
removal of the requirement that the landfill tax return form is
prescribed in regulations is a matter of administrative convenience
which will bring landfill tax in line with the other environmental
taxes (aggregates levy and climate change
levy).&#148;</div><a name="09062577000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that those two taxes are outside the scope of today&#146;s
discussion, but I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm
whether we are seeing a standardisation measure across a whole
selection of
taxes.</div><a name="09062577000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
support of the proposed legislative changes, HMRC also announced a
consultation exercise, seeking views on the preferred and alternative
options for change, which are aimed at modernising the definition of a
taxable disposal of waste at a landfill site, and the definition of
wastes that should qualify for the lower rate of tax. Interested
parties have been invited to make comments before 24 July
2009.</div>
<a name="09062577000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
the consultation closes in four weeks. I am not asking the Minister to
make a judgment on the results of that consultation, but could she tell
us how the consultation is progressing and how many responses it has
had to date? Will she tell us whether the new rules will bring in a
change in the tax take, what efforts HMRC has made to inform landfill
operators of the nature of the clause, when it will take effect and
what the likely impact will be on the sort of behaviour that gave rise
to the court case in the first
place?</div><a name="09062577000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000547"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Let me provide a bit of background. Landfill
tax is payable each time waste is disposed of at landfill. It is an
environmental tax that seeks to ensure that the full environmental cost
of waste 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>disposal to landfill is reflected in business decision making. Last
year, the Court of Appeal found that where material is received on a
landfill site and put to use on the site, there is no liability to
landfill tax. The Government have accepted that decision and we have
accordingly invited applications for refunds of
tax.</div><a name="09062577000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Waste Recycling Group case means that we are now in a position in which
landfill tax legislation relating to use of waste on site does not
reflect our policy intention. The use of waste at a landfill site is,
in effect, disposal in terms of environmental impact. It is treated as
disposal under environmental protection regulation and, on that basis,
it should be taxed as disposal. However, the WRG judgment means that,
at present, no tax is due. Let me give an example. The use of inert
waste as a protective cover for landfill at the end of the working day
has the same disamenity of lorry movements and noise as the general
landfilling of inert waste. Therefore, it is right that the lower rate
of landfill taxable for inert waste should apply to this use for daily
cover.</div><a name="09062577000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
WRG case means that the Government are receiving less revenue from
landfill tax. We estimate that it will amount to &#163;200 million
over three years if not addressed. The changes introduced by this
schedule will mitigate such revenue losses. However, I stress that this
is a case of mitigating revenue losses and not extending the
application of the
tax.</div><a name="09062577000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are determined that landfill tax should remain robust and a
cornerstone of our policy for reducing the UK&#146;s reliance on
landfill. To that end, the schedule provides powers to make a Treasury
order, prescribing landfill site activities that are taxable in
addition to taxable disposals that are already caught by landfill tax
legislation.</div>
<a name="09062577000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
published a draft of the Treasury order, which we intend to lay
following Royal Assent. It lists eight uses of waste at a landfill site
and they are all uses that do not involve the creation of a tangibly
engineered structure. The order will be subject to approval by the
House within 28 days of it being made. The House will therefore have an
opportunity to debate it in due
course.</div>
<a name="09062577000475"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09062577000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule also seeks to ensure that landfill tax legislation remains
coherent following the WRG judgment by removing redundant provisions.
The exemption from tax of the use of waste for site restoration is
removed because, as a result of the judgment, tax would not in any case
be due. Similarly, tax would not be due in respect of waste for
processing or recovering held in designated areas, often known as
tax-free areas, so the tax-free area provisions are therefore
removed.</div>
<a name="09062577000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
protects HMRC&#146;s access to information on site restoration and
processing and recovering activities at landfill sites. That
information is important to HMRC&#146;s ability to determine whether
a taxable disposal has taken place. The schedule provides powers for
HMRC commissioners to make regulations about the information that is to
be submitted to them. We have published a draft of those regulations,
which, with the Treasury order, have been sent to all registered
landfill tax operators for information and comment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column640" />Column number: 640</div><a name="09062577000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,
the removal of the site restoration exemption and the provisions on
tax-free areas will be directly replaced with requirements to supply
HMRC with similar information to that already required under current
legislation. Landfill site operators are unlikely to see any practical
difference, but, importantly, there will be little or no increase in
the administrative burden.</div>
<a name="09062577000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
the changes that I have described, the schedule makes one minor
provision: it allows the landfill tax return form to be set out in a
public notice rather than in secondary legislation, which brings the
position for landfill tax in line with the other environmental taxes.
It will therefore be easier to make amendments to the return form,
should they be required. The change will have no appreciable impact on
landfill site operators.</div>
<a name="09062577000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
changes will be put in place from 1 September 2009&#151;a time scale
that gives landfill site operators adequate notice, but reflects the
importance of quickly bringing the tax in line with policy
objectives.</div>

Hands:</b> The Exchequer Secretary is being generous in giving
way. She surprised me when she said that &#163;200 million
would be lost over three years. Does that sum relate only to the
company that was at the centre of the court case? I realise that she
cannot disclose the tax paid by particular companies, but it seems a
widespread practice to use landfill materials to improve or change a
site. Am I right in thinking that that practice has been going on

Finance Bill, Mr. Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09062577000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have only
one question for the Minister. The clause amends the Vehicle Excise and
Registration Act 1994 to allow the Secretary of State for Transport to
make regulations compelling the registered keepers of vehicles to
destroy the vehicle registration certificate once they have received an
amended or updated version. My question for the Minister is simple: why
is that in a Finance Bill? It does not seem to be directly a taxation
matter and consequently it sits somewhat strangely in the
Bill.</div><a name="09062577000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000551"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Jenkins</b> (Tamworth) (Lab): I have more than one
question. I am glad that the measure is in the Bill, because at least I
have the opportunity to put a couple of points to my hon.
Friend.</div>
<a name="09062577000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
why we are compelling owners of vehicles to destroy documents, but some
people in this country keep what are called historic vehicles. The
historic vehicle is itself an asset, but the documentation is also an
asset. When a vehicle is sold and ownership is transferred, it adds
value to the vehicle if it was owned by a famous individual, a member
of the Royal family or other such person. The documentation is part and
parcel of the history of the vehicle. Will my hon. Friend give me an
assurance that when a new document has been issued, the owner of the
vehicle can send the old document into the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency where it can be stamped &#147;no longer valid&#148; and
returned to the owner, so that it can be part of the history of the
vehicle?</div>
<a name="09062577000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second
point is that although we say that we need to compel owners to destroy
documents, people will be allowed to register documents online, which
means that there is no requirement to send the documents back to the
DVLA. What assurance can my hon. Friend give me that we will not have a
situation in which two sets of documents refer to one set of vehicle
registration details? Will not such a situation benefit those
individuals in the motor trade&#151;they are thankfully few and far
between&#151;who carry out the process of ringing, whereby, after a
bit of work, two cars are given the same registration number and the
same engine stamped number? We will have provided such individuals with
an extra set of documents because one set has not been destroyed.
Surely, to restrict growth in that trade, it would be far better if we
insisted that those documents be sent back to the DVLA. We could
therefore close the loop and ensure that we have not got two sets of
documents in circulation for one vehicle. I wait for clarification from
my hon. Friend on those two
points.</div><a name="09062577000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000552"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
asked why the measure is in the Finance Bill. The provision relates to
vehicle licences, which are taxpayer records. The change will help to
keep taxpayer records up to date. The purpose of the clause is to grant
the Secretary of State for Transport the power to make regulations
allowing keepers of vehicles to destroy an existing vehicle
registration document once they have received a new one. They are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000555"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause extends agricultural property relief and
woodlands relief to land held anywhere in the European economic area.
There is little in the Budget material or the explanatory notes to the
clause to explain the reason for that. The extension is welcome, and I
do not intend to divide the Committee on clause stand part, but it
would be helpful if the Minister outlined the reason for the clause. We
have been advised that it is probably the result of a formal request
from the European 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column643" />Column number: 643</div>Commission following the European Court&#146;s decision in the Hein
<i class="I">v</i>. Persche case, but I shall be grateful if the Minister
confirms
that.</div><a name="09062577000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
a few years, the European Commission has steadily pressed member states
to eliminate territorial discrimination in estate and gift tax reliefs.
Most case law has involved gifts to charities when the donor is a
taxpayer in one state and the charity is based in another. Hein
<i class="I">v</i>. Persche is a similar case. Until now, whenever it has had a
success, the Commission has issued formal requests to member states,
but the UK has generally resisted them. The clause seems to mark a
shift in
attitude.</div><a name="09062577000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister confirm the reason for the clause, and will he tell the
Committee whether there has been a change in attitude? In the past, did
the UK tend to resist the elimination of territorial discrimination in
estate and gift tax reliefs, whereas now the Government are taking a
different approach? Subject to information on those points, we have no
objection to the

that members of the Committee who own agricultural property or
woodlands in the European economic area and who might be thinking of
dying soon will be interested in the clause. It ensures that if
inheritance tax relating to a property has been paid or was due in the
past six years, relief may be available. It will provide greater
consistency of treatment for inheritance tax reliefs and bring them
more into line with relief for business
property.</div><a name="09062577000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire is right in saying that by
doing this, the Government will meet their obligations under EC law. He
referred to a specific court case, and my understanding is that there
was a reasoned opinion, which we considered at official level. We
believe that it is right to make the changes proposed in the clause and
to ensure that we extend inheritance tax woodlands relief to owners of
property in the EEA. I hope that that clarifies the
matter.</div><a name="09062577000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000557"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000561"></a>Ian

made by the European Commission in this case. We always look at such

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000564"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendments ensure that the legislation
functions as desired in the registration of the charge in all three
Land Registry jurisdictions: England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and
Scotland. The charge is an important anti-avoidance measure related to
the allowances for tax treatment of alternative finance investment
bonds, sometimes referred to as Islamic law compliant bonds, and help
to level the playing field with conventional
products.</div><a name="09062577000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
turning to the details of the amendments, I will say a few words about
Government policy on Islamic finance, which relates to clause 122 and
schedule 61. The Government want everybody, irrespective of
religious or ethical beliefs, to have access to financial products. As
with other high potential growth areas in financial services, the
Government are committed to the UK becoming a global leader in Islamic
finance. We have made significant progress in recent years and the UK
is currently by far the largest western centre for Islamic finance.
More than 20 UK firms offer Islamic products and services&#151;more
than anywhere else in the western world. The UK has five stand-alone
sharia-compliant banks and one stand-alone sharia-compliant insurance
provider. The London stock exchange is one of the premier listing
venues for sharia-compliant products globally, with 18 issuers listing
sukuk on the London stock exchange to date, raising close to
&#163;6.5 billion. We are confident that we will strengthen and
enhance our position in the future, with benefits to all UK
taxpayers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 645</div><a name="09062577000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me comment very briefly on the issue of potential sovereign sukuk. In
November 2008, the Government announced the decision not to proceed
with the issuance of sovereign sukuk at that time. The decision was
driven by a number of factors, mainly that sovereign sukuk would not
have offered value for money owing to the economic conditions in world
financial markets and our debt management policy. I emphasise that that
decision does not reflect diminished Government commitment to Islamic
finance in the UK. Our work, including the measures announced in the
Finance Bill, which I hope we will pass today, will pave the way for
the Islamic finance industry to issue corporate sukuk products as an
alternative source of funding for UK and overseas funds. The Government
will keep the situation with sovereign sukuk under review. Personally,
I would like sovereign sukuk to be issued in the
future.</div><a name="09062577000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000565"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> In Committee on last year&#146;s Finance Bill, we
had a lengthy debate with the then Economic Secretary in which we spoke
a lot about sovereign sukuk. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith
and Fulham and I expressed concern about the cost, compared with other
conventional methods of funding Government debt. The Minister has
referred to the difference in cost. A number of people have said to me
that it would be helpful to those interested in Islamic finance if the
Government provided the data underpinning the argument that it would be
too expensive to use sovereign sukuk. Would he be open-minded about
publishing the
data?</div><a name="09062577000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000566"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am always open-minded when considering
publishing data. The decision that we took and announced in October
last year was based on a number of factors. Clearly, given the
financial climate at the time, issuing sovereign sukuk would
demonstrably have had its difficulties. We did not believe that it
would have offered good value for money. However, we shall continue to
keep that under review, and, as I have indicated, I envisage strong
advantages in the UK issuing sovereign sukuk when circumstances
allow.</div><a name="09062577000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000567"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the Minister tell us about the decision-making
process? Why was a decision taken last October not to do that? Is the
decision not to do something made every month or quarter? How
frequently the decision made? It seems extraordinary to have a
decision-making process not to do something. What sort of policy is he
following?</div><a name="09062577000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000568"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I said that we would keep the matter under view,
as is normal Government
procedure.</div><a name="09062577000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause introduces the legislation in schedule 61 on stamp duty land
tax, capital gains tax and capital allowances relating to alternative
finance investment bonds. It deals with anomalies in the tax treatment
arising between AFIBs backed by land and conventional bonds backed by
land. More specifically, when the transfer of such property forms part
of the arrangements for issuing an AFIB, the transfer could be liable
to stamp duty land tax. However, a conventional bond issued in
essentially the same economic circumstances would not be
liable.</div>
<a name="09062577000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an effort
to level the playing field, stamp duty land tax will not be charged
when an AFIB is issued. The legislation will also remove charges for
tax in respect of capital gains that might arise on the transfer of
property under the same circumstances. The legislation will also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 646</div>ensure that the entity using an AFIB to raise finances will retain its
rights to claim capital allowances relating to property transferred
under the arrangements for issuing the bond. We have consulted quite
extensively with those interested in offering such products, and our
efforts to level the playing field have been widely welcomed by
them.</div><a name="09062577000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
part of the conditions for the relief accorded by the legislation and
to protect Exchequer revenue in the event of default, a charge in
favour of HMRC must be registered against the title of the property
used in the alternative finance bond arrangements. That means that HMRC
has an interest in the property registered with the relevant Land
Registry. The charge will enable it to recover any SDLT and related
interest and penalties that might be due in the event of default or
avoidance. Without the amendments, the legislation would not function
in all the Land Registry regions in relation to the registration of the
charge. The amendments do not increase the scope of the
legislation&#146;s anti-avoidance provisions, but simply mean that
the provisions will work as intended in all three of the Land Registry
regions. I believe that they are uncontroversial, but I hope that my
wider comments on schedule 61 will be of benefit to the
Committee.</div><a name="09062577000168"></a>

<a name="09062577000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial
Secretary and I, along with the hon. Member for Leicester, South, took
part in a panel discussion on Islamic finance at the East London Muslim
Centre a few months ago. There is a broad degree of understanding
across the House about the right approach to Islamic finance and the
importance of it, not just to the Muslim community in this country, who
are able to purchase products that they would not otherwise be able to
obtain, but to the financial services sector.</div>
<a name="09062577000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">When at the
East London Muslim Centre, I remarked that we were within sight of the
Square Mile. A number of investment banks and other businesses have
sharia-compliant products on sale through windows, as well as having
the stand-alone institutions that the Economic Secretary referred to.
It is right to highlight the fact that London is leading the western
world in this area, based not only on the innovation and skills that we
see in the City of London, but the regulatory and tax approach that has
been adopted. The Financial Services Authority has described its
approach
as:</div><a name="09062577000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
obstacles, no special favours&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column647" />Column number: 647</div><a name="09062577000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sharia-compliant
products should therefore be on a level playing field for both tax and
regulation. That sentiment was echoed in the 2008 Treasury document
which
said,</div><a name="09062577000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will not champion Islamic finance over conventional finance, but will
instead strive to create a level playing field between Islamic and
conventional
finance.&#148;</div><a name="09062577000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
support that approach.</div>
<a name="09062577000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the
fourth Finance Bill where these matters have been debated and we have
always sought a degree of consensus. The only area where there has not
been consensus&#151;it is more a matter of emphasis than fundamental
disagreement&#151;is the issue of the sovereign sukuk product, on
which I intervened on the Minister. Last year&#146;s Finance Bill
Committee debated the loose ends around the product when the Government
introduced paving legislation in that Bill to introduce a sovereign
issue. One loose end was cost. Time and again, people who specialise in
the area make the point that it would assist the wider market if there
were a sovereign sukuk issuance. We need to ensure, if people go down
that route, that we fully understand the product and its cost
implications.</div><a name="09062577000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
61 is a development of legislation established over recent years. A
basic tax framework was set out in the Finance Act 2007 so that income
payments on alternative finance and investment bonds are treated as a
tax deductible expense of the payer and income of the recipient and
receive the same tax treatment as interest. However, there were three
outstanding issues. The first was the treatment of the sale of property
and whether that was subject to stamp duty land tax. There would be a
charge on the initial sale to a special purpose vehicle and a further
charge when the special purpose vehicle sold the building back to the
originator. If a conventional bond had been used, no stamp duty land
tax would have been charged on the second purchase.</div>
<a name="09062577000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
outstanding question was whether there is a capital gains tax charge on
that sale to the special purpose vehicle and whether a further charge
would arise on the appreciation in value of a building while it was
being held by special purpose vehicle. Again, the issue and redemption
of a secured conventional bond would not have given rise to that second
charge on disposal. Finally, there was the matter of capital
allowances, which the Minister has referred to. The structure of the
bond gave rise to a number of possible additional tax charges that
would not have occurred on a conventional product. It is right to
ensure that the treatment is the same, not just for the interest but
for all the underlying taxes that might be triggered by one of the
bonds.</div>
<a name="09062577000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the 2008
Budget, the Government announced they would issue a consultation
document on stamp duty land tax. That and the impact assessment
highlighted that the SDLT places an additional barrier to issuers,
compared with the conventional equivalent. That extra charge therefore
puts the structure at a considerable disadvantage relative to
conventional securitisations. The principle behind this year&#146;s
changes is to facilitate the use of AFIBs on real property, so that
those bonds will not incur SDLT, and so that entitlements and capital
allowances will be preserved.</div>

5(9) sets out the quantum of the charge, that being the SDLT that will
be payable, plus interests and penalties, assuming that SDLT is due and
payable but not paid. The inclusion of penalties creates some
uncertainty in determining the amount of the charge, particularly as
the imposition of a penalty and the level at which one might be imposed
are dependent on a number of factors; the penalty is therefore not
easily predicted. The removal of penalties from the quantum of the
charge would not prevent the imposition of penalties in appropriate
situations, so penalties could still be levied, which is important, but
it would pre-empt commercial uncertainty in the operation of
satisfactory charge, which is a condition of
relief.</div><a name="09062577000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the event that SDLT relief is withdrawn, paragraph 7(4) provides for
the amount chargeable to SDLT to be the market value of the interest at
the time of the first transaction. The substitution of market value for
actual consideration normally applies when the purchaser and vendor are
connected. Transactions between non-connected parties are generally
based on actual consideration. It is unclear why the apparently penal
approach of applying market value regardless of the connection has been
adopted. Perhaps the Minister could clarify
that.</div><a name="09062577000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
17 provides for the transfer of an asset by Q to any person other than
P to be treated as a disposal or balancing event in relation to P for
capital allowances purposes. However, if Q transfers the assets to
P&#146;s group member, there should be provision in the legislation
for P and the group transferee to make the same elections for capital
allowances purposes that would be available had a transfer been made by
P directly to another company. I suppose that this is one of those
paragraphs where one has to mind one&#146;s Ps and Qs&#151;I
couldn&#146;t resist that one. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Try harder.&#148;] I will try harder. I only have another two
paragraphs to go, so the possibility of further bad jokes about
schedule 61 is quite
limited.</div><a name="09062577000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
22 sets out an anti-avoidance test for the reliefs provided under the
schedule. We do not have any objections to a test, but will the
Minister consider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column649" />Column number: 649</div>whether there should be a statutory clearance mechanism? The Minister
has already indicated that he is very open-minded in considering these
matters; I want to push him further and ask him to tell us the outcome
of his consideration. Given the sums involved in the issue of the bonds
and the time that goes into such matters, rather than there being some
uncertainty about anti-avoidance measures, it would be helpful if there
was some mechanism to get clearance from HMRC to ensure that it is
happy with the bond. The same sort of logic is used for transactions of
securities or indeed share exchange.</div>
<a name="09062577000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some very detailed points to consider. However, we go back to the
importance of ensuring that there is a level playing field for
alternative finance investment bonds compared to conventional bonds. We
must see whether we can continue to harness the ingenuity of those who
work in the City to maintain the promotion of London as a centre for
Islamic
finance.</div>
<a name="09062577000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000571"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> There has been a widespread welcome for the
actions that the Government have taken previously and in this Finance
Bill with regard to Islamic finance. To quote a partner from Norton
Rose:</div>
<a name="09062577000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
tax changes will give a considerable boost to the UK Islamic Finance
initiative and ensure that in these difficult times alternative sources
of finance will be available in the
UK&#148;.</div><a name="09062577000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could quote a number of other comments. Clearly, people who follow
these matters have been very supportive of what we have been trying to
achieve as a Government and there has been an ongoing process of
discussion and dialogue between policy officials and experts
in this area.</div>
<a name="09062577000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
respond specifically to the comments made by the hon. Member for
Fareham. First, on the point of control and the waiving of rights,
investors can hold as many bonds as they wish, provided that those
bonds do not carry the right of management and control of the bond
assets. The ability to waive the rights of management and control
subsequently would require the agreement of the bond issuer and it
would potentially create two classes of bond, which could relate to
uncertainty among investors, the bond issuer being Q as opposed to P,
who would be the originator, as is explained in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09062577000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC has been
advised that there is no requirement within Islamic law for these bonds
to provide for management and control of the bond assets. If such
rights are then provided, they can open up significant anti-avoidance
possibilities. So we believe that the proposals contained in the Bill
are clear and unambiguous, providing the certainty that is requested by
industry.</div>
<a name="09062577000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">He suggested
some alternative wording. I note that the hon. Gentleman did not table
an amendment, but officials will have noted what he has said. If there
is any way in which the wording of the clause could be improved to make
it clearer we would certainly look at that, although at the moment I
doubt that improving the wording would be possible.</div>
<a name="09062577000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
provides relief for sub-underwriters. It defines an underwriter as
anyone in the context of the offerer of rights under a bond who
will:</div><a name="09062577000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;agree
to make payments of capital under the bond in the event that other
persons do not make those
payments.&#148;</div><a name="09062577000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition includes
sub-underwriters.</div><a name="09062577000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of penalties and why they are included in the charge, I again
want to say that there are significant avoidance risks associated with
this relief, which HMRC 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column650" />Column number: 650</div>has sought to address by introducing the charge as a deterrent to the
abuse of the legislation. The charge provides a security required to
protect Exchequer revenue. In the event of avoidance or in the event of
the conditions of the relief not being complied with, the relief may be
withdrawn. In such circumstances, the charge over the land will ensure
that any tax that is due can be
collected.</div><a name="09062577000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point about market value, the market value rule is again an
anti-avoidance provision, which is intended to ensure that the
arrangements are not used to transfer land to a third party without the
payment of the right amount of stamp duty land tax. Without that rule,
the value of the land could be artificially suppressed and any
subsequent default leading to the withdrawal of relief would result in
SDLT being paid on the suppressed value, which obviously would not be
right.</div>
<a name="09062577000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
anti-avoidance in general and the point about the statutory clearance
mechanism that the hon. Gentleman raised, I can confirm that HMRC
operates some statutory clearance systems. In addition, it operates
non-statutory clearance systems to provide certainty for businesses
operating in the UK. Where there is material uncertainty about the tax
consequences of a transaction or event, businesses can use the service
to obtain written confirmation of HMRC&#146;s view of the application
of tax law to that specific transaction or event. That arrangement will
cover alternative finance investment bonds. I know that some experts
are concerned about statutory clearance, but I hope that my
clarification is of use and that it makes the position very
clear.</div>
<a name="09062577000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I have covered the points raised by the hon. Member for Fareham.
Alternative finance investment bonds are an important area, and it is
right that that market continues to develop. The legislation before us
today will help that to happen.</div>

<a name="09062577000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000572"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I wish to put just a brief question to the
Minister. We have debated in other arenas the transfers of mutuals, but
we have never discussed the impact on taxation of those transfers.
Clearly, these are all enabling powers because regulations will be
made. How far have the Government progressed with the consultation on
these
regulations?</div><a name="09062577000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000573"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Subsection (6), on page 63,
states:</div><a name="09062577000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regulations
under this section are to be made by statutory
instrument.&#148;</div><a name="09062577000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Normally,
it says whether the SI will be passed by the affirmative or the
negative procedure. I do not know whether it is clarified in subsection
(7), but it is usually defined on the first mention of the statutory
instrument. Will the Minister clarify that for us
now?</div><a name="09062577000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000574"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am looking sideways rather than askance to
confirm the answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for
Wellingborough. I am informed that the statutory instrument will be
passed by the negative procedure.</div>
<a name="09062577000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Fareham notes, the clause introduces a power for the
Treasury to make regulations relating to tax consequences on the
transfer of business by mutual societies. Again, the intention is to
ensure, as far as is possible, a level playing field for future mutual
society transfers. The power will have an effect on transfers of
business from 22 April 2009. The precise scope of the regulations is
still under discussion. I cannot be specific about when the regulations
will be introduced, but it will be as soon as possible. We want to
allow mutual societies to take full advantage of the new transfer
rules.</div>
<a name="09062577000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000575"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not quite sure about the timing of the
transfer of Britannia building society to Co-operative Financial
Services. Will there be uncertainty in the tax treatment of that
transfer until the regulations have been
laid?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column652" />Column number: 652</div><a name="09062577000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000576"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b><b class="B"> </b>I do not believe that there is
uncertainty. The clause provides the basis for removing uncertainty
from mutual societies and delivers on our commitment to facilitate
transfers under the Finance Act 2007. As such, we believe that it
should encourage expansion in the sector. That is why we want to see
the clause as part of the Bill. I am happy to consider further the
point that the hon. Gentleman makes about Britannia. Clearly, we do not
want to see any uncertainty. That transfer has been approved by
shareholders. Other building society mergers and takeovers have also
taken place prior to this legislation, and we do not believe that there
is problem with any of
them.</div><a name="09062577000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

clauses 5, 8 and 9 are all in my name, and I hope that they will
provide a stimulating opportunity for the Committee to consider how the
law can be improved to the benefit of many of our constituents. New
clause 5 amends section 230 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions)
Act 2003, which contains the rate for mileage allowance payments. I am
sure that many Committee members will be familiar with these rates, not
least because, as I understand it, they apply to Members of Parliament.
However, the rates are: 40p a mile for a car or van for the first
10,000 miles within a tax year and 25p for any subsequent miles; 24p
for a motorcycle, and 20p for a bicycle. New clause 5 makes two simple
amendments to section 23: to increase the relief rate for cars for the
first 10,000 miles from 40p to 45p a mile, and to insert a requirement
at the end of the section for the Treasury to publish an annual report
assessing the impact of the rate level on community transport scheme
volunteers.</div>

states:</div><a name="09062577000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
tax-free mileage allowances are intended to give tax relief for amounts
that represent fair reimbursement for car
use.&#148;</div><a name="09062577000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a crucial point. There is a tendency, in some minds, to assume that
the rates have been held down as an environmental measure&#151;that
they have been kept at the same level and not had inflation taken into
account because the Government wish to disincentivise people to use
cars, in particular. The HMRC guidance makes it clear that that is not
a motive. There is no environmental dimension to current policy. It is
designed to achieve something perfectly reasonable: it is meant to
reflect the costs of motoring
accurately.</div><a name="09062577000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that everybody accepts that a ceiling is needed, because the
provision could act as a tax avoidance scheme if a large amount of
money was reimbursed for each mile driven. At the same time, there is
recognition that some reimbursement is appropriate. I am not seeking to
change the figure for the mileage over 10,000 miles a year. Most people
accept that there are fixed costs and that the per mile cost of
motoring decreases. One may wish to make the case that the level should
be 8,000 miles or 12,000 miles, or make the case for any other number,
but 10,000 miles is a fairly reasonable amount to set it at before the
rate comes down. Therefore, I have decided to leave that figure where
it is.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column654" />Column number: 654</div><a name="09062577000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only change is an extra 5p on the allowance for the first 10,000 miles.
It is reasonable for those who have to drive for business to be
reimbursed at a fair rate, but, in the next minute or two, I want to
concentrate on people who volunteer their services and also enjoy
relief at the current rate. I shall give a couple of examples; in our
constituencies there are all kinds of voluntary organisations in which
people give up their time to drive people to hospital appointments and
so
on.</div><a name="09062577000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until
recently there was no high-level cancer treatment in Taunton, we are
pleased that there is now a new cancer centre, which provides treatment
in the vast majority of cases, but that is a new service. Before that,
people had to go to Bristol daily for complicated cancer treatment.
Bristol is almost exactly 50 miles from Taunton, so the round trip was
100 miles. Volunteers committed to collecting two or three patients
from different parts of the town, driving them to Bristol, waiting
while they have their treatment and then driving them back to Taunton.
That is extremely generous in terms of time and willingness to incur
costs. Their mileage costs are, rightly, eligible for reimbursement,
but I do not want such people to feel disincentivised to make that
noble gesture on behalf of their community because they feel that the
tax-free allowance on mileage does not accurately reflect the cost
incurred by them.</div>
<a name="09062577000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other volunteers, who may not drive such long distances, but who may,
for example, routinely collect elderly residents and take them
somewhere. It may be that such residents&#146; one opportunity a week
to go out and socialise is to attend a club&#151;we were talking
about bingo this morning&#151;or maybe an informal bingo session in a
village hall. The driver is eligible to be reimbursed, but obviously
cannot be paid more than 40p a mile for the first 10,000 miles because
they would be eligible to pay tax on that mileage.</div>
<a name="09062577000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 45p per
mile level was not arrived at particularly scientifically. It is
difficult because one can make calculations on a number of different
levels. To a large degree, it obviously depends on the value of the car
and the degree to which it is depreciating, on the fuel consumption
and, now that we have differential vehicle exercise duty bandings, it
depends which band the car is in. One could justify all kinds of
different figures. I have used 45p because the level has been at 40p
for many years and all Committee members will accept that the real
costs incurred by motorists are higher now than when the 40p level was
introduced.</div>
<a name="09062577000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000603"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing
this matter to the Committee&#146;s attention. It is regularly
brought up in my constituency, especially with regard to volunteer
drivers. There was a period when the volunteer drivers in my
constituency were unwilling and were really at a financial
disadvantage. I want to clarify whether the hon. Gentleman is
suggesting that the Government look at the matter through the new
clause and perhaps come back with a differential rate that is higher
for volunteers and charity
workers.</div><a name="09062577000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000604"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify my
intentions. The hon. Gentleman is completely right. I do not want to
imply that the motivation of the people I am talking about is
financial. Their commitment is huge and the reimbursement, against the
time they commit, is minute. I do not want people to be disincentivised
from making that sort of commitment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column655" />Column number: 655</div><a name="09062577000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue also applies to businesses and others, particularly in a rural
community. Most of the villages in my constituency have very infrequent
bus services. It would not be feasible for somebody who needs to visit
a number of people who are homebound, for example, to undertake a
series of journeys on regular bus services. Such people are often
required to use their own car as part of their paid job, rather than
one supplied by a company. I am, therefore, talking not just about
volunteers but about people who quite legitimately incur mileage as
part of their work. I do not want them to be penalised
either.</div>
<a name="09062577000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said at
the beginning, there are two purposes to new clause 5. The first is to
increase the rate from 40p to 45p for the reasons that I have set out.
I am quite willing to hear the Minister concede that 45p is not enough.
If she suggests another figure, we shall be willing to listen to that
argument. I can see that there might be a case for a rate of 50p, for
example, but I suggest 45p. The second purpose is to seek a specific
impact assessment for the necessary rate to make sure that community
transport scheme volunteers are not disincentivised in their desire to
serve the people in their area. I hope that new clause will enjoy the
support of the Committee and the
Government.</div>
<a name="09062577000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000605"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I commend the hon.
Gentleman for raising the general issue. We may well hear that there
needs to be a little more thought on how to address it, but I have
certainly had constituents&#151;volunteer drivers&#151;raise the
issue with me. I would want to focus the issue pretty firmly on that
sector. The difficulties that they face in not making their act of
volunteering rather costly to themselves should, of course, be our main
concern. A volunteer car scheme in my area offers a number of services.
It can take someone shopping, to hospital or to a doctor&#146;s
appointment. I represent a rural area, so journeys to hospital are
sometimes lengthy. There is also a community transport service
operating minibuses and larger vehicles. It is a concern. Volunteers
sacrifice a large amount of their time; it is for them to make a
judgment and we are very welcoming of it. However, to add a material
financial penalty, which I have been persuaded could occur in some
instances, is not our intent. Our intent is to encourage volunteers to
offer such services to people. I hope that the Government will at least
give some careful thought to the issue, if not actually concede some
ground on new clause
5.</div><a name="09062577000271"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000606"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I note that the hon. Member for Taunton says that
new clause 5 is the first of three clauses in his name. Of course, the
lead name on all of the new clauses is that of the hon. Member for
Twickenham. There was some excitement on our Benches that he might make
an appearance to speak to the new clauses. I have been a member of the
Committees on the past four Finance Bills, as has the hon. Member for
Twickenham, and I was hoping that we would see his first appearance in
those four
years.</div><a name="09062577000481"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="09062577000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
the hon. Member for South Derbyshire, I welcome new clause 5, as it
enables us to highlight this matter. The hon. Member for Taunton
rightly says that there are two components to the new clause, the first
of which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column656" />Column number: 656</div>would increase the rate under the approved mileage allowance payment
scheme from 40p, which has been the rate since 2002, to 45p. In the
time since 2002, by and large the cost of motoring has gone up. The
cost of motoring varies, of course, depending on what happens with the
price of petrol. The price of petrol was a particularly important issue
a year or so ago, when it was higher, and I received a fair number of
representations about it. Perhaps there is an argument for a fuel duty
stabiliser to reduce the volatility of the cost of fuel. However, we
will not go there
today.</div><a name="09062577000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that in 2007 Ministers promised a review, in discussions with
businesses on the 40p rate and whether it should be changed. However,
nothing in particular came of that. Perhaps the Exchequer Secretary
could tell us whether there are any ongoing discussions on that matter;
it is clearly a matter that must be kept under review. I would also be
interested to know the financial implications of new clause 5. Again, I
hope that she can inform the Committee of those implications.</div>
<a name="09062577000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000607"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> Perhaps I should have
mentioned this point myself, but new clause 5 clearly has financial
implications although it is hard to predict them precisely because
there may be some behavioural change. Having said that, however, there
may be financial implications in not going forward with the new clause.
If volunteers are disincentivised from driving people so that they can
benefit from essential services, there may be an obligation on social
services departments to do that work instead, at a greater
cost.</div>
<a name="09062577000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000608"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> That is a fair point. The figure involved here is
quite difficult to quantify, but there is a legitimate concern about
it.</div>
<a name="09062577000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
element of the new clause is the situation with volunteers. I agree
with the remarks of the hon. Members for Taunton and for South
Derbyshire about the importance of volunteer drivers. As it happens,
this week I was able to invite Mrs. Helen Dean, a volunteer
driver for one of my local charities, the Watford Peace Hospice, to the
MP Heroes tea party, which was held on Tuesday. A number of hon.
Members in the Committee from all parties were able to take part in
that event. Mrs. Dean, like many other volunteers, does
tremendous work in helping charitable organisations. I am sure that all
members of the Committee would unite in saying that without the
contribution of volunteers, charities would find their work much harder
and the demands on elements of the public service would be greater. So
we should acknowledge the contribution of volunteers.</div>
<a name="09062577000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the hon. Member for Taunton for highlighting the matter of
volunteers. Clearly, it would be most unjust if those individuals faced
a financial penalty for their good work; it is right that we look
kindly on such contributions to society. We would be interested to hear
the Government&#146;s response to the new clause, in particular
whether it is workable. None the less, the issue of volunteers is worth
highlighting.</div>
<a name="09062577000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000609"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I should declare an interest at the outset, as I
drive a biofuel car, which is considerably more expensive than a petrol
car and therefore I would benefit from a higher rate if it was
granted.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column657" />Column number: 657</div><a name="09062577000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position of volunteer drivers has been discussed extensively already
and it is a very important matter in my area. I agree with the hon.
Member for Taunton that it is not a question of providing a financial
incentive for volunteer drivers; instead, it is a question of those
volunteers getting back what they lose by doing that type of
driving.</div>
<a name="09062577000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wider
issue is what the Revenue says at the beginning, that the tax-free
mileage allowance should effectively be the cost to the taxpayer of
using their car while on business. That is the purpose of the
allowance. In the past, many years ago, everyone used to have a company
car and there were enormous problems in working out taxable
benefits.</div>
<a name="09062577000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000610"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div>
<a name="09062577000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000611"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I see that the Exchequer Secretary disagrees, but I
am sure that she enjoys her Government car. For most people in
business, there was an attraction in their company providing a car,
which they used privately. However, there was then a problem of taxable
benefit in terms of how much of the petrol use was personal, and the
calculations became extremely complicated. A tax-free mileage allowance
led to habit switch: people bought their own vehicle and reclaimed the
cost of using it on business through the
allowance.</div><a name="09062577000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question now is: has the cost changed? If the cost remains roughly 40p
a mile, that is fine, but have the Government done any research in
conjunction with car organisations, such as the Automobile Association,
on the actual average cost of driving a mile? If the real cost is
something like 70p per mile, the allowance needs to be looked at again.
It cannot be right that the taxpayer does not get reimbursed for the
full cost of using his vehicle while on business. Will the Minister
tell us what information the Government have on the subject? If the
actual cost is considerably greater than the Revenue allows for, that
does not tie up with what the Revenue says is supposed to
happen.</div><a name="09062577000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000612"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I welcome the debate on the new clause,
which has raised some important questions. I will deal with the rate of
the mileage allowance payment first and discuss volunteers later. I do
not want people jumping up and saying, &#147;What about the
volunteers?&#148; when I am talking about the mileage
allowance.</div><a name="09062577000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
allowance is currently calculated at 40p a mile, which is the rate at
which employers can reimburse their employees for using their private
cars for business journeys without that reimbursement being taxed. The
rate is set to reflect broadly the cost of business mileage, including
the costs of fuel, maintenance, depreciation and insurance. Let me make
it absolutely clear that it is not intended to be equivalent to some
overall assessment of the cost of motoring, but to reflect the specific
additional costs of driving businesses journeys in an employee&#146;s
private car. The current rate of approved mileage allowance payments of
40p a mile is a reasonable reflection of those business motoring costs.
Of course, there will be some motorists for whom the rate is either
above or below their actual costs, but over the whole UK car fleet, it
represents a fair and, if anything, generous rate, according to our
calculations.</div><a name="09062577000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
effect of increasing the AMAPs rate would be to provide an incentive to
those employees whose actual costs are less than the proposed 45p a
mile rate to drive further in order to profit from the mileage
reimbursements. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column658" />Column number: 658</div>That is not the purpose of the allowance, and it could lead to an
increase in unnecessary driving and thus to an increase in overall
carbon dioxide emissions, contrary to the Government&#146;s
environmental
objectives.</div><a name="09062577000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been asked why we do not uprate the AMAPs rate in line with the
retail prices index. Since the AMAP was introduced in 2002, some
elements of the overall costs of motoring, such as fuel costs, have
increased, but over the same period capital costs have fallen and the
fuel efficiency of cars has improved. Furthermore, the reduced cost of
fuel per mile driven is taken into account when calculating the overall
costs of business mileage. We review the AMAPs rate annually as part of
the normal Budget cycle, but we have concluded that, as the rates have
to cover a wide variety of drivers and were never intended to reflect
the actual costs of motoring for every car, the present rates are
sufficient to cover the business motoring expenses of most
drivers.</div><a name="09062577000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000613"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): Do the
Government publish the calculations on which their estimate that the
present rate is a fair amount is based? If not, will the Minister
ensure that they are published in future, so that we and our
constituents can see for ourselves that there is a reasonable and
rational basis for the
calculations?</div><a name="09062577000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000614"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I will look into that. I should also like to
point out that the AMAPs rate does not restrict how much employers can
reimburse their employees. Employers remain free to pay their employees
whatever reimbursements they wish, and employers across the country
reimburse their employees for a range of expenses at various different
rates.</div><a name="09062577000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
AMAPs rate merely limits the amount that employers can reimburse
employees tax-free. Without such a limit, employers would be free to
use travel expenses as a form of untaxed remuneration, while paying low
salaries to their employees to avoid paying a fair amount of income tax
and national insurance. There is no justification for increasing the
AMAPs rate as proposed in the new clause, especially at a time when
maintaining sound public finances must be a central fiscal objective
for the
Government.</div><a name="09062577000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to move on to
volunteers&#151;</div><a name="09062577000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000615"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> The hon. Lady mentions the financial cost
of the new clause, but is moving on without having told us what it is.
I would be grateful to be told, as it is easier for her Department to
make an assessment than it is for me. That would surely have a bearing
on Members&#146;
considerations.</div><a name="09062577000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000616"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The estimated cost is &#163;225
million a year.</div>
<a name="09062577000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many hon.
Members spoke about the impact on volunteers. The implication of the
new clause and the comments of many hon. Members is that the current
AMAPs regime may be a barrier to volunteering. Let me place clearly on
the record my appreciation of the voluntary sector and the people who
give up their time to help build a stronger society and are selfless in
their generosity to others. Many hon. Members have spoken about that
this afternoon. The Government would never want to do anything to
undermine that spirit of giving or the wider culture of volunteering.
In particular, we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column659" />Column number: 659</div>have never wished to intervene in reimbursements paid to volunteers,
whose work is highly valued, in order to tax them. It is right that
those who freely give their time and their vehicle to voluntary work
should be able to reclaim their motoring expenses. For that reason,
volunteers are not taxed on payments they receive if they just cover
reasonable expenses.</div>
<a name="09062577000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
convenience, the Government allow voluntary organisations to reimburse
volunteers for mileage driven in the course of their voluntary work at
the statutory AMAPs rate. If they choose to do that, voluntary
organisations need not keep detailed records or produce detailed
evidence to HMRC to show that the reimbursement payments only cover
motoring costs actually incurred. However, using AMAPs in that way is
entirely a matter of choice for voluntary organisations; if they so
wish, they have the option of reimbursing volunteers the precise actual
costs incurred through driving in the course of their voluntary work.
However, full records would have to be kept and produced to HMRC to
ensure that only the actual costs of driving were reimbursed. For
voluntary organisations, therefore, AMAPs are an optional convenience
and I do not think that using that system hinders or impedes the work
of
volunteers.</div><a name="09062577000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000617"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The Minister anticipates the difficulty of the
answer that she has given. The representations that I have had make it
clear that while it is possible to reimburse the actual cost, many
small voluntary organisations find it an uncomfortable experience to
keep records to feed to HMRC, which suggests they would only do that in
extremis.</div>
<a name="09062577000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000618"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I take on board my hon. Friend&#146;s
point, but the facility is there if voluntary organisations are willing
to use it.</div>
<a name="09062577000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000619"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Further to the intervention by the hon. Member for
South Derbyshire, the same thought crossed my mind when the Minister
made her comments. Does she not recognise that the last thing
volunteers want is a big bureaucratic burden? They are giving up their
time and effort; they do not want to be faced by endless form-filling.
That simply does not address the
problem.</div><a name="09062577000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000620"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
but it does not detract from the principle that the facility is there
if they are able to use it. There may be ways the process could be made
easier. Perhaps the voluntary sector could work together to look at how
to do it&#151;perhaps by using a standardised form. There are ongoing
discussions and all taxes are kept under review as an inevitable
process. I re-emphasise that we value the work done by volunteers. I do
not think the new clause will
help.</div><a name="09062577000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000621"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09062577000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000622"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Not at this point. I urge the Committee to
reject the new
clause.</div><a name="09062577000482"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="09062577000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000623"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> Before I respond to the debate, I am happy
to give way to the hon. Member for Wellingborough while the thought is
fresh in his mind.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column660" />Column number: 660</div><a name="09062577000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000624"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> It is disappointing that we are rushing at this
stage of the Bill. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be very
simple to allow volunteer drivers to have an exemption or to make the
rate 60p a mile for them. There would not be any form-filling involved;
it would be a straightforward exemption. There would be no significant
loss of money to the Exchequer and it would be a simple and fair way to
help those drivers. I urge the Minister to take that point on
board.</div>
<a name="09062577000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000625"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am pleased that I gave the hon. Gentleman an
opportunity to make that additional point.</div>
<a name="09062577000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am now in a
slightly weird position, in that I am indirectly seeking to answer for
the Minister, although she might find that reassuring. However, I am
not sure that it would be as simple to have an exemption as the hon.
Gentleman believes, because I suppose that there would have to be some
process for deciding whether the mileage was being claimed for
voluntary driving or for some other form of driving. My preference
would be to stick with the arrangement that I propose in new
clause 5.</div>
<a name="09062577000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000626"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is encouraged by what may
have been a throwaway line by the Minister&#151;that there may be a
simple way in which voluntary organisations might be able to
communicate any variance from the rate to HMRC and that negotiations
with the voluntary sector might yield a mechanism for doing that. I
must say that I am sympathetic with that point in the new clause,
although I am not generally sympathetic to the arguments about business
motoring and providing support for that. My focus is firmly on the
specific issue of volunteer drivers.</div>
<a name="09062577000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000627"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
that point, because I think that it is well meant and I think that
there is a common view in the Committee that we want to do everything
that we can to encourage people to contribute their time in that way.
However, he also made the point earlier that a lot of very small
charities are not just put off by the administrative burden that they
face; they are also slightly frightened off by all the talk about HMRC.
We all know that, of all the officers in a voluntary group, it is
always hardest to find a treasurer, because people are worried about
what the implications may be for them, in particular whether they would
be legally held to account if there were any irregularities even if
they had had the best intentions.</div>
<a name="09062577000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">My fear is
that, even if the rules appeared to HMRC to be fairly straightforward
and were regarded by a company as being straightforward, there would
still be a disincentive for voluntary organisations and individuals who
wished to volunteer their time to go down that path, because they would
fear that they would inadvertently fail to comply with the rules. On
that basis, I think that the system that I propose probably offers the
best way forward.</div>
<a name="09062577000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
hon. Member for South Derbyshire not to be completely dismissive of the
case for people who are acting in a business capacity. As I said
earlier, I am not just talking about people who make lots of journeys
up and down motorways at 70 mph. It is possible that some of those
people, especially if they have a car with low fuel consumption, might
find out that the costs of their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column661" />Column number: 661</div>driving worked out at less than 40p a mile for their first 10,000 miles.
However, there are some people in different circumstances. The example
that I gave was of people in rural communities where there is no
alternative form of transport to the car.</div>
<a name="09062577000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
if someone in a rural community was performing some nursing-type role
and was required to use their own car to go from house to house to
visit people who needed a daily visit to help them to wash or change
their clothes, or for some other form of personal care, that person
might find, especially if they were travelling on rural roads or if
they had to carry equipment and therefore needed a slightly bigger car,
that the cost, in terms of the reimbursement at the rate of 40p a mile,
was not an accurate reflection of the cost that they had
incurred. When I talk about &#147;business&#148;, I do not want the
hon. Gentleman to assume that that I just mean well-paid people driving
very big cars down
motorways.</div><a name="09062577000311"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000628"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Nor did I imagine that the hon. Gentleman meant
that. However, the concern that I have is perhaps the one that the
Minister shares. My focus is on a narrow community of volunteer
drivers, but if the proposed rate was applied generally, there would be
an incentive for drivers to change their behaviour to achieve a
maximisation of the return that they could make tax-free from their
activities. Also, I am not persuaded that the general cost of driving
has risen sufficiently over a period of time to merit a general
increase in the rate.</div>
<a name="09062577000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000629"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> If new clause 5 is accepted in a few
minute&#146;s time, it is possible, I suppose, that somebody who
currently drives 8,000 miles a year as a volunteer may look at the
arrangements and say, &#147;Wait a second. If I drive another 2,000
miles, and I get an extra 5p per mile, that extra &#163;100 a year
would be an incentive to do additional voluntary work.&#148; If that
was the case, we might regard that as &#163;100 well spent. There
might be environmental considerations, because that person&#146;s
extra voluntary activity would potentially lead to a greater amount of
pollution. The point is that the matter is not quite as clear cut as
the hon. Member for South Derbyshire implies and I am not convinced
that an extra 5p a mile would have that much effect on
behaviour.</div>
<a name="09062577000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
set up a straw man when she said that there needed to be some sort of
limit because otherwise people would be paid very low salaries but
incur very high mileage costs. Everybody accepts that there needs to be
some limit. The Minister made the point in order to knock it down. It
has not been made by anyone else. I am sceptical about the estimated
cost that she quoted. In the absence of detailed workings&#151;a
point raised by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness&#151;it
is quite hard to know on what basis those costs were calculated. There
is a potential cost of disincentivising people to undertake either
business or voluntary activity. I am not certain that the Minister has
calculated the potential loss of revenue if such activity is
disincentivised.</div>
<a name="09062577000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis
of all those points, and because our constituents probably think that
we spend a lot of time discussing the issue without seeking to bring it

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000649"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a
Second
time.</div><a name="09062577000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 5 was pretty straightforward, because I think everyone is able
to grasp the difference between 40p a mile and 45p a mile. I am afraid
that new clause 8 is rather less straightforward. It seeks to deal with
what has been an extremely topical issue over the past few months,
namely eligibility for capital gains tax on second
residences.</div>
<a name="09062577000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause does not refer to the practice of which many members of the
public strongly disapprove, which is the very narrow issue of Members
of Parliament designating one property as a second residence in order
to claim their additional costs allowance and designating another
property as a second residence for the purposes of capital gains tax
compliance with HMRC. That is legal, although, people feel that in most
cases it is morally dubious, at best. However, that is not the central
thrust of new clause 8.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column663" />Column number: 663</div><a name="09062577000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
would amend the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. When I looked
into the issue&#151;with some assistance&#151;it proved to be
rather more complicated than it first appeared. The new clause centres
on sections 222 and 223 of the 1992 Act. Section 222
identifies what constitutes the principal residence and what
constitutes other residences for the purpose of eligibility to pay
capital gains tax. The section includes a requirement for a person to
inform HMRC which residence is their principal residence, as well as
other requirements relating to, for example, married couples and the
consistency of their declarations on which residences are designated in
which
category.</div><a name="09062577000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
223 deals with the amount of relief and the rules whereby people can
qualify for it. It is worth bringing one point in particular to the
attention of the Committee, because some Members may not be aware of
it. Under one of the provisions, if a second property is sold within
three years of it becoming a second property, there is no eligibility
for capital gains tax in that period. For example, somebody who has a
single home may want to buy a bigger house in the next street, because
they have an expanding family. They move swiftly to buy the house
before they have sold their existing property, because the house is on
the market and they are happy to pay the asking price. They do not have
the time to make a chain arrangement, but they are fortunate enough to
have enough money to support two mortgages for an interim period. My
understanding is that the original property is not considered to be a
second home for the purposes of eligibility for capital gains tax
during that
period.</div><a name="09062577000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
housing market may be picking up a little, but I think that people in
areas where it is hard to sell properties would feel aggrieved if they
had to pay substantial capital gains tax on a property that was only a
second property in a technical sense, but that had been the family home
until they moved. I understand the argument for having that three-year
period, but many people might think that it is quite a long time;
perhaps we could discuss what is an appropriate period. There is a
problem in that, although the present system is reasonable in the
circumstances that I have just described, it allows quite a lot of
creativity and flexibility where people do not have those sorts of
arrangements and where they own multiple
properties.</div><a name="09062577000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
declare an interest, because I own two properties, but I have not
flipped between the two for the purposes of my additional costs
allowance, and I have never sold a property in my life. I have bought
two, but I have not sold any, so I have never paid capital gains tax on
any property transaction. I hasten to add that, rather than seeking to
avoid it, I have not realised any capital
gain.</div><a name="09062577000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="09062577000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
am I trying to do in the new clause? I am inserting two new paragraphs.
The first is on the subject of the first part of my speech: the
requirements to report to HMRC which property is the main home and
which is the second home. At the moment, the requirements are not
sufficiently prescriptive so there is, therefore, room for doubt and
for people to be caught out unwittingly or to bend the rules in a way
that we would disapprove of.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column664" />Column number: 664</div><a name="09062577000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
section 222(5)(a) requires HMRC to write to the individual to inform
them of the requirement to declare which property is their main
property and, by implication, which is not their main residence for the
purposes of tax. New paragraph (aa) reduces the two-year period to six
months from the date on which the notification from HMRC is received.
People moving house have many concerns&#151;making sure that they
have their council tax and utility bills right and so on&#151;so some
leeway in registering the change of status is reasonable, but two years
is excessive; six months would be sufficient. Under my proposal, for
the first time, HMRC would be obliged to write to the person from whom
it required the information, so people would not be caught out
unwittingly. I can imagine circumstances in which people would not
realise that they were required to submit the information and I would
not wish them to incur the wrath of HMRC
unwittingly.</div>
<a name="09062577000348"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000650"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
congratulate the hon. Gentleman on putting his case pretty clearly. The
rules are couched in that way, first, to avoid added
bureaucracy&#151;he has started down that path and I suspect that we
will hear more about the bureaucratic necessity for an individual or
HMRC to get in touch&#151;and, secondly, to recognise that
people&#146;s lifestyle changes over time, perhaps because of getting
divorced, splitting up and so on, and it is not necessarily easy to say
that that will be within six months or twelve. The three-year rule
means that one does not have to worry about changes in circumstances or
have to investigate an individual&#146;s intention at a particular
time in their life. While perhaps an over-long period for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s liking, a three-year period is clear, and enables
matters to be managed with clarity and with as little bureaucracy as
possible.</div><a name="09062577000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000651"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, because it
allows me to clarify a point that I probably did not explain well
enough the first time. Two separate points are being conflated. One is
the three-year rule, which I mentioned earlier, and the other is the
period in which people are not eligible to pay capital gains tax. I
cited the example of somebody moving within their neighbourhood while
still retaining ownership of the first property for an interim
period.</div><a name="09062577000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that I was making before I gave way was about the two-year period
during which HMRC ought to be notified of which property is the
principal residence. We do not want it to be unclear which property is
the main residence. If it was unclear, there would be an incentive for
the individual to claim that whichever house they were selling and
realising a capital gain on was their principal residence at that
point. Many people would feel that that was unreasonable.</div>
<a name="09062577000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, my new clause states that the individual must inform
HMRC which property is the principal residence, unlike the current
wording, which seems to say that the individual may inform
HMRC&#151;there is ambiguity. Trying to frame the new clause has been
difficult because the current rules are somewhat ambiguous. Trying to
amend a rather fluid and hard-to-pin-down arrangement is not easy. That
fluidity and the difficulty in pinning it down make the rules open to
abuse and, if I am being generous, broad interpretation, particularly
by accountants, which means that the spirit of the rules can be
infringed, even while abiding by the letter of the
law.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column665" />Column number: 665</div><a name="09062577000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000652"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> As Conservative Members are not whipped in Committee
these days, it is always interesting to hear an argument before making
a decision. I am not sure what nut the hon. Gentleman is trying to
crack. I have experience of the previous recession, which was not as
bad as the one we are in now. The house in which I was living fell
considerably in value. When I had to move to a different part of the
country, I could not afford to sell the first house at a loss, so I had
to wait for it to come back up in value. Under the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposal, I would have been penalised for
that.</div><a name="09062577000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000653"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> There are two sections, both of which I will
explain. If I do not explain the whole picture, there is a danger that
someone as open-minded as the hon. Gentleman may not fully realise the
merits of my case. I do not say that in a sneering way at all. The hon.
Gentleman is one of the few Members whose vote is unpredictable on this
Committee. Many Members could ask themselves why they bother to turn up
at all because they vote as instructed. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.]</i> I
will not be tempted down this route. I suspect that few members of the
Committee find slightly laughable the ritual of one side voting one way
and the other side voting the other. As I say, the hon. Member for
Wellingborough is commendably open-minded in many of his
views.</div><a name="09062577000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that people&#146;s circumstances change, that they get jobs
in different parts of the country, and that they get divorced and
married. All those changes happen all the time. We all know that the
rules are trying to establish that one&#146;s principal residence is
not eligible for capital gains tax, but subsequent residences are. If
that were not the case, one could, as an investment decision, accrue
many different properties and not be eligible for capital gains tax on
them when they are sold, whereas that individual would be eligible for
capital gains tax if they had chosen to invest in something other than
property.</div>
<a name="09062577000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know what
we are trying to achieve. In each individual case, one can recognise,
in most instances, what is an appropriate interpretation of the law and
where the rules are being bent. The difficulty is trying to frame in
legislation&#151;no doubt the Government have faced this
difficulty&#151;the wording that prevents people from treating the
law in the opposite way to which it was intended but does not
inadvertently trap people whose behaviour is entirely proper and in
line with that just mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. That is the
difficulty that I face. I hope that everyone is facing it because we
all need the incentive to get this
right.</div><a name="09062577000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first part of the new clause is the requirement for people to inform
HMRC which is their principal residence. Without that information, it
is impossible to draw any further conclusions. That is what I was
talking about a moment ago. The second part is to see how we can
tighten up the rules on what has now widely become known as
&#147;flipping&#148;. At the moment, when someone redesignates a
property, they can claim that for a three-year period, they are not
eligible for capital gains tax. That point came up earlier when I
talked about the safeguard that is in place for somebody who has moved
within their neighbourhood from what is essentially one first home to
another first home, but who, for an interim period, owned two
properties. The safeguard, which prevents that person from being
eligible for capital gains tax, means that individuals can
&#147;flip&#148;&#151;to use the new jargon&#151;the residence
and, therefore, qualify for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column666" />Column number: 666</div>the three-year exemption. They qualify even though the property was
always their second property. They are being advised by accountants
that that is an appropriate way to avoid capital gains tax, or a
portion of it, on what was always a second property. That is hard to
define. I propose that if people flip to a property and then flip back
to the principal property, they would not then be eligible for the
three-year period. It is still difficult because somebody with multiple
properties who sells them on a rotating basis might be able to stay one
step ahead of the tax man in terms of their tax liabilities. It is
difficult to frame a law that would stop them from doing that. However,
they should not be able to flip from their main property to the second
one and back again in a way that enables them to qualify for a benefit
that social attitudes would deem to be inappropriate and against the
spirit of the
law.</div><a name="09062577000357"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000654"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Although I admire what the hon. Gentleman is trying
to achieve&#151;albeit with the caveats that I mentioned
earlier&#151;has he not summed up the problem? He might be able to
stop somebody who has two properties from being able to flip, but he
cannot stop the serial property owner who, through a buy-to-let
operation, can flip through several properties. Such people just have
to ensure that in any three-year period they do not designate the same
property as the primary property more than once. The proposal is fine
for the average person, but it could be used as a charter for
buy-to-let operators and allow them to avoid
tax.</div><a name="09062577000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000655"></a>Mr.

people the hon. Gentleman describes avoid tax at the moment so I would
not be making the situation any worse. This is a probing

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000657"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> It is a probing new clause. I readily accept that
getting the detail of such a proposal right would be difficult for
anybody in Opposition, or indeed for the Government. However, it would
be negligent of us not to explore this issue to see if the law can be
improved.</div><a name="09062577000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is similar to the inheritance tax argument with which we are
familiar. The people who plan ahead and employ decent accountants can
avoid paying a tax that those who do not plan ahead and do not use
accountants do not avoid paying, even if their circumstances are the
same. People think that unreasonable. It does not require a
particularly sophisticated accountant to advise people to redesignate
their properties to reduce substantially their capital gains tax
liability in a way that goes against the spirit of the law. Such
revenue is lost to the Exchequer and could have been used on debt
repayment, schools, hospitals, police and so
on.</div><a name="09062577000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
who own one property or who do not own any property think it reasonable
that capital gains tax should be paid on the sale of a second property.
They feel that the system that allows people to pick and choose whether
they pay tax on a large proportion of their capital gain on a second
property is unreasonable and ought to be more effectively policed. That
is why we tabled the new clause. This is an important subject and I
look forward to the contributions of the Minister and other hon.
Members.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column667" />Column number: 667</div><a name="09062577000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000658"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> This has been an interesting and entertaining
debate so far. I congratulate the hon. Member for Taunton on tabling
the amendment and on floating an interesting
suggestion.</div><a name="09062577000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have three broad areas of concern. First, some of the consequences of
the proposal might not have been fully thought through. It sounds as
though the hon. Gentleman would not disagree with that. Secondly, it
will increase bureaucracy, particularly because of the number of
additional letters. It sounds as though HMRC would have to send out a
letter on the completion of any property transaction. If the problem is
as big as he suggests&#151;and perhaps it is&#151;that might be
reasonable. However, we should not underestimate the bureaucracy
involved. At the same time, there would be an obligation for people to
write to HMRC to detail any change in what they perceive as their
residence. That might also be reasonable, but I fear that we would be
adding a great deal of bureaucracy without knowing the size of the nut
that we are trying to
crack.</div><a name="09062577000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also have a couple of concerns about the drafting, but I am getting
more and more confused. I have spoken to two bodies that have concerns
about the new clause, but they cannot agree between them what the
problems are. Therefore, I will not discuss the drafting because it is
likely to make us even more
confused.</div><a name="09062577000484"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="09062577000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are broadly sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention to
prevent the flipping of properties for capital gains tax purposes, seen
most notably recently in the case of Members of Parliament. However,
the measure will affect many thousands of people&#151;it is hard to
tell how many&#151;beyond MPs. Care is needed when making tax policy
such as this. We would want to see far more extensive study of the
impact of the proposed changes before we felt able to give our support.
The status quo, as he pointed out, provides protection for those
selling properties where, for example, they have ended up owning two
properties at the same time due to a delay in the sale. It seems
reasonable to have some protection for those who end up holding both
properties, especially in the current climate.</div>
<a name="09062577000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Wellingborough referred to the last recession. In
the current climate there is likely to be a fair number of stalled
property chains where people have ended up having two principal or
primary residences. I do not think that the new clause is intended for
them. It also might penalise people who end up selling homes or their
principal or primary residence twice in the same year. I do not believe
that that happens terribly often but I am sure it does happen, and we
would not want to penalise that. We have sympathy with the motives and
intention but want to see more study. We are not actively able to
support the new clause at the moment but would like to see more
intensive study carried out by HMRC, if this is perceived as a serious
and widespread
problem.</div><a name="09062577000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000659"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for
Taunton on so ably and frequently deputising for the hon. Member for
Twickenham who is the lead name for the new clause. I am sure that it
is not his fault that the drafting is technically deficient. For the
record, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham made some
comments about this, the new clause refers to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column668" />Column number: 668</div>part 9 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 when part
7 is intended. It also purports to amend a provision&#151;section
222(5)(b) of the Act&#151;that was repealed in
1996.</div><a name="09062577000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000660"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister because I was also told that.
However, I went back to the new clause and it clearly states part 7, it
does not mention paragraph (b) but does mention paragraph (aa). Will he
clarify? I was given the same information&#151;that there was a
drafting error&#151;but, when I checked, there did not seem to be
one.</div>
<a name="09062577000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000661"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am certainly advised that the new clause is
technically deficient along those lines. I will investigate again and
see whether that matter has been cleared up. I hope to go on to explain
the other reasons that the new clause does not work as
intended.</div><a name="09062577000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000662"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Is the Minister saying that he did not check that
himself?</div><a name="09062577000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000663"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am beginning to wish I had never introduced
this part of my speech. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> Let me make a
bit of
progress.</div><a name="09062577000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000664"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am concerned because the Minister, in
explanation, criticised the new clause for mentioning part 9 of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. It is clear in front of us that
there is no mention of part 9. The new clause does in fact refer to
part 7, which is the point I was making. It appears to be drafted
correctly. Where does it say part
9?</div><a name="09062577000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000665"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I stand corrected on that point. Perhaps the new
clause has gone through modifications. There are other reasons why it
should not become part of the Bill and I hope to describe
them.</div><a name="09062577000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do, however, welcome the opportunity to discuss private residence
relief in the capital gains system as an issue more generally. It might
be helpful briefly to outline to members of the Committee how the
relief operates, although I think that a number of our colleagues
understand it perfectly
well<i class="I">.</i></div><a name="09062577000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
general, individuals who own more than one residence pay capital gains
tax on their second home, but not on their main residence. They can
choose which is their main residence and notify HMRC. Any residence
that has been at some point a main residence receives relief from
capital gains tax for the final three years of ownership.</div>
<a name="09062577000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relief
has been in place since the introduction of capital gains tax in 1965.
The only significant change to it has been the extension of the relief
for the final period of ownership of a property which has at any point
been a main residence. That period was initially one year. It was
extended during housing market downturns from one year to two years in
1980, and from two years to the current three years in
1991.</div><a name="09062577000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
system currently has a number of features. It is straightforward to
operate, as it allows individuals to take the initiative in notifying
HMRC of any change of their main residence. It allows people to move
residence as and when they see fit, and it also means that individuals
who move houses during a housing market downturn&#151;for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column669" />Column number: 669</div>example, to find work&#151;but have difficulty in selling their old
house in a reasonable period of time, do not have to pay a capital
gains tax charge. However, as hon. Members have pointed out, the very
flexibility of the system has meant that some people have been able to
reduce their CGT liability by flipping their nomination of main
residence between different properties.</div>
<a name="09062577000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause seeks to address some of the perceived problems with the current
system, and I have sympathy with the aims of the new clause, even
though I do not believe that it achieves those aims. First, it would
require HMRC to contact all those who have more than one residence to
tell them to nominate their main one. Although I can see that that
might reduce the scope for abuse in some cases, it would mean
practically that HMRC would need to monitor the movements of every
person in the country who owned more than one property, including
landlords of buy-to-let property, to check where they were spending
their time. That would be administratively impossible. HMRC has neither
the power nor the resources to carry out such a task. It is also,
arguably, far too intrusive into people&#146;s
lives.</div><a name="09062577000380"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000666"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> I take the Economic
Secretary&#146;s point that what constitutes a main property can be
hard to define&#151;and Members of Parliament may have discovered
that&#151;and even harder to police. However, although people would
accept that point, they may still have reservations about a situation
where someone&#146;s circumstances have not changed, but they still
flip the designation because of tax liability considerations, not
because they are suddenly spending more nights in one property than
they were before. If they are going to designate a main property, they
should, many people believe, stick with that as their designation
unless there is some reason to change it to some other
designation.</div><a name="09062577000381"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000667"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Again, I have sympathy with what the hon.
Gentleman says, but there are real practical difficulties involved in
establishing main residence.</div>
<a name="09062577000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000668"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Perhaps HMRC might consider contracting out such an
enforcement process and the checking mechanisms that are required to a
media organisation with experience in this
area<i class="I">.</i></div><a name="09062577000383"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000669"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will not pursue the line of argument suggested
by my hon. Friend. The new clause would, as the hon. Member for Taunton
recognises, oblige everyone who owned more than one home to nominate
their main residence within six months of HMRC contacting them to ask
for a nomination. The new clause does not specify a time limit within
which HMRC is to contact home owners, and so set off the process, so it
could have the effect of extending the total period for which a
nomination may be made. It would also be an additional burden on home
owners who at present, as has been pointed out in the debate,
&#147;may&#148; contact HMRC, but are not obliged to do so when
there are changes in the homes that they own and occupy. I can see
there are arguments for reducing the period during which a change in
nomination can be made. However, new clause 8 on its own would not deal
with the problems; it would need to be part of a much wider package of
measures to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column670" />Column number: 670</div><a name="09062577000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
reason why I think that new clause 8 does not work is that it would
deny any relief from capital gains tax for someone who moved their
nomination of main residence to another property and then moved it back
to the first property. Again, I can see the problem that the hon.
Member for Taunton is trying to solve, but that approach would capture
some people who have moved residence for reasons other than to reduce
their CGT liability.</div>
<a name="09062577000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">For instance,
suppose that someone occupies two homes and has nominated the home
where they spend most of their time as their main residence. They then
move away to work and as a result their second home becomes, in fact,
their main residence and they vary their nomination accordingly. If,
because of a change in circumstances, they then shifted their main
residence back to their first home, a switch of nomination to reflect
that reality would mean that they would receive no relief from CGT on
either of the properties under the new clause.</div>
<a name="09062577000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
there are some real difficulties in the detail of what the hon.
Gentleman is proposing. However, he raises some important points about
the abuse of private residence relief, which need further
consideration. This is a complex issue, but the new clause would create
the type of difficulties that I have outlined. On that basis, I ask him
to withdraw the new clause.</div>
<a name="09062577000387"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000670"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> I never pretended that new
clause 8 was a perfect blueprint for administering this
difficult area of taxation and I am grateful to everyone who assisted
me in making it as close to perfection as it ended up being; if it had
been left to me, it might have been a lot further away from perfection.
This is a difficult area and trying to amend all the previous Acts of
Parliament that we are discussing is obviously difficult, for Ministers
as well as for other MPs.</div>
<a name="09062577000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
think that the point that I sought to make remains a valid one. That
point is that people should expect to pay CGT on the capital gains on
properties beyond their first property. Furthermore, a system that is
as open to avoidance as the current system is becomes discredited. As a
result, the people who pay CGT are, as often as not, the people who are
least effective at working their way around the system. Compare their
position with that of people who are least eligible to pay the tax. If
that happens it is unfortunate, because it discredits the tax system as
a whole and people feel that they are not being treated
fairly.</div>
<a name="09062577000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I was
seeking to do in new clause 8 was to suggest a possible improvement. I
hope that the Minister and other members of the Committee will see
merit in exploring this area further, to see where the law can be
improved. However, having had a useful conversation, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000671"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a
Second time.</div>
<a name="09062577000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stand in
yet again for my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham, who is busy
advising any politician who wishes to listen on the right way forward
for the national economy and indeed the global economy. I am grateful
to have the opportunity to lead on some of these matters in his
stead.</div><a name="09062577000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
subject of new clause 9 is furnished holiday lettings. It is a subject
that has probably been raised by constituents and other interested
parties with a number of members of the Committee. Having said that, I
suppose that I have a particular interest because I represent a
constituency in south-west England and the type of properties that we
are discussing in new clause 9 are more typically found in that part of
the country than in any other part of the country, or so I am led to
believe.</div><a name="09062577000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 9 is widely drawn. It simply requires the Chancellor to publish
a report before the pre-Budget report that would discuss the tax
situation of commercially-let furnished holiday accommodation. The
Government would then be obliged to arrange for that report to be
debated in the House of Commons. I am seeking to draw the Government
out on the issue and to enable Parliament to discuss it in a more
thorough
fashion.</div><a name="09062577000485"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="09062577000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
of my reason for doing that is the amount of legislation affected by
the measure. The people who assisted me found at least seven separate
items of legislation that would need to be amended, and there may be
others. I have sought to avoid the pitfall of trying to make all of
those changes in a way that may not be wholly accurate. Instead, I have
asked the Government to look at the issue afresh.</div>
<a name="09062577000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will start
with the background and then get on to the nub of what is not a
particularly complicated issue. A furnished holiday letting is a
letting where the property is furnished and the letting meets three
qualifying tests. The first is that it is available for holiday letting
to the public on a commercial basis for 140 days or more during a
financial year&#151;four to five months. A person cannot just let a
property out to a friend for a week or a fortnight in August; it needs
to be for an extended period. It may be that they live in, for example,
a cottage by the seaside in Devon during the winter, but derive revenue
from letting the cottage out from April to September, when the demand
is
greatest.</div><a name="09062577000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second criterion is that the property has to be let commercially for 70
days or more&#151;so it has to be available for 140 days or more and
let for 70 days or more. The third criterion is that it is not occupied
for more than 31 days by the same person in any period of seven months.
We are not talking about a property with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column672" />Column number: 672</div>a long-term rental arrangement with one party. That one-month period
seems reasonable. Anything beyond that ceases to be a conventional
holiday letting. That condition ensures that long-term lets do not
qualify. In the case of multiple units, such as holiday park cabins,
only the first and the third rule&#151;available for 140 days or more
and not let to the same individual for more than 31 days&#151;need to
be met by each unit.</div>
<a name="09062577000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
benefits accrue from having those arrangements for furnished holiday
letting. The first is that people who own that category of property can
qualify for capital allowances&#151;for the cost of the furniture and
fixtures&#151;for which they would not otherwise qualify, and they
can offset losses against their overall income and receive various tax
reliefs for which they might not otherwise qualify.</div>
<a name="09062577000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
that I have brought the matter to the attention of the Committee now is
that in the Budget the Chancellor announced that the current
rules&#151;the ones that I have just described&#151;are
incompatible with EU
law.</div><a name="09062577000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000672"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b>
Ah.</div><a name="09062577000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000673"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I have a feeling that this afternoon is going to
stretch on a bit longer than we might have anticipated.</div>
<a name="09062577000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chancellor said that the current rules will have to be abolished. The
special tax treatment I have just described will end on 5 April 2010.
From then on, furnished holiday lettings will be treated the same as
other property investment. At the moment, they are treated as trade
property to allow them to qualify for the business and capital
allowance reliefs that I have just mentioned. For the next year, the
furnished holiday letting rules will be extended to the EEA. The
Treasury is predicted to gain, I am told, in the region of &#163;20
million from the abolition.</div>
<a name="09062577000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
south-west, the region containing my constituency, furnished holiday
let properties accounted for &#163;574 million of revenue&#151;some
16 per cent. of all visitor spending in the region. Self-catering
visitors, I am told, often stay longer and spend more than those
staying at hotels. The sector is therefore seriously important, not
just to the people who have such properties, but to the wider economy
and community in parts of the country that are heavily reliant on
tourist income.</div>
<a name="09062577000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chancellor said that the repeal was necessary because the furnished
holiday lettings rule only applied to the UK and therefore breached EU
law. However, in the technical note published on the day of the Budget,
HMRC
said:</div><a name="09062577000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
difference may not be compliant with European
law.&#148;</div><a name="09062577000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise &#147;may not&#148;, so there is some doubt about whether
the Government are obliged to go down this path, as was claimed in the
Budget.</div>
<a name="09062577000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">I leave the
Minister, and anyone who wishes to contribute, with the following
questions. First, can the Minister tell us whether the current rules
are against EU law, or whether the revenue raised is of passing
assistance to the Government but they are not obliged to adopt the new
arrangements from 5 April 2010? That is a crucial point on which there
is an absence of absolute clarity. Secondly, what will extending the
rules to the European economic area cost for the next year? That too is
a legitimate question.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column673" />Column number: 673</div><a name="09062577000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
why did the Government announce the measure in the Budget, without any
advance consultation? That point has been made to me by a number of
people. It was sprung on them and the first that they knew about it was
when they read the financial supplement pages of national newspapers.
There had not been any attempt to assess the impact on that part of the
economy or, as I said, on the wider tourism industry in parts of the
country such as the south-west of
England.</div><a name="09062577000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly,
I am told that it has been reported in the <i class="I">Western Morning News</i>
that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport was not consulted by
the Treasury on the changes. If that was the case, that would represent
a deficient piece of government and a lack of joined-up thinking, to
use the accepted jargon. The DCMS wants to promote tourism and
opportunities for people to visit parts of the country where there are
attractions that VisitBritain and others are seeking to promote, rather
than go on foreign holidays, for example. If the Treasury is bringing
in tax rules that run contrary to the efforts of another Department, it
seems reasonable that those two Departments ought to speak to each
other.</div><a name="09062577000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
can the Minister say why the legislation to repeal the rules is not
contained in the Finance Bill? To put it another way, why have I had to
table new clause 9 at all? A lot of people who are affected by the
changes would like to think that those changes, if they were to be
passed, had gone through the whole period of scrutiny to which we
subject tax law in Committee and through other procedures in the
House.</div><a name="09062577000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was keen to make all those points on what is an important matter for
the individuals concerned, but also for our wider economy and for the
tourism industry, in some parts of the country in particular. As new
clause 9 only asks the Government to produce a report&#151;an impact
assessment on the changes and on what needs to be done&#151;they
should not have great difficulty with it. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09062577000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000674"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The new clause is relates to an important subject
and it is right that we debate it, but I fear that in the time
available we are not going to be able to do it justice. I have a
lengthy speech prepared, but the Committee will be pleased to know that
I shall not deliver
it.</div><a name="09062577000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
echo all the questions asked by the hon. Member for Taunton. In
particular, it is striking if the Treasury did not consult the DCMS. I
would be interested to know what assessment the Treasury or the
Government as a whole have made of the impact that the measures would
have on rural and tourist communities, both in the long term, if there
is to be a reduction in the availability of furnished holiday lettings,
and in the short term, if there is going to be an impact on the housing
market in some of those
areas.</div><a name="09062577000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should declare an interest as someone who has enjoyed many
self-catering holidays in furnished holiday lettings in the UK,
frequently in the south-west of England, but last year in south
Pembrokeshire. The proposals may well have an impact on holidaymakers,
property owners and rural communities
alike.</div><a name="09062577000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we have an opportunity to return to the issue, to debate it
at greater length, but anything that the Minister can say now would be
of great
interest.</div><a name="09062577000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000675"></a>Mr.
Bailey:</b> I do not intend to speak on the new
clause&#151;I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Taunton intend
to press it to a vote&#151;but I bring to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column674" />Column number: 674</div>notice of the Committee that I have an interest, which is declared in
the Register of Members&#146; Interests, although it is not in the
constituency of the hon. Member for
Taunton.</div><a name="09062577000417"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09062577000418"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000676"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I am delighted to have a chance to contribute
under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson, in what is likely to
be the final substantive debate of the Committee.</div>
<a name="09062577000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
dealing with an important topic. Landlords are normally taxed on
property rent or income under the separate property income rules. Under
the furnished holiday letting rules, however, landlords of furnished
holiday properties in the UK, if they meet certain qualifying
conditions, as set out by the hon. Member for Taunton, are treated for
tax purposes on the basis that they are trading. That means that they
are subject to a different set of tax rules. Other landlords of
residential properties may well be eligible for different tax reliefs,
for example more flexible loss relief, which is probably the most
important benefit, capital allowances, certain capital gains tax
reliefs and relevant earnings treatment for pension purposes. However,
landlords with income from furnished holiday accommodation elsewhere in
the EEA have not been treated in the same way as landlords with
furnished holiday accommodation situated in the UK. They are instead
treated under those property income rules in the same way as landlords
of other types of UK and overseas property. Preferential treatment of
furnished holiday lets as a trade for tax purposes has been limited to
the
UK.</div><a name="09062577000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference in treatment may not comply with European law. One can only
surmise what a court might ultimately determine, but our conclusion was
that we had a choice either to extend the preferential treatment tax
treatment to those who invest in European properties that meet the
requirements, or to withdraw it for everybody. We looked at the issue
very carefully, in particular in the light of our objective to have a
thriving UK tourism industry and thriving rural economies. If we wished
to maintain furnished holiday letting rules for UK accommodation, it
was likely to be necessary to extend them to properties elsewhere in
the
EEA.</div><a name="09062577000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000677"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The Financial Secretary said that other parts of the
EEA do not have the rules that we have. Does the financial Secretary
know whether that is by chance? Do nation states just happen not to
have chosen the way that we have
chosen?</div><a name="09062577000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000678"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> My point was that UK tax rules do not apply to
people who have furnished holiday homes in other parts of the EEA. They
do not benefit from the somewhat more generous rules; only those who
have such property in the UK benefit. That is why we needed to consider
the matter. If we had chosen to extend the benefits to everybody who
owns furnished holiday accommodation elsewhere in the EEA, we would be
giving more tax relief to the growing number of UK landlords with
holiday accommodation abroad. The effect of that would have been to
impose an increased cost on all UK taxpayers, with tax treatment in the
UK encouraging investment in other countries&#146; holiday markets.
That is an initiative that would be unlikely to find much favour in the
House.</div><a name="09062577000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond
that, there is a question whether the rules as they stand are still
fair. Many residential landlords provide services and undertake
activities similar to those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column675" />Column number: 675</div>landlords who are able to avail themselves of the furnished holiday
lettings tax regime, but they cannot qualify for the same tax relief
because they do not meet all the conditions. That raised another
question about fairness in competition. We made the announcement we did
because the regime would neither be supporting the UK tourism industry
nor ensuring fair and equitable treatment for residential landlords. We
left some time, however, for landlords to adjust to the change. As the
hon. Member for Taunton rightly has said, change will take effect in
2010 and will be legislated for in next year&#146;s Finance
Bill.</div><a name="09062577000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman queried why there was no advance consultation. Having
made the announcement in the Budget, we will publish draft legislation
and an impact assessment at the pre-Budget report, before the
introduction of the measure in Finance Bill 2010. We will be happy to
consider any comments on the legislation at that time, so there will be
an opportunity for
consultation.</div><a name="09062577000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
expansion of the relief to the whole of the European economic area
would roughly double the cost from &#163;15 million to &#163;30
million per year, and one can envisage the costs of the European
element growing faster than those of the UK element. We will publish
the impact assessment, albeit at the PBR rather than, as the new clause
suggests, ahead of it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that
there will be time for discussion and that the aim of the new clause
will be delivered by the steps that I have
described.</div><a name="09062577000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="09062577000426"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000679"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
typically considered, thorough and courteous response. I had toyed with
idea of pressing for a Division to allow members of the Committee to
reflect the concerns that have been expressed to me on behalf of those
who have been adversely affected by the changes. However, as the
Minister made an effort to say that there will be greater consultation
and an impact assessment, it would be churlish to question his
commitment to that.</div>
<a name="09062577000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that exercise will be undertaken with an understanding that there are
individuals whose livelihoods are severely affected by the changes. It
is not a mere technical matter; some people rely on the income that
they receive from holiday letting. I hope that the Minister realises
the impact on such individuals and on communities across the
UK&#151;particularly, as I have said, in the south-west of
England&#151;who are worried that they may lose crucial tourism
revenue as a result of the changes, especially during the
summer.</div>
<a name="09062577000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light
of the Minister&#146;s generous remarks, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
clause.</div><a name="09062577000429"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause</i><i class="I">,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09062577000430"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clauses
125 and 126 ordered to stand part of the
Bill.</i></div>
<a name="09062577000431"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the Chairman do report the Bill (except clauses 7,
8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 20 and 92), as amended, to the
House.</div><a name="09062577000432"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000680"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Before we conclude our
consideration of the Bill, may I put on record my thanks to you,
Mr. Atkinson, and to Mr. Hood for your
stewardship and guidance throughout our debate? May I also ask you,
Mr. Atkinson, to pass on our thanks to Sir Nicholas for his
temporary assistance during our third sitting?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column676" />Column number: 676</div><a name="09062577000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me also
thank the Clerks&#151;Mr. Laurence Smyth and his
colleagues&#151;as well as the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, the
doorkeepers and the police officers for their help in ensuring that the
Committee&#146;s business has run smoothly, and for all the help that
they have given to members of the Committee. I would also like to thank
the representative bodies that have worked with officials, my
ministerial colleagues and me, for their help in identifying how the
Bill could be
improved.</div><a name="09062577000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have enjoyed a smorgasbord of issues, such as white label cigarettes
manufactured in eastern Europe; the removal of Japanese knotweed; the
taxation of European backwoods, which cropped up on a number of
occasions; the striking parallels evident to at least some members of
the Committee between tax avoidance legislation and the book of
Leviticus; and the recycling facilities in Taunton, which, if I
remember correctly, the hon. Member for Taunton invited us all to
visit, which was a generous offer indeed. Like others, I, too,
congratulate him on shouldering the whole burden of the Bill in the
absence of the hon. Member for
Twickenham.</div><a name="09062577000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
range and depth of our deliberations has been substantial. I express
particularly my thanks to the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's
Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney, who is in his
constituency today. His shoes have been ably filled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Erewash. I would like also to thank my hon. Friends the
Members for Hove and for Glasgow, North-West, who have often been a
source of much-needed inspiration in our
debates.</div><a name="09062577000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to thank all my hon. Friends on the Committee for their
patience, and Opposition Members of all parties for their constructive
and good-natured contributions throughout our procedures. They have
helped to ensure that the Bill is better and
clearer.</div><a name="09062577000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
particularly thank my hon. Friends the Exchequer Secretary, the
Economic Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela
Eagle), who is now the Minister of State, Department for Work and
Pensions, and my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) for
all the help that they gave while they were in their
posts.</div><a name="09062577000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to thank all the officials from the Treasury,
Revenue and Customs, and other Government Departments, whose help has
been invaluable. I am particularly grateful to parliamentary counsel
for their work behind the scenes, which is essential to all that
we
do.</div><a name="09062577000439"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000681"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I also thank you for your stewardship of the
Bill, Mr. Atkinson. You have shown wisdom, and, from time to
time, patience was a quality that you displayed to the Committee. The
same qualities have been shown by your co-Chairman, Mr.
Hood. I am sorry that Sir Nicholas is not here to chair the closing
sitting. I know that he enjoys it so
much.</div><a name="09062577000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also like to thank the Clerks. The Financial Secretary referred
to parliamentary counsel. We do not have such resources when we draft
our amendments and so are grateful to the Clerk and the Public Bill
Office for their help and support. The Financial Secretary pinched my
joke about smorgasbords. I think that the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers have
had to deal with a veritable smorgasbord of technical terms and foreign
place names. I would also like to thank the doorkeepers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column677" />Column number: 677</div><a name="09062577000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
particular word of thanks for the representative bodies, because they
give Opposition Members enormous help in coming up with ideas and
thoughts about how to improve legislation. PricewaterhouseCoopers in
particular supported us throughout the process. John Whiting, who has
been a source of advice to both sides of the House, is retiring at the
end of this month, but his wisdom and counsel will not be lost to the
world of tax, as he will move seamlessly to the Chartered Institute of
Taxation. We are all grateful for his
help.</div><a name="09062577000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the ministerial team&#151;the Financial Secretary, the
Economic Secretary, and, of course, the Exchequer Secretaries. We have
seen a veritable array of Secretaries over the past month. It is ironic
that my neighbour, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, the hon.
Member for Portsmouth, North, and I will spend a great deal of time
together over the next few months debating a range of issues to do with
financial
services.</div><a name="09062577000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful for the support that I have had from my hon. Friends the
Members for South-West Hertfordshire and for Hammersmith and Fulham. It
is, of course, the first Finance Bill that my hon. Friend the Member
for Hammersmith and Fulham has done from the Front Bench. He has
overcome his natural reticence to play a full role in the
Committee.</div><a name="09062577000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also grateful to my backwoodsmen for their service during the course
of the Bill, and, of course, to our Whip, the hon. Member for Rochford
and Southend, East, who, together with the Lord Commissioner of Her
Majesty's Treasury, the hon. Member for Waveney, ensured that the
Committee ran to time and harmoniously&#151;until 16.09 on a
Thursday. I am conscious that we are not as harmonious today as we have
been for most of the other days.</div>
<a name="09062577000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Taunton has played his customary role of being the sweeper
from time to time on the comments that we have made, but today that
role was reversed. Perhaps he is auditioning to be the new sage of the
Liberal Democrats&#151;the sage of Taunton,
perhaps.</div><a name="09062577000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been an effective Finance Bill scrutiny process. Our task as the
Opposition is not just to make political points but to probe and tease
out some of the issues behind the Bill. I think that we have done that
very well in the sittings that we have had. I look forward to rejoining
battle downstairs on
Report.</div><a name="09062577000447"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062577000682"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b>: I will be extremely
brief&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;No.&#148;]&#151;unless provoked. I will be going down to
Taunton shortly, and if anyone wishes to come and see the recycling
facilities with me this evening, I think there is extended opening on a
Thursday.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column678" />Column number: 678</div><a name="09062577000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
thank you, Mr. Atkinson, and your fellow Chairman for the
diligent way in which you have ensured that we kept to the task before
us. I also thank the representative bodies that the hon. Member for
Fareham mentioned. Opposition parties do not enjoy the benefits of
having the apparatus of the state at our disposal, and therefore the
assistance that we have from organisations such as
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is very helpful
in assisting us and our staff to table amendments and new clauses that
are technically capable of being debated, and implemented if that is
the will of the Committee.</div>
<a name="09062577000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Ministers for undertaking a sizeable task, which they have undertaken
with good humour and considerable application. I thank all members of
the Committee. It is a bit like a Big Brother household, apart from the
fact that people do not get chucked out&#151;sadly.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.]</i> Well, perhaps a new feature might be for
people to text in&#151;in this new modern era that you are now a part
of, Mr. Atkinson&#151;with their views on which members
should be expelled if they have not contributed in the right way. We
get to know the characters of everyone who serves on the Committee and
feel enriched as a result.</div>
<a name="09062577000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
thank my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham for his inspiration
throughout this process. No wonder he is held in such high esteem by
the people of this country. He has been able to contribute to the
probing that has been evident from the Liberal Democrats without even
having to deliver that many speeches himself. For all those reasons and
with a high degree of affection, may I say how much I will miss our
deliberations? On that note, unless others wish to contribute, we may
feel it is time to go on to other activities this
afternoon.</div>
<a name="09062577000451"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062577000683"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I add my thanks to the Clerks, the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, the doorkeepers and the police for keeping us
straight in Committee. I also thank all members of the Committee, which
has been good-natured. Incredibly for what normally is a fairly boring
subject&#151;the Finance Bill&#151;it has been very amusing from
time to time. I appreciate how much hard work goes into it. The matters
are very complicated and there has been a vast input from all the teams
in Committee. My thanks to you
