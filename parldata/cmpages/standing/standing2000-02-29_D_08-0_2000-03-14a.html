<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The amendments that appear in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) are similar to those we tabled earlier. They are logical in that they seek to include warrant officers as suitable for membership of the new summary appeal courts. In Committee, last Tuesday, the Under-Secretary explained that, although he looked warmly on our forward-looking amendments seeking to allow warrant officers to be part of court martial proceedings, he felt the need to boot it in to the quinquennial Bill next year. Once again, my response is that if we do that we may as well boot the whole Bill into next year's proceedings. In fact, I have a feeling that this Bill is a trial. It is unprecedented for a Government Bill to complete its Committee stage without being amended by the Government. As I have said, there is something fishy about this.
<P>
We consider that the same reasons would not be valid for rejecting the amendments. The summary appeal courts proposed in the Bill are a new structure and our proposal to allow warrant officers to sit as members of those courts is in tune with the Government's plans for warrant officers and courts martial, which we hope will make their way into legislation next year.
<P>
We hope that the Under-Secretary will not just say that the proposal must be rolled into next year's Bill because the new structures would benefit from the rich experience and levelheadedness of NCOs. It would strike me as odd that an officer fresh out of Sandhurst, Dartmouth or Cranwell with just two years under his or her belt should be able to sit on one of the new summary appeal courts while the NCO with 15 or 20 years' experience should be excluded. We attempted to improve our original amendments by specifying that the qualifying period for such warrant officers should be 10 years' service. Therefore the summary appeal courts would be using the most experienced personnel available to them.
<P>
It is noteworthy that paragraphs 17 and 18 to schedule 3 will allow civilians to be members of summary appeal courts when they are hearing appeals from civilians. This is in the same vein as the approach in the amendments and I hope that the Under-Secretary will take that into account when considering our proposal. It is a significant point because the Minister for the Armed Forces has replied to a parliamentary question that I tabled some time ago about the number of categories of civilians who will be subject to the Bill. He has placed the answer in the Library. There is a complicated number of categories of civilians who will be subject to the Bill so it is important that we ensure not only that we have civilians who are members of summary appeal courts, but that we should not exclude warrant officers. If the Government are prepared to concede that one should not only have officers, but civilians, I fail to see why--considering the Government precedent--we cannot include warrant officers in the Bill.
<P>
The Under-Secretary admitted last Tuesday that the Bill was difficult to draft and that a great deal of work had to be done within a limited time scale. I hope that that is not Whitehall speak for being rushed. We get the impression that warrant officers were inadvertently overlooked until it was to late. I do not wish to be pedantic, but I should draw to the Minister's attention the definitions contained in proposed new section 83ZC(4) of the Army Act 1955, which is contained in subsection (1) of the clause. The definitions include officers but do not mention commissions, although they are mentioned in proposed section 83ZC(1). Why is that distinction made? Is it just shorthand and does it matter? Perhaps the Government should amend the Bill to ensure that they get it right, which would be unprecedented.
<P>
We need to know whether non-commissioned officers are included. Perhaps it is intended to include them and that is why subsections (1) and (4) of proposed section 83ZC are different. The same proviso could apply to proposed subsection (2). Will the Minister confirm that the draftsmen have not let something slip through that should be addressed? I hope that he will consider the amendments seriously; I accept that a further tweaking of their drafting may be necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Viggers </B>(Gosport): I feel a strange sense of detachment in speaking to the amendment. In the Select Committee that considered the 1996 Armed Forces Bill, the Labour party, then in opposition, proposed an amendment similar to that to which my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) has spoken so well. Briefed by Ministry of Defence officials, the Government of the day chose to oppose the amendment. They pointed out the clear distinction between individuals who hold Her Majesty's commission and those who do not. They said that it was part of the structure of the armed forces for commissioned officers to have special responsibilities and duties. Despite the wide experience that warrant officers might have built up during their service, we were urged that it was right that they should not form a part of the court in a court martial. The reason given was that such a right had to be part of the command structure and was part of the basis on which commissioned officers held their special responsibility and were able to make judgments on others.
<P>
I argued in favour of retaining the exclusive right for commissioned officers to sit on courts presiding at courts martial. A similar approach is proposed in the new arrangements for summary courts. I am detached on the matter and I look forward to hearing the Minister's arguments, which will presumably be written by a team that is similar or comparable to that which advised the previous Government during the passage of the Armed Forces Bill in 1996. I am tempted to point out that the Opposition are not part of a control freakery structure and are entitled to our own opinions. Indeed, Salisbury and Gosport may occasionally speak with different voices. I am something of an enthusiast for the procedure under which the Select Committee that considers Armed Forces Bills sits once every five years and can give detailed consideration to, matters such as those under discussion. There are arguments in favour of holding off the decision until that Select Committee has used its procedures to peruse the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I should like to refer to the Select Committee's consideration of the 1996 Armed Forces Bill, which my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport so ably chaired. Perhaps he recalls that on 27 February 1996, under questioning from Mr. Mans, who is no longer a Member of Parliament, a Ministry of Defence representative said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since we have not detected a goundswell in favour of this<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
--NCOs on courts martial, that is--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and since the current system is in line with the chain the command as it exists and because of the resource implications in training times, I see no reason why we should change.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That answer was given, in response to question No. 451, by no less a figure than Brigadier Currie, who features again in the current proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> As always, my hon. Friend has done his homework carefully, and his quotation is apt for this occasion.
<P>
I look forward with keen interest to hearing the Minister's remarks. I accept that society moves on and that although, on balance, it was appropriate one, three or five years ago for commissioned officers to exclusively retain the right to serve on courts martial, the new structure of courts might be more appropriate and it might be proper for warrant officers to serve. Drawing on experience, I think that the younger officers, who will be eligible to serve on summary courts, would in practice keep a careful eye on sergeant-majors and warrant officers and, in relation to military affairs, take guidance from them. We should recognise the changes that have occurred and agree that warrant officers should be eligible to serve in the new court structure.
<P>
I am not hostile to my hon. Friend's proposal, and I await the Minister's response with interest.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Lewis Moonie):</B> I met Keith Mans a couple of weeks ago when I was in Singapore for the Asian aerospace conference, and I am happy to say that he was in excellent health and on very good form.
<P>
On the technical points that were raised by the hon. Member for Salisbury, there is no need to refer to commissions in subsection (4). Clause 16(1) already refers to officers who have held a commission for a number of years, and there is no need to refer to the matter again.
<P>
I do not want the hon. Gentleman to think of me as a nasty so-and-so who confuses hon. Members. I have considered numerous Bills from the Government and Opposition Front Benches and a fair old number from the Back Benches, and I am well aware of the various kinds of amendment. Probing amendments--they are uncomfortably named, and often uncomfortable to deal with--are often negative, and the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear that we generally reject them. There are also helpful amendments that seek to improve the Bill. My approach is to examine each amendment carefully. If I feel that our approach is wrong and that an Opposition amendment is right, I give the hon. Gentleman a guarantee that something will be done. I have felt on balance so far that it has been better to reject the Opposition amendments.
<P>
The fact that we have not had to introduce amendments suggests that the Bill was carefully drafted. I remember only too well when I was in opposition that some Bills needed many Government amendments because they had been drafted hastily. Similar considerations may apply to this Government's legislative programme, but not here. We have a framework of experience in which to set the Bill--it amends existing Acts, so the fact that we have not needed to amend it is not such a pat on the back as it may have appeared at first. By and large, we have managed to avoid such pitfalls.
<P>
I have more sympathy with this group of amendments than with others and it is with some reluctance that I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw them. I shall give my reasons in some detail.
<P>
I echo the hon. Gentleman's comments on the wide experience of warrant officers and the desirability of using that experience in every appropriate circumstance. However, the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) said that historically some sensitivities are attached to the 253 254 matter. It has taken some time to get the armed forces to accept the principle that warrant officers should sit on courts martial.
<P>
In 1998, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, who was then Minister of State for the Armed Forces, announced that warrant officers would be eligible to serve as court martial members when the accused had a rank that was lower than a warrant officer. We plan to improve those arrangements in the next quinquennial armed forces Bill, during the next Session.
<P>
It has taken some time to reach a position in which the principle is generally accepted, and we should be wise to proceed with caution. The Bill provides that the summary appeal courts shall consist of a judge advocate and, as lay members, two commissioned officers. We have considered the matter sympathetically, and we intend to introduce changes in the next quinquennial Bill.
<P>
It would appear to be sensible to appoint warrant officers to the summary appeal court. Very few, if any, warrant officers would have completed fewer than 10 years' service. However, there is a difference between the two types of court which, for the moment at least, incline me towards limiting the members of the summary appeal court to commissioned officers.
<P>
Courts martial are courts of first instance. They hear cases for the first time. The summary appeal court, on the other hand, will hear appeals against commanding officers' decisions. We are not persuaded that it would be right to put warrant officers on those courts, although we have no objection in principle.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am prepared to concede that we will consider the matter seriously next year. By the time the quinquennial Bill is introduced, we will have experience of the workings of appeal courts and what happens in practice. That would be the time to make the change. It would be a wee bit over-hasty to do it now because the many new procedures that we are introducing will take time to bed in.

<P>

<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his measured and positive response. I get the feeling that he would like to accept the amendment, but that the time is not right. I am also grateful for his explanation of the minor technical drafting problem. I sense that an amendment might wheedle its way on to the amendment paper on Report. I promise that I will not embarrass anyone by referring to it.
<P>
On the point of principle, the Under-Secretary made it clear that change is on its way. I hope that we do not have to wait too long. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport reminded us, in 1996, the Labour party was strongly in favour of it. We were a little reluctant to introduce it, because of the niceties to which the Under-Secretary referred. Although the time is right, I accept that it might be better to introduce it in the quinquennial Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 36, line 22, leave out 'two' and insert 'five'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 90, in page 36, line 23, leave out 'two' and insert 'five'.
<P>
No. 94, in page 37, line 17, leave out 'two' and insert 'five'.
<P>
No. 95, in page 37, line 18, leave out 'two' and insert 'five'.
<P>
No. 99, in page 38, line 13, leave out 'three' and insert 'five'.
<P>
No. 100, in page 38, line 14, leave out 'three' and insert 'five'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> All six amendments attempt to change the qualifying period from two or three years to five years for people who serve on summary appeal courts. The extent to which an officer should have experience before serving on such a court is a matter of judgment. Justice should not only be done but be seen to be done. Those people who sit on summary appeal courts should have the experience of several years' service. Two years' commissioned service can be a long time in some services, but not in others. For example, pilots in the Royal Air Force have no experience of man management. They walk to the aeroplane, fly the thing around, come back, perhaps tell the chief crew that there is something wrong with it and walk back to the crew room. It is only when one accepts responsibility for man management that one realises that that difference exists.
<P>
The only way to get the necessary and valuable experience of man management is to spend several months being responsible, through warrant officers and non-commissioned officers, for the conduct, well-being and discipline of men. If I digress, it is only to say that the armed forces, in their different ways, provide as good an experience of man management as any other work. That experience is derived from having responsibility for the men. Some manage equipment and do not have that experience. I am not sure that it is appropriate for the read across to be the same for the three armed forces.
<P>
Having said that, the read across will not be exactly the same because the subsection relating to the Army states that membership of the summary appeal court is to be available to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a military officer who has held a commission in any of Her Majesty's naval, military, or air forces for a period of not less than two years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Similarly, the subsection relating to the Air Force Act 1955 applies to a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>who has held a commission in any of Her Majesty's naval, military, or air forces for a period of not less than two years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Interestingly, the wording in the subsection regarding the navy changes to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an officer is qualified under this section for membership of the summary appeal court if he is a naval officer of or above the rank of lieutenant who has held a commission in any of Her Majesty's naval, military, or air forces for a period of not less than three years or periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than three years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A naval officer must be most unusual to have held the rank of lieutenant in the Army or Air Force. A better drafted subsection would have read: "an officer of or above the rank of royal naval lieutenant or equivalent". That matter is between the Under-Secretary and his draftsmen.
<P>
Is the Under-Secretary satisfied that it is sufficient for an individual to have held a commission for two years--or for an aggregate of two years--to qualify for membership of a summary appeals court? Would it not be more appropriate to substitute a period of five years? He might be minded to include warrant officers in the constitution of such courts; by definition, such officers would have served for more than five years and, probably, for more than 20 years.
<P>
Officers who have been commissioned for two years might not have developed a wide range of experience, especially not of man management. Will the Under-Secretary agree that the limit should be five years rather than two years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I support the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport, which make good sense. I do not share his military experience. We discussed at length under clause 7 the fact that barristers and solicitors would have to go through several years' professional training and would have to have at least five years' professional practice to be eligible for appointment as judge advocates. A judge advocate might have a more important role if leading the court, but he might merely be making custody decisions. Officers appointed under the clause would be participating in the judicial process. There seems a considerable inconsistency between the two types of appointment.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to consider the matter carefully. Commissioned officers might be relatively young--my hon. Friends will tell me how young--people with only two years' experience of commissioned rank could be, but I imagine that they would be in their low twenties. Someone of such a tender age has not had the experience of life, let alone of service in Her Majesty's armed forces, to be eligible to participate in summary appeal courts. If the Under-Secretary's thrust is that we should give members of our armed forces greater human rights, he cannot fail to heed seriously the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> This is an interesting group of amendments. We have drawn a parallel with the district courts martial when the specification is for the term of two years as outlined in the Bill. For a general courts martial, it is three years as in the Navy, which has only one type of court martial. That is why the minimum period is specified as three years.
<P>
We have great experience of the use of junior officers in courts martial and we are content that a lack of experience within the forces does not act as a bar on their service. It has proved to work well in practice. After all, they are sitting as judge with a professional person hearing evidence and reaching a conclusion based on that evidence. A summary appeal court is analogous more to the district courts martial. Generally, it will be hearing appeals against relatively minor offences. We are content that the principle of using officers with such experience has worked well and is long established in courts martial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I can tell from the tone of Under-Secretary's response that he will not accept the amendment, so I shall try again. I am advised by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury that someone as young as 22 could be eligible to serve on a courts martial. An officer may have been accused of having committed a relatively serious offence, but he may be sufficiently confident that he will get off that he allowed it to be heard by his commanding officer. Having been found guilty, he would go through the appeal court procedure. If the Minister had been accused of committing such an offence, would he be happy if someone as young as 22 and with limited experience, was eligible to serve in the courts?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The appeals courts deal with appeals against summary punishments that are not generally serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> They might be.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Well, they are not as serious as charges that would automatically require a court martial. We consider that officers of that age and experience are suitable to be included. I do not know how many are; it is a minimum requirement. It might be difficult to find out how many officers with limited experience that meet the requirements actually serve on a court martial. I see no reason in principle to deviate from that for a summary appeal court when, after all, there will be a presiding officer with sufficient legal knowledge and experience to take the panel through the procedure and provide advice when necessary.
<P>
If it were a matter of hearing an appeal with officers less senior than the commanding officer, that may inhibit fair decision making. That would probably still be the case if the officer had had five years' experience. He would still have less experience than the commanding officer. The principle of using junior officers has been long established. It works well. It is kept under continual review and if we saw a need to change it, we would. However, it is important to maintain it for the summary appeal court, too, and to maintain a consistent standard for a minimum service throughout the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> We could ask 12 people with completely detached attitudes how many years qualification they thought would be right, and we may receive answers ranging from one to 10 years. I could not maintain that five years is the right figure or that two years is wrong. I know that the Select Committee that consider the quinquennial Bill, which will be appointed in January 2001, will keep the issue of eligibility under review. It will note our debate today. Based on that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> The grouping is a little more disparate. We are dealing with three points, which are again about eligibility for membership of the summary appeal court. Clause 16(1) contains a list of people who are not qualified for membership of the court, which includes, in proposed new section 83ZC(3)(e) to the Army Act 1955,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an advocate in Scotland or a solicitor who has a right of audience in the Court of Session or the High Court of Justiciary.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am baffled as to why such people should not be eligible. The wonderful Conservative Administration appointed a Lord Chancellor whose qualifications were Scottish. I see no reason why advocates or solicitors from that part of the United Kingdom should be disqualified.
<P>
Proposed new section 83ZC(3)(f) is even more interesting.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Some but not all lawyers would become eligible to sit under the amendment. It would not apply to lawyers who have qualified in England and Wales, but purely to lawyers from Scotland and Northern Ireland. I must admit to some perplexity; I do not know whether that was the intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> It may be that I need to retire to a darkened room and think again about the exact wording of the amendment. If, in my own frail hand, it has failed to achieve its purpose, I apologise to you, Mr. Benton, and to the Committee. It was intended to strike out the ineligibility of Scottish advocates from being members of the summary appeal court. I would have thought that that was straightforward.
<P>
Similarly, under proposed new section 83ZC(3)(f),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a member of the Bar of Northern Ireland
<P>
is not qualified for membership of the court. I know several barristers in England and Wales who have extended their qualifications by becoming members of the Bar of Northern Ireland. Am I to understand that such people would be ineligible? That seems to be the perverse effect of the provision, and I will be happy to apologise to the Minister and the Committee if I am wrong.
<P>
Proposed new section 83ZC(3)(h) states that
<P>
any person who is, or has at any time during the preceding five years been, a provost officer
<P>
is also ineligible. The naval equivalent is a member of the Royal Navy regulating branch. The reference to five years takes political correctness too far. Surely it is a slur to say that membership of such courts makes one ineligible for five years. I look forward to being corrected by the Minister. If someone who has been a provost officer up to five years previously decides to enter the Church and become a padre, would he be ineligible? That would seem a most obscure, strange and unfair disqualification. I see from the Minister's body language that he is not entirely ad idem with my argument. I look forward to being put right on this. These are comparatively minor matters but there appear to be mistakes in the drafting.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Key:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport is being a little modest. These matters are extremely important. At present it is unclear, certainly to me, whether we are excluding Scottish lawyers or lawyers from Northern Ireland from this appeal process. As so many service men and women come from Scotland and Northern Ireland, it would be extraordinary if lawyers who are familiar with the legal systems that operate there were excluded from this process. I hope that the Minister can reassure us about that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I am just trying to make sense of these amendments. Is their purpose to re-include all lawyers as potential servers on the appropriate body?
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Viggers </B>(Gosport) indicated assent.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I see that that is correct. Obviously there are two separate groups of amendments. I suspect that amendments Nos. 96, 97 and 98 cover his intention and I was probably misreading the whole thing.
<P>
We have made two class exclusions here, basically provost officers and lawyers. I do not hold anything against either of those groups, particularly lawyers, I hasten to add, but clause 16 specifies who is not eligible to serve as a lay member of the summary appeal court. The Bill generally mirrors the arrangements covering the eligibility for membership of courts martial, although the more detailed rules for court martial membership are laid out in rules and Queen's regulations.
<P>
The first excluded category is those who could have been involved in the investigation of a case or otherwise in its handling at some stage prior to the appeal. That rules out provost officers or those who have recently served as such. It rules out the prosecuting authority, the court administration officer and their staffs. For practical purposes, it is simpler to exclude classes of people rather than only those who have had prior involvement in a particular case. While we accept that obviously not all provost officers would have been involved, it is easier administratively to include them all. That is why that has always been the case with courts martial.
<P>
The second class of people excluded from eligibility is lawyers. We exclude them simply to ensure that lay members will not be unduly influenced by the presence of an extraneous lawyer in addition to the judge advocate whose function is to decide how the law applies in the case. The Committee will be aware that lawyers are not allowed to serve as jurors in an ordinary trial for exactly the same reason.
<P>
If the amendments were carried, provost officers would become eligible so it would presumably be necessary for the court martial administration officer to make inquiries in each case to make sure that an individual had not at any time had an involvement that might make it inappropriate for him to serve. That makes it unduly complicated. Again, I understand that police officers are precluded from serving as civilian jurors, so there are some reasonable parallels here both with the court martial system and the civilian system.
<P>
There is no doubt in mind that lawyers should not be allowed to serve. It would unduly complicate matters. Having one legal officer is sufficient. As for those who might have been involved, investigations are often so complex, that people may have been involved only indirectly or for part of the time, or may only have asked for an opinion. That would complicate matters, so it is much easier to exclude that class. Indeed, there is no compelling reason why they should be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Paragraph (g) of proposed new section 83ZC(3) excludes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a person who has in any Commonwealth country rights and duties similar to those of a barrister or solicitor in England and Wales, and is subject to punishment or disability for breach of professional rules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That baffles me. Am I to understand that barristers and solicitors who are not subject to those disciplinary procedures in Commonwealth countries are eligible?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That is what it looks like to me. However, I am sure that there is a good reason for the drafting, which I am sure I can give to the hon. Gentleman later. I cannot give him an exact answer at the moment.
<P>
On the question of provosts, having given the matter a lot of thought, I believe that we are right to debar them from courts martial and the summary appeal court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I am not totally persuaded that the amendments are unhelpful. I reserve the right to make the most vehement attack that I can on the failure of the Government and all its advisers to combine the armed forces Acts, as I find myself wrestling with negatives and paragraphs that make it almost impossible to understand the thrust of the Bill.
<P>
It would not be appropriate to push the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman concludes, let me say that I heartily share his feelings about examining three different Acts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> All I can say is that I am happier to be asking questions than being in the Under-Secretary's position of not being able to answer them.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Constitution of court for appeals</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would assist me with one or two points.
<P>
We are all agreed on the need to consolidate the three service discipline Acts, into each of which the clause inserts a new section. Under subsection (1), additions to the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 specify that the summary appeal court shall consist of one judge advocate and two officers qualified under the terms of clause 16. For each appeal, the judge advocate will be chosen by or on behalf of the judge advocate general. The officers and--eventually, we hope--warrant officers will be chosen by the court administration officer.
<P>
Subsection (2) inserts a new section into the Naval Discipline Act 1957, which is identical to the provision for the other services, except that it provides for the judge advocate to be chosen by or on behalf of the chief naval judge advocate. It also provides that at least one member of the court holds, at the minimum, the rank of commander and that the most senior member of the court shall act as president.
<P>
Why are requirements for naval summary appeal courts more exacting than those for the other services? Furthermore, another exacting condition imposed by 1957 Act may amaze the Under-Secretary as much as it did me. Why does that Act specify the three categories of civilians to whom the Act applies? The first category is spies. The Naval Discipline Act 1957 says that spies in a Royal Navy shore establishment abroad or on board one of Her Majesty's ships anywhere shall be subject to the Naval Discipline Act. It also states that the Act includes persons who in a Royal Navy shore establishment abroad or on board one of Her Majesty's ships anywhere shall attempt to seduce from his or her allegiance to Her Majesty a person subject to the Act. That does not apply to the Army and the Air Force. Why is the Navy so much more exacting?
<P>
11.15 am
<P>
The third category of civilian covered by the Act is passengers on board one of Her Majesty's ships, vessels or aircraft. A civilian on an RAF aircraft is not necessarily subject to the Act. Extraordinarily, however, if the aircraft belongs to the Navy, such a person automatically is. That opens an intriguing prospect as Members of Parliament often hop on and off naval and RAF aircraft and Army air corps helicopters: the law that applies depends on the service flying them.
<P>
That is important and interesting and I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary could shed light on the matter, no doubt with the advice that is close to hand. However, if he cannot give an answer today, I should be happy to receive a written reply. Why does the clause's provision for the Navy differ from that for the Army and Air Force?

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have one question for the Under-Secretary. In a court martial,it is possible for the accused to object to the appointment of a particular judge 261 262 advocate and other officers. There is a possible lacuna in the Bill, as it does not make provision for the accused to make any objection to such appointments. Indeed, that could give rise to a possible European Court challenge that proceedings are unfair.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I assume that the hon. Gentleman has not received my letter of 13 March, which answers that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Would the Under-Secretary paraphrase his letter to help me to decide whether I need to say anything more?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> My letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The current provisions governing procedures of courts-martial allow an accused to object to a judge advocate, any member of the court or the interpreter. It is expected that these same provisions will be included in the rules applying to proceedings before the summary appeal court. I am copying this to the Chairman and all committee members.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I only signed the letter yeesterday, so it is hardly surprising that the hon. Gentleman has not received it yet. However, it explains that the matter is one of rules and is not covered by the Bill. The same rules will apply as those applying to courts martial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That is helpful, and answers my objection to the clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Well, spies, seducers and so on. I must confess that I have not read the 1957 Act quite as carefully as I might have done, otherwise I might have noticed that interesting provision. My hon. Friends have suddenly looked up. They clearly have an interest in the matter, as do the massed ranks whose presence in this Room is not recognised. I do not have a clue about the matter, but I am happy to write to the hon. Member for Gosport with an explanation.
<P>
Many small differences in the Acts are the result of the fact that service preferences favour different circumstances. Where there is no good reason to refuse the service preference, we tend to grant it. We shall examine the matter carefully when the time comes to consolidate the Acts into one. A uniform system working across all three services would be much simpler. If we are not careful, we shall end up with a single Act, but with lots of subsections, which might make it even more complicated. Hon. Members will acknowledge that it may take time to persuade those who have operated in a certain legal framework that it would be good to give up the way they do things in the interest of streamlining. As I said, I shall be happy to write in greater detail if I have not clarified all the issues now.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'solely on grounds of misconduct of the Commanding Officer in the hearing of the facts or where the Commanding Officer has made an error of law.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The amendments, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold and myself, would slightly reduce the grounds on which an accused can take an appeal from a summary hearing before his commanding officer to the new summary appeal court. At present, the Bill proposes that the accused be allowed to appeal any decision by his commanding officer on the grounds of the findings and/or the punishments awarded. In other words, the accused is given carte blanche to raise an appeal after his hearing, irrespective of whether the grounds to do so are legitimate. Therefore, every member of the armed forces who is tried summarily may as well appeal the decision if he does not like it. Under the rules, any appeal cannot leave them worse off. We mentioned the important issue of principle earlier and we wish to ensure that this part of the Bill is right.
<P>
The amendment follows the guidelines for an appeal in the civilian courts of the UK--an important principle, if we are seeking to provide members of Her Majesty's forces with more human rights or bring them more into line with the civilian world, which appears to be the Government's intention. The Government have an opportunity to chart the way forward here.
<P>
Under my amendment, an appeal could take place only when the commanding officer had either misconducted himself--in other words, failed to give one party a fair hearing--or made an error on a point of law. If an appeal is raised on either of those points, the commanding officer is responsible and deserves to be appealed, as he has had an opportunity to become conversant with the relevant law and deal with the hearing in a fair manner.
<P>
The appeal would be available on both conviction and sentence. In the civilian magistrates courts, there is an absolute right of appeal. Facts can be appealed and usually a simple form is filled in and the matter is given a complete re-hearing before the Crown Court, which does not see any of the papers from the previous hearing. However, the judge has the power to increase the sentence and make cost orders against the accused, thus ensuring that spurious appeals do not come before that court.
<P>
Under the Bill, the summary appeal court cannot increase the sentence. I understand that there are no real cost provisions in the military discipline system, so there is no disincentive to bringing spurious appeals. The net effect will be that after each summary hearing, the accused--and the rest of ship's company or battalion--will be left in suspended animation, waiting for the re-hearing. What will be the effect on morale and discipline? What will happen if the summary hearing has been the result of an altercation between two members of a ship's company and the two are left working together because the accused decides to appeal?
<P>
This is indeed an important matter. Has the Minister noticed today's coverage in the national press and media of the Aldershot incident, in which several members of the parachute regiment were tested positive for hard drugs? One of the men had been beaten up by his enraged colleagues. An NCO is reported as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No one is looking too hard for the lads who carried out the attack. The feeling is that it is the least this man deserved.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a problem and if we leave the provision that allows every case to be appealed, the waiting will do no good at all to the cause of justice. That is why I tabled the amendment, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I return to what I said last Thursday in support of my hon. Friend's amendments:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, a test or threshold should be introduced which comes into operation before an accused person has the right to be heard by these extensive and time-consuming courts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We were debating summary appeal courts. I continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A court should be satisfied that there are good grounds for a case to be heard.--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 9 March 2000; c. 236.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the norm when either the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords hears a case from a lower court: they would not take it on automatically.
<P>
We received a duff reply from the Minister:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have listened to much talk over the past three quarters of an hour and I cannot confess that I have heard anything new. I listened to every word that has been said so far about the Bill and, I regret to say, that, although much passion has been generated, there was little logic in the speeches and certainly no new argument to convince me to change my mind about the central plank of the Bill.--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 9 March 2000; c. 242.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that the Minister will not change his mind about this either. I would like to think, however, that on a new day and with a new spirit of openness of mind, he will consider the amendments carefully. Unless some test or threshold is applied, we shall end up with many frivolous appeals with no proper grounds for proceeding. A case may have been heard extensively by the commanding officer; many witnesses may have been brought in; and it may be quite clear that the accused is guilty and has been sentenced reasonably. The amendments make a good deal of sense.
<P>
Will the Minister explain subsection (3):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The court may at any later time give leave for an appeal to be brought.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under what circumstances may the court so give leave? Will the Minister provide some examples to clarify it? The subsection may contain the sort of safeguards that my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury and I are seeking through the amendments, but, if I am right, the amendment makes even more sense because the phrase is vague. It will probably be tested time and again. The Minister's reply will be examined carefully in order to establish what that particular phrase means. Will the Minister provide further clarification and give some sympathetic thought to the amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Together with amendments Nos. 104 and 105 to 107, which we shall debate when we reach clause 20, the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury is important because it helps to correct a problem that will flow if the Bill is enacted as drafted. The Bill anticipates 1,500 appeals from summary judgments but that is a significant underestimate. As their sentence cannot be increased, many people will want to appeal because they will have absolutely nothing to lose by doing so. To have the open right to appeal, without having to state the grounds, is wrong. Appeals should be restricted to those in which there are grounds such as misconduct by the commanding officer in hearing the facts or an error of law on his part. The amendment proposes a sensible way to restrict the right of appeal and I therefore support it.

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I thought so.

</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I shall not forget that in a long time. I thought that I was giving a rhetorical flourish. We cannot please all the people all the time, especially the Opposition.
<P>
Alas, we return to one of the Bill's points of principle. The summary appeals system is a good system and that is why we have done our best to preserve it, but to do so it must be compliant and at present it is not. The Bill was drafted to comply with article 6, the right to a fair trial, while maintaining the system of summary discipline. Both principles could not be maintained if we accepted the amendment. However inconvenient it may be, if there is a right to appeal it must be a universal right. If it is constrained in any way, it immediately makes the summary system non-compliant and open to public challenges in the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> So far, I do not disagree with a word that the Minister has said. However, subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The court may--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I repeat the word "may"--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>at any later time give leave for an appeal to be brought.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That implies that there are circumstances in which the court will refuse leave to appeal. Will the Minister clarify those circumstances?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> There is a general right of appeal if it is brought within the time limit of 14 days. If an individual decides to bring an appeal after that time, he or she would have to get permission from the court to do so. It would then be for the court to decide whether to accept the application for leave to appeal. It is for the court to decide which cases are accepted if an appeal is made after the time limit.
<P>
We return to the principle of the Bill, unfortunately; we are stuck with it. We do not know how it will work in practice, but we think that we will be able to handle it. There will be a certain number of cases, but if the armed forces discipline system is as robust, and their morale is as strong as we say it is, there will not be the great raft of appeals that hon. Members fear. The vast majority of people caught in some wrong doing, having admitted it and been given their punishment, will accept it. That is what Army discipline is all about. If that is not the case, 265 266 we will soon find out, but the fact remains that there must be a system; the appeal must be available on all counts so that we can comply with article 6. The reason for introducing the Bill this year is to make it compliant with the convention before it becomes part of British law. I regret that I have no choice but to decline the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The Minister has brought us back to the principles of the Bill. He alleges that the clause must be compliant with those principles and that it is so framed for that reason. I wish that the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) was present to give us the benefit of his opinion, but he also sits on the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges, which is why he is not here. I would be interested to know whether the Liberal Democrats have a view. I note that, once again, they are not represented in Committee. They have contributed about 200 words to the entire proceedings, and I am surprised that the Government are still prepared to have them on the Cabinet Committee that considers defence and foreign affairs. It is extraordinary that the Government think that it is worthwhile to have them on it. When the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch)--and who knows where he might be--did speak, he gave no indication of whether he supported the Bill in principle.
<P>
The Under-Secretary says that there is a point of principle at issue. The summary system is a good one, but it must be compliant. We followed the debate in another place and, in particular, the advice of Lord Campbell of Alloway on whether the military system of justice as it stands is compliant. He argued the whole way through the debate that, in his opinion, it was, and that the European Court of Human Rights would not, in any event, seek to crush the British system of military justice as it stood.
<P>
The Government see this as a matter of principle, as do the Opposition. It is just not common sense--good law should be based on common sense--that every judgment can be appealed. It is common sense that there should only be appeals only on the grounds of misconduct or error of law. That is what the amendment is about, and I regret very much that the Government have decided not to accept it. We will make our position clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend see that there is, yet again, an inconsistency between the discipline system in the Bill and the procedure in the civilian courts? Why do the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords use thresholds to determine whether they will allow appeals? It is because they do not wish to waste time on frivolous appeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> My hon. Friend is right.
<P>
On the practical aspects of the issue, troublemakers, barrack-room lawyers and others with nothing to lose could make a meal of this process, for the reasons that I have set out. I hope that they will not, and I am sure that common sense will prevail in most cases. Nevertheless, there is the potential for abuse of the system, which is why we want to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 40, line 12, leave out 'fourteen' and insert 'seven'.
<P>
The amendment would reduce the amount of time available to the accused to decide and take action to appeal a verdict to the summary appeal court provided for in the Bill. We seek properly and effectively to balance the competing needs to provide the accused with sufficient time to put in place the necessary arrangements and to minimise the period of uncertainty created by any delay before a sentence can be carried out or set aside, as appropriate.
<P>
Setting the length of time to be permitted for appeals is purely a matter of practice rather than principle, given that the Government found it necessary to agree to re-examine the length of time in which appeals can be lodged as a direct result of an Opposition amendment that was debated in Committee in the other place. That is reported in column 385 of House of Lords Hansard on 16 December 1999. That notable victory, which was notched up by Earl Attlee on behalf of the Opposition, throws into stark relief the lack of thought that Ministers have given to the practical implications of rushing into this European-convention-on-human-rights-compliant Bill.
<P>
From the outset of the Bill's parliamentary progress, we have opposed the delay in the implementation of a summary award given by a commanding officer. We have done so because of the uncertainty that that could cause; the damage to commanding officers' prestige and credibility, and the destabilising effect that the abeyance of the sentence might be expected to have on the accused's close friends and colleagues, which could be prejudicial to the maintenance of good order and military discipline.
<P>
The example of two men, tried on an identical charge and receiving identical sentences from their commanding officer, one of whom accepts the sentence, but the other appeals, shows the damage to a military unit's morale that a lengthy appeal period could easily cause. Such a case would be even more damaging if the unit were on active service, for example, in East Timor or Kosovo.
<P>
In Committee in the other place, the Opposition proposed an amendment that would have had the effect of reducing the period in which appeals could be lodged to seven days. The Minister said that she would consider further the time limit proposed in that amendment. On Report in another place, Baroness Symons tabled a Government amendment reducing the period of appeal from 21 to 14 days. That is reported in column 1015 of House of Lords Hansard on 8 January.
<P>
We continue to believe that 14 days is more time than an accused should need to prepare his or her legal aid application, await a decision on it, and make an appointment to seek and receive advice from an appropriate legal representative. The Government, by appearing to set their face against any further reduction in the time limit for appeal, risk severely damaging morale in the services and undermining the authority of commanding officers.
<P>
It is clear that that is not an issue of principle, but one on which the Government have already moved. Whether to settle on a limit of 14 days or reduce to it to seven is a matter of judgment. We would prefer to err on the side of the chain of command. We believe that concession after concession has been made against the interests of the chain of command, which is why we urge the Government to reduce the limit to seven days. Such a reduction would be in the interests of Justice and of implementing the provisions of the European convention on human rights. We hope that the Minister will agree with us as clearly as the Minister in another place agreed with Earl Attlee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I support my hon. Friend's views. Anyone who thought of appealing would normally know whether to do so at the end of the hearing. It would concentrate everyone's mind if the period in which an appeal could be lodged were to be shortened from 14 to seven days. As we have said many times, if we are not careful, the thrust of the Bill may diminish discipline in the armed forces. Anyone who feels that he has not, for one reason or another, had a fair hearing or that his sentence is excessive will know--as will his legal advisers, if he has any--by the time of a sentence being passed by the commanding officer at a summary hearing whether he wishes to appeal. Therefore the amendment makes sense. Indeed, it seems doubly to make sense in the light of the Minister's reply in regard to subsection (3):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The court may at any later time give leave for an appeal to be brought.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So if there were good grounds for an appeal--if, for example, it had not been possible to obtain sufficient evidence--the summary appeal court would want to bend over backwards to ensure that it could be heard, even if it were after the seven-day period allowed. The amendment makes eminent good sense and 1 hope that the Government will consider it sympathetically.

<P>

<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie </B>(Kirkcaldy): As the hon. Member for Salisbury said, the issue was the subject of a compromise amendment in another place. When the Bill was introduced, a period of 21 days was selected because that is the period in which an appeal can be lodged for a case heard in a magistrate's court to go to the Crown Court. One needs good grounds to deviate from the principle that, where possible and practical, we should try to mirror the civilian system. However, in the other place the point was conceded and we agreed to a compromise, to try to make the system as rapid as possible. It is a matter of deciding what period is most reasonable.
<P>
We have had legal advice from senior counsel that in order to comply with article 6(3)(b) of the convention, an accused must have adequate time to prepare his defence--which includes time to decide whether to lodge an appeal. Based on the decisions of the Strasbourg court, we were advised that 10 days was the minimum we could give an accused. So even were I prepared to compromise further, I could not accept seven days, because that period conflicts with our advice.
<P>
There are two other reasons for rejecting the period of seven days. First, the Bill properly allows for applications out of time. However, the shorter the period for seeking appeal, the more likely applicants are to seek leave to appeal out of time. Again, that might lead to an even more complex situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That goes back to the previous set of amendments. At least the judge advocate would consider carefully whether there were realistic grounds for an appeal to be heard out of time. The matter would be placed in the hands of a professional, who would decide whether an aggrieved service man had proper, rather than just frivolous, grounds for appeal. Our proposal gives a more sensible threshold.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That may or may not be the case, but it still conflicts with the first condition--that the period must be a minimum of 10 days. The second reason for rejecting the amendment is that we are trying to avoid the possibility of accused persons lodging ill-considered appeals, simply to ensure that they are within time. The shorter the time period, the more likely someone is to decide too quickly whether to appeal--whereas given a little longer to reflect, he may decide not to appeal at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Presumably, if the accused were uncertain about whether to appeal, he could lodge an appeal within the seven-day period and then subsequently withdraw if he decided not to go through with it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I assume that he could but that does not necessarily lead to greater simplification of the system.
<P>
I believe that we have gone as far as we can. I suppose that, technically, we could go down to 10 days, but we believe on reflection that two weeks gives us an adequate balance between our desire to mirror what happens in the civilian courts and the minimum period of 10 days which our legal counsel has advised us is the minimum allowable under the convention. Fourteen days is not an unreasonable compromise in the circumstances. Obviously I cannot accept seven days because, technically, it falls short of the advice given to us. I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> This was always going to be a matter of judgment. The Minister has given at least one plausible reason, which is that the shorter the time for appeal the greater would be the likelihood of an increased number of applications for out-of-time consideration. His argument is compelling. I was interested and pleased that 269 270 he conceded that there might be a case for going down to 10 days. On the basis that we may wish to return to the question of 10 days at a later stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> We should not leave clause 18 without a short debate on the consistency of sentencing which would, if it occurred continuously, give grounds for a greater number of appeals. We are all about consolidation both within the three services and across them. We ought to be moving towards consistency in the appropriate sentence for the crime in each service. I want to press the Minister a little on this aspect. The much-quoted Brigadier Ritchie, the Director of Personal Services for the Army, said in evidence to the Defence Select Committee on 10 February, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate that a sentencing guide was being produced but emphasised that it would be only a guide.
<P>
Can the Minister say whether the guide has been produced and, if so, how far it mirrors the green guide for sentencing and summary trials which the Royal Navy has had for 40 years? That system seems to have worked well in the Navy, and there seems to be consistency in sentencing across the service, whereas in different Army regiments the ethos of discipline is rather different. We shall have to move increasingly towards a more consistent system whereby the relevant crime will be given the same sentence, either increasingly summarily--where it is now different--or when a crime goes before a court-martial. We shall need to see that consistency of sentencing by commanding officers of regiments is equal, otherwise there will be a greater number of appeals to the summary appeal court, as laid out in the clause. Perhaps the Minister can give us some guidance to enable us to understand how the idea will work in practice.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting point which I had not considered prior to his raising it. It has given me a great deal of concern over the years in relation to the civilian system. There is undoubtedly enormous variation in sentencing between different areas of civilian law and I have no doubt that there will be equal variation between services and regiments. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that nothing causes someone greater resentment than thinking that he has been victimised or given a more severe punishment than others. Consistency in sentencing is more likely to secure general approval from those who are subject to it if there is a general acceptance that they are being dealt with fairly. This issue may come up next year in the quinquennial review. We have not actively considered it, but we are doing so now, and we shall return to it. I cannot help him a great deal today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister is producing a constructive and helpful reply. Will he ensure not only that the Army has a sentencing guide but that the sentencing guides produced by each of the three services are consistent among the services?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That is certainly a principle that I would want to uphold in ensuring consistency. We are moving towards that, and I hope that we shall make progress next year. I support the principle wholeheartedly.
<P>

<P>
No. 107, in page 43, line 4, leave out from 'award' to end of line 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Like amendments Nos. 48, 49 and 50, the amendment is designed to restrict the number of appeals. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury based his amendments on the grounds and the timing of appeals in ensuring that the number of appeals does not get out of hand and out of line with the Government's estimates. The estimate that the Government gave in November 1999, when the Bill was introduced in the other place, was that 850 to 900 appeals would be made against summary judgment. That number was subsequently increased to 1,500--in other words, about one in five, or 20 per cent., of summary judgment cases would go to appeal.
<P>
I recognise that many people are prepared to accept the judgment imposed on them. When the Select Committee on Defence took evidence on the Bill, the Director of Personal Services (Army) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Genuinely, I believe, and I think this is the experience of most commanding officers, good soldiers will entirely accept that they have done wrong, they will be in front of the commanding officer and they will take their punishment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree that that is the general rule that has applied so far. However, I am profoundly worried that if the individual service man or woman has nothing to lose by making an appeal, many more appeals will be made than have previously been estimated.
<P>
Based on my constituency experience, I also believe that the root of the problem will be family and friends, who will urge the individual to appeal. From my experience, the service man or woman involved is prepared to accept the sentence, but, as I said on Second Reading, it is perhaps merciful providence that most of us are backed by husbands, wives and friends, who have a higher expectation and belief in the individual's ability and decency than the structure in general.
<P>
A man who is sentenced by the armed forces will be prepared to accept that sencence, but often his wife will not. We are now dealing with not only wives and husbands but every sort of relationship, including homosexual and lesbian relationships. People who support lesbian and homosexual relationships say that such relationships are just as loyal as heterosexual married relationships. The partner or friend will urge the service man or woman to appeal, because he or she has absolutely nothing to lose. My amendment would change that and say that the summary appeal court can impose a more severe sentence than that imposed by the commanding officer.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
If we keep coming back and arguing that the number of appeals will be greater than that originally anticipated by the Government, it could just be because we believe we are right. Just as the Minister bats back the answers he has given on previous occasions, we will persevere with this point because we believe that there will be many more appeals than the 1,500 that the Government expect. If there are many more appeals, the costs will also be proportionately large. We will need many more than 31 additional lawyers. We will need a much higher amount than 6.5 million from the scarce defence budget. Therefore I urge that we take out the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is no more severe than the punishment originally awarded.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I see no reason for not removing those words.
<P>
I have in my hand article 6 of the European convention on human rights, which concerns the right to a fair trial. Nothing in it says that if a case should go to appeal the sentence imposed by the appellate court may not be heavier than that imposed by the original summary court. There is no reason why that should be the case as the obvious point of an appeal procedure is that there will be a judicial officer who will be judicially qualified. There will be two officers with the qualifications that we have discussed before. By its very nature, I should have thought that the appeal court would be more compliant than the summary judgment of the commanding officer. Therefore, I see no reason why we should not allow provision for the sentence of the appellate court to be greater than that of the original court.
<P>
If we do not amend the Bill in this way, I foresee a large number of appeals. The cost will be greater. I see no reason why the amendment should not be made. I cannot see how the Minister can argue that we need to retain the Bill in its original form because it is more compliant. Indeed, the more I hear the discussion on this Bill, the more I think it would be appropriate for us to withdraw from the European convention on human rights and then immediately rejoin, having excluded the armed forces from it. We are going down a dangerous path. If my amendment were accepted it would limit the damage that the Bill could do.

<P>

<B>Mr. Key:</B> The clause deals with the powers of the summary appeal court. It provides that when an appeal is made against a finding of guilt, the summary appeal court may either confirm that finding, quash it or substitute a finding that another charge has been proved if that alternative would have been available to the commanding officer at the original hearing.
<P>
Where the court confirms the original finding or substitutes another, the court may vary the punishment as long as the substituted punishment is one that the commanding officer could have awarded originally. Crucially, it can be no more severe than the original punishment. The same proviso counts for appeals against punishment only in that the summary appeal court may confirm the original punishment, or substitute another, as long as the substituted punishment is one that the commanding officer could have awarded originally and is no more severe than the original punishment.
<P>
My hon. Friend's amendment seeks to make an important change to the powers of summary appeal courts. The present plan means that the courts can give no greater punishment than the commanding officer originally gave. My hon. Friend's amendment aims to remove that stipulation. It is a good amendment. It provides a much needed disincentive to appeal to the summary appeal court. At present the accused has nothing to lose from appealing against his punishment. By introducing the risk of a greater punishment there would be a disincentive for offenders to make frivolous appeals or appeals that might be intended to slow up the disciplinary process.
<P>
The amendment would help to promote justice by ensuring that only the genuinely aggrieved will want to run the risk of incurring a greater punishment, but that is not to say that the summary appeal court would automatically give a greater punishment to those who appeal to it. The amendment would simply give them the ability to do so should they consider the case merited it or if they felt that the facility of the summary appeal court was being abused. That would send out a message to those who were considering making a spurious appeal with the aim of playing out the system, or were trying to get one over on the commanding officer by appealing against a finding and punishment that may be perfectly fair.
<P>
My hon. Friend's amendment would also help to restore some of the authority of the commanding officer that is lost under the process at present. The Defence Select Committee heard that as many as 20 per cent. of summary justice decisions would be appealed. One in five is a large proportion. I think that it is an unacceptable figure and one that damages the whole concept of summary justice in the forces. These amendments would go a long way to reducing that figure of 20 per cent. That is surely something that the Government would wish to see.
<P>
In earlier discussions of the role of the summary appeal court we argued that there is no firm proof that the summary appeal courts are strictly needed under the ECHR. The Government are goldplating the system again. If they insist that the goldplating is necessary, we hope that they will agree with our efforts to mitigate what we believe will be the negative impact of the summary appeal court. My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport has made a powerful case which we support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I should like to add my support to the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport which seem to make eminent good sense. The Opposition wholly welcome the system of summary appeal courts. We hope that on the whole 273 274 summary matters will be dealt with under the normal procedure administered by the commanding officer and that appeal courts will be necessary only comparatively rarely. My fear is that they will become increasingly common.
<P>
Some form of disincentive is needed to appealing to the summary appeal court unless there are good grounds for doing so. That is a long-established principle in the civilian courts where if an offender opts for trial by jury in a Crown court rather than the summary justice of the magistrates court, he knows perfectly well that the sentence that the Crown court can hand down can be greater than that awarded by the magistrates court. That is the disincentive to seeking a trial by jury. It makes good sense to have some form of disincentive, particularly, as I have mentioned so many times in Committee, to frivolous appeals.
<P>
The appeal court is properly constituted under the Bill. There is a highly qualified judge advocate. There are, according to the Minister, two well qualified commissioned officers and there is the court administration officer. These courts are professionally constituted. I suspect that the commanding officers will be tempted to become more lenient in their sentences in order to be seen to be totally fair to the men under their command. A commanding officer will not want his officers to appeal to a summary appeal court. When this properly and highly professional court looks at a case and considers that an offence has been committed, but that the commanding officer has been too lenient in the sentence, it should be able to set a higher one.
<P>
My hon. Friend's amendments makes eminent good sense. It would not contravene the ECHR. Unless the Minister can convince us to the contrary, nothing in article 6 would be contravened as my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport made clear. If he cannot, this is yet another case of the Bill over gilding the lily. I hope that the Minister can look at the amendments sympathetically.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Our reading of this situation has been based on legal advice. I would think more of the arguments of the hon. Member for Cotswold if he could say that they were based on legal advice too. As he does not, he is in the same position as me as a lay person and is making his own interpretation. As a Minister, I am bound to take the advice that I am given. In this case it conflicts with the arguments that he makes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Will the Minister explain what that advice is as it certainly does not appear in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It does not have to appear in the Bill. We have had advice, although I will not give him the details. That is not normally done. We have been told that summary hearings are not compatible with the convention and that we must frame our legislation accordingly. I appreciate the helpful intent of the amendments. There is nothing that I would like better than to streamline and to save as many appeals as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It seems a little unsatisfactory for the Minister simply to tell us that his legal advice is that it would not be compliant with the convention. He should at least tell us the nature of that legal advice so that we can research it to see whether we agree. That is the whole purpose of the Committee. We are examining the Bill. The Minister should tell us which article in the convention gives rise to this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I will look at that matter and come back to the hon. Gentleman. I cannot do so at present, but it does not affect my attitude to the amendment. The Bill deliberately includes a ceiling on the power of the summary appeal court in relation to sentence--that is the sentence that was given when the case was dealt with summarily. Summary procedures on their own are not compatible. It is common ground that we need to be able to deal with matters summarily. We are in favour of that. The Bill is about putting procedures into place around summary dealings to make them withstand challenge under the ECHR. That does not involve going to Strasbourg. After 2 October they can be challenged in British courts too because of the passing of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
The right of appeal is key in this respect. It provides access to a court that is compliant with the convention. The protection that providing a right of appeal gives is immediately weakened if going to a compliant court from a non-compliant court places the appellant in jeopardy of a more severe sentence. In a civilian system they face that risk but the choice is between one compliant court and another and not between one where they felt they had been dealt with unfairly and one that is automatically compatible, as that is the way we have constructed the higher court.
<P>
Appellants will have a number of issues to think about before they appeal. In most cases it is our judgment that they will wish to put the matter behind them as quickly as possible and get on with their service careers. We still believe that the vast majority of cases will not go to appeal. In fact, the figure of 1,500 that is often quoted is a maximum not the number we expect. We hope that it will be a great deal fewer than that. It comes down again to the argument on the point of principle. We think, based on advice, that summary hearings are not compatible with the convention: Opposition Members take a contrary view. If our view is to stand up we must ensure that the compliant court has the same powers and that there is no disincentive on the individual to pursue his case, merely individual to pursue his case, merely because he fears a stiffer sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> The Minister has been very fair, as he always is, in expressing his views. To be fair to him, he does not seek to say that our argument is hostile or damaging; he simply advances his cause under the banner of compliance with the ECHR. My understanding of legal advice is that it is based on statute law or case law. Any lawyer giving legal advice in this country would advance it because of the corpus of statute or case law. Legal advice about the European Court of Human Rights is not legal advice at all, but a guess about what the European Court will decide in a particular case, such as the Hood case?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> With respect, we are not dealing with the European Court any more, but with the European convention on human rights as applied to British law. We are talking about British courts and our legal advisers are much more familiar with what is likely to take place here than in Europe. It can cause difficulties when we are dealing with Strasbourg, but we are not any more: as I said, we are dealing with courts in this country.

<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> In that case, where does article 6 say that the British courts must follow the wording of the Bill, which is not to impose a sentence greater than that imposed on summary justice? The words are not in the article. How can the Minister maintain that the British courts must accept the words of the Bill, but not those of the amendments? In the Hood case, we were told that legal advice cross-read into article 5 some of the wording of article 6 of the European convention on human rights. I maintain that there is no reason why we cannot accept the wording in the amendment, which I press to the vote.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The clause provides the order-making power for the Secretary of State to decide on the mechanisms by which the appeal courts will operate in practice. There is a long list from (a) to (r), but it is wrong for so much to be left to the order-making power of the Secretary of State. Serious matters are included: under (i), which cases are ineligible to be heard; under (l), the admissibility of evidence; and under (m)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the rehearing of an appeal where any member of the court originally constituted to hear it has been unable to continue hearing the appeal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said, these are serious matters, which should be built into the Bill properly. Will the Minister explain the Government's intentions regarding the orders brought forward under the clause? That would help us to decide whether to vote in favour of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I have only one point about the rules. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold that draconian powers are being given to Ministers. Subsection (2)(q) deals with rules to make provision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as to making copies of the records of proceedings available and as to the fees payable for such copies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that refer to copies of video recordings of proceedings provided through video links? Will they be available; at what price; and how quickly? They may be available in time for an appeal, but would they be available in time for a solicitor representing an accused person--within a matter of hours, which could be crucial? Will the Minister clarify paragraph (q)?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> On the fees, I am not sure, but there will be no video links for summary appeal courts, so the hon. Gentleman's question does not apply. If I recall correctly, copies of proceedings tend to be expensive and it is not within my power to do much about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> With respect, it is within the Minister's power to do something about it. The Minister is making the rules, so it is extraordinary to hear him say that he has no powers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Obviously, we set the prices according to the standard tariffs. That is what I meant. Prices will be based on the assessed cost of providing the information requested. That is standard practice, which I have no great power to vary. I meant only that I would follow standard practice.
<P>
The clause mirrors as far as possible section 103 of the Army Act 1955, which is why it contains the same powers. We took note of the report of the Deregulation Committee and I would be grateful if the Committee gave careful consideration to it. The report accepts the use of the negative procedure. Delegated powers and secondary legislation are often necessary to fill in the details behind general principles established in primary legislation. We had to accept it grudgingly as a necessity during the previous Conservative Administration and we now accept it much less grudgingly as a necessity now that the boot is on the other foot, even though we railed against it in the past. It is a necessary part of the procedure for making legislation function effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Before we dispose of the clause, has the Minister drafted any of the regulations? If not, when does he expect to do so?
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Before Committee members get too excited about rushing headlong towards the final hurdle, I regret that I must bring them up short for a little more explanation and thought.
<P>
We must consider whether the Bill should include more repeals. I am especially anxious about the NATO Status of Forces Treaty 1951 and the Visiting Forces Act 1952. The matter is fairly complex. The Status of Forces Agreement in London, which was signed by NATO members on 19 June 1951, sets out the legal arrangements for the exchange and basing of military personnel from one military state to another and provides for the sending state to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over members of its armed forces and their dependants in the receiving state's territory.
<P>
In the United Kingdom, SOFA provisions are enacted by the Visiting Forces Act. Separate agreements govern the status of NATO international military headquarters. United Kingdom service personnel remain subject to service jurisdiction wherever they are serving, but the extent to which that may be exercised varies according to the receiving state.
<P>
With the exception of exercises and other deployments to countries where SOFA applies or to Commonwealth or former Commonwealth countries whose visiting forces legislation is similar to ours, it is necessary to negotiate terms that can be incorporated in a memorandum of understanding. That will be increasingly important if our armed forces' prime purpose is to engage in peace enforcing or peacekeeping in nations that are not signatories to the European convention on human rights.
<P>
There is a further impact, and we need to go back some years to understand its significance. During the second world war, the Allied Forces Act 1940 enabled visiting allied forces to conduct courts martial, but did not provide immunity from ordinary criminal law. There was a single exception, as the United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act 1942 gave members of the United States naval and military forces immunity in United Kingdom courts. That remained the position until the aforementioned Acts were repealed by the Visiting Forces Act 1952.
<P>
Several extraordinary things happened in that period which gave rise to those Acts. There was a large American base in Shepton Mallet in Somerset and, as a colleague reminded me, the Americans meted out fierce retribution to those of their service men who were involved in rape cases in the local community. The American courts martial passed sentence stating that rapists were hanged unless they were native north Americans in which case, for cultural reasons, they were shot. That gave rise to the aforementioned Acts.
<P>
That has ramifications for the incorporation of ECHR into domestic and military law? Have such points been adequately covered and are repeals necessary? Foreign military personnel and associated civilians are fully subject to the jurisdiction of UK courts, except when the law provides for the service courts of the force concerned to deal with them. The Visiting Forces Act gives effect to SOFA's provisions on jurisdiction and similar provisions have been extended by the International Headquarters and Defence Organisations Act 1964 to military headquarters which were set up following the North Atlantic treaty.
<P>
I accept that the matter is complex and arcane. The Under-Secretary may be able to wipe aside all my concerns with a single grand phrase or gesture. On the other hand, the matter may need to be examined in detail.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary would examine the question of contractors. The NATO Status of Forces Agreement defines a visiting force as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>personnel belonging to the land, sea or air armed forces of one Contracting Party--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to SOFA--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>when in the territory of another ... in connection with their official duties.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It defines a civilian component as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the civilian personnel accompanying a force of a Contracting Party who are in the employ of an armed service of that Contracting Party.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Employees of independent contractors who happen to be carrying out work on the force's behalf are not part of the civilian component.
<P>
The SOFAS which apply in Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina and, latterly, Kosovo, refer to NATO personnel, defining them as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the civilian and military personnel of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation with the exception of personnel locally hired.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That definition excludes civilian contractors.
<P>
I am sorry to go on, but I am making a serious point. Have the ramifications of the Bill been thought through in relation to the complex arrangements of serving with other NATO forces, some of which are not signatories to the ECHR? I trust that the Under-Secretary will enlighten us.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I may have to write to the hon. Gentleman on his final point.
<P>
More generally, however, I congratulate him on the ingenuity with which he worked the matter into our debate, yet remained in order. I say that with a resentful glance at the Chair--I am only joking, Mr. Benton.
<P>
The Visiting Forces Act 1952 was passed to incorporate the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement into United Kingdom law. SOFA provides a basis for a mutual and reciprocal system of exemptions, immunities and privileges for visiting forces when exercising or stationed in a host country. Such privileges may include, for example, the ability to purchase food tax-free.
<P>
A major feature of SOFA, which is implemented by the 1952 Act, is the question of jurisdiction for dealing with offences committed by visiting service men, civil servants accompanying a force, dependants and contractors. Its main provision is the agreement that the visiting force will retain jurisdiction for its people, which applies equally to United States personnel based in the United Kingdom and our forces serving in NATO countries, Commonwealth countries and, more recently,  those countries that have signed up to the NATO partnership for peace.
<P>
The UK's ability to retain jurisdiction is extremely important. It is only fair that our service men and women are secure in the knowledge that, when overseas, they will be dealt with by a legal system that is familiar to them and meets their expectations about what is an offence and what punishments can be imposed for that offence. Given the diversity and complexity of the world's legal systems and the more radical punishments available, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that retaining jurisdiction over our forces is a beneficial and necessary measure.
<P>
Reciprocity is the premise behind SOFA, which is a multi-national agreement. If we seek to interfere in any way with the right of a visiting force in the UK to deal with someone under its own legal system, we risk the breakdown of the agreement. If we breach SOFA's spirit, we would find it difficult to resist a similar challenge to our right of jurisdiction when overseas. We do not want to jeopardise that right and do not think that there is any need for appeal. On the contrary, we would seek to defend the provisions wholeheartedly.

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 47, line 16, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
I have just realised that I have to move the amendment [Hon. Members: "Hooray."] Members of the Committee should not get their hopes up: it is not nearly as exciting as it sounds. It also took me a wee while to realise that the practical effect of the amendment is to delete the subsection that was inserted in the other place as a privileged amendment, immediately prior to its introduction in the House. The purpose of the subsection is to ensure that the Bill cannot authorise any charge for expenditure until the House has passed the money resolution. Now that the money resolution has been agreed, the subsection can be removed. It is purely procedural and allowed the Bill to pass from one House to the other and back again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I prepared an impassioned speech to remove the subsection, without realising that the Minister was proposing to remove it. The clause as it stands is inaccurate and misleading bunkum. The Minister has explained that it was necessary to remove it because it was technically correct, but is no longer so. However, I cannot let it go without giving the Bill a final kick and pointing out that the Government's proposal will impose charges on the people and on public funds. It will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>vary the amount of or otherwise alter any such charge in the manner, or affect the assessment, levying, administration or application of any money raised by any such charge.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 That is the Government's choice. The Minister cannot pretend to be simply a passenger on the bridge of a ship that is being swept along on the current of the European convention on human rights and the European Court. The Minister was responsible for taking the Bill through the House. He was the Minister responsible for putting before the House and the people the spending of 9 million a year on lawyers and administrators rather than on other, needy parts of the armed forces. He is the Minister responsible for not only the Bill but defence medical services, and he is hesitating to confirm that the Ministry of Defence will allow the Royal Hospital, Haslar in my constituency to be used by the national health service. I deplore all that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Before we dispose of the clause, I wish to say a few words--which will give the Minister an opportunity to give me a good kicking. That would be an example of summary justice being meted out without cause for appeal.
<P>
I would like to know when the Government are minded to bring the Act into force, so that we have it on the record. If they are not likely to do so until October, which is the date that has been given in the debate, I am not sure why we have had all these Committee sittings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to intervene, but that is the subject for a clause stand part debate. We are still dealing with amendment No. 52.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Benton.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That gives the hon. Gentleman the chance to be kicked again. When one is my size, one has to learn to take a few kicks. I am fairly absorbent.
<P>
I would not like to be thought of as a reluctant stowaway on a ship of state as it carries the Bill towards its destination. I have said on several occasions that I wholeheartedly support the incorporation of the ECHR into British law and the necessary changes that that would implement. All decisions on scarce resources involve difficult questions of allocation. The provision is necessary. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am giving Haslar hospital a fair amount of attention and will no doubt be able to tell him, in the not too distant future, what has been decided.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> This debate provides the Minister with another opportunity to give me a good kicking. I would prefer to give the Minister a kicking than for him to be kicking me--I might come out of it rather worse--but I am a plucky little fellow, so I will have a go.
<P>
When does the Minister expect the Bill to come into force? If that does not happen until October, several propositions arise. First, why have the Government introduced the Bill? If they introduce a new tri-service discipline Act next year, there will be only a few months 281 282 between the Bill coming into force and that new Act. The Minister said that the Bill's raison d'tre was that such a measure was urgently needed to comply with the ECHR judgments in the Hood and other cases.
<P>
Secondly, what will happen to judgments in the interim? How will the Government ensure that any sentence imposed before the Bill comes into force complies with the ECHR? That could produce a peculiar lacuna. Perhaps the Minister will consider bringing the Bill into force more quickly to prevent such a lacuna from being created. If he does so, perhaps we will be given sight of the draft secondary legislation that is necessary under the Bill before May. Indeed, it might make sense to have sight of the draft secondary legislation before Report. Perhaps the contrary argument is that there should be no Report stage until the draft secondary legislation is in place. Will the Minister clarify those matters and tell us what is in the Government's mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I should like to explore subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An order under subsection (2) ... may contain such transitions provisions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I question the date of 2 October. We know that that is the time frame and that it will be extremely tight. I also question the transitional nature of some of the provisions. It is clear that the Government must enact the Bill by 2 October.
<P>
During our debates in Committee, we have heard that great effort is being made to create training teams in the services, and we applaud that action. However, the Minister acknowledges that it is difficult to read across proposed amendments to legislation on discipline and the dispensing ofjustice from one service to another. The Bill exemplifies that confusion and complexity. It has been necessary for the Opposition to table amendments in the other place so that the service discipline Act relevant to a particular service is accounted for in each case. Three parallel sets of provisions have been necessary throughout the Bill. Ministers in the other place acknowledged that the manuals of military law, and the sister publications for the other services, further complicate a hugely complicated picture. All that makes the task of adhering to inherently complex and sensitive legislation a practical nightmare for commanding officers. Last night, I spoke to someone who has been a commanding officer for some time. He said what a different business it is commanding forces now compared to only a few years ago.
<P>
In Committee in the other place, Lord Peyton properly sought to smoke out the Government. That is reported in column 311 of the Hansard of the other place for 16 December 1999. He referred to the acute difficulties for those trying to read the Bill in conjunction with the service discipline Acts. That point will be even more relevant once the Bill is enacted. On behalf of the Government, the noble Baroness Symons said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government are considering moving now to a tri-service discipline Act ... It will take some time for us to consider the best way forward but we must have a look at consolidating the Acts. Such a consolidation would supersede the current legislation.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 315.]<P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Gosport and I served on the Committee that considered the Armed Forces Bill 1996. At that time, the Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill was unequivocal. In paragraph 37 of its report, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recommend that the Government ensures that the necessary resources and Parliamentary time are made available to allow for the consolidation of Service law before the passage of the next Armed Forces Bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not go into great detail about what the Select Committee said, but it bears reading. It is an extremely sorry tale of good intention, missed opportunity and lack of resources and of joined-up government--on the part of the previous Government as well as the present one. In using the time of the lawyers required, defence was always at the bottom of the pile. That cannot continue. Parliamentary draftsmen will have to start with a clean sheet because of the Bill. Many years of wasted effort have already been spent on consolidating the three Acts, so much so that the previous Government was told that it would be "wholly inappropriate" for consolidation to proceed until first the 1996 amendments relating to the ECHR, and now the Bill, had been considered.
<P>
Ministers do not propose to work on bringing common sense and comprehensibility to the service discipline Acts before the enactment of the next quinquennial Bill. Instead, they seem to be hinting that they might not introduce such vital codifying legislation until the Parliament after next. I started the Committee by saying that we all recognise that each of the three services has a different ethos. That is not in doubt. However, as we have increasingly purple operations, it makes sense to introduce a little more common sense to the process.
<P>
I should like the Minister to assure us that the Bill will be fully and properly workable by 2 October this year. If it is not, we may as well have undertaken the entire exercise next year with the quinquennial Bill, rather than this one. The Chairman of the Defence Committee asked whether it would be possible to extrapolate the costs of losing as against the costs of changing the law prior to the quinquennial review. That question remains unanswered. There has been ungainly haste in introducing the Bill when we might instead have had a much-needed period of consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny, which we shall enjoy for the quinquennial Armed Forces Bill. In agreeing that the clause stand part, we need an assurance that all work will have been completed by 2 October and that the Government seriously intend to move towards consolidation of the three service discipline Acts.

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It is our intention that the Bill will come into effect by or on 2 October this year. Obviously I do not yet know the commencement date, but it will be as soon as we have everything in place. Everything will be in place by the time the Bill is enacted.
<P>
Interim judgments may be made in the meantime, and we shall just have to live with that. I hope that people will realise that there is no point in challenging the system in the mean time, but there is nothing we can do about that. We cannot make the Bill retrospective, so the courts would not be in place.
As to consolidation, the hon. Member for Cotswold knows my views. I am disappointed that we have not been able to achieve it in time for the quinquennial review next year. We shall doubtless receive a sound and severe kick from the Select Committee--one might almost say deservedly so. However, it is not just a matter of me sitting around with a wet towel on my head one weekend, putting all the provisions of the three Acts into one, handing it all over to the services and saying, "Tough, get on with it." We try to proceed with the agreement of the forces, none of which wants to give up elements of its particular prerogatives. We therefore have to move forward at a relatively slow pace. I am not stupid enough to give any guarantees, but if it is not in the next Bill, I would certainly expect it in the one after that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 28, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Since this is my first Committee as Minister, I should like to thank you, Mr. Benton, and your co-Chairman, for the way in which you have handled the Committee. I thank other Committee officials and officers for the smooth running of the Committee and Opposition Members for not kicking too hard, although sticking to their guns throughout. I did not manage to convince them of the merits of my case, but I stand by it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I associate the official Opposition with thanks to you, Mr. Benton, and to Mr. Malins for chairing the Committee. I thank the Minister for his largely good-natured replies to our amendments. It has been a pleasure to see the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) here when he could be, and none of us should be surprised that the Liberal Democrats were hardly present at all and made no contribution of any sort to the deliberations of the Committee on the future of Her Majesty's forces.
<P>
I extend our thanks to the Minister's officials and to House of Commons officials for their courtesies, to Hansard staff, to the messengers and badge keepers and to the police who have ensured that at no stage did disorder overwhelm the Committee, notwithstanding the enormous public concern about the issues that we have debated. We have taken the Bill seriously and sought to improve it. We shall return to some of the issues on Report.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On behalf of Mr. Malins and myself, I thank the Minister, Opposition spokesmen and members of the Committee for their courtesy at all times. I also thank the learned Clerks and everyone connected with the Bill for their help and co-operation, which is much appreciated. I must now try to get out of the habit of referring, particularly when I speak to my wife, to 0930 hours, 1000 hours and so forth. It has been an enjoyable experience for me and my co-Chairman. Thank you all very much.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
