                           </strong> The amendments go to the heart of the sort of
national health service that we want to see. They are important.
Nevertheless, I hope to deal with them quickly today—certainly
more quickly than I dealt with the last clause. I thought it fair to
tell the Committee that, although I do not mean to say that the issues
are not
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments reflect the need for collaboration and co-operation in the
NHS, because we want to achieve that as a holy grail. Everyone agrees
that we need integrated services. Co-operation and collaboration, not
autonomy and competition, should be at the heart of the NHS and of the
Bill. We need to make it clear that services that work together and
collaborate are desirable and will not be threatened by competition
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State’s duty to promote autonomy, as the Bill
currently stands, is bizarre when set beside such important duties as
improving services and reducing inequalities. Even more extraordinary
is the fact that the apparent duty of the Secretary of State is not to
the NHS as a whole, but is effectively to reduce the level of
co-ordination. If we want integrated services, the ideal circumstances
would be ones where there is an atmosphere of mutual trust, where there
is not huge reorganisation and where services do not feel threatened by
a reduction in resources. These hardly seem to be ideal circumstances,
even at the best of times, for integrated
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
huge reorganisation that the Bill introduces, at the same time as the
efficiency savings in the NHS, threatens to create total chaos. We have
heard from policy wonks on the Government Benches that that sort of
chaos can be creative, but we do not need creative chaos in the NHS.
Services need to co-operate and collaborate ever more to achieve
integrated services. Will the Minister tell us how the Bill will make
increased integration and co-operation more
likely?<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000045">&#160;</a>

people with long-term conditions such as Parkinson’s or cancer
are concerned about is how their whole treatment pathway will be
planned, and how commissioners—either the NHS commissioning
board or the consortia—will ensure that there is understanding
and knowledge about their condition at every stage of their care.
During the oral evidence sessions, we heard concerns from many
organisations about the fragmentation that might result from the

the amendments are about placing what is needed for good, clinical

is focused on the needs of the patient in particular and the public in

                           </strong> The amendments deal with co-operation and
integration throughout the health and social care system. Clearly,
those are important themes. Although I shall talk about each amendment
individually, I will take the opportunity to refer to our overall
approach, to help the hon. Lady. The Government recognise and are an
active advocate of the benefits of integration, including better
outcomes for patients and a better patient experience. We have made it
clear that we intend to create a health and social care system that
achieves better outcomes and is designed around individuals rather than
institutions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are absolutely committed to the principle of autonomy, and clause 4
puts that principle at the heart of the NHS. It is about eliminating
the political micro-management that constrains the freedom of
hard-working professionals to focus on what matters most to us all:
improving outcomes for patients. If we want to improve 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 333<a class="bkMark" name="Column333">&#160;</a>
                           </div>outcomes in the NHS, we need to empower our front-line professionals.
The Bill confers functions directly on the bodies most capable of
discharging them. The principle is about giving those bodies the
freedom to exercise their functions, so long as that is consistent with
the interests of the health service and
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
can sympathise with the intention of the amendments, which seek to
emphasise the role of integration and collaboration. However, what they
propose seems to be based on two assumptions with which I cannot agree,
the first of which is that somehow integration can happen only at the
expense of autonomy. The partnerships necessary to support integrated
services need to be created at a local level by building effective
relationships between local bodies. The Secretary of State cannot do
that for them, and it is more likely to happen if bodies are not
constantly looking up to
Whitehall.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
15, 16 and 119 are all based on the assumption that autonomy and
collaboration cannot co-exist happily together. In fact, they are not
mutually exclusive; it is not a case of either/or. There should be no
conflict between autonomy and co-operation when both are consistent
with the interests of the health service. The Government agree that,
where appropriate, organisations should co-operate to deliver the best
possible services for patients. That is why the Bill sets out explicit
duties for bodies to co-operate with one another. For example, clause
266 places key national bodies under a duty to co-operate. Health and
well-being boards will have a role in promoting integrated working and
shared commissioning of health, social care and public health services
to meet better the needs of individuals and families using the
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second assumption is that the Bill weakens the legislative framework
for collaboration and integration. It does nothing of the
sort—it strengthens the framework in several ways that I shall
explain in the context of the amendments. Amendment 120 would do two
things. It would replace the board’s autonomy duty with a duty
of co-operation and it makes specific reference to the new duty under
clause 179—health and well-being boards must promote integrated
working among those responsible for arranging health or social care
services in the relevant
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have already explained that we are committed to empowering
professionals to exercise their functions as they see fit. That is why
the duty is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
I have explained why I believe that autonomy and co-operation are not
mutually exclusive. Given the other provisions in the Bill, it would be
unnecessary to introduce an additional duty of co-operation in clause
19. However, the NHS commissioning board will have an important
influence over consortia behaviours, through its functions of
developing commissioning guidance for the consortia and of setting the
indicators in the commissioning outcomes framework against which the
performance of consortia will be assessed, and through practical tools
such as the development of tariffs. That is why clause 19 places an
explicit duty on the board, under proposed new section 13J, to
encourage consortia to work closely with local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000063">&#160;</a>

act collaboratively, with fellow providers, commissioning consortia and

role of Monitor, as economic regulator, will be to ensure that the
social market for provision of NHS services operates in the public
interest. Monitor will do that by promoting patient choice and
competition on quality, where appropriate, by setting or regulating
prices and by supporting the continuity of services. Monitor will
promote patient choice and competition for services on a fair playing
field. It will have powers to address restrictions on competition and
quality if they act against the public

amendment 124, the Opposition again seek to add duplicate powers into
the Bill and the 2006 Act. The amendment to clause 22 would impose two
linked but different duties on commissioning consortia. I will address
them in turn. The amendment’s proposed new section 14NA(1) seeks
to introduce a duty for a consortium to co-operate with the board,
other consortia and local authorities. However, the provision has
already been made elsewhere. Paragraph 129(3) of schedule 4 amends
section 275 of the 2006 Act to provide for consortia and the NHS
commissioning board to be NHS bodies for the purposes of the Act,
ensuring that the board and the consortia are covered by the existing
duties of co-operation, which already apply to NHS trusts and NHS
foundation trusts. In section 72 of the 2006 Act, NHS bodies have a
duty<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000069">&#160;</a>

co-operate. I understand the aim behind the amendments, but they are
misconceived. As I have mentioned, Monitor will have powers to ensure
that competition works fairly and in the interests of patients. It is
not necessary to invent a parallel set of functions for Monitor to
oversee the extent to which providers co-operate with each

point that at times there may be no conflict between autonomy and

obvious. We seek to amend a small section of the 2006 Act, which states

                        </p>
                        <p>That is fine, but
clause 4 adds to that description of the Secretary of State’s
duties a provision that defines how he carries them out: with a view to
encouraging autonomy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000079">&#160;</a>

points about that. Some aspects of the requirement are blindingly
obvious; we would hope that any Secretary of State would do them at any
time. Under clause 4, he must ensure when he carries out those
duties—promoting good health and so
on—that<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000080">&#160;</a>

                        <p>on any person or
provider. We would hope that that is so obvious that it is not worth
stating in legislation. We would not want the Secretary of State to go
out of his way to add burdens to people who are trying to provide
health care.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
also states that he must exercise his functions in a manner that allows
maximum freedom and autonomy to those who are providing the services.
In other words, he should not meddle unduly. Again, that strikes me as
a blindingly obvious good point—one does not want to interfere
with people when they go about their general business.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000082">&#160;</a>

pose a question. Why are we specifically adding a provision to describe
how a Secretary of State should discharge his functions? Why does that
provision refer only to autonomy and not to all the other matters that
we should mention? Why can we mention autonomy here and collaboration
elsewhere? There is no obvious answer to that. The measure adds an
inelegant characteristic to the existing legislation, which refers to
what the Secretary of State does.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000083">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It seems an attempt via legislation to give a
particular sort of emphasis rather than to do anything considerable. I
perfectly accept the points made by the Ministers, but in terms of real
effect, there are adequate later provisions that will ensure that
autonomy and collaboration will be balanced out in the interests of the
NHS. There is no difficulty in the effect of the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000085">&#160;</a>

the realms of how the Secretary of State will do what he is supposed to

together. The purpose and point of the autonomy is to reflect the
changing situation of the position of the Secretary of State within the
ambit of the NHS under the terms of the White Paper—that is, to
stop the Secretary of State from having day-to-day powers to
micro-manage and interfere in the day-to-day running of the NHS. That

the NHS does. It should restrict itself to that. In my view, it should
not be amended to go into detail about how the Secretary of State
should do things. That should be done at a later stage, as it is in the
Bill. We have taken autonomy and put it in one place, and taken
collaboration and put it in another.

Will the Minister clarify when things are too autonomous? We all

debate and there is some concern about what Dr Nicholson said? Some
have interpreted his evidence on NICE quality standards as meaning
bringing in a lot more centralised control of GPs. It is understood
that his evidence was effectively that NICE will be setting down
guidelines on what quality commissioning looks like.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000095">&#160;</a>

would have to commission to those standards. Does that mean that GPs
are going to be told by the board what they should commission and when
and how? Is there a plan for NICE guidelines to be enforced on GP
consortia by the board? If that is correct, I presume that the Minister
agrees that that is a great increase in central control of
GPs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000096">&#160;</a>

11 seeks to strengthen the autonomy duty set out in clause 4. It is a
curious amendment, given the other amendments that we have been
discussing. If I have understood it correctly, the logic behind the
hon. Lady’s previous amendments 36, 37 and 39 was to strengthen
the ability of national bodies to hold local

                           </div>organisations to account for improving quality. Amendment 5 would do the
same for inequality under clause 3. However, amendment 11 is a direct
contradiction of the thrust of those amendments, allowing local
organisations to act with complete disregard for the actions of
national bodies. The thrust of the amendment would mean that consortia
could pay no attention to the commissioning board’s
commissioning guidance, which is based on National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence quality standards, reducing the ability of the
board to provide leadership on improving quality. I can only suggest
that the hon. Lady has not considered the consistency of her
arguments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000099">&#160;</a>

I have set out previously, the principle is about maximising autonomy,
but in the context of preserving the core values of the national health
service. The NHS is a national tax-funded service, and it must be
accountable to the Government of the day and to Parliament, so it is
right that Ministers set strategic direction and national priorities.
It is when political micro-management prevents hard-working
professionals from focusing on high-quality care that we fail to
deliver the best possible outcomes for
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000100">&#160;</a>

Bill will create national bodies with the appropriate skills and
experience to ensure that the health service works in the best
interests of patients. We want patients to be able to choose from a
range of providers that are accredited to provide safe and high-quality
care and treatment, and select the one that best meets their needs. It
would be inappropriate to allow any body or individual complete freedom
from proportionate checks and balances. For that reason, I urge hon.
Members to resist the amendment, although I understand that the hon.
Lady has said that she is not going to press it to a Division. I hope
that that goes some way in explaining why we do not agree with the
general tone and philosophy behind the

be the force of Nicholson’s evidence. If I am wrong, will the

the autonomy that GPs will be given. It is important that we get

potential impacts, and to seek to mitigate any negative ones. It may
help the hon. Lady to know that it is a phrase that is often used to
describe the duties of public bodies. For example, the NHS
constitution, which was drawn up by the hon. Lady’s Government
when they were last in power, is a good example of a document to which
NHS bodies must have regard.

Clearly, the chief executive’s evidence suggests that they will

not saying that that is a bad thing, because the difficulty of
spreading best practice throughout the national health service is the
quest in which people have been engaged for 60 years. It is potentially

On the way in which NICE guidelines are interpreted at the moment, most
hospitals will have regard to them in relation to, for example, a CT
for a head injury. They must, however, use clinical discretion in
certain cases, such as when alcohol is involved with a head injury or
if older people and a particular area are involved. I do not see how
the clause differs from the implementation of that provision. There is
a basic framework of good practice in relation to which clinical
judgment needs to be exercised. Does the hon. Lady not accept that that

how autonomy fits with accountability and local democracy. The clause
states that there should be no unnecessary burdens, but what are those
burdens? Is it an unnecessary burden to pay attention to what the
public want, or to be accountable to, or scrutinised by, the public? If
that is what we are talking about, it is a matter of grave concern. The
amendments seek clarification, and amendment 12 in particular seeks to
make sure that public involvement, accountability and openness are not
regarded as unnecessary burdens. What does the Minister have in mind
when he talks of
burdens?<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000129">&#160;</a>

view, almost an unnecessary clause. I think we could put it in any
piece of legislation at any time. It is no wonder that legislation
keeps expanding in this place, because we insert statements that are
completely vacuous. It is rather like inserting a clause that says,
“The Secretary of State should not spend unnecessary money or go
to sleep on the job.” Nobody in their right mind will advocate
that we impose unnecessary burdens or make any sort of case for
imposing such burdens, because they are—to put it
bluntly—unnecessary. The clause as it stands does nothing. There
is a purist point of view that says, “Why put clauses in that do
absolutely nothing?”<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000132">&#160;</a>

the Secretary of State and the NHS commissioning board to avoid
unnecessary burdens on bodies providing, commissioning or regulating
health services. As I said earlier, the specific purpose of those
duties is to set out the principle that, when considering whether to
place requirements on the health service, the Secretary of State and
the NHS commissioning board should always consider the impact of their
actions on health service organisations and ensure that they are acting
proportionately.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000133">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 17
and 121 seek to remove the requirement that the Secretary of State and
the NHS commissioning board should avoid unnecessary burdens. In other
words, they suggest that the Secretary of State and the board should be
able to impose unnecessary burdens on the health service, thus
recreating the problems of the past. We know that front-line services
have been subject to unnecessary burdens and targets, which have
distorted priorities and distracted professionals from focusing on what
really matters—high-quality patient care and improved
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000134">&#160;</a>

unnecessary burdens were put on the NHS, the Secretary of State
probably regarded them as necessary, practical or sensible in some way?
There has never been a Secretary of State who has willingly said,
“This is a wholly unnecessary burden, and I will impose it on
providers and the health service in general.” There may have
been, but the Minister can hopefully advise me on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000135">&#160;</a>

be by direct interference with individual providers or whether it be
interference in the day-to-day operation of commissioners. That is the

Government Members were nodding in agreement about the need to ensure
best practice and to ensure that there were not regional or national

agreements to identify diabetes and so on—some 150, I think he
said. We do not disagree with that approach, because we should have the
highest possible standards, but if that is not micro-management, what

seeking to enhance outcomes, because those 150 or so standards will be
established on a clinical basis through NICE. That is the way to do it,
rather than through the interference or direction of the Secretary of
State. I agree that those standards, we hope and expect, will enhance
and improve patient care. That is a plus point and a way forward; it is
not day-to-day micro-management by politicians. I am sorry that the

would specify that certain functions should be excluded from the
Secretary of State’s duty to avoid unnecessary burdens. The
intention is one with which I can sympathise: to ensure that the clause
does not have the unintended side effect of decreasing public
involvement or the availability of quality information. I can reassure
the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury that the clause would
not have such an effect. Clause 4 is about the relationship between the
Secretary of State and the health service. It does not enable
organisations to sidestep their statutory duties. The Bill confers
appropriate duties in relation to patient and public involvement,
consultation and accountability on relevant bodies in the system, and
we envisage that the NHS Information Centre will publish data relating
to performance, or quality of services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000144">&#160;</a>

duty to publish and lay before Parliament an annual report on the

amendments. That information revolution will help to ensure that
high-quality information is accessible to all. I notice that the hon.
Lady will not press the amendment to Division—it was, to all
intents and purposes, a probing amendment—so I hope that that
goes some way to reassure her, but I somehow doubt that it

                        <p class="tabbed">In the
interests of making progress, I do not want to repeat in detail all the
debates that the Committee has had about service reconfiguration.
However, I want to remind members of the Committee—not that they
need reminding, but for my own benefit—of some crucial points.
First, we all know that major reconfigurations of services are
absolutely vital for improving quality of care, which is not only about
saving more lives but about increasing the number of people who can
live lives that are free from serious disability. I am thinking of two
key issues in that regard. The first is stroke care, and we have
already said that there is an important issue about specialising
services in some hospitals. However, an area that needs serious and
rapid progress is trauma care. There is absolutely clear evidence that
when trauma services are provided in more specialist centres they save
lives. There are some very basic points to make. If someone experiences
a major trauma in the evening, at night or at the weekend and they are
sent to the wrong 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 345<a class="bkMark" name="Column345">&#160;</a>
                           </div>hospital, their chances of survival are far worse than if such an
incident happens during the day and they go to a major trauma unit. In
fact, when considering the quality of care for trauma services, there
is an awful lot that we could learn from what happens to some of our
troops abroad. In the NHS, we have not got to the standard of quality
of care in trauma services that we need.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The problem
with the Bill is that it is not clear where responsibility lies for
major service reconfiguration. I know that the Government have said
that GP commissioning consortia can either group together or that one
of the partners can take the lead on service reconfigurations in their
particular area. I remind Members of the evidence that we heard from
Stephen Thornton of the Health Foundation, who said that all the
research into lots of different experiences of giving GPs more control
over commissioning shows that GPs are good at changing and developing
community and primary care services, because those are the services
they know about, but the evidence that they have successfully led large
hospital reconfigurations is, at best, lacking. That point was also
made by Nigel Edwards of the NHS Confederation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
worry that GPs might not have the skills to carry out major
reconfigurations of services quickly. Strategic health authorities have
led many major service reconfigurations. I know that some members of
the Committee feel that those reconfigurations have not been done as
well as they might have been done, but I have already cited the example
of stroke care in London, which was led by NHS London. That
reconfiguration was very difficult and challenging, but it is already
saving lives and improving patient outcomes. However, if SHAs go, who
will lead major service reconfigurations?<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The hon. Lady defends SHAs and, judging from her
argument, she says that bigger is always better. However, if we have
only regional centres, we will not develop key services in local
district general hospitals that will save lives. A good example of that
is in heart care with angioplasty intervention, which is the gold
standard. However, because of this “bigger is better”
approach, that standard has been lost in many DGHs. That standard is
what we should be developing in DGHs. Does she accept that it is a good

                           </strong> First, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would
never wish to put words in my mouth but I certainly never used the
phrase, “Bigger is always better”. Secondly, of course
providers need to develop and improve their own services, but he is
highlighting another issue. DGHs will want to develop the best possible
care and services they can, but should that always be led by local
DGHs? If we believe that regional centres need to lead on highly
specialised care, for example trauma services, do we not need a more
planned approach in some cases? That is my concern. In a much more
market-led environment, in which a body wants to attract as many
patients to its hospital as possible because that is what gives it the
money to survive, we 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 346<a class="bkMark" name="Column346">&#160;</a>
                           </div>may end up with many DGHs attempting to develop some services that we
need to be in more specialised centres. I do not think that it is an
either/or, but we need some regional level planning capacity if we are
to improve care.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The trouble
is that it is not clear where responsibility will lie. One thing that
patients and the public have always found frustrating in the NHS is
finding out who is responsible. Where does the decision lie and who is
responsible for taking it? The amendment seeks to make it clear that
responsibility for leading the big service reconfigurations lies with
the board. We may come on to whether that board should have offices at
a regional level, but in the amendment the responsibility will lie with
the board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
an issue about consultation. If providers lead service reconfiguration,
there is concern that they will not be required to consult publicly on
changes to non-designated services. The Government’s response to
the White Paper consultation stated that there does not have to be
public consultation on changes to non-designated services. The problem
is that at the moment we do not know which services will be designated.
That is up to Monitor. When asked who will designate and how it will
happen, Monitor, in evidence to the Committee, said that it did not
know because it had not written the guidelines. This is a real
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Designated
services could cover a very large number of hospital services, in which
case it would not, in the Government’s mind, promote
competition. Designated services could cover a very narrow set of
services, which would allow more competition, of which, I am sure, the
Government are in favour, but, in that case, there could be big changes
to a lot of services without any public consultation. Will providers be
able to change non-designated services without public consultation? I
hope that the Minister will be able to answer that question.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
part of the amendment gives the NHS commissioning board clear
responsibility for reconfiguration. That is not to argue that it would
not involve GP consortia or that the providers would not also have an
important role, but if we are to make the changes that we desperately
need to services such as trauma care, and make them quickly, someone
should have clear responsibility. That is what the amendment
delivers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000186">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments relate to giving the NHS commissioning board additional
duties under clause 5 to lead in service reconfiguration in areas over
which it has commissioning responsibility, and to have regard to the
principles and values of the NHS constitution. The NHS commissioning
board has a strong role to play at 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 347<a class="bkMark" name="Column347">&#160;</a>
                           </div>local level, taking into account local needs and reflecting the values
of the NHS constitution in its actions. Proposals for the
reconfiguration of services are predominantly a matter for the NHS
locally, working in conjunction with clinicians, patients and other
stakeholders. That would apply equally to changes in those services for
which the NHS commissioning board is
responsible.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
clause 19, under proposed new section 13L to the 2006 Act, the
commissioning board would be required to involve service users when
developing its plans for commissioning arrangements, just as primary
care trusts and strategic health authorities are currently required to
do. That includes being clear about the implications that the change
may have for existing services. If the commissioning board proposed
changes that would have a significant impact on the way in which
services are delivered, or on the range of services available to
people, it would be required to involve patients and their
representatives in the development and consideration of the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
NHS commissioning board will also be an active partner in health and
well-being boards. Health and well-being boards will be able to require
representatives of the commissioning board to attend meetings about
their local commissioning responsibilities. The commissioning board
will also participate in the preparation of joint strategic needs
assessments and local joint health and well-being strategies, enabling
democratic and transparent input into the intentions of the
commissioning board. Just like GP consortia, the commissioning board
must decide which of the services that it is responsible for
commissioning should be designated services. In practice, it is likely
that many of the secondary care services that the board will commission
will need to be designated.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 69
will require the NHS commissioning board to consult relevant local
people and local authorities on its proposals for designating services,
and to keep those decisions under review. If the board proposed to make
substantial changes to designated services, the local authority
scrutiny powers would apply and the commissioning board would have to
consult the relevant local authority. Those duties will ensure that the
board takes fully into account the needs and views of the people who
deliver and receive the services it commissions, and that the
commissioning board will be central to any changes affecting those
services for which it is responsible. Therefore, the amendment is
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000193">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that I can offer reassurance on the second part of the amendment.
We are unshakably committed to the principles of the NHS as set out in
the NHS constitution. All NHS bodies will continue to be required by
law to have regard to the NHS constitution when carrying out their
functions. Schedule 5 to the Bill amends the Health Act 2009 so that
the NHS commissioning board, and commissioning consortia, will have a
duty to have regard to the NHS constitution. It is our intention that
the board will play a leading role in promoting awareness of the NHS

could be a non-designated service in a hospital or primary community

substantial service change for those services that it commissions, such

certainly be looking forward to the wonderfully accurate reporting of

Minister said that he suspected that A and Es would not be designated
in London. If that is his view, Opposition Members might disagree with
it, but at least he should be consistent. When they were in Opposition,
present Ministers and Secretaries of State should not have been
standing behind people with placards saying that their hospitals, A and
Es and maternity services would be closed if the designation of those
services is not to be wide.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000216">&#160;</a>

the debate so far—something that we will come back to when we
discuss the process for designated services or lack thereof—is
that it is unclear how things will happen, who will be responsible or
how many services will be covered. That is at the heart of the Bill and
why there are worries about the confusion about how services will be
reconfigured, which ones will be protected, who has responsibility and
how patients or the public will have a

is no doubt that GPs and other health professionals have a vital role
to play in deciding the future shape of services. However, when I
worked with the NHS as director of the ambulance service network, a PCT
within each region took responsibility for commissioning ambulance
care. When that started, the PCTs had little understanding, knowledge
or experience of what happened in regional ambulance service trusts,
which led to a lot of frustration between providers, which would say to
the PCTs, “You don’t understand what we’re
doing,” and PCTs, which would say to providers, “You
can’t just direct and order us around. We have responsibility
for looking after patients and the public.” If there are
problems, as there are up and down the country, which lead PCTs have
taken the time to develop the knowledge to resolve, how many more
problems will there be when GP consortia are established and set up? I
am not yet convinced that the responsibility for huge reconfigurations
of stroke, cancer and heart disease care should lie with GP-led
consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000224">&#160;</a>

have finished, he will make it clear to Members how that process will
take place. I believe that the non-executives on the board will make
the appointment, but the chair, the key non-executive member, who will
have been directly appointed by the Secretary of State, will have key
influence and say over who the chief executive of the board will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000262">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Lady said, amendment 47 would require
the appointment of the chairman and non-executive members to be made by
the Appointments Commission rather than by the Secretary of State.
However, the Secretary of State has always had responsibility for
making public appointments to both local and national health bodies.
The hon. Lady knows this well because she served as a special adviser
in the Department of Health in the middle part of the previous decade,
working for a Secretary of State who enjoyed such powers herself. At
the time, it did not seem to be a problem to the then Secretary of
State or the then Government, and we share that
view.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
any case, even when powers of appointment have been delegated to the
Appointments Commission for the majority of public appointments, the
Secretary of State has retained powers in terms of appointments to a
number of the most central bodies, such as Monitor and the Care Quality
Commission. In those circumstances, it has been the norm for the
Appointments Commission to manage the recruitment process and for the
Secretary of State to make the appointment. I am happy to confirm that
that is how public appointments to the NHS commissioning board will
also be handled. There will be a role for the Appointments Commission
in supporting the recruitment of the chair of the NHS commissioning
board, but I think hon. Members will also be aware that as a result of
the review of arm’s length bodies, the Appointments Commission
will be abolished. Therefore, all future appointments will be handled
by the Department, as is the case now in other Departments and in
accordance with guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public
Appointments. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment, and I
ask my hon. Friends to join me in opposing it if it is pressed to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000265">&#160;</a>

the Secretary of State under the previous Government—whom I was

appointing the chief executive, yes she did so, because there was no
independent NHS board. The Department of Health had that
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000266">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Following the Government’s logic, if they
want an entirely independent NHS board, it is important that there is a
fair, open and transparent process for appointing both the chair and
the chief executive, which is what the amendment seeks to establish. If
and when the Appointments Commission is abolished, the Department of
Health will appoint the chair of the board, so how will the Department
be held accountable? How will Parliament have any knowledge or scrutiny
of that process? The Government cannot have it both ways, with an
entirely independent board and a chair appointed by the Department of
Health. Which officials within the Department would be involved? Would
they not be influenced by the Secretary of State, and want to please
him or her? This is such an important change, and it does not make
sense that the appointment be made by a civil servant, although I am
sure that many of them are
independent-minded.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000268">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The aim of the amendments is to ensure that the
NHS board has the full range of voices, skills and expertise it needs
to do its job properly. I want to highlight five key points. The NHS
board is going to be leading the future provision of health services in
this country. It is important that not only we in this House are
convinced it has the full range of voices around the table, but that
crucially patients, members of the public and staff within the NHS are.
Winning hearts and minds is important. Feeling that one has a
representative ensuring that one’s views are heard around the
board is important. From my own experience—as the Minister keeps
mentioning—of working within the Department, I know that that is
important for people working in the system. They want to know that
their voices are around the table, because they often feel they are not
always heard.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000284">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
believe in tokenism. It would be wonderful in any walk of life if
people always stood up for every one of their colleagues, but that does
not always happen. The amendments seek to ensure that the people who
need to be round the table are. The first seeks to ensure that a work
force representative, drawn from and elected by the staff side council
representatives on the NHS staff council is on the board. Maybe the
Minister will tell us if he has been to talk to the NHS staff council
about the changes in the Bill. The staff council does very important
work. It is crucial to work closely with the trade unions, as their
members will play a big role in implementing some of the changes. The
amendment calls for a representative elected by members of that council
to be on the NHS board. That is very important—I am trying to be
helpful—if the Minister wants to see his policies implemented.
It is vital to work with the staff side council and draw on its skills
and
expertise.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the amendment seeks to ensure there is a registered nurse on the NHS
board. Many of us will have had strong representations from individual
nurses and the Royal College of Nursing. I do not doubt that the
Government believe that nurses should be involved. However, by not
having it clearly specified either that the NHS board or the
commissioning consortia will have a registered a nurse, makes nurses
very concerned. That is why the amendment seeks to clarify that there
has to be a registered nurse on that board. The Prime Minister said in
the <em>Telegraph </em>that he believes that nurses can and should be
involved. I urge the Government to make that a reality by putting it in
the Bill. The skills, expertise and experience of nurses are vital, as
I am sure the Minister will agree. In that case, I am sure he will have
no objection to ensuring that a nurse is on the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third issue, addressed by amendment 48, is to have at least one other
member appointed by the Local Government Association. My experience of
working in the health service is that there may well always be a member
from local government involved, either at local or national level.
However, it is important that that is not just seen as the token local
government or social care person around the table.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The fourth
point, in amendment 49, is that at least two people on the board should
be appointed by HealthWatch England to represent patient involvement.
Having a clear voice on the board for patients and the public,
appointed by HealthWatch England—if it ends up being established
as a result of the Bill—which is supposed to be independent,
would be a hugely important and useful addition. No doubt the Minister
will say that the board will involve patients and the public, but I
think that they want something more than that—they want
representatives at the
table.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
it is crucial that at least one of the non-executive members of the
board has expertise or experience in relation to the commissioning of
research in the health service. One of the many brilliant things about
the NHS is its capacity, which we probably have not used as much as we
could have, to conduct some of the highest-quality research. I have no
doubt that many members of the board will understand that, but we need
someone who has far more in-depth experience of the type of research
that the NHS can and should conduct, to ensure that  it remains
a world leader in this field. That would be hugely
beneficial.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As I said at
the beginning, there is sometimes a worry that there is too much
tokenism, with people having places on a board who do not necessarily
need to be there. However, we all know from our own experience that
when we are busy and we have important things on our minds, it helps to
have people there from different backgrounds and with different
perspectives, who will always ensure that those concerns are
heard.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000290">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the Minister will see when we come to later
schedules and amendments, we cover these points there as well. He will
see that within the relevant amendment we say that two medical
practitioners should also be part of the board. I do not want the board
to end up having people on it for the sake of it, but I do believe that
the amendments would, by making explicit provision in the Bill, ensure
that all staff and patients were fully represented and that they saw
that that was happening and did not have to rely on trust
alone.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000292">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This group of amendments would make changes to the
proposed membership of the commissioning board. I can understand the
arguments made by the hon. Lady, as they all relate to how the board
can best live up to its potential. I agree with hon. Members when they
say that key to the effectiveness of the commissioning board will be
the involvement of patients and the public and having effective working
arrangements with local
government.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000293">&#160;</a>

what we are discussing today is the legislative framework in which the
board will operate. As we have discussed in relation to previous

allowing the commissioning board to tailor its structures to best meet
the job that it has to

against dentists and professions supplementary to medicine. May I pose
this question to the Minister? What does he have against doctors in
secondary care? We heard evidence from the Royal College of Surgeons
and various others, and I am sure that there would be agreement among
those on the Government Benches, that having a skilled professional
with expertise in designing integrated care pathways would add value to
the commissioning

not quite get there. However, those are not the issues that we are

together, the amendments would mean that the non-executive membership
of the board would have to include a medical practitioner, a registered
nurse, at least one person with expertise in research, at least one
person drawn from the NHS staff council and yet another person
appointed by the Local Government Association. In addition, the

                        <p class="tabbed">We have
repeatedly stated our intention that there should be clinical
professional leadership on the NHS commissioning board. It will be
vital that there is clinical input in all areas of the board’s
work. Indeed, new section 13G, which will be inserted in the National
Health Service Act 2006, would require the board to make arrangements
with a view to securing that it obtains appropriate advice from people
with clinical, professional expertise to enable it to perform its
functions effectively. However, we have not sought to specify in the
Bill exactly what form that should take. One role of the commissioning
board is to decide that, and we trust in the decision that it will come
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000300">&#160;</a>

the board, be they the non-execs appointed by the Secretary of State or
the executive members, will in practice need a range of skills and
experience appropriate to dealing with the issues faced by the board.
Specifying that certain members should have particular backgrounds not
only overrides the board’s autonomy, but will invite perfectly
valid criticisms that one group is being prioritised over another,
which could, indeed, limit the pool of experience available to the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000301">&#160;</a>

Member for Leicester West made her introductory comments, I asked about
the representation of dentists, pharmacists and allied health
professionals—I could go on. Do they not have just as legitimate
a right to say that they should be represented on the board? In
reality, the NHS commissioning board must have the freedom to determine
how best to ensure that all those varied and legitimate interests are
involved and represented in its work.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000302">&#160;</a>

the board will have the freedom to appoint as many committees as it
considers appropriate and to decide who should sit on them. There is no
reason whatever for all these different interest groups to be
represented in the board’s membership. However, they will be
able to take part in the board’s committees as and when the
board believes that that would be useful, helpful and
relevant.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000303">&#160;</a>

responsible for £80 billion of taxpayers’ money, but
given the old adage about knowing the price of everything and the value

of the commissioning board, the right hon. Gentleman
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000310">&#160;</a>

myself rather surprised to say it, but I wholeheartedly agreed with the

                           </strong> If the right hon. Gentleman looks through the Bill
and the White Paper, he will see considerable opportunities for
consultation at all levels of the national health service and the
provision of care, not only now but under the modernisation of the NHS.
I do not want to get distracted and fall foul of you, Mr Hood, but what
we are doing in many ways is empowering patients, which is a form of
consultation, so that they too will be able to take a far more direct
interest and, through the exercise of choice, have greater involvement
in the provision of their health care.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
48, 49 and 78 would all involve members of the board being appointed by
outside agencies. That has the serious potential to confuse lines of
accountability and, indeed, to undermine the independence of those
bodies. Let us take the example of HealthWatch. The Government fully
support the need for greater public and patient involvement in the
design and delivery of care services. Our vision for HealthWatch
England is clear: to operate as the national champion for patients and
members of the public, by presenting their collective consumer voice on
health and social care services and influencing relevant bodies to
improve the quality and safety of those services. In doing so we intend
that HealthWatch England will have the power to provide advice and
information on the views and experiences of patients and members of the
public to, amongst other bodies, the NHS commissioning board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000316">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Within that
context, it would be entirely inappropriate for HealthWatch England to
have a role in determining the membership of an organisation to which
it will have a statutory power to provide advice. To place that
responsibility on HealthWatch England would, rightly, lead to
accusations of a conflict of interest, calling into question the
integrity of an organisation, itself designed to represent the views of
members of the public.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000317">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The same is
true of amendment 48, which would require at least one member to be
appointed by the Local Government Association. I recognise that hon.
Members are seeking some reassurance that local government interests
will be represented on the board, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 360<a class="bkMark" name="Column360">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and I am happy to provide that. Clause 19 includes a duty on the board
to exercise its functions with a view to encouraging integrated working
between consortia and local authorities. Schedule 4 also preserves the
powers in the National Health Service Act 2006 for NHS bodies, which
will include the commissioning board, to enter partnership arrangements
with local authorities and to make services and facilities available to
them to support delivery of those services. In addition, under the new
provisions in part 5 of the Bill, health and well-being boards will be
able to require the commissioning board to attend meetings in relation
to its local commissioning responsibilities. The commissioning board
will also have a duty to participate in the preparation of the joint
strategic needs assessments and local joint health and well-being
strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000318">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those are the
practical measures whereby we will ensure close working between the NHS
and local government. I believe that they, rather than giving the Local
Government Association powers to appoint members of a national board,
are the way to achieve true integration. Although I am happy to confirm
again that we intend there to be a wide range of experience, including
clinical representation, on the commissioning board, it is not
appropriate or necessary to set out in the Bill the form that that
should take. I ask my hon. Friends to oppose the amendments if they are
put to a

will be an extremely powerful body. It will have control over pretty
much the entire NHS budget, even if not directly, because it will be
responsible for commissioning primary care services locally, or with
primary care commissioning consortia, as well as those national
services. As it is such a powerful body, it is extremely important that
the Government’s arrangements for it are looked at carefully. I
listened carefully to the hon. Member for Leicester West when she spoke
to her amendments and to my right hon. Friend the Minister when he
responded. I agree that the Bill is not the right place to set out
specific bodies that are allowed to put forward people for the board,
but the matter of the board’s accountability is not sufficiently
clear. I would like the Government to consider how accountability could
be better
maintained.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000320">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
chair of the board is appointed by the Secretary of State, as are the
other non-executive members. The Secretary of State has power to remove
those members from the board in certain circumstances. We have talked
about not wishing to micro-manage the NHS, and I entirely agree with
that. The whole thrust of the Bill is in that direction, which is
welcome, but there is a bit of a conflict in my mind—I am sure
that I can be disabused of it, but I would like reassurance and perhaps
some movement on it—between our wishing to get away from
micro-management and at the same time having all the non-executive
members of the board appointed directly by the Secretary of State, who
can also remove
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000321">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
return to the powers of the board, in his evidence Sir David Nicholson
said, in response to the right hon. Member for Rother Valley, that the
board would have to have people on the ground throughout the country,
because it could not be expected to take decisions in Rotherham for
Leeds or Burnley. The board will be very powerful and—I mean
this in the nicest possible way—it will have its tentacles in
every part of England. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 361<a class="bkMark" name="Column361">&#160;</a>
                           </div>We therefore need some clear accountability for the board. At the
moment, accountability is, understandably, to the Secretary of State. I
am sure that the Minister will make the point that the Secretary of
State is responsible to Parliament, and that there is therefore a clear
line of accountability. I would like to see a little more
accountability to Parliament, in the same way that local GP consortia
will be more accountable to local health and well-being boards at
district
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000322">&#160;</a>

suggested by the amendments, one way to do that would be for the Royal
College of Physicians or the Royal College of Nursing to appoint
members, or some such procedure. I agree with the Minister that that
would be cumbersome and would prompt the question of who is left out,
rather than of who is included, but  I urge the Government to
consider making the appointments—particularly of the chair, or
perhaps  of all the non-executives—subject to some sort
of parliamentary scrutiny, so that Parliament can be assured that the
make-up of the board, which is in the hands of the Secretary of State,
accurately reflects what Parliament believes is in the interests of the
nation, and so that that vital body can commission services as well as
possible for the

carefully to what he and the Minister said about not wanting every
single person who might be involved in the NHS commissioning board to
have a representative on it, but the experience within the NHS over a
long time has been that certain groups end up
dominating.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reason why nurses feel so passionately and strongly that they want a
representative on the board is that they feel that their voices have
not been heard. The reason why it is important that local government
should have strong representation is that, although someone from social
care is often involved—just as, in the Department, we have the
fantastic director general of social care—that is only one
person, who always has to be the person who makes the rules known. The
reason why it is important that patients and the public are on the
board is that, although there are many passionate patient groups, the
experience is that the professional groups sometimes
dominate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
fact that at the moment there is complete freedom for the board to
decide who is represented on it worries people. The Government say
that, for patients and the public, it believes in “no decision
about me without me”, but that is not guaranteed in the NHS
commissioning board. They say they want to involve clinicians more
closely in the commissioning of services, but the Minister does not
want to have medical practitioners or a registered nurse on the board.
They say they want closer working with local government, but that is
not enshrined in the legislation. The Minister has said that the
Government’s intention is that all those different groups should
be involved. If that is their intention, it should be included on the
face of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000326">&#160;</a>

accountability to Parliament of the board and the appointments process.
The amendments bring together many of the concerns that have been
raised today about how Parliament can be assured that the people on a
very important and powerful board, which will ultimately be responsible
for £80 billion of taxpayers’ money and which could have
people working in all parts of the country, are the right people with
the right skills, and that they can be held to account.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000351">&#160;</a>

State—subsequent to present one, with which the Appointments
Commission has been involved. As I said before, the two principal
figures on the board  will therefore be politically
influenced—influenced, not driven—appointments. Several
organisations have expressed concerns about that. The British Medical
Association, for example, is unsure whether the board will be able to
operate autonomously and be free from political control. It also says
that the NHS commissioning board’s appointments process must be
distanced from the Secretary of State otherwise the ability of the

concern is how the board can be better held to account for its actions
and activities by Parliament. To ensure that the board’s
appointments process is fair, these amendments propose placing a check
on the power of the Secretary of State. By legislating to ensure that
Parliament has the power to confirm key appointments to the board, it
will help to ensure that the Secretary of State’s political
influence on the appointments process is subject to proper checks and
balances. It will also allow Parliament to assess whether the key
individuals who will be driving change and helping determine the
spending of £80 billion of taxpayers’ money
are performing in the best
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000353">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
amendment 79, the key appointments would be subject to confirmation by
the Select Committee on Health. It is important to understand that
although the board itself has not yet come into existence and the way
in which key officers will be appointed is only just being debated, the
Government have already begun the process of making those appointments.
The amendments will ensure not only that the Secretary of State has a
key role, which is important, but that the appointments are monitored
and endorsed by Parliament. That would lead to a more open and balanced
appointment process.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000354">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
on both sides of the House have been keen to see the role of Select
Committees enhanced. As I understand it, for the first time their
members are elected; that is an important development and one that hon.
Members appreciate. This amendment will take us a stage further and
allow—just as in the United States—the Select Committees
to affirm and confirm key appointments to powerful roles. That is so
important. If the NHS board is to be a more independent and autonomous
body, it is vital that Members of this House, through the Health
Committee, have a role in confirming those
appointments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000355">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have a lot of sympathy with amendment
79, but less with amendment 51, which would require the Health
Committee to affirm the appointment of executive directors. Those
appointments are to be made by the non-executive directors, who
themselves will be affirmed by the Health Committee. The Health
Committee’s affirmation cannot go down through all levels, but I
certainly support those whom the Secretary of State appoints directly
being affirmed by the Health Committee. I will give a couple of
examples of where Parliament has already been given greater powers in
the affirmation of such appointments—we do not seek the power of
appointment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000356">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My first
example is the Treasury Committee, which has a role in affirming the
membership of the Office for Budget Responsibility; my second example
is the Select Committee on International Development, on which I sit,
which was responsible for affirming the appointment of the chair and
possibly the other members of the independent aid watchdog. There are
therefore precedents for such affirmations. As a firm believer in the
sovereignty of the Queen in Parliament, I believe that Select
Committees, whose members are now elected, as the hon. Member for
Leicester West said, should have more responsibility for scrutiny of
Government. We have a good opportunity to do that. To sum up, as I have

                           </strong> The amendments would change the Bill’s
provision for the appointment of members to the NHS commissioning
board. Once again, these amendments seem at odds with the direction of
other amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Leicester West. Her
amendments have consistently taken issue with our plans to promote
autonomy in the NHS. We wish to remove the broad and extensive general
powers to intervene in the NHS currently held by the Secretary of State
and replace them with a few specific and limited
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000358">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State, of course, remains accountable to Parliament for
the provision of the comprehensive health service. As I have explained
on previous occasions, the Bill strengthens that accountability. For
the first time, the Secretary of State will have to report each year on
the performance of the health service and consult publicly on the
annual objectives set for the NHS through the mandate. The
commissioning board will be accountable to the Secretary of State for
delivering against that mandate. These amendments would remove one of
the key planks of that accountability, which is the freedom for the
Secretary of State to appoint the people who will be responsible for
overseeing a large proportion of the health service
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000359">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
52 would remove the requirement for the Secretary of State to approve
the appointment of the commissioning board’s chief executive.
The permanent head of the Department is the principal accounting
officer and has overall responsibility for the Department’s
funds and use of those funds. Chief executives of non-departmental
public bodies and arm’s length bodies are appointed accounting
officers in their own right to ensure that they too can be called to
account for the resources allocated to them by the Secretary of State
and Parliament. The chief executive of the NHS commissioning board will
be the accounting officer for the commissioning budget and, therefore,
it is entirely appropriate that the Secretary of State should approve
his or her
appointment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000360">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
remaining amendments would require that the appointment of all members
of the commissioning board be subject to the approval of the Health
Committee. All Departments are required to ensure that appointments are
open, transparent and made on merit. The Commissioner for Public
Appointments regulates the processes by which Ministers make
appointments to the boards of certain public bodies in England and
Wales. That will continue to be the case, but it is not Government

of ways. Before the formal confirmation of the head of the Care Quality
Commission, she went before the current Select Committee on Health to
discuss how she saw her role and the way forward under her stewardship.
Such a case would be up to the Health Committee. Similarly,
pre-appointment hearings apply for the Independent Commission for Aid
Impact, dealt with by the Select Committee on International
Development. The same process applied as with the interviews for the
CQC head by the Health
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000363">&#160;</a>

different.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000364">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I speak in support of the amendments,
following the excellent arguments made earlier by my hon. Friend the
Member for Leicester West. The amendments are designed to shed light on
what look like yet more hurried elements of the Bill by addressing
procedure or the lack thereof, the Secretary of State’s leverage
and how it might be kept in check.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000384">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to remove or suspend a
non-executive member of the NHS commissioning board whenever he or she
deems necessary on grounds of incapacity, misbehaviour or failure to
carry out his or her duties. However, the Bill does not make it
explicit whether the non-executive member has the right to appeal. At
present, no appropriate checks and balances have been built into the
Bill. At the very least, the amendment does not undermine the powers
prescribed for the Secretary of State and applies a necessary, moderate
and just check to those powers to ensure that justice may be served for
all parties
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000386">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Tier
1 or first-tier tribunals are generic tribunals with jurisdiction over
a range of appeals. In other words, they are not specific to one area
of appeals, such as immigration, pensions and so on. The tribunals
cover a number of health matters, and first-tier tribunals include a
health, education and social care chamber. First-tier tribunals are
also mentioned in various other parts of the Bill in relation to
appeals against rulings. Without the amendment the Bill looks arbitrary
and lacking in due process rather than liberating.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000387">&#160;</a>

                        <p>My
colleagues and I fear that without a requirement for the explicit,
unqualified agreement of the board chairman, neither the appropriate
board chairman nor the board will have the means to operate
autonomously, free of direct micro-management, political influence and
top-down control by the Secretary of State. The NHS commissioning board
process must retain, maintain and sustain a degree of autonomous
accountability for decisions on any appointments and dismissal
procedural decisions. It is crucial that a degree of checks and
balances on the Secretary of State’s powers are clear, so that
the board

                           </div>and its chair remain suitably distanced from the Secretary of State.
Otherwise, the ability of the board to operate effectively and
transparently will be severely limited. This amendment, for example,
avoids a potential conflict of interest where a Secretary of State has
power to impose regulations on the NHS commissioning board and
consortia without the board’s consultation or agreement. Where
disagreements between boards and Secretaries of State occur, it will be
fundamentally crucial for a board’s chair to work in
partnership, not in subjugation, with the Secretary of State, otherwise
trust and partnership in the arrangements disintegrate in and outside
the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000389">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
81 restores transparency to the process, and ensures that Parliament
can act as the appropriate body to provide the necessary oversight for
any recommendations brought by the Secretary of State. The Bill has
neither any examples of what a Secretary of State may have in mind, nor
a scale of remuneration, which only leads me to the conclusion that it
would be brought to bear in an arbitrary, or indeed ad hoc, fashion by
the Secretary of State. Will the Minister give us a structure, or an
example, of what a Secretary of State might have in mind? Can he give
us scales of remuneration that a Secretary of State could turn to, or
what models of best practice, to which the Minister may refer, could be
stipulated? Any such answers would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000390">&#160;</a>

amendments deals with matters concerning terms of appointment,
remuneration and functions of non-executive members. Once again, the
amendments seem to run

			Column number: 370<a class="bkMark" name="Column370">&#160;</a>
                           </div>counter to the arguments made by Opposition Members, that the Secretary
of State should be personally accountable for the provision of services
in the NHS. They would remove the Secretary of State’s powers to
hold the non-executives on the board accountable for their conduct and
performance, and to determine their pay and remuneration. Before I deal
with the individual amendments, I should point out that the provisions
on appointments and dismissals of non-executives, as set out in the
schedule, are common to many arm’s-length bodies. They do not
represent radical new policy and are similar to procedures carried out
under the previous Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000394">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 54
would require there to be a right of appeal to a tier 1 tribunal where
a non-executive is removed from office. The Bill sets out clear
criteria for the Secretary of State to remove a non-executive member on
the grounds of incapacity, misbehaviour or failure to carry out his or
her duties as a non-executive member. Those criteria are common across
other arm’s-length bodies within the remit of the Department of
Health. They do not include statutory rights of appeal, because
non-executive appointments do not represent an employment contract. The
usual employment legislation, therefore, does not apply. Nevertheless,
we would expect that all reasonable routes would have been exhausted
before the decision to dismiss someone was reached. If taking a
decision to remove someone from office, the Secretary of State would
have to act fairly and reasonably in any event. The standard procedures
that currently apply in practice require that the individual should
have the chance to request a review of the recommendation and to make
their case in writing before a final decision is reached, and we would
expect that to continue to be the case. Ultimately, the non-executive
would have the right to challenge the decision to remove them from
office by way of a judicial
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11030158000395">&#160;</a>
