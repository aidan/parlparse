Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill
<P>
<H5>8.55 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> Good morning, Mr. Maxton. First, let me thank the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) for giving me notice of his intention to oppose clause stand part. He is revisiting an issue that he raised when moving the Opposition's amendment on Second Reading, an amendment that was rejected comprehensively by the House. However, I agree with one remark that he made at the time, which was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The last thing that the internet needs is an interfering regulator.''—[Official Report, 29 November 1999; Vol. 340, c.54.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill is not about regulating the internet. That is neither possible nor desirable. The internet is regulated in the same way as other aspects of our lives, because the same law applies in the familiar off-line environment as in the on-line environment. Our aim is to introduce specific regulation relating to electronic matters only if that is absolutely necessary and justified.
<P>
There is widespread agreement in the industry that a kitemark for cryptography services is needed to boost confidence and build trust, and there is broad support for the Government's approach of favouring self-regulation. We are debating the reserve option—the statutory default, the powers that the Government will use if self-regulation fails. If we have to use those powers, part I of the Bill will not allow us to regulate the internet as a whole. It will allow us to act in the narrow matter of providing a voluntary approval scheme for cryptography service providers.
<P>
If we decided to implement the statutory reserve powers, who would exercise them? The Government previously suggested that Oftel would be the most appropriate body and, at present, we think that it will be. It has expertise in regulating the telecommunications sector, which has many similarities to the sector under discussion. Many telecommunication companies propose to offer cryptography services directly or in collaboration with other companies. Oftel also has experience of representing the interests of consumers and balancing them against the interests of industry. It has broad technical expertise and would be able to subcontract particular aspects of technical assessment. Bringing in Oftel's existing expertise would be a cost-effective use of resources and, if we were setting up a statutory scheme, it would be the most likely choice of approvals authority.
<P>
However, we propose to hold the possibility of a statutory scheme in reserve. If it is ever implemented, it could be some years hence and other bodies such as the Financial Services Authority or even the Data Protection Registrar might be equally or more suitable regulators. We would have to weigh up the pros and cons of choosing a particular body in the light of the circumstances. That is why the provision allows the flexibility to delegate to other bodies, rather than specifying a body that is most suitable now, but may not be in the future. Delegating the functions to a statutory body might require changes in the statutory provisions for that body and the clause provides that any such changes would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The House would be given the opportunity to debate the matter and to scrutinise explicitly the Government's choice of approvals authority. I hope that I have adequately summarised the purpose of clause 3 and persuaded the Committee to allow it to stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): The clause is one of the dodgiest in the Bill. It is open-ended; it gives the Secretary of State the freedom to appoint virtually anyone to be the regulatory person or body under part I, which is utterly unnecessary. I shall not revisit the arguments for not wanting part I, but should its provisions ever be invoked, clause 3 will be the most unsatisfactory provision in it.
<P>
We are not debating simply a reserve option. As the Minister pointed out, we are debating the nature of that reserve option. Clause 3 allows the Secretary of State to appoint pretty well anybody as regulator, although we believe that ``regulator'' is the wrong word and we hope that it will remain an inaccurate description of what that body or person will do.
<P>
The provision is very unclear. If the Secretary of State was so inclined, a new structure could be created, perhaps called the Office of Cryptography—Ofcrypt or Ofweb. It is, as yet, undefined, unexplained and unspecified. It would be open to the whim of the Secretary of State. A body such as Ofweb or Ofcrypt would be excessive even it was separate from the Department of Trade and Industry, but what fills me with most foreboding is that the job might be given to Oftel.
<P>
Oftel regulates prices with an inflation-minus formula and it issues telecommunications licences. It is now reviewing that process. Its ethos is one of pretty heavy regulation, which came about in the wake of the privatisation of the British telecommunications industry. Such an approach, with the necessary duplication of personnel, would be a grave mismatch. Oftel would be the wrong body to give the light touch promised by the Minister for the regulation of trust service providers, cryptography and the workings of the internet.
<P>
I seek an assurance that Oftel will not be used. It is not the right body. Indeed, we are not sure that such regulation needs a specially structured organisation, with its own offices and staff. Such an organisation would be one step removed from the scrutiny of the House. The light touch that the Minister promised could equally well be provided by an official in the Department, a few doors down the corridor in the DTI building from the Minister's office. The Minister would thus be directly responsible to Parliament only for the few simple decisions that might need to be taken under the Bill. That would not necessitate a separate office. If it was suggested that it did, I should be gravely concerned that the proposed regulation would become unduly heavy-handed and complicated—and, what is more, one step removed from parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
I accept that the setting up of Ofweb or Ofcrypt, or whatever else it might be called, will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. We welcome the fact that both Houses of Parliament would be able to scrutinise such a change, but such a change could be slipped through in the dead of night. I fear that it would involve much more regulation than the Minister is prepared to admit. I take in good faith her statement that she does not want heavy-handed regulation, but the Bill is structured in such a way that it could creep in.
<P>
If internet access charges are thought to be too high, or if other matters are thought to be wrong, we shall start receiving campaign postcards legitimately demanding that changes are made. Politics will then take over, and Ministers will flex their muscles and say, ``Do not worry, we shall regulate it.'' As soon as that happens, a statutory instrument will be made to set up Ofcrypt—or to change the powers of Oftel.
<P>
The explanatory notes on clause 3 state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Subsection (4) provides that where the functions are delegated to a statutory body or office holder''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as the Minister pointed out, that means one that already exists, such as Oftel—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the statutes relating to their original functions shall be modified to include the new functions so delegated.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, clear and open provision has been made, as the Economic Secretary said, for Oftel to assume the powers and responsibilities of regulating the sector in a way that we do not advocate. Oftel would be the worst possible organisation to assume that responsibility.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman's argument with all the attention that it requires. Is it his view that such supervision should be the responsibility of someone in the Department, consistent with what I understood to be his view that political involvement in the decision was undesirable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but an impartial official in the Department of Trade and Industry is entirely reliable and should not be as political as the hon. Gentleman suggests. An entirely new apparatus for regulation is unnecessary; a professional civil servant in the DTI would suffice. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that, by being so proximate to Ministers, officials would be infected by Ministers' political purpose such that they could not be relied on, he is wrong. A separate office could be created—Ofcrypt or Ofweb, perhaps—that was not immediately accountable to the House of Commons, so that when Ministers were asked questions they could say that the office was independent and they could not answer for its day-to-day actions. Alternatively, the role could be given to DTI officials, for whose day-to-day actions Ministers are responsible and on which they would have to answer questions on the Floor of the House. I accept the distinction that the hon. Gentleman is making, and there is a trade-off between the two, but the structure that I propose is more satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> On the basis of that argument, would it not be logical to abolish Oftel, Ofwat and the other regulatory bodies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> No, because they have different purposes from those that the Economic Secretary envisages in this case. They relate to the climate of competition in particular industries following the privatisation of state monopolies. The internet is not being similarly privatised, because, thank goodness, it is private already. If it were not, it would never have got off the ground. The last thing that it needs now is for the Government to knock it for six. That is why I am calling for the lightest regulatory touch and the simplest mechanism possible. [Interruption.] I believe that a fan of Al Gore is about to speak.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for writing the United States Government and the Department of Defence out of the internet-origin equation. I am sure that they, too, will be grateful for that. Following his argument about a delegated regulator, how does he feel about the model of the Data Protection Registrar, who is independent but accountable? Would he prefer such a mechanism to the involvement of a body such as Oftel?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a point. To return to Al Gore, the technology may have started with the Government, but its commercial application did not, and it is the commercial application that is proving to be the fantastic revolution that we all support. I do not know enough about the data protection mechanism to say whether that would work. I am trying to extract a clearer signal from the Minister about what she envisages. I am worried that everything that she said in her opening remarks suggests that she wants approval functions to be delegated to Oftel. The existing structure of Oftel is utterly unsuited to the purpose of part I. A different sort of structure and person would be required if this ridiculous part I were ever invoked.
<P>
My plea is for the Minister to give the Committee an assurance that, although she cannot explain in detail what might happen, the organisation involved will not be Oftel.
<P>
The industry has grave concerns that, if it were Oftel, there would be a mismatch. In effect, a schizophrenic organisation would have to take one approach to its existing duties and a completely different one to its new duties under the Bill. Instead of a coincidence of interest between its existing purpose and the new purpose, there could be a conflict of interest. For all those reasons, Oftel is not the appropriate body. I urge the Minister to say that Oftel will not be involved, failing which I shall urge my hon. Friends to vote against the clause.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I share my hon. Friend's concern about delegation of the approval functions to Oftel. I should like to raise one or two points of detail with the Minister. I am sure that, in her typically helpful way, she will be able to help us with them. First, the seventh report of the Trade and Industry Committee quotes the document ``Consultation 99'', in which the Department of Trade and Industry states that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may decide to retain some aspects of licensing within the DTI.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, not all the approval functions will be delegated lock, stock and barrel to Oftel. Some residual licensing functions will remain with the DTI.
<P>
The second important point is whether Oftel can subdelegate approval functions to bodies further down the chain. The DTI referred to that potential pitfall and the Select Committee stated that service providers and their customers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will be confused by the multi-layered design of the proposed statutory licensing regime''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
by which it meant subdelegation after subdelegation.
<P>
The clause provides little guidance on the possibilities for subdelegation. I should like to hear the Minister's thoughts on that point of detail.
<P>
Sifting through the evidence, as is my wont on a cold December evening with my hot chocolate, looking at the rather good DTI reports and the great deal of evidence that has been taken over the past 12 months, I was reminded of what many of the witnesses said about the proposed role for Oftel. The gist of many witnesses' evidence was that Oftel was certainly not best placed to act as the approval authority for service providers.
<P>
As the Select Committee report states, the Institute for the Management of Information Systems argued that the approval of service providers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``should be geared towards consumer protection rather than the regulation of cryptography and that the licensing authority should be the Office of Fair Trading or the Financial Services Authority''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which I thought was an interesting observation.
<P>
British Telecommunications said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it did not believe OFTEL was competent to be a sole regulator of all the issues concerned with cryptography''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Association of Payment Clearing Services
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``told the DTI of its doubts about OFTEL's ability to handle electronic commerce issues''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the evidence from those in the sector is that Oftel is not best placed to deliver what the clause seeks to deliver. The DTI spells out in some detail the precise nature of the functions that Oftel will take on. There is precious little detail in the clause, and nothing at all about Oftel's sub-delegation of the functions that the clause will grant to it. For all those reasons, I shall urge my hon. Friends, who will no doubt make a miraculous appearance in a few minutes, to vote against the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I want to raise the question of who will carry out the approvals. It will be a test of the voluntary registration scheme, which many of us feel is unlikely to be successful or useful. The issue of approvals will be critical in deciding whether the scheme has any value. My concerns are about the technical nature of the approvals system itself. Bodies such as Oftel are unlikely to be capable of approving cryptography schemes or service providers and monitoring them as they go along. It is important, when giving approvals, to be able to give day-to-day reassurance about the effectiveness of a service provider. It will not be simply a question of handing out a certificate and walking away—at least, I hope not, if we are to have a meaningful system. It is well known in cryptography circles that technology—the arms race—is continually advancing. I am sure that there will be constant challenges and threats to those who are established and placed on the approved register that will subsequently render them unsuitable or inappropriate for approval.
<P>
How will approvals be achieved technically, and how will the measure enmesh with the industry generally? We believe that the proposal is unnecessary because the industry itself, for sound commercial reasons, is developing technology and standards. People from financial organisations and internet service providers get together to agree standards. If functions are to be delegated under the scheme, it should be to the industry, rather than to a third party, such as Oftel. They should be delegated to those who are practising out there at present under the standards committee that the industry is setting up.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am aware of the Liberal Democrat desire to remove the Government from all spheres of economic life. Does the hon. Member for Hallam favour the proposition that, as a general principle, all industries should regulate themselves?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Having spent many happy hours under your chairmanship in other Committees, Mr Maxton, I fear that were I to go down that route, I would be hauled back. I shall simply say that the Government are not capable of regulating highly complex and technically evolving industries. They will end up looking stupid if they intervene when the industry has found perfectly good solutions. Cryptography is about people having confidence in electronic commercial transactions. That confidence will come from the industry, not from Government regulation. The Government have accepted that by saying that the scheme is voluntary—they are giving a nod to industry to develop its own systems. I am confident that that will happen. However, it does not necessarily apply in other areas of the law when more Government interference may be necessary to protect individuals.
<P>
To return to the main subject, it is crucial for the Minister to explain whether the clause carries with it the suggestion that the Government may delegate to those industry bodies that already exist, such as the industry standards committee, and allow them to continue the very good work that they have been doing so far, with the major providers agreeing standards amongst themselves. Most of the businesses conducting these activities are international. They are not solely UK-based businesses. Authorisation should be given according to international rather than United Kingdom standards. Would it be possible for the United Kingdom Government to allow approvals by a body not solely based in the United Kingdom? It is crucial to the matter that we are discussing that such a body is based internationally, not in the United Kingdom; it cannot function on a United Kingdom basis. That fact raises important questions about how Ministers delegate powers. Ministers have not traditionally had to pay as much attention to the international dimension as they may now have to in pursuing what are, I hope, our shared aims of promoting electronic commerce and the United Kingdom's involvement in it.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This brief debate has been extremely interesting. I am afraid that I cannot give the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton the assurance that he seeks. I am not prepared at this stage to rule out Oftel as the appropriate candidate for delegation to run a statutory scheme, should one be created. However, I will spell out the stages that would be needed before the decision was made. We would start by promoting self-regulation. We have made it clear that that is our preferred option and we are working with the Alliance for Electronic Business to achieve it. A judgment would also need to be made in time about whether self-regulation was fulfilling the objectives published by the Government. If not, we would decide whether to bring part I of the Bill into effect and establish a statutory, but voluntary, scheme. In that event, to whom might we delegate the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by part I? We would need to decide whether it would be appropriate for Oftel or another body to exercise some or possibly all those powers, with the important exception of the regulation-making powers.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Can the Minister explain exactly what clause 3(4)(a) means? It strikes me as gibberish to state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the enactments relating to the functions of that body or office shall have effect as if the functions of that body or office included the functions specified in the appointment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It is entirely clear, if one understands the conventions used by parliamentary counsel. It simply states that a statutory body to whom any powers under part I were delegated would have those powers as delegated under the appointment. It is crystal clear, although I am sure that my officials will correct the record, or enable me to do so, if what I have said is wrong in any respect.
<P>
If we should need, at the end of the process I have described, to decide to whom the powers should be delegated, we should certainly want to consult on the matter and, in the light of circumstances at the time, take account of comments such as those that have been quoted about Oftel's suitability or otherwise.
<P>
The delegation of powers under the clause relate only to powers conferred under part I of the Bill. Clause 3 could not be used to turn Oftel or anyone else into a general internet regulator. All that could be done would be to delegate the powers under part I that enable the approval scheme to operate—with the exception of the regulation-making powers conferred on the Secretary of State by part I.
<P>
The problem with the Opposition's stance is that without clause 3 no such delegation would be possible. The only option for a statutory scheme would be for the Secretary to State to run it, through departmental officials. That model is far too inflexible for us to impose now, not knowing what conditions will exist in years to come if a statutory scheme is required.
<P>
In response to concerns expressed by the hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), I point out that the Bill would not permit us to create a new body. Clause 3 enables the Secretary of State to delegate some or all of his part I powers to an existing statutory body, or one set up by business.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I have listened to the Minister's remarks about the clause not allowing the Secretary of State to delegate powers to a new body, but the clause does not seem to say that. Indeed, the explanatory notes state that the clause enables
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State to delegate the approvals functions . . . to any person''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Where in the Bill is it stated that that person must be an existing statutory body? [Interruption.] The Minister has just been rescued.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The Bill does not require delegation to be to a statutory body. It can be to a statutory body or a voluntary body established, for instance, by industry. Clause 3 does not give the Secretary of State the power to create a new statutory body. He can delegate powers to an existing person, which, as Committee members will recall from the previous sitting, can include a legal person, but the Bill does not include a power to create a new legal person with statutory authority for that purpose.
<P>
Clause 3 provides the Secretary of State with appropriately flexible powers to decide, if and when the time should come, which functions to delegate, with the exception that I mentioned before. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) raised the question of subdelegation. It is envisaged that if under part I the Secretary of State delegated the powers of the approvals authority to, say, Oftel, Oftel could subdelegate part of the assessment process, for instance part of the technical assessment. I do not think that there is anything confusing to trust service providers in that. Indeed, the self-regulatory scheme, the Scheme, that has been established by the Alliance for Electronic Business, will also draw on subdelegation, with other bodies providing some of the assessment.
<P>
An example of what I am describing would be British Standard 7799, the code of practice for a variety of information security services. Compliance with that and other standards is assessed by certification bodies approved by the UK accreditation service. Should Oftel become the delegated authority under the clause, it would probably want to use that structure to avoid having to replicate assessment of an organisation's compliance with the standard. Similarly, Oftel or anyone else would no doubt want to use outside experts in that way, to provide assistance in achieving the objectives of part I.
<P>
I think that I have dealt with the points that have been raised. Clause 3 does not enable the Secretary of State to create a new body or to establish a general internet regulator. It simply allows the Secretary of State the flexibility, if it should be decided that self-regulation does not achieve the Government's objectives, to delegate some or all of the relevant functions, with the exception of the rule-making powers, to an appropriate body. That appropriateness can be decided at the time of the decision, with the safeguard of an affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> In view of our wish to confine regulation to the narrowest possible form, we intend to press the clause to a division.

Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restrictions on disclosure of information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 5, leave out lines 16 to 18.
<P>
The amendment deals with the data protection principles under the Bill. Subsection (4) is worded obscurely. The gist of it seems to be that, if information covered by the subsection is released into the public domain in a version that is legal under the subsection, it can be disclosed by another person. That seems reasonable but, presumably, the further inference that must be drawn from the clause is that if information is released into the public domain by means that would be prohibited under this subsection, for whatever reason, it cannot be disclosed by any other person on pain of extremely tough penalties. If that is the intention of the provision, is it in accordance with the usual laws that apply to data protection? The provision seems to be unusually tough, and I am not convinced that it is fully compatible with civil liberties.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): If I understand the hon. Gentleman's amendment correctly, he is making the extraordinary proposal that someone could put information in the public domain, but the Liberal Democrats would not be allowed to comment on it publicly. That is extraordinary given that the Liberal Democrat party is committed to freedom of information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that comment.
<P>
Clause 4 overlaps with the Data Protection Act 1984 and prescribes more stringent penalties for disclosure of information than are required under that Act. I should like the Minister to deal with that point. It is not clear why that should be so, and why the rules governing public disclosure are at variance with common practice and impose unreasonable constraints. For example, subsection (4) covers penalties for public disclosure of information that is already in the public domain for other reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I wish simply to comment on the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter). Can the Minister explain the nature of the offence under the clause? Disclosure what information might be subject to a fine or imprisonment? Will she explain the nature of such an offence, the type of information that might be disclosed and say what harm is being done and how, so that people can understand exactly what the clause is designed to do?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Let me start by explaining the purpose of clause 4. In doing so, I trust that I shall deal with some of the points made by the hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for Weston-super-Mare. Clause 4 makes it clear that, in conferring approval on a trust service provider under part I, the approvals authority may obtain information relating to the private affairs of any individual or business that is needed to approve the provider. That category of information, which is specifically referred to in subsection (1), is protected against improper disclosure under the clause.
<P>
In the course of its work, the approvals authority may need to obtain information about the senior managers or directors of the organisation that is applying for approval. That information might include an individual's private financial affairs or a previous investigation relating to a criminal allegation. Such information could be sensitive and its inappropriate disclosure would clearly be an invasion of privacy.
<P>
Clause 4 deals with the circumstances in which approvals information can be properly disclosed and the penalties that can be imposed for improper disclosure. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare asked whether the normal penalties for such offences could be imposed. The penalties will be the same as those provided for in the Competition Act 1998. That underscores the fact that if an authority has to obtain information from a company or individual—in this case, to decide whether to confer an approval—it is right that the confidentiality of that information is properly protected.
<P>
If confidentiality or privacy is breached, a criminal offence has been committed and the appropriate penalties should be imposed. Of course, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said in an effective intervention, subsection (4) specifically provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the information is disclosed to the public in circumstances in which the disclosure does not contravene''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the clause, further disclosure is perfectly proper and does not constitute a criminal offence. That is intended to deal with information that has been disclosed for the purposes of a court case, for example, and is therefore in the public domain.
<P>
If information is in the public domain, it makes perfectly good sense for it to remain there. It would be absurd if those who released information that had been properly put into the public domain could be charged with the criminal offence of improper disclosure and be subject to those penalties. Unfortunately, that would be the effect of the amendment. I am sure that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare did not intend that to be its effect. A similar provision exists under the Competition Act 1998, which also contains a regime for protecting information. I hope that that adequately explains the purposes of clause 4 and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the Minister. Given that explanation and clarification, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations under part I</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 5, leave out lines 31 to 35.
<P>
The Government must get the provisions right first time, or they will cause much confusion. At the moment, there is too much scope for continuing uncertainty and confusion. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Regulations made by the Secretary of State under any provisions of this Part—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) may make different provision for different cases; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) may contain such incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision as the Secretary of State thinks fit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is all-embracing and too much of a catch-all phrase. We need clarity and simplicity from the Secretary of State. Clause 5(3) gives too much leeway for continuing uncertainty. I therefore urge the Committee to omit it.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am interested in paragraph (3)(a), which states that the regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may make different provisions for different cases''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It may be normal to make such a sensible-sounding provision—it may be how parliamentary draftsmen do these things—but I wonder what members of the public will make of it. They will ask why we need such a provision. They will say, ``You seem to specify the circumstances in the regulations. Surely, it can be taken as read that different provisions will be made in different cases.''
<P>
It is a linguistic point, Mr. Maxton, but I should be interested to hear the Minister's view on such things being phrased for our delectation and delight.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I sympathise with the points made by the hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for Hallam. Obviously, they have not read many statutes; on that, too, I sympathise with them. However, it is an entirely standard provision in Acts of Parliament that when a Secretary of State makes regulations or other secondary legislation he may make different provisions for different cases. It may seem absurd to spell it out, but lawyers like to make these things completely clear. Regulations have to provide for incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provisions. Otherwise it would be quite impossible to proceed by way of secondary legislation. Where on earth would we be if the Government could not on occasion proceed in that way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Ah!—scrutinised.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Scrutinised, whether by negative or affirmative resolution procedure. The previous Administration made many such provisions. I am afraid that Acts of Parliament will always have them. Nothing sinister or unusual is intended by the drafting of clause 5. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment and that the clause will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> So charming has the Minister been that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision of cryptography support services</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 6, leave out lines I to 5.
<P>
At the risk of appearing repetitious, Mr. Maxton, this is yet another example of my campaign for plain English. Given that Liberal Democrat Members share my concern about linguistic gibberish appearing in our laws, I hope that they will join me in my campaign against standard provisions such as this one. We should challenge precedent and try to make our laws simpler and clearer.
<P>
I find subsection (2) difficult to understand. If the Minister can explain it to the Committee in plain English, why can it not appear in the Bill in equally plain English? I look forward to her analysis of the extraordinary subsection that the amendment would delete. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``References in this Part to the provision of a cryptography support service include references to the supply of, or of any right to use, computer software or computer hardware if, and only if, the supply is intended to be no more than incidental to the provision by the same person of cryptography support services not consisting in such a supply.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have wrestled with that. Indeed, I have woken up in the dead of night trying to understand it. I know that the Minister is sympathetic to my plight, that she would like me to sleep peacefully and therefore that she will explain exactly what it means. However, I say again that if she can explain it to the Committee, would it not be possible to bung it back to the parliamentary draftsman with a gentle request to put in plain English? The Bill will then be clear to laymen, and legislators like us, who are responsible for enacting it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Far be it from me to agree with the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, but I think that I must on this occasion. I understand what my hon. Friend the Minister is trying to do with the clause, as the explanatory notes make clear, but I wonder whether there has been an error in the drafting. I apologise for not tabling my own amendment, but I wonder whether the final six words of subsection (2) should have been omitted and the word ``exclude'' rather than ``include'' used. Will my hon. Friend give some thought to my suggestion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I take the opportunity to apologise for my jack-in-the-box approach to the Committee this morning. I am also involved in the Select Committee on Education and Employment, which is meeting two doors along the Corridor.
<P>
I fully support my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton. This subsection is probably the worst drafting of the entire Bill. I am somewhat confused as to what is meant by ``cryptography support services''. I hope that the Minister can spell it out and come back, in due course, with a replacement. Do such services include holding the keys or matching and designing the keys? How are such services distinguished from, say, someone in the Old Kent Road selling shrink-wrapped software with a cryptography element in it? Will the Minister clarify those distinctions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I think that practical as well as linguistic issues may be involved, having read the explanatory notes, which are much clearer than the Bill. I understand that if one were to buy a cryptography package, such as ``Pretty Good Privacy'' for a few pounds, it would not be covered by the scheme. I can also understand the third party on-going relationship. However, there is a grey area, which the subsection does not deal with.
<P>
I use an on-line banking service, provided by National Westminster. It provides me with a cryptography service and supplies me with software, which does all the cryptographic management on my computer. I am not sure whether that software is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``incidental to the provision . . . of cryptography support services''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or whether it is core within it. The word ``incidental'' may be critical in this context, but I regard that software as the core part of the cryptography. Any notion of an on-going service is secondary to that. Many of the services to which we subscribe will fall into that grey area when the relationship consists primarily of a supplied piece of software, and perhaps on-going updates to it.
<P>
If the scheme is introduced and people challenge whether their financial relationships should be within it, we shall end up having difficulty in deciding at what point the hardware and software supplied becomes incidental or core to the service. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the wording, so that we can be clear on where to draw the line between the service provider who is in the scheme and the software provider, who may be providing the software as part of a service.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am delighted to have the opportunity to clarify the clause, and I shall do my best. Subsection (2) should remain in clause 6. It is not a simple provision—again, I sympathise with hon. Members' anxieties—but it is important, because it clarifies the position of people who are purely selling or distributing cryptography products in software or hardware form The clause is designed to make it clear that simply selling or distributing such cryptography products is not covered by the term ``cryptography support services''. Such a person will therefore be precluded from having to seek approval for such activity. To use the example that the hon. Member for Hallam cited, cryptography software bought off the shelf or from the web or embedded in a personal computer will not constitute a service. We never intended, and nor, I believe, does the Conservative party, to try to approve or regulate the provision of cryptography products. We do not want to do that, and the industry has not called for us to do so.
<P>
The clause is intended to ensure that selling or distributing cryptography products will be covered by the term ``cryptography support services'' when such activity is in conjunction with and incidental to the provision of a cryptography service. The example that the hon. Member for Hallam cited of an on-line banking service that includes cryptography could, therefore, be approved under the scheme created under part I. Someone who has contracted with a user to supply a public key certificate for an electronic signature could seek approval for that service, even though a significant part of it would involve the provision of software to the user. The important point is that such software would be provided as part of the service, and not simply as a one-off product in its own right. Central to the definition of a ``service'' is a continuing relationship between the service provider and the user of the service. That is the distinction that we are trying to make in the clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary that subsection (2) must remain part of the clause. She is arguing that if I were to rent her time on my computer and she were to offer a cryptography service, she would be covered under the clause but I would not, because I would only be renting the computer time to her. However, I am worried that subsection (2) as drafted would incorporate me, too.

<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that point. The subsection is intended to ensure that the provider of the hardware in such circumstances would not be eligible for approval under the scheme. That is the effect, as well as the intention, of subsection (2). Merely to delete subsection (2) would introduce an unhelpful ambiguity about whether the mere provision of cryptography software or hardware could constitute a service that could be approved under part I. However, I shall consult ever-helpful parliamentary draftsmen further to discover whether the drafting of the clause could be simplified to ensure that the intention and the effect are more immediately obvious to readers of the Bill. I shall undertake to write to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, who tabled the amendment, on that point. I cannot guarantee that I shall be able to return with an amendment on Report, but I readily undertake to consider the matter further.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Of all the various points that the Committee has so far debated, or is likely to debate, the provisions under clause 7 are the most important. Given that the Bill is highly charged and technological and does not call for the usual political divisions that we so often witness in the House, a real spirit of cross-party co-operation is necessary for it to come out of the legislative process in a satisfactory shape. Clause 7 is the heart of the Bill, and for the Bill to work, it must be right. I am not in the business of playing political games. Our amendment is a serious attempt to improve the Bill in the one area where it really matters. I shall explain the purpose of the amendments in a nutshell, and then clarify in more simple language what we are trying to achieve.
<P>
At the moment, a certifier may certify a public signature verification key as belonging to a particular person. That is arguably the most typical case. Without the amendments, subsection (3) would fail to treat a signature verified by such a key as having been certified, because neither the signature, the private key used to make a signature nor any verification procedure would have been certified. The proposed paragraph (d) would remedy that situation by including the public key among the items capable of legitimate certification.
<P>
What I have said so far may illustrate the difficulty of understanding such matters, which was a deliberate ploy. I shall now explain in plain English—as part of my own campaign—why the amendments really matter. As the Minister said on Second Reading and in Committee, the Bill is designed to be technology neutral. I accept that that has been its genuine objective. Indeed, everyone believes that the Bill is technology neutral. However, in being so, it must also fit in with existing technology.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I must first develop my argument.
<P>
The Bill will be useless unless it can fit with the real-world procedures of public key cryptography applied to digital signatures, to which clause 7 refers. It is the heart of the Bill. In the United States, the equivalent legislation is the Electronic Signatures Act. If only one clause were needed—it would be better if there were only one clause—this is it.
<P>
To create a digital signature, the sender's private key is combined mathematically with the digital representation of a document to create a signature—a number unique to that document and that private key. A recipient can check the integrity and authenticity—two importantly defined words—of the document by verifying the signature against the published public key corresponding to the private key. The public key, usually called the ``signature verification key'', will be available from a published electronic directorate.
<P>
However, there remains the problem of knowing whether a public signature verification key belongs to the named party. Unless one can be sure of that, fraud may occur. The commonly accepted technological solution to the problem is to use public key certificates. A certificate is a package of data that contains the key owner's name, public signature verification key and various permissions or attributes. The whole package is signed digitally by an authority that vouches for the ownership of the public key. As drafted, subsection (3) uses the word ``certified''—this is the key to my argument—in an informal sense, not the crucial technical sense of what a public key certificate means. Our amendments Nos. 49, 50 and 51, by adding a new paragraph, make explicit allowance for the clause to be interpreted to cover the technical certification process of a public key.
<P>
Our preference would be for the subsection to be entirely redrafted, not because its intention is wrong—although we disagree with it in principle—but in order that ``certified'' is used in an informal sense or solely in an accurate technical sense. In other words, ``certified'', which is crucial to the understanding of the clause, should be used consistently—informally or in an accurate technical sense. Injecting such consistency into the Bill is crucial to its success and to a clear understanding of the clause.
<P>
My plea to the Minister is that she takes further advice on the matter and undertakes to come back on Report or in another place to render that part of the Bill consistent. At the moment, the lack of consistency in the use of ``certified'', be it in an informal or a technical sense, will cause confusion.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be constructive in the amendment, but could he clarify why he feels that paragraph (c) does not achieve what the amendment is trying to achieve?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I agree that that is the intention of paragraph (c), but I am not sure that it is sufficiently specific to achieve it. The ambiguous use of ``certified'' will cause trouble, even though I accept that paragraph (c) is an attempt to clear up the ambiguity.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I find that difficult to follow, but would not my hon. Friend agree that the ``either/or'' nature of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) creates that confusion? We are saying that we have to tie the three together to achieve the result that we want, rather than treating them as a series of options.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is part of our duty as legislators to take outside advice and all of us have done our best with what is a very technical Bill. One need only talk to journalists—whose eyes glaze over very quickly—to realise that they are not prepared to work that hard to understand the Bill before they report it. I know that the Minister and her supportive team in the Department have done their best to wrestle with the technical matters, and they deserve much praise for what they have done. However, many of the outside representations that we have received express concern about the Bill's highly technical nature.
<P>
This is in many respects a one-hit Bill and, as I said earlier, it is vital that we get it right first time. We do not want any muddle or confusion or tidying up afterwards. I ask the Minister to recognise that there is much feeling on the matter and to consult before Report stage, and to bring in some tidying-up amendments or redrafting, if she is persuaded that that is necessary.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I should like the hon. Gentleman to clarify his position in light of his hon. Friend's comment. Subsection (3) uses what we computer people call Boolean logic. The Boolean ``or'' means that either one thing or the other will happen; both are possibilities. If the subsection were to use the Boolean ``and'', as the Opposition suggest, it would no longer be technologically neutral.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Yes. The hon. Gentleman is a clever chap. I am delighted that he has broken his Trappist vow. Most Labour Members seem to have been instructed not to say much in the Committee. Clearly, he has been saving up that little Boolean bazooka. I shall not be diverted to discussing the words ``or'', ``and'' or ``either'' any further.
<P>
Clause 7 is the crucial clause. We are not arguing about a party political matter. We all want to make the clause work. We disagree about part I. We may disagree about elements of part III, but we all agree that this is the clause that matters; it is what the Bill is all about. This is what will advance electronic commerce in Britain. How electronic signatures work in law is what matters most. Those who know far more than any of us about such matters are concerned about what they think are contradictions in the clause. In a spirit of co-operation, I urge the Minister to consider whether those concerns are well founded.
<P>
I am not sure that amendment No. 52 goes happily with amendments Nos. 49, 50 and 51. Our purpose in tabling it was to get the Minister to explain the exact legal status of e-signatures. Are they intended to be contractually binding, or merely admissible evidence? Will she clarify that matter for the record? Will consumer measures, such as those on cooling-off periods, be amended if trade increasingly moves on to the internet and away from shops?

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support the amendment. I shall avoid using too much Boolean logic. I always thought that Boolean was what the French played on bank holidays.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Thanet asked how the amendment differed from subsection (3)(c). The difference is fundamental. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton started to describe the workings of public key infrastructure systems. I do not want to cover that ground again, but the important point is that the certification of data components other than those that might be assumed to be the signature would be included under the amendment. Several packages of data could all require certification, whereas subsection (3)(c) refers to the procedure only.
<P>
The procedure for putting together two pieces of information and creating a key—a secure piece of data that can be trusted—may be neutral and in the public domain, but it might not be certifiable. However, those two components might be certifiable. That unique combination allows us to say that the transmission is signed in such a way that we can have confidence under the terms of part II.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that we must get this important clause right. I am concerned that the current drafting fails to take account of the differences between paper-based and electronic signatures. The Government want to take printed signatures into the electronic world without thinking about the scope of elements that may be involved in what is deemed to be a valid electronic signature. I am concerned that subsection (1)(a) refers simply to ``an electronic signature'', without giving a clear idea what that is. The amendment to a later part of the clause refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``data logically associated with the means of producing the signature'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is very vague, but the nearest that I can get to grasping the nature of electronic signatures.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> <P>
If I encrypt data with my private key, the hon. Gentleman needs to have my public key to know that I have signed it. For him to have confidence that it is my public key, someone must have certified that it is my public key. That is what the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton is trying to establish. Subsection (3)(c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procedure applied to the signature, as a valid means of establishing the authenticity of the communication or data'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is a simple, plain-English way of establishing the authenticity of my signature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The procedure for putting the public and private key together may not be the certifiable element. It may be the two bits of key work that are being certified. We are thinking of the current forms of signature that are available electronically and which have moved away from paper-based, physical signatures, but we do not know what is down the track. We do not know what will be deemed to be a valid signature. My feeling is that the components that will have to be certified in order for someone to say that a secure transaction is secure will increase in number and complexity over time. We have already seen how credit card numbers can be generated through electronic means, using algorithms, so that the traditional security barrier to owning a credit card has gone. We have trusted those strange ink scores for many years, but we have moved on and we are now using other methods. We shall see a dramatic increase in attempts to crack signatures and there will be a corresponding arms race in the systems that are required to produce a signature that is valid under this legislation. I do not feel that all those elements have been covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Encryption and electronic signatures, or signatures for the future, as the hon. Gentleman has been describing them, may not even be physical things, but may be sub-atomic. Is not what is behind the signature important? For example, when someone signs a contract to buy a house, he needs to know all the other implications. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I agree entirely. The clause is moving us into an area in which people will be placing electronic signatures without understanding the full implications. I referred on Second Reading to the ``granny chose a weak password and lost a house'' scenario. People set up a system and believe that they have a valid electronic signature. Let us not be sexist. Let us say that grandad sets up the signature and grand-daughter gets into the system and purchases whatever for £50,000. The system is deemed to be valid even though the certification process has not been understood, but the house has to be sold to pay for the £50,000 worth of goods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> Is it not sensible, therefore, to accept the Government's proposal in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It is not the intention of any Opposition Member to allow such an event to occur. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton made it clear that his amendment was intended to tighten up the clause. We want a legal framework for electronic signatures that will take into account all the fears and concerns about the crucial element of confidence and trust. If the Bill is about anything, it is about confidence and trust when a transaction is launched. People have never had such confidence when they have signed cheques, but they expect it in this medium. Such confidence is not necessarily covered by the definition of signatures in the Bill. In the amendment we are trying to ensure that we can cope with multi-faceted signatures. What we deem to be a signature now is one thing, but it could be translated into something that is one component in an electronic form or two components as public key encryption, and may evolve into something that is far more complex. We are trying to test whether that is covered by the current phrasing.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The hon. Gentleman is aiming a fair shot at the question whether the wording as it stands covers all aspects. We are attempting to cover every future technological possibility with more and more complex wording. If the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton were carried, subsection (3)(c) would become superfluous. If we are certifying data, it is unlikely that we would need to certify the procedure as well. The word ``procedure'' is appropriately vague, as it would usually be understood to cover the procedure or whatever is associated with it, whether it is data, sub-atomic information, or whatever. By attempting to pin the procedure down, we would make it less viable for the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We are talking about a Boolean belt and braces approach to the various elements. That is perhaps what people will be looking for to be able to certify a range of aspects in the process of establishing what is or is not a signature. I am running the risk of arguing against what I argued for earlier when I asked for clear language. There is a potential constraint in not adopting the sort of definition proposed in the amendment and sticking to terminology that is used historically, such as signature and its rather narrow definition. We shall not cover every technical eventuality nor every technological change, but there is a danger of becoming hide-bound. Those who like to dot the i's and cross the t's, and who have done so successfully in other parts of the Bill, will have to recommend changes later if these provisions are legally challenged by someone whose system has been cheated and who has lost money. If someone challenges whether the signature was duly certified, we may have to return to the matter because what we believe to be certification procedures are not what are being used out there. The amendment would throw in extra complexity, but as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said, that complexity is necessary in order to have fully comprehensive legislation that will last.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Hallam, as we are trying to make a serious point. The Minister and her Department, in their driving ambition to be technologically neutral, have come up with a clause that is in danger of being technologically neutered. There is technology out there already, which the clause had better recognise and provide for alternatives that may emerge in the future.
<P>
I am very much the layman and have found the debate illuminating. A signature is a product of, first, the document and, secondly, the key. Subsection (3)(a) refers to ``the signature'', paragraph (b) to the key, and paragraph (c) to the technique or the process, of which there are a number on the market, used to generate that signature. It is only by pulling those three paragraphs together that we can accurately describe today's technology.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall continue for a moment. By accepting the amendment, we would create the option of alternative means of generating signatures that may appear in the future. We know that in future, we shall want to take advantage of the great selling point of the new signatures, which is that someone can send a message in encoded form without having to transmit the key to unlocking it. That is now possible through the unique technology involved, which makes such encoding different from anything that has gone before. It will not be desirable for any future system to lose that unique advantage, and therefore, far from being technologically biased, proposed paragraph (d) is technologically informed about the type of system that may emerge as a rival to what we have today.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I have followed the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest, but it does not appear to sustain the point of his earlier intervention, in which he seemed to suggest that the word ``or'' should be replaced by the word ``and''. Is he arguing that paragraphs (b), (c) and proposed paragraph (d) are needed for a signature to be certified? That is not the common industry view.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If I understand the amendments correctly, we are indeed saying that ``or'' should be removed from the end of paragraph (b) so that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) read as a continuum. At the end of paragraph (c), the Bill would say ``or'' and then describe in proposed paragraph (d) the conceivable means by which other technology might produce a signature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I might be able to clarify a debate in which there has been some confusion. In matters of law, a court may have to consider and admit two documents. One is the document with a signature and the other is the certificate considered as a document that verifies the signature. As the clause stands, paragraph (c) may not be sufficient, which is why our proposed paragraph (d) is needed. That is the crux of our argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I hope that the Minister will educate me by the end of the sitting, because, as a layman, I have drawn the analogy of a letter of credit that has three elements to be satisfied before money is paid out under it. I know that analogies are dangerous, but they might help us think concretely about what we are trying to achieve. The Government's approach is that one of the elements must be satisfied, but we say that all three must be satisfied.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam said that we wanted a system in which there was no doubt about the security of the process, and no risk that those engaged in payment might find themselves exposed and forced to sell the family home to cover a liability that should never have been theirs in the first place. However, thanks to the drafting of the clause, people might find that they have inadvertently become liable.
<P>
We must recognise that those who provide cryptography services will be subject to people aiming to defraud the system, and that the system of public and private key, although new and offering unique advantages, may have an Achilles heel. Signatures might be taken and exploited by fraudsters. Therefore, the way in which we deal with subsection (3) may have a dramatic impact on people's willingness to enter into the new technology for a vast range of day-to-day transactions. If they are scared off by the risks involved and the excessively high cost of maintaining the security of their private key, we will find that clause 7, far from opening up a new world of e-commerce under English law, will have curtailed its development to the detriment of our whole economy.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I support the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton about the word ``certified''. I refer to words that have come into common parlance in the current e-commerce industry. We must use those words in their new technical sense throughout the Bill, and clearly define them, or make it clear that we are using them in their everyday sense or, preferably, avoid them altogether and chose other words that will do equally well.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I congratulate Opposition Members on trying to be constructive, but I suspect that they were advised to table such an amendment by computer professionals. I referred earlier to Boolean logic because parliamentary draftsmen have a different interpretation of the words ``or'' and ``and'' from that of computer professionals, who interpret them in a Boolean sense. In Boolean logic, both conditions linked by ``and'' have to be satisfied, which is roughly the same when a parliamentarian uses the word ``and''. However, there is a different interpretation of the word ``or''. When a computer professional uses the word ``or'', both conditions cannot be satisfied; it must be one or the other. One condition excludes the other condition. When a parliamentarian uses the word ``or'', he usually means that both conditions can be satisfied; it does not matter which one. One condition can be satisfied or both of them can be satisfied. There is a complete difference between attitudes to those two words.
<P>
Given that the Bill has been drafted by a parliamentary draftsman, I assume that he has used the word ``or'' in the usual way that is adopted by parliamentarians.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument closely, but will he clarify that he is happy with the concept that an electronic communication can be deemed to be certified when someone has certified only the procedure applied to the signature, not the means of producing it and the signature itself? Is he happy with the potential for mishap that may result from such a limited requirement before certification is deemed to have happened?
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> If I were entering into a contract that was likely to cost me a lot of money and I needed to be sure that the person with whom I was electronically signing the contract would be forced to honour his obligations, I would not be satisfied. The Government have made it clear that, ultimately, it will be up to the courts to decide what level of force they put behind any electronic signature. If an electronic signature and nothing else was provided to the courts, I would have the option of accepting it as such. Moreover, if I were to give the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) a cheque, he would have the option of accepting my signature on that cheque. If he did not trust me, he might insist on seeing my bank card to authenticate my cheque.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing the analogy of a cheque, but we all recognise the dangers of such analogies. If I sign that cheque and hand it to him, I am liable. But if the cheque is handed to him fraudulently by someone who had forged my signature—I could not be liable in English law. The danger of the system is that, if I carry out that process electronically and the hon. Gentleman is happy with the signature, even though it has been created fraudulently by someone else, I may still be deemed liable under the clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making my point. If I receive a cheque from his own hand—I know where he sits in the House and I can bop him one if the cheque bounces—I am perfectly happy to accept his signature. However, if someone whom I do not know presents me with a cheque on behalf of the hon. Gentleman, I may require further authentication that the cheque will be honoured. If I had never met the hon. Gentleman before, I would certainly ask for his signature to be authenticated.
<P>
Were I to accept the hon. Gentleman's signature on a cheque, and if he later denied liability for it, I would probably take him to court, and the judge would want to know how confident he could be that the hon. Gentleman had signed the cheque himself. Were I to say in court, ``You can have absolute confidence in the fact that the hon. Gentleman signed the cheque because I saw him sign it, and he handed it to me personally,'' the court would almost certainly accept that it was a legal contract and would find in my favour.
<P>
If, on the other hand, I was given the hon. Gentleman's cheque in a pub by someone whom I had never met before, and if I had no authentication of the cheque's validity, the court would find for the hon. Gentleman on the assumption that he had not signed the cheque. The legislation is drafted to give individuals the right to decide what level of confidence they place in the signatures offered to them. That is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman is looking at the process entirely from the point of view of the payee, and not considering the risk to the payer. That highlights again the dangers of making such analogies. The world of e-commerce includes virtual personalities, as well as real personalities who might have met in the pub. Fraudsters can create a false picture of a real person, purporting to be them. In every particular, including their website, they seem to be the genuine article. The payee could stand up in court and say, ``It seemed entirely credible. It had his photograph, details of his family, his diary and what he was doing next week. An entirely credible picture was painted by the person who was doing a deal with me over the internet.''
<P>
It would be very hard for someone who had been fraudulently deprived of his money by such a process to be sure that he, as payee, had any genuine reason to doubt that he was not entering an authentic and genuine transition. In the real world of the cheque—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is this a speech or an intervention?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If I may finish, Mr. Maxton; it is a complicated matter. In the real world, a real person will have signed the cheque; the onus is on the payee to prove that the payer had actually signed the cheque—perhaps because the cheque was handed directly to him. That is the difference.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am being tolerant with interventions because it is a complicated argument. I understand that hon. Members may need to make quite complex points, but I hope that interventions will not always be so long
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but the Bill gives choice to both receivers and senders of signatures. As an originator of a signed document, I would have a choice of methods of signing, and my decision would be based on the risks and benefits of each method. However, the Bill allows the hon. Gentleman a choice when receiving my signature in a document. He can choose how much confidence to place in that signature. Were we to exchange contracts worth a lot of money, he would insist on a fully authenticated signature with certification to prove that it was mine. He would probably insist that the entire document be encrypted and signed so that he could be confident that my signature applied to the entire document. He would insist on that level of confidence On the other hand, if we were involved in a simple transaction, such as buying some goods from my website, involving a small amount of money, he might simply offer me his credit card details, which I might be prepared to accept as a simple basis for that transaction.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning the courts and choice, because the amendment relates to a further element of choice. Perhaps he does not share the anxiety with which the amendment is designed to deal. People might present in court a cheque and a cheque card, which show a signature, and present the fact that they examined both as their defence for believing the signature to be valid. People will be able to argue that the signature was certified, that the means of producing or communicating the signature was certified, or that a certified procedure applied to the signature. However, they will not be able to say that associated data relating to public key encryption systems was also certified. That is what the amendment is designed to enable them to do. We want to give such people another limb to strengthen their case by reference to those four elements rather than merely the three currently provided for in the Bill
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I accept what Opposition Members are trying to achieve with the amendment. I am simply arguing that it is already provided for in the Bill more clearly than their amendment would. To return to my original argument about Boolean logic, three conditions are specified in clause 3, under subsections (a), (b) and (c). According to the Bill, a signature must be provided. There is no ``or'' between (a) and (b). In computing terms it is a Boolean ``and''; condition (a)—some form of signature—is mandatory.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am not sure about that. The word ``either'' appears before the (a), which, as I understand it, means that either (a), (b) or (c) must apply. The Bill therefore provides that any may apply.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> My hon. Friend is right to pull me up on that. We are dealing with the authentication of the signature. My point is that, to be authenticated, a signature must exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to amendment No. 56, in relation to which his argument, which he is making very well, might be better made. At the risk of his having to repeat himself later, it might be helpful to point that out. I agree with what he is saying, but in relation to the amendments under discussion, what the hon. Member for Hallam said is exactly right and is the crux of the debate. What the hon. Member for South Thanet is saying might be better said when we discuss amendment No. 56, when we can perhaps have this discussion all over again.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will allow a discussion then, but I do not want a discussion on amendment No. 56 now.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I anticipated your ruling, Mr. Maxton, and I do not intend to enter into a discussion on amendment No. 56.
<P>
I understand what the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton is saying. However, some form of signature is a given, and if we want people to have absolute confidence in that signature, we must face the question of how to authenticate it. Amendment No. 51 would add another condition that might constitute a choice in generating signature data that could authenticate that signature. People might therefore choose to certify the data, rather than the signature itself. That is what I believe that the hon. Gentleman is trying to do with the amendment. However, condition (b) already relates to the means of producing or communicating the signature. Therefore, data that can be used to authenticate the signature at some later date are part of the means of producing the signature. In other words, condition (b) is a much simpler way of achieving—in much plainer English—what the amendment is trying to achieve. Inserting condition (d), which simply refers to data, creates an unnecessary complication which, when some future technological change occurs in future, might trip up the Bill and cause problems. I would much prefer to see us working within the constraints of the three existing conditions because they adequately meet Opposition Members' concerns.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
To return to the point made by the hon. Member for Guildford, who intervened several times, the Bill gives people choice. It gives people generating a signature choice about what level of authenticity they want, people accepting a signature choice about the level of authenticity they are prepared to accept and the courts freedom to decide what level of confidence they will put in any contract agreed to by one of those exchanges of signatures.
<P>
The Government have got it absolutely right. The criticism that we made earlier about plain English is in this case not applicable; they have expressed in plain English what they want to achieve in the clause—although I can understand why computer professionals might not be able to trust it completely, because of the different interpretations of ``and'' and ``or''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I challenge what the hon. Gentleman says about condition (d) being a further restriction; it is actually an extra option—unless I have got my ``or''s confused, I do not think that I have. By inserting ``or'' at the end of paragraph (c), we can then insert our paragraph (d), and that gives more flexibility and does not constitute an extra restriction.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The amendment calls for data logically associated with the means of producing a signature, but that is only a complex way of proposing what already exists in paragraph (b), in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the means of producing or communicating the signature''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What the parliamentary draftsmen have achieved and what the Government propose is a much simpler way of doing the same thing. In the long term, the simpler we make this, the more likely it is to be understood in the courts. The last thing that I want is some crusty old judge who has never heard of the Beatles trying, five years down the road, to understand the concepts of public and private key encryption and to untangle the legislation. The Government have got it right on this occasion and we would do well to leave their wording as it stands.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> We have had an interesting debate. Two separate issues are being addressed; we should clarify them. First, there is a split between the arguments of the hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for Guildford. The amendment, as the last intervention of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton made clear, offers an additional ``or'' option. At present the subsection contains paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and the amendment proposes a paragraph (d). In several interventions, the hon. Member for Guildford has argued for an alternative approach under which several or perhaps all the conditions would be required. We must make it clear that that is not what the amendment proposes.
<P>
The clause states that conditions (a), (b) or (c) may be considered to certify either the authenticity of the communication or data, or the integrity of the communication or data, or both. We are giving the courts the opportunity to accepting certification under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) as evidence to verify an electronic communication in whole or in part.
<P>
We should accept that the clause is intended to allow the parties to a transaction to exercise discretion, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet said, and to provide the court the flexibility to assess whether sufficient evidence has been produced, depending on the circumstances of the transaction.
<P>
The question whether the amendment is needed hinges on whether we consider that it will be possible for the parties to the transaction or the court to accept data associated with the signature as relevant evidence. My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet has argued convincingly that a court, or parties to a transaction, will be comfortable using paragraphs (b) and (c) to accept data associated with the signature without requiring the additional paragraph proposed under the amendment. The amendment has been useful because it has drawn out those matters. I hope that the Minister will stress that she considers that data associated with the signature will be covered under paragraphs (b) and (c). If that is the Minister's view and if she puts it on record, we can assume that the courts will so interpret subsection (3).
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This has been a truly fascinating debate. We are at the heart of the Bill. I welcome the assurance of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that this is not a party political matter. In the same spirit, I assure him that I never expect to receive a pager message reminding me of the manifesto position on Boolean logic. I shall long treasure the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet, who explained exquisitely the difference between Boolean and parliamentary ``or''; it was extremely helpful. Any confusion that might have arisen about subsection (3) stems not only from the computer buff's interpretation of the word ``or'', as distinct from that of the parliamentary draftsman but, as the Committee has learned, from different interpretations of the words ``certificate'' and ``certify''. I stress that in the Bill and especially in the clause the words ``certify'' and ``certification'' are used in their legal, not their IT or technical, sense.
<P>
In explaining the purpose of the clause and subsection (3), I hope that I can explain why amendments Nos. 49 to 51 are unnecessary. I shall then deal with the issues raised in amendment No. 52. As the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said, we must ensure that the process for creating, verifying, communicating or processing an electronic signature, whether by one person or several, is admissible as evidence of the authenticity or integrity of the communication or data. That process will vary substantially depending on the type of electronic signature used.
<P>
I shall confine my remarks to those electronic signatures based on public key cryptography and backed up by a certificate to that effect, as other hon. Members have done. Difficulties have arisen partly from trying to interpret the clause as if it referred to public key cryptography only, given that other technologies may become available in future.
<P>
Let us assume, for instance, that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton wants to be issued with a public key certificate that verifies his identity. He would approach a provider—I hope an approved provider—and ask for a certificate. He would typically be asked to provide evidence, from personal documents and so on, to back up his claim to be the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton. He would then be issued with the certificate—an electronic document—containing his public key, which would be needed to verify the signatures created with his private key. The certificate itself would usually provide information on what sort of checks had been done before it was issued, and it would be electronically signed by the approved provider.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman would also be issued with the associated private key, which might be carried on a smart card, to be used to create the electronic signature. Any message subsequently signed by his private key could be verified only by the associated public key on the certificate. The two are inextricably linked.
<P>
Once the hon. Gentleman has obtained his certificate and the private key, he could use the key to sign messages or documents. That would be done electronically by applying the private key to a digest of the message to be sent—which is often referred to as a hash. The signed hash—the electronic signature—would be sent to the intended recipient, along with the certificate. It could be unlocked only by the application of the sender's public key.
<P>
That verification procedure is specifically covered in subsection (3)(c). In that way, the recipient could be confident that the message had not been altered on route—and, indeed, that it had come from the hon. Gentleman himself. In addition, the recipient could check the certificate to ensure that the identity of the hon. Gentleman had been verified by a reputable body.
<P>
I have outlined that certification procedure to show why the whole process—the issuing of a certificate, the production of the electronic signature and its verification against the public key in the certificate—should all be admissible in court. Those processes are important in establishing trust and confidence in the authenticity and integrity of the message.
<P>
I entirely understand the logic behind the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, but they are not necessary. The hon. Gentleman clearly wants to ensure that the public key—the verification key—can be explicitly certified. However, that is already included in subsection (3)(b) because the certification body certifies the means of producing the signature by certifying the corresponding public key. Its verification, however, is covered in paragraph (c), because the public key is part of the procedure of verifying the signature. Whether the private and public keys are generated by the certification body, as would normally be the case, or whether they are self-generated and simply certified by the certification body as being a functioning key pair is not important.
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Hallam was concerned about whether all the elements that go to make up a signature—which could be many different parts of a process,—are all covered in subsection (3). It was precisely to meet that point that we separated them into paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), but a process may involve one or more of those elements. We need to think about those different elements as being separate; we should not confine ourselves to their use in public key cryptography. As I said, paragraph (b) covers the certification of the public key of the user and paragraph (c) covers the verification process used by the recipient of the message; together, they adequately cover the provisions of paragraph (d) as proposed in amendment No. 51.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> In that process, the certificate may have to be considered as a document on its own merits. For example, it might be argued that the certificate was out of date. Would the courts be able to consider a certificate when deciding the validation of a signed document?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Yes, that is the intention and the clear effect of subsection (3). However, it over-simplifies the matter to suggest that the court might want to consider only the signed document or only the certificate. In practice, the court may want to consider how the document came to be signed, how the certificate was issued and so on. The Bill makes all that admissible.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The difficulty has arisen, not least because of the difference between a certificate in the electronic technical sense, in which we have sometimes been using it, and ``certify'' and ``certification'' in the legal sense in which they are used in the Bill. Once again, I am willing to ask the ever-obliging parliamentary draftsman whether he will reconsider the wording. I do not guarantee to table an amendment at a later stage, but I am happy to examine whether subsection (3) will do what we believe it will do and that it is drafted in the most simple and helpful way possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> As one who is not such a computer buff as other members of the Committee, I shall adopt a layman's approach to the matter. Will the Minister say why subsection (3)(c), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a procedure applied to the signature'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
might not be judged by a court to refer simply to, say, the technique used to generate a signature from the characters of a document, of which I understand there are several? Can the hon. Lady imagine a situation in which the technique has been certified without the other parts of procedure having been completed, after which a fraudster completes the procedure? Let us suppose that the recipient of the partly true, partly forged package completes a transaction and wants to prove in the court that he does not have the problem of fraud, but the person who has the problem is the one who purportedly sent the message. All that would have to be done to make that person legally liable would be to say, in accordance with clause 3, that the procedure was certified by the genuine sender. The other party would not have to prove that.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman refers to a matter that is not covered by the amendment. It brings us back to the point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet that the hon. Gentleman wants to substitute ``ors'' with ``ands''.
<P>
I refer now to what constitutes a valid contract.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Has the confusion arisen because Opposition Members are legitimately trying to come up with a fraud-proof system of electronic signatures? Written signatures are easy to cheat. Electronic signatures can be made difficult to cheat, but they cannot be made fraud-proof because, sooner or later, someone will figure out how to cheat them. The courts will have to decide who is obligated and who is not obligated, and possibly providers of cryptography services will have to indemnify the user of their service against fraud entering the system.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend makes precisely the point that I was about to make. Nothing that we can do will enable cyberspace to be a fraud-free zone, any more than the best efforts of parliamentarians and judges alike can make the physical world fraud-free. It is not within the realms of human possibility. It would be wrong, however, to confine the admissibility of information in the way that it is seeking, although he has not tabled an amendment to that effect.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 is clearly well-intentioned, but it is not necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> May I make one more point about the other amendments before the Minister moves on to amendment No. 52. A key distinction must be made between the certification of the key and that of the signature. At the moment, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) pretty well all refer to the signature. Nowhere is there reference to the certification of the key, hence the need for the paragraph (d) in our amendment. Does not the Minister accept that as a logical argument?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No, I do not. The certification of the public key of the user is an integral part of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the means of producing or communicating the signature''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as set out in subsection (3)(b). I have undertaken to check that once again with the parliamentary draftsmen, to enable me to confirm the accuracy of what I have said, and that paragraphs (b) and (c) together cover what the new paragraph (d) in the amendment is intended to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We accept that it is not a fraud-free world. Surely the challenge is to decide where to set the fraud threshold. If it is set too low, no one will use the system as the payer; and if it is set too high, it will become so complicated that it will not be used. The Minister may not have pitched it right.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The issue is what constitutes a valid contract. Clause 8 is designed to remove the various barriers on the statute book to using electronic means for legally valid transactions. For many transactions to which the Government are not a party, no legislation specifies the form that they must take to be valid. In those cases—which encompass the majority of contracts made under English law—the parties to the transaction are free to decide how to carry it out. If they subsequently have a dispute and take the matter to court, the court will weigh the evidence before it. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet gave an example of just such a dispute over the validity of a signature on a cheque. Clause 7 will give people much greater confidence in using electronic signatures to make contracts because it will provide that an electronic signature and the associated certificates will be admissible as evidence. Clause 14(2)—if I may anticipate that—clearly states that an electronic signature can be evidence of who signed the document; whether that person intended it to have legal effect; the time and date on which it was signed; and whether it is what was signed or whether it has been tampered with. In short, clause 7 and other parts of the Bill provide that an electronic signature can do such things as one would expect of a signature. The question whether a signature is intended 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to have legal effect''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
is provided for in clause 14(2)(a)(iii). There is thus no need to spell out in the phrase contained in amendment No. 52 that an electronic signature can evidence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the formality of a contract''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because that is already provided for. Nor, I think, would it be right to constrain the court by insisting that all three of the elements set out in subsection (3) should be present. The court could judge whether the evidence was adequate to enable a conclusion to be reached on any of the relevant matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam earlier raised the issue of the possibility of someone being defrauded with respect to possession of a house. The clause makes it clear that the fact that a contract has been signed with an electronic signature would be admissible evidence of the intention to bind the parties. That is exactly what a written signature on a written contract does. A written or electronic signature could be used as evidence of whether the signatory intended the contract to have legal effect. However, there might be other evidence that the signatory did not know what he was doing; that some fraud had entered into the transaction and that therefore the contract was invalid. The court would have to weigh the evidence in individual cases. That would apply whether the signature was electronic or in writing—and plenty of cases have arisen over the centuries of people being defrauded of their property because of forgery in a written document.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I used an extreme example to illustrate the general point, but I think that there is potential for the court to take a different approach in a case in which someone's cheque book was left lying around, then stolen by someone who used it, from that taken when someone's computer was switched on, after which transactions were made. The validity of the signature and the technical back-up would be used as grounds for deciding that it was a genuine transaction. I think that there will be a difference in interpretation. An example of that is the banks' approach to cashpoint machine fraud. They deny it, arguing that the electronic means of dealing with the matter means that it is secure. They might have to accept stolen cheque book fraud more readily.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That is an example of what the courts will have to consider. Clearly, a body of case law will build up as electronic contracts and commerce become more common. We cannot anticipate all eventualities even in our splendidly drafted Bill and with the assistance of the Opposition. We can—as I believe we have done in clause 7—produce sensible and technology-neutral drafting that will enable the courts to treat electronic signatures and associated certificates as evidence with a bearing on the validity of contracts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton raised issues about consumer legislation. That legislation—providing cooling-off periods and so on—is just the sort that might well be amended under clause 8. Any such amendments would simply substitute electronic communication for paper. They would not be able to change the length of a cooling-off period, nor impose one in a context where there is not one now. The amendments would simply create equivalence between electronic and physical trading.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt with all of the points that have been made in this immensely fascinating debate, and have persuaded the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton to withdraw his amendment—particularly in the light of my assurance that I shall, with the help of the parliamentary draftsmen, re-examine the drafting of subsection (3). If not, I must urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
