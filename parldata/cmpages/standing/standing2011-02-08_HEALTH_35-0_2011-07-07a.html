               <p class="tabbed">Clause 55 is
crucial. It is the first clause of part 3, and the Opposition have
always said that it is the absolute heart of the Bill. Monitor, the
body established under clause 55, is the beating heart of part 3. Our
view is clear: even though the clause has come back to us in its
re-committed form, the functions of Monitor are effectively unchanged.
The pause and the Government’s response to the listening
exercise were, as we said when the  Bill was re-committed, a
political fix—a smokescreen. I intend to demonstrate the extent
to which it was a smokescreen, and to show that the clauses that we are
considering today, beginning with the establishment of Monitor, are
where the smoke is thickest.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000023">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In truth, and
despite the extensive changes that we have seen from the Government, I
contest that Monitor is essentially unchanged in form and function, in
instinct and intent, and in power and purpose. Some of the words have
been changed, or juggled about; some have been moved up and some have
been moved down, but the core of Monitor’s role is completely
unchanged.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000027">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">That, as we
all know—we in Committee and others outside the Committee have
endlessly said so—introduces a much greater degree of
competition into the NHS between the public, private and voluntary
sector providers, yet despite the changes presented by the Government
as the antecedents of the Bill, it is still overwhelmingly a publicly
delivered, publicly owned and publicly funded service. In the
Minister’s words, the Government want to create a genuine market
in the NHS—and that desire remains intact, despite the
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000028">&#160;</a>

accurate; there is a slight distinction between the words that we heard
from Hamish Meldrum and the feedback that Dr Meldrum got at
the BMA conference.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000030">&#160;</a>

when giving evidence to the Committee, Hamish Meldrum conceded that he

to show today that the Bill is largely unchanged in respect of Monitor.

may want to reassess its opinion of the changes.

that once we have looked through the smoke and past the mirrors put up

amount of time. As far as I am aware, the amendments to the Bill were
not shared with Dr Meldrum before their publication, so he had as much
time as anyone else to read them on the web once the Department of
Health published them—unless the hon. Gentleman knows something

will deliver a more efficient allocation of resources, drive economies
and incentivise innovation. They believe that about markets across the

course, is that when the Labour Government were in office, we did not
turn our face to competition overall. We introduced some competition,
but within a regulated framework and prescribed parameters, and with
specific targets for treating specific problems—usually elective
care, and usually to reduce waiting times. What was the net impact of
our changes at the end of our 13 years in government? Less
than 5% of NHS services were delivered, paid for or dealt with by the
private
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000051">&#160;</a>

A moment ago, the hon. Gentleman referred to 5% of care provision

many respects. I am not accusing him of misleading the House in any
way, but that 5% refers to the whole NHS, and the proportion was much
higher in secondary care. The hon. Gentleman’s Government were
prepared to pay 11% more for private providers, and allowed those

certain areas of the NHS, to deal with capacity issues, particularly in
respect

always tightly prescribed and carefully regulated, and we certainly
never contemplated applying the Competition Act 1998 to the NHS to
facilitate the opening-up of the market and the entry and exit of
providers—that is, the closure of public services and the
opening of private or other public services. We never considered any of
those things, and we ended up with just less than
5%.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000065">&#160;</a>

return to what the Minister, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, said
a moment ago. I cannot wait to see this fabled impact assessment, which
will, effectively, show us the new form of the Bill. It will set out
the heart of the Bill; it will set out not just new facts and figures,
but fundamental changes. Will we get a paragraph that fundamentally
disagrees with paragraph B106 of the previous impact assessment, which
specifically said that Monitor’s job was to<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000070">&#160;</a>

responsible for…competition in the health

               </p>
               <p>That
is interesting, given that we have now heard about the Co-operation and
Competition Panel’s powers to enforce key aspects of competition
law, which will be concurrent with those of the Office of Fair

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The principal
point that I am making is that Monitor’s powers have not changed
one jot. It has not been given new powers to enable integration. Its
powers to promote competition have not changed one iota. Therefore, its
core—what it is able and intended to do—is unchanged. We
look forward to hearing from the Minister precisely how it has not
changed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Far more
helpful than the impact assessment, and indeed Ministers, who have been
noticeably unhelpful in clarifying their real intentions—it is
unclear whether they have performed a U-turn, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Easington said, or whether things have changed—has
been Mr Bennett, Monitor’s chair-designate. Before, during and
after the pause, he has been very explicit—slightly
contradictory, but very explicit—about what he thinks.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">During the
pause, Mr Bennett went on to change his view; in fact, at one level, he
seems to have undergone something of a damascene conversion. In the
lecture to the Cass business school on 11 May, which I mentioned
earlier, he said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“much has been
made about the extent to which regulation of healthcare can or should
be based on the regulation of the utilities sector.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, much had been
made of that—by Mr Bennett, only a couple of weeks previously. I
do not think that anybody else raised the issue before, other than a
bit in our consideration of the Bill. However, Mr Bennett went
on:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“To be
very clear, healthcare is not the same as
utilities.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Right.
Okay. We were pleased that he had spotted that health care was not like
the utilities; we were quite chuffed about that, because that is what
we had been saying. We did not think that we had been getting through,
but clearly we
had.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
things got even better. Mr Bennett went on to say that Monitor
would<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“seek to achieve
a healthy combination of competition and collaboration through the
approach we
take.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>At
that point, I thought, “Well, this bloke’s been
converted. He worked for Tony Blair. Perhaps he’s finally
understood what we were trying to do with a bit of competition, but
mainly allowing the NHS to collaborate and integrate.” I thought
this was good stuff. We thought that competition can play a role and
deliver results for patients, such as through ISTCs dealing with hips
or cataracts, but only if it is properly regulated, with clinical
targets strategically planned across services, strategically planned
regionally, and strategically planned by Government, as opposed to the
free-for-all that will open up when there is greater autonomy combined
with a free
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
thought we were getting through to Monitor and that Dr Bennett was
really starting to listen to us. Then, when we read the report from the
Future Forum, we were almost ecstatic because its key recommendation
was to remove Monitor’s primary duty to “promote
competition” and instead change it to “protect and
promote” the interests of patients. At that point, I was
delighted. I thought, “We’ve really struck home. They
have listened to us.” We were thrilled. The Secretary of State
said that he would do what the Future Forum wanted and strike out
promoting competition as an end in itself—that was absolutely
fine. We were thrilled. Imagine our disappointment when we saw the
weasel words and the gobbledegook in the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000085">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">To illustrate
that, I turn again to the evidence we received on the same day as we
heard from Professor Field from Dr David Bennett, the man in charge of
Monitor. When asked whether the powers conferred on him, concurrent
with those granted to the OFT, had changed, he said they had not
changed and

               </p>
               <p>which

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman seems to be slightly going
around in circles. It comes as a tremendous surprise to my hon. Friends
that he should now be extolling, in certain circumstances, the virtues
of competition in the NHS; during the whole of the previous Committee
session, he was trying to make the case that there was no competition
before we came to power and that Labour did not agree with it. He also
seemed to say—<em>[Interruption.] </em>The hon. Member for

                     </span>
                  </strong> I will respond directly to that point. What the
Minister says is fundamentally untrue—the Competition Act was
not created to be applied to the NHS. The Government allege that the
Act always might have applied to the NHS. We contest that legal
definition of the extent to which the Competition Act has applied
hitherto to the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The reality
is that the British state has always been able to defend the NHS as
largely a state-provided service without a real market or multiple
providers, so it has not fallen within the remit of the Competition
Act. That is our interpretation. We believe that it has been misleading
of the Government to suggest, on repeated occasions, that the
Competition Act always applied to the NHS. If the Minister can point to
a single instance of a challenge to the NHS under the Competition Act
during our 13 years in government, I would be impressed—because
there was not
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000102">&#160;</a>

The point is that the NHS was subject to the Competition Act, as are
all services in the UK. However, as the Minister should know, the NHS
is covered under category B services in the European competition rules
and is therefore exempt from the Act’s full requirements. The
notion that the NHS was already subject to the Competition Act in the
same way that this Bill is writing it in—forcing the NHS to be a
player in the market rather than the market itself—is wholly
untrue.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000107">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Again, I entirely agree. As my hon. Friend has
clearly pointed out, this area is contested. It is not a settled, legal
view that competition law has always applied to the NHS. In fact, a
significant body of legal opinion says that that is not the case
because of the nature of the services provided. The extent to which
there is state provision, with few entrants into the market, affords
the Government the ability to argue that it is not a real market and
therefore should not be subject to competition law. That has been the
basis on which the NHS has defended itself when it has been challenged
previously.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That will
change because competition will be written into the script. The
language has changed a little, but the powers in respect of competition
remain unchanged. The other thing that we heard from Mr Bennett is that
the burden of proof requiring Monitor to demonstrate where it should
apply competition has apparently been increased. I shall come back to
that in a moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A further
thing that has changed with Monitor is the application of a
contradictory and far weaker duty to enable health care services, which
we will come on to in the debate under clause 56. At the moment, I do
not think that that is entirely reconcilable or, more importantly, that
it is of equal weight. The desire to prevent anti-competitive
behaviour, with specific powers attached, and to enable integration
where it is in patients’ interests implies that integration is
often not in patients’ interests. I presume that we are talking
about vertical integration or cartel behaviour, as it would probably be
called in other legislation. There is a big difference between powers
specifically designed to prevent and the desire to enable without any
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
what about the change in language? In essence, the duty to promote
competition has been taken out and replaced with a duty to prevent
anti-competitive behaviour. That is described elsewhere in the Bill as
behaviour that
would<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“prevent,

               </div>
               <p>When I read that I
thought, “This sounds very familiar to me.” I have worked
with the Office of Fair Trading in the past, in
industry and business, on market studies—and, indeed, in the
health care sector. I turned to the Competition Act 1998 to look for
the
words<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“prevent,
restrict or distort
competition”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000270">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
did not have to go very far; in fact, I got to part I, section 2.
Section 1 is simply entitled “Enactments replaced.” The
title of the first principal section has the
words:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“preventing,
restricting or distorting
competition”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000271">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
thought, “My gosh that’s very familiar. That’s
precisely what the Government have described as anti-competitive
behaviour.” Section 2 goes on to describe such behaviour as
being
to<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“directly
or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading
conditions”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Well,
the NHS currently does that; it fixes prices in the tariff and fixes
trading conditions through contracts. That is standard practice in the
NHS between hospitals and doctors. The description goes
on:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“limit
or control production, markets, technical development or
investment”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Well,
the NHS clearly does that lots. It limits and controls how many doctors
it will need and precisely which services it will offer. That will
clearly be subject to challenge. The Act mentions something
else:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“share
markets or sources of
supply”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000274">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
suggest that it is absolutely vital in the NHS to share markets and
sources of supply. Apparently, that will potentially be ruled out when
competition law applies. The Act gives a further
definition:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“apply
dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading
parties, thereby placing them at a competitive
disadvantage”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
might, for example, involve someone working with a local GP consortium
and deciding that they are going to give the business for their
cataract operations to the local hospital, as they have always done. In
future, of course, that will be a problem because in deciding to go to
their local hospital, someone is disapplying the ability of other
providers elsewhere in the country, which they have never treated with
previously, to apply. The Act also
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“make
the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties
of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to
commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such
contracts.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Again, that is a clear
example of where the NHS does draw up contracts and does not get all
the potential providers available in the country—the market, in
other words—to tender and submit bids. It does not do that, and
it would be hugely unwieldy if it did. The likely result would be that
it might be undercut and have to “exit the market”, to
use the language of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000119">&#160;</a>

Clearly, the hon. Gentleman is drinking his Front-Bench Kool-Aid on the
issue of whether things have changed. That is an Americanism; forgive
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">He gets two
points fundamentally wrong. One is that, of course, Monitor was always
going to be a sector-specific regulator. We keep hearing, “It is
all right now. It is a sector-specific regulator.” As far as I
was aware, it was not going to regulate gas or white goods in its spare
time—it was always largely going to be looking at health care
and the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As to the
notion of a new sector-specific regulator that will know about health
care, I would have been worried if it had not known about health care.
I am still worried that essentially it involves a bunch of accountants
who do not know about health care. Now it is meant to judge quality in
the NHS and determine, on the basis of medical, clinical decisions,
whether competition or integration are appropriate. That worries
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My second
point is that we cannot be certain that those things I read out will
not apply in the NHS. We cannot be certain, because they have not been
applied hitherto. I will again quote David Bennett. If the hon. Member
for North Warwickshire listens for a moment, he will hear that even the
man in charge of Monitor does not know whether competition law is going
to bite harder in future. <em>[</em>

arises in a later clause but is relevant to our current discussion.
Given the reference to regular reviews by the Competition Commission,

Commission than the BSkyB bid.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000138">&#160;</a>

are talking about shifting from an ex ante intervention to one that is,

               </p>
               <p>That struck a chord
with me, because having worked with the OFT, I know that it is very
fond of the phrases, “ex post” and “ex
ante”; in fact, they are used in most of its documentation to
describe whether it intervenes through a market study, for example, to
assess whether there is anti-competitive practice in a market,
which  is of course ex ante, or it investigates whether there
is collusion, cartels or anti-competitive mergers, which  is ex
post. It is very interesting that Monitor, which we assumed would
investigate ex ante—through market studies—will now only
look ex post, and do so through something called “the
Co-operation and Competition Panel”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000145">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That raises
several important questions. First, why do we need Monitor at all? If
we have principles, rules and regulations called “the
co-operation and competition regulations” operating already and
Monitor is to operate through them, what do we need Monitor for? It
does not make any sense at all. Secondly, how will it operate through
the Co-operation and Competition Panel and what are the associated
costs?<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
looked up the Co-operation and Competition Panel because, I confess, I
did not know much about it. It is a very interesting organisation. As
far as I can tell, it has about 10 or 15 executive members—the
great and the good of health care—and about 20 staff. Strangely,
it

was because it assumed that it would be done in once Monitor came into
existence, but I would say it is a fair bet that that was the reason.
Its business plan for 2009-10 clearly shows that it costs just
£2.8 million, as opposed to £130 million a year—or
£500 million, I do not know. The other thing we do not know,
because we have not seen the impact assessment, is how by much the
costs of Monitor will increase now that it needs, as David Bennett told
us the other day, a whole bunch of new people that we do not have
yet—that is, clinicians—to advise whether competition can
be applied, or integration ought to be applied, because of the effect
on the quality of patient care?<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000147">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We do not
know why we need the Co-operation and Competition Panel employing a
handful of people at a cost of £2.8 million, but apparently it
is being kept on so that it can be worked through—to use the
Secretary of State’s phrase—by the £150-million
Monitor. That prompts the question: when was it decided that the
Co-operation and Competition Panel would be retained? Has that been
factored in? No reference has been made to it in the impact assessment.
When was it decided that that additional cost would be placed on the
public purse? Several of the Co-operation and Competition
Panel’s documents make it clear that it expected to cease to
operate in 2012, when the new competition regime was
applied.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to know what the Health Secretary meant when he said that the
principles and rules for co-operation and competition would be
operated, so I looked them up. Interestingly, the introduction to the
rules states that they<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“have been

               </p>
               <p>That
is a change from the rules that were set up by the Labour Government.
The question is which set of rules will apply: the old rules or the new
ones? If it is the new rules, will principle 7 apply? I would be
grateful if the Minister would tell us, because the NHS will be
operating under these rules. Principle 7 is about the conduct of
individual organisations, and it
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>

that that principle does not currently apply in the
NHS, as specified in the explanatory note on principle 7, which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“In
certain circumstances, individual providers may have the ability to
restrict choice or competition by refusing to use services supplied by
others or refusing to supply essential services to others. For example,
an established provider with a powerful position in a local market

introducing new providers by refusing to supply essential services such

and peculiar. We had understood from what we heard from Ministers and
David Bennett that Monitor would range over the NHS and proactively
look at where it thought there were problems and issues. David Bennett
said, for
example:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
might look across the whole country and say, ‘There’s
something odd here; all diabetes care is being provided by the local
incumbent
hospital’.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000287">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Gosh,
would not that be odd, if the local hospital were providing diabetes
care? It would be truly terrible. I would be really worried if the
hospital “or whoever”, as Mr Bennett put it, were
providing diabetes care. He went
on:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“yet
it’s not at all obvious to us why this isn’t a more
competitive
market”—<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>why
there are not, say, diabetes specialist clinics run by Assura Medical,
which operates widely in the constituency of the Minister of State, the
hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, and why other players are not
entering the market. I thought, when I read that, that the Government
had clearly changed their view. Monitor will not be doing that any
more, but will simply be looking, ex post, at what has happened. It
will not be ranging over things, looking at the market and worrying
about whether there should be more providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000168">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The reason we
are so worried is that, going by what David Bennett says, we just do
not know the extent to which competition might be applied in the NHS,
because it has not been tested yet in the courts. We do not know
whether there is going to be wholesale, free market, let-it-rip
competition. As we speak, Hanover Healthcare, which provides private
mental health services, is challenging an NHS hospital through the
Co-operation and Competition Panel by suggesting that it is effectively
being frozen out of the local market by not being allowed to tender or
bid for business.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
fundamental concern is that the Co-operation and Competition Panel is
not a statutory body. It does not have powers to intervene in the
market and it is not enabled, through the Competition Act 1998 and the
monopolies and mergers legislation, to intervene in the marketplace.
The Co-operation and Competition Panel is a radically, fundamentally
different body that provides advice to the Secretary of State, who is
ultimately responsible for determining whether there ought to be more
competition and whether there have been anti-competitive or cartel
behaviours, or integration that is against the interests of patients.
That determination will pass from the Secretary of State to an
arm’s-length quango operating under legislation, like the Office
of Fair Trading, and under a duty to afford a level playing field to
public and private providers in the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other key question is where does all that end up? How will the NHS look
in 10 or 20 years’ time once the floodgates have been opened and
the market has been allowed effectively to set prices and to determine
which services should be introduced? Can we be sanguine that there will
not be wholesale private entry into the market and that there will not
be price competition? The Bill is not clear on that and, crucially,
David Bennett, the bloke who will be in charge of the body, is not
clear on that. Or, rather, he is clear that price competition
ultimately, at some point down the line, is a good idea. To quote him
again, he said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“in
the early stages, competition will be on quality not on price…
in a world where we cannot easily measure quality, if you allow price
competition there is a very real risk that quality will fall. And there
is even evidence that happens. But you can see it being used for
simpler procedures where you can measure quality well. It will be very
limited at first, and it will appear only slowly… I would not
want to see price competition ruled out… price competition is a
way”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000291">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
will conclude with one final remark, which, again, is from David
Bennett. Asked whether he worries that in future there will be
“Tesco-style chains of hospitals” up and down the land,
he said that it will be a matter for providers. He said that it will
not happen quickly, but it might happen eventually. Effectively, once
there are multiple providers in the marketplace, the law of supply and
demand will apply. That is what Government Members want, because, as I
said at the start, they believe that competition is always the most
efficient means to deliver economies, drive innovation and achieve
value for money, irrespective of the sector. They think it is true for
telecoms and utilities, and they are right, but health care is
fundamentally different. The NHS is fundamentally different, and
creating Monitor using such economic

                  </strong> Let me return to clause 55. I intervened on my
hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd earlier on what the Nuffield
Trust said in its memorandum to the Committee. Let me repeat that
evidence:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Government’s Response to the NHS Future Forum Report also
undertook to incorporate the existing Co-operation and Competition
Panel into Monitor, giving them a ‘statutory
underpinning’ in the
process.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000304">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
has not happened up to now, although I do not know whether there is an
intention to do that at a later stage of the Bill, either on the Floor
of the House or in another place. I assume that people outside,
however, expect it to happen during proceedings on the re-committed
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We took
evidence from Monitor last Tuesday. Again, I brought up the issue of
clause 65 and the Enterprise Act 2002, and the point about any mergers
between NHS trusts or mergers with other businesses being referred to
the Office of Fair Trading or the Competition Commission. Dr Bennett
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
NHS today is covered by competition rules in two fundamental ways.
First, the UK Competition Act, which embodies EU competition law,
applies across the whole of the UK economy.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000305">&#160;</a>

               <p>We have heard all that
before, which I accept. That happens now regardless of any clauses in
the Bill, as I understand it, which prompts the question: why are the
clauses included? We have never really had an answer to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Dr
Bennett continued:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
second way in which there is already a competition regime in the NHS is
through the principles and rules of co-operation and competition
established by the previous Government. Those set out rules that
determine, among other things, how competition should be applied in the
health sector. The Co-operation and Competition Panel today looks at
the application of those rules, hears complaints if people are
concerned that they are not being followed, and will take a view. Today
it advises either us, as the foundation trust regulator, or the
Department of Health if it falls in its area, where it sees an
infringement of the rules. Then we or the Department decide what to do
about it. Those things are true today and, in principle, they do not
change under the new
proposals.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000306">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>There
is still the issue of why the OFT and Monitor would play a part, as
opposed to the Co-operation and Competition Panel, which has a role in
this area.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I asked the
second witness, Sonia Brown, whether she had a view on my
question—you chaired this sitting, Mr Hood, if my memory serves
me well. She said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“On
the mergers? The intention under the Bill is that foundation trusts
will be subject to merger control by the Office of Fair Trading and, if
necessary, by the Competition Commission. That is the idea that sits
behind the Bill.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,

the Member for Pontypridd said. We are talking about a sector
regulator, Monitor. The Minister might not like these concerns being
put to him, as they were by the Future Forum’s members. It was
suggested that competition, as the Bill originally sought to introduce
it, would destabilise the NHS. That concern remains, because many of
the clauses remain. Monitor needs to have what was offered to it; it
was to have the power, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 327<a class="bkMark" name="Column327">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and the Co-operation and Competition Panel was to
have statutory underpinning, when the Bill came back into Committee. I
do not believe that that is what has happened, and neither do people
outside, witnesses included. I wait to see what the Minister has to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000210">&#160;</a>

but the hon. Member for Pontypridd has prompted me to say things that I
would prefer to have said later, when we dig down into the detail. He
is a clever, amusing and articulate chap and, as has been said, he has
treated us to an emotional rollercoaster, but he might have slightly
misjudged the occasion. We are here to scrutinise legislation, and
clear minds are probably a little better than emotional
rollercoastering. That said, he has overused what I describe in most
political debates as hyperbole. He said that the legislation had not
changed one iota, and that there was no scintilla of difference. He has
pleased his friends and cheered them up enormously on a grim Thursday
morning, but he has not added a great deal to the character of the
debate. When he reads his remarks in print tomorrow morning, he will
find that he said in one place that we do not know whether there will
be fully fledged competition, and in another that yes, there will be
such competition. That is the problem with constructing a largely
forensic
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000211">&#160;</a>

Monitor that the hon. Gentleman did not mention and which does not help
his cause, to prove that his argument is largely forensic, rather than
a wholly plausible one that should satisfy him. He made the broad
accusation that we want to see, on competition, references to Adam
Smith. I do not believe that anyone actually reads Adam Smith. His is
an extraordinarily boring book, a bit like “Das Kapital,”
which was passed by the Prussian censors because no one could be
bothered to read it. People quote from Adam Smith without having a real

competition and therefore thought that it had some sort of basis. That
is on record, and we will not go into that or say for the moment how
that approach was different from the Government’s, but the hon.
Member for Islington South and Finsbury, to whom I listen with almost
as much attention as I do the hon. Member for Pontypridd, said in our
first debate on these clause that KPMG established that with
level-playing-field competition the NHS was cheaper, with its overall
costs down by 14%. If someone is in favour of the public sector, they
might see competition as having distinct advantages as long as,

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman’s conceptual analysis
and arguments are of interest, but as we have repeatedly requested,
could he give us a practical example of something that could have
happened before the amendment was brought
forward?<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000228">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am not an expert in competition law, so I will not
endeavour to do that at this stage; when we get to the clause, I am
sure that the Minister will be more than capable of
doing that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000229">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I argue that
there is a serious conceptual distinction here—so when the words
are changed, the meaning is changed. Stamping out anti-competitive
behaviour may be a necessary condition for having an unfettered
competitive market, but it is not a sufficient condition. That applies
in lots of other circumstances, when we talk about things other than
competition. There is a huge difference between stopping conflict and
promoting peace or stamping out gross aspects of racism and encouraging
racial harmony. They are
different.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000230">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me give an example of where the conceptual distinction
works—when it is put into law and it makes a difference, or
should make a difference, unless the law is much odder than I suppose.
Socialism, for example, can be promoted, but many of those liberals and
so on who went out to the Spanish civil war to stop the Falangists from
exterminating people were not into promoting socialism at all; they
were just stopping activity that was designed to stamp out socialism.
So that is a real-time example of where this conceptual difference
genuinely works.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000231">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
matter that will come up time and again is EU competition law. The hon.
Member for Pontypridd said on several occasions that there is gross
uncertainty and that the Government are adding to it in some peculiar
way. I have not done enough research on this, but I have a book from
the Library on governance and health systems in Europe. It has an
excellent section on EU competition law and public service. It is
probably a definitive work, which I recommend to hon. Members. It makes
a crucial point that affects all our
deliberations:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000232">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
treatment of health care by European competition law encapsulates more
clearly than almost any other public service a key dilemma: to what
extent are public services subject to the norms of competition law and
the internal market…? As we shall see, neither the European
courts nor the Commission has so far provided a completely clear set of
answers to these
questions”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000309">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>In
other words, the legal environment at the very top is completely
opaque, playing off laws about competition and various parts of
legislation against other laws about
solidarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000233">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Would the hon. Gentleman agree that the point is
that when we add 85 clauses on competition, have a policy of any
willing provider and remove the private patient cap, that forces the
issue? We are saying that this is a market. This has not been an issue
before because it is clear that the NHS has been a social organisation,
with social aims and objectives. The only reason why the Government
have to set up Monitor to protect the NHS from competition law is that
they are adding competition law to the Bill and turning the NHS into
more of a market with their policies. Does the hon. Gentleman see
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000234">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady is wise enough in such matters to know
that the previous Government set up the Co-operation and Competition
Panel, because they saw the exact problem of the framework of European
law plus varied providers. <em>[</em>

discuss the prevalence of one set of nouns over another, but the
question is not how often nouns are used; it is for what purpose and to

law any less opaque than it currently is. I am totally convinced
that if there is no sector regulator of some sort,

worse.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000236">&#160;</a>

because I had seen other people standing; the eloquence of my hon.
Friend the Member for Southport has obviously silenced them. We have
had an interesting and particularly wide-ranging discussion. No doubt
we will not have to debate the first group of amendments at such
length, because we seem to have dealt with several issues within it. I
will confine my remarks to clause
55.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000237">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Like
most of my hon. Friends, I found the speech of the hon. Member for
Pontypridd entertaining, witty and lengthy. He promised us that he was
going to clear away the fog and smoke during his remarks. I fear that
he has let the Committee down in that respect, however, because he has
not kept his promise—he has actually thickened the smoke and
confusion with his rhetoric.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000238">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As I listened
to the hon. Gentleman, I thought of those movies that one saw when one

snake oil salesman who tries to sell his quack remedies. Unfortunately,
my hon. Friends will not have been convinced by his
quackery.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000239">&#160;</a>

Government believe that, for providers to be able to exercise their
functions and freedoms to improve services, the environment in which
they operate must be fair, stable and transparent. The policy aims to
liberate providers from hierarchical management and to create a
consistent framework of regulation across all types of providers. The
Future Forum stated in the “Choice and competition”
report:<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000242">&#160;</a>

key role is to protect and promote the interests of patients. It will
regulate all providers of NHS-funded health care services, and support
commissioners in ensuring the continuity of essential services. It will
also, with the NHS commissioning board, set the prices to be paid for
NHS services and address anti-competitive behaviour that acts against
patients’ interests. I am surprised that some have come to the
conclusion that competition and anti-competitive prices are exactly the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="11070756000243">&#160;</a>
