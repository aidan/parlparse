						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000339"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> It is good to see you back in the Chair,
Mr. Bayley, and it is good to be back in Committee. As you
can tell from my demeanour, I have been preparing carefully this
morning.</div>
					<a name="08022677000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The gist of
the amendment is that if we are to guide young people in the right
direction, we must be explicit about the nature of that guidance. I
wonder whether, instead of the clause referring simply to
&#147;services&#148;, the nature of the new statutory obligations
should be made clearer. In that sense, this is a probing amendment to
test the Government&#146;s commitment to and understanding of the
need to offer the right range of advice and guidance on what is
available to young
people.</div>
					<a name="08022677000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled the
amendment in the context that the Opposition continue to have profound
reservations about whether Connexions is the right vehicle to provide
the range of advice necessary to assist young people. I do not want to
undermine or demean Connexions. It does good work; however, it is asked
to do too much good work. An all-age careers service dedicated to
advising on &#147;career choices&#148;, as the amendment labels
them, that sat alongside Connexions  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column654" />Column number: 654</div>would be a much better vehicle to provide the advice and guidance that
is required. I have made that point before and make no apologies for
mentioning it again.</div>
					<a name="08022677000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Government are considering that point, because it has
been made not only by the Opposition, but by many agencies. I hope that
in responding to the amendment, the Minister will expound his thinking
on how he sees careers advice and guidance in the future. The demands
upon the service will be greater, given that it will be dealing with
the challenges of the statutory provisions at the heart of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022677000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">An all-age
careers service is the vehicle used in other places to deliver such
advice and guidance&#151;for example, Scotland has an all-age careers
service. Many people in the service believe that the problem with
Connexions is that it is a jack of all trades, giving advice on sexual
health, lifestyle issues and drug problems, rather than simply on
careers, training and related subjects. Careers guidance in other
European countries tends to be more systematic than in the UK. It tends
to begin much earlier and is geared towards providing detailed
information on the skills requirements for particular jobs or
professions.</div>
					<a name="08022677000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
joint memorandum on the Bill, all the main organisations involved in
careers guidance, including the National Association of Connexions
Partners and the Institute of Career Guidance, expressed concern that
the new local authority duty under the Bill is &#147;not specific
enough&#148;. They go on to
say:</div>
					<a name="08022677000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Effective
participation requires assistance with choices. Such advice and
guidance must be about choices not merely of which learning option to
follow, but why&#151;that is, with a clear view of progression beyond
18+ into employment (either directly or via further training or higher
education). The key is that choices about the relationship between
learning and work&#151;i.e. about career&#151;should drive
participation in
learning.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
places a clear duty on local authorities to provide just such services
and to adopt just such an approach.</div>
					<a name="08022677000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I started by saying
that the amendment is designed to probe the Minister and test the
Government&#146;s thinking, it is also built on our considered and
profound doubts about whether the proposed arrangements are
sufficiently robust and appropriate to give life to the Bill. Those
doubts are supported by a number of the agencies that have given
evidence on the Bill. Given that critique, if the Minister resists
amendment, I hope that he will range widely in saying why he thinks the
amendment is not sufficient and not in line with orthodox thinking, and
why his dogmatic concentration on the existing structure is
right.</div>
					<a name="08022677000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022677000340"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): I assumed that the
Conservative spokesman would speak to the wider purposes of the clause,
which is primarily to do with young people, including young adults who
are in the care of local authorities. I thought that the amendment
might at least address that aspect. Such young people may, in fact, be
attending the National Star College in the Cotswolds, which I visited
last year, where many young adults with learning difficulties and other
disabilities attend on a residential basis, not only to be given formal
education that leads to qualifications but to be taught valuable life
skills.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column655" />Column number: 655</div>
					<a name="08022677000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the broad intention of
the amendment, which seeks to widen the scope of the clause by
replacing the
phrase</div>
					<a name="08022677000034"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such services as
it considers appropriate&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08022677000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">with the more specific
&#147;information, advice and guidance&#148;. However, will the
Minister expand on what services he believes it would be considered
appropriate for the local authority to provide, so that we can see
whether the amendment is
relevant?</div>
					<a name="08022677000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000341"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> Good
morning, Mr. Bayley, it is a pleasure to see you back in the
Chair. We trust that you had a good week last week, when the Committee
was under the excellent stewardship of Mr.
Bercow.</div>
					<a name="08022677000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
94 would specify that services provided under the clause should be
known as &#147;Connexions&#148;. In proposing to amend the clause
in that way, I thought that the Opposition were seeking to pay tribute
to the success of the Connexions service in winning young
people&#146;s support and becoming so widely known. I thought that
they wanted to sustain a valued brand that is well known to young
people and keep the advantages to authorities of badging services
offering information, advice and guidance to young people with that
name. I then listened to the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings and was saddened to learn that he does not hold Connexions in
such high regard, but wants to retain the brand anyway. I reassure him
and the Committee that we intend to use the power to direct in clause
55, which I am sure that we will come on to fairly soon, to require
authorities to do just
that.</div>
					<a name="08022677000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the
hon. Member for Bristol, West regarding the services we envisage being
delivered by what will continue to be known as Connexions, we expect it
to carry out the services that the current service does, but to do so
to the quality standards that we have
published.</div>
					<a name="08022677000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
amendments Nos. 94 and 41, as the Committee will already be aware from
debate on earlier clauses, Connexions delivers generic information,
advice and guidance to young people, as well as more specific
information and advice on career choices. That will continue when the
responsibility is transferred to local authorities. The service
Connexions provides is supported by the new IAG quality standards,
which have been largely welcomed by local authorities and their
partners.</div>
					<a name="08022677000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings spoke of his desire for an
all-age careers service. He is worried that, given the breadth of the
advice that they are required to give, Connexions and its personal
advisers are jacks of all trades and masters of none. Obviously, we
have to strike a balance between genuine expertise and the ability to
offer a joined-up service that can look across the range of issues
affecting young people and advise them accordingly. Given the raising
of the status of the quality standards&#151;we intend to make them
statutory guidance&#151;we believe that we will get the best of both
worlds. It is not a question of either/or: we can have personal
advisers offering high-quality services and high-quality advice that
looks at the range of issues.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column656" />Column number: 656</div>
					<a name="08022677000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would say to the hon.
Gentleman that there is a case for developing an all-age strategy,
particularly with the extension of the participation age to 18. The
Government are implementing the recommendation in the Leitch report to
create a new adult careers service from 2010, and work is in train to
development a coherent strategy for careers advice for all
ages.</div>
					<a name="08022677000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000342"></a>Mr.
Hayes:

way?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000343"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I will in just a moment. Let me just finish the
points I am making.</div>
					<a name="08022677000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not necessarily have
one service catering for all age groups, as different age groups have
different needs. The strategy will help to ensure that transitions
between services are managed effectively and that common issues such as
labour markets and occupational information, contracting and work force
development are looked at collectively, where possible. It will also
ensure that the responses acknowledge and respect the different
concerns and problems of adults and young
people.</div>
					<a name="08022677000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000344"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Will the Minister provide more detailed information
on the pilots now being rolled out for the new adult careers service,
as they are highly relevant to the issues implicit in the amendments?
Secondly, what are the objectives of the pilots? There is some concern
that the objectives are unclear and that the pilots are not being
tested against any thesis or assumptions. He might like to take this
opportunity to correct that misapprehension, if it is
such.</div>
					<a name="08022677000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000345"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
giving me the opportunity to set out more details of the pilots. I fear
that I would try your patience, Mr. Bayley, if I were to get
too distracted at this point, but if I find an opportunity to address
that matter directly as we debate the transfer of Connexions to local
authorities, I will return to that issue to inform the Committee as
best I can.</div>
					<a name="08022677000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention is to raise the status of the quality standards to that of
statutory guidance. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are committed
to targeted youth support. We expect all authorities to deliver
targeted youth support throughout their areas by December this year.
That is a challenging but essential aim, and we are working with
Government offices, the Training and Development Agency for Schools and
local authorities to support that ambitious programme.
</div>
					<a name="08022677000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision of
information, advice and guidance and of targeted youth support will be
emphasised as a core function of Connexions through the directions that
we will issue under clause 55. We intend those directions to set out
that local authorities must ensure the provision of reasonable access
to a personal adviser for all 13 to 19-year-olds, and 20 to
24-year-olds with learning difficulties or disabilities, to provide
them with information, advice, guidance, advocacy and brokerage,
including brokering access to targeted youth support services. We
believe that those measures are suitable for ensuring a high-quality
and consistent approach, while providing councils with local
flexibility.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I am
surprised that the Minister is resisting amendment No. 93, given that
the wording is lifted from the foreword to the &#147;Quality
Standards for Young People&#146;s Information, Advice and
Guidance&#148; issued by his Department. His right hon. Friend the
Minister for Children, Young People and Families says in the first
paragraph of that
foreword:</div>
					<a name="08022677000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In a
complex and changing world all young people need access to good
quality, comprehensive and impartial Information, Advice and
Guidance...They need good IAG to help them make the right learning and
career
choices&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022677000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
changed &#147;learning&#148; to &#147;education&#148; in the
amendment. I am surprised that the Minister does not agree with his
right hon. Friend&#146;s wording and accept our
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022677000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000347"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I do not disagree with the wording or the
intention of the amendment. I regard it as unnecessary, because we are
going to give the guidance that he just referred to statutory status,
as I said twice in my comments. That will fulfil the purposes of the
amendments. On that basis, I hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="08022677000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000348"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Minister has underestimated the significance of
this aspect of the Bill and, indeed, of this group of amendments. At
the end of the day, the success of efforts to increase participation
will be dependent&#151;as we have argued repeatedly&#151;on
inspiring young people with a new thirst for learning. I believe that
that learning must, at its heart, have a test of employability: whether
it will lead to greater employability for the young person concerned.
Much of that will depend on the learning being tailored to particular
outcomes, so advice and guidance are critical.</div>
					<a name="08022677000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said when moving the
amendment, I do not want to demean the Connexions service; it does a
good job. However, I am not sure that creating extra demands on an
unreformed system is tenable. The clarity of what will be stated in the
Bill if the amendment is made will be highly significant in ensuring
that advice on careers and on the training related to careers is of a
sort that is likely to lead to the encouragement of that thirst for
learning and, thus, the greater participation that we all
seek.</div>
					<a name="08022677000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">One might ask
why I have reservations. Amendment No. 41, to which I did not speak at
length in my opening remarks and on which the Minister did not dwell,
either, makes provision for the existing dual-function Connexions
service to be separated so that the targeted support can be focused on
the young people who need it. The Connexions service cost &#163;475
million in 2006-07, which is more than twice the cost of the careers
service in its last year of operation&#151;&#163;236 million in
2000-01. Yet according to Government figures, less than a quarter of
young people advised by Connexions actually require the kind of
integrated support that it was designed to
deliver.</div>
					<a name="08022677000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
is right to say that we need to strike a balance between tailored
expertise on careers advice and the breadth of services, but I suspect
that that balance is not finely tuned at present. That minority of
young people who benefit from that range of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column658" />Column number: 658</div>services&#151;they are often quite challenged people&#151;is
certainly getting a good deal out of the existing arrangements. They
have a one-stop shop for the range of skills and advice that is
necessary for them to prosper. However, I doubt that the generality of
young people benefits from the existing arrangements, thus my call for
a parallel all-age careers service, which could give the sort of
skilled and expert advice necessary for the Bill to have the best
effect. The clearer we are about that on the face of the Bill, the
better.</div>
					<a name="08022677000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nor
am I convinced that the Minister has dealt with the question of
capacity. By definition, there will be additional demand: we will draw
into the system young people who I suspect do not now seek anything
from Connexions, wither careers advice or advice on lifestyle issues.
One of the reasons why I asked him about the pilots of the adult
careers service was that if we are going to take an holistic approach
to the relationship between supply and demand, capacity issues and
weighting, we need to know what the Government&#146;s medium-term
intentions are regarding the adult careers service. The Minister said
that the Government have responded to the Leitch report, but we do not
know much about the pilots. The message that I get from the sector is
that there are doubts about whether the pilots have been carefully
enough thought through and have been built around assumptions that can
be tested. Are the pilots aimed at establishing any clear
outcomes?</div>
					<a name="08022677000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
target our support more effectively. The aim of the Bill and of the
advice and guidance that is critical to its success is at least in part
to deal with the problem of young people not in education, employment
or training. It is a cause of immense shame that, according to official
figures issued on 16 January, the number of people aged 16 to 25 not in
employment, education or training has increased by 223,000 since 2002
to reach 1.24 million. The number of young people who are not in
education, employment or training has grown steadily since 1997 and is
now a shocking and unacceptable figure. It is inconceivable that the
quality of the advice and the nature of the guidance that young people
receive from school onwards do not have a role to play in dealing with
that. </div>
					<a name="08022677000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
started my summation by saying that the Minister underestimates the
significance of this part of the Bill and the amendments. It would
perhaps not be an exaggeration to say that failure on NEETs is one of
the most damning indictments of the present Government. If I feel
strongly and state my case with some passion, it is because this a
matter of real important. On the basis of what we have heard from the
Minister, I am not inclined to press the amendment, but I hope that he
will reflect further on the points made. It is not acceptable not to
take this aspect of the Bill sufficiently seriously. I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08022677000351"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Given that we had a slight problem with the last
pair of Government amendments, of which one was not put to the
Committee, I want to be absolutely clear that I would like all eight
Government amendments in the group to be put to the Committee and
agreed to, so that we do not have to return to them on
Report.</div>
					<a name="08022677000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">An effective
Connexions service is critical to raising participation&#151;a point
that hon. Members have made on several occasions in this Committee and
that has just been made at some length by the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings. We are committed to devolving responsibility
for the delivery of the Connexions service to local education
authorities. The Bill will achieve that, but it is important that the
Government retain the means to ensure that the essential core functions
of Connexions are delivered consistently across authority
boundaries.</div>
					<a name="08022677000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Connexions service is currently delivered directly by the Department,
and consistency can therefore be managed directly. It is critical to
the work that the Connexions service does to reduce the number of young
people not in education, employment and training, which will become
ever more important under our proposals for raising the participation
age, that there is national co-ordination and consistency, for the sake
of service users. Clause 55 as drafted therefore proposed a broad power
to give directions to a local education authority on the exercise of
its Connexions functions set out in clause 54&#151;the delivery of
Connexions services. Subsections of clause 55 set out what the
directions may cover.</div>
					<a name="08022677000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">On further consideration, I
have decided that it would be better if that direction-making power
were more tightly defined, and I imagine that members of the Committee
will agree that that is desirable. That deals with a concern expressed
to me on behalf of local government. The agreement between local and
central Government following the local government White Paper allows
local government a wide range of freedom and flexibility in how it
delivers agreed outcomes. A broad power to direct might be taken to
signal that central Government were not committed to that agreement,
however clear and tightly focused our intention.</div>
					<a name="08022677000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall outline the effect of
each amendment as briefly as I can. Amendments Nos. 190 and 191 will
narrow the power to direct by limiting its operation to the areas set
out in the subsections that follow. Amendment No. 192 will remove from
the scope of the directions two areas of operation: setting out how
Connexions services are to be made available and specifying standards
that are to be met. As I have just explained, I accept that those could
be considered incompatible with the new local performance framework and
the agreed national indicator set. Amendment No. 193 will replace the
areas for direction 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column660" />Column number: 660</div>removed by amendment No. 192 and therefore sets out what directions may
cover. The first paragraph of amendment No. 192 allows directions that
specify the descriptions of individuals who may be involved in
delivering Connexions. We propose to use that to specify minimum
qualifications for Connexions personal advisers.</div>
					<a name="08022677000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now is a good
point to discuss amendment No. 95, which was tabled by the hon. Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and is grouped with the Government
amendments. I hope that it is a probing amendment, designed to clarify
our expectations of the qualifications held by Connexions personal
advisers. Quite apart from the provisions in clause 55, the quality
standards for information, advice and guidance, which we discussed
earlier, deal with the qualifications and experience of staff. We will
ensure that local authorities must have regard to those standards.
Section 10 of the standards is the relevant section. As I made clear,
we will use the direction-making power provided by the first paragraph
of the amendment to specify the minimum level of qualifications that we
expect Connexions personal advisers to hold, in keeping with what is in
the standard. On that basis, I hope that the amendment is not
pressed.</div>
				
					<a name="08022677000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11 am</div>
					<a name="08022677000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second paragraph of
amendment No. 193 allows directions that require the authority to
ensure that the authority or any Connexions provider delivering
services on its behalf co-operates with the national Connexions Direct
service. Connexions Direct is an award-winning national helpline and
website service for young people. It complements face-to-face services
provided by local Connexions services and is highly regarded by young
people. The website regularly has over 100,000 visits per week. The
service has received extremely positive feedback from young people. The
website holds information on local Connexions provision&#151;for
example address and phone numbers, local website links and details of
major activities or campaigns&#151;which adds to the site&#146;s
value. It also supports local Connexions services. It will only work,
however, if local authorities keep it up to date. The paragraph also
allows directions requiring co-operation with Jobcentre Plus and any
other agencies that help young people find suitable employment,
education or training. I can envisage the national apprenticeship
service being included here.</div>
					<a name="08022677000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third paragraph of
amendment No. 193 allows directions to deal with the use of the
Connexions brand. That is the direction-making power to which I
referred when speaking to amendment No. 94. Since Connexions was
established, the brand has acquired well established recognition among
young people. We want the brand to continue to be prominent after local
authorities take responsibility for the services under clause 54. That
way, young people know the core services that are on offer and what
they can
expect.</div>
					<a name="08022677000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
194 allows us to direct authorities to adhere to the national
specifications for the Connexions client information system. That is
very important if we are to have easy and rapid updating of information
on individual young people. It is also important for ensuring that we
have data security to high national
standards.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column661" />Column number: 661</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000352"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Minister is giving a comprehensive account of
these important amendments. To what extent does he anticipate local
authorities will need to interact in this regard? We have not discussed
that much. He mentioned the need to have systems that are
interoperable. I am not sure we have sufficiently considered how much
interaction there will be, not merely between agencies but between
areas, for supporting young people.</div>
					<a name="08022677000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000353"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>There is considerable interaction between
different areas of Connexions. Services in those different areas will
be delivered by local authorities and will be the responsibility of
local authorities. The sorts of interaction generally relate to young
people who live in one place and access education and training or work
in another. There are also young people who travel from one place to
another and who might turn up in a different place and access
Connexions. A decision has to be made on whether they are temporarily
in a place and it is best to continue with the previous personal
adviser, or whether it is best to transfer the advice into the local
area. Similarly if a Connexions service run by a local authority in one
area where a young person lives started the advice, it is likely that
they would carry on that advice even if a young person accessed
education and training in a different authority. A decision might,
however, be made between authorities, in consultation with the young
person and the educational institution they are attending, on whether
or not it is appropriate to move the service from one local authority
to another. I hope that that satisfactorily answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div>
					<a name="08022677000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beneath that
sort of real interaction, which is designed to offer a joined-up,
seamless service for young people, data transfers are required within
the Connexions client information system. The hon. Gentleman used the
word interoperable, which may not be entirely the right word, but if
the services are all to be delivered to the same standard, the various
data systems do need to be interoperable. The relationship with
Connexions Direct and the Connexions client information system is a
different one. The national Connexions service does not hold data on
individuals; the data that are passed up are anonymised and are used
for statistical purposes.</div>
					<a name="08022677000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman can make his
long and passionate speech about our difficulties with NEETs, but while
we are on the subject, it is worth saying that the rise in the number
of NEETs is due partly to the rise in the number of 16 to 18-year-olds,
but we certainly do not shy away from the problems. However,
participation rates have increased in recent years: the proportion of
16 to 18-year-olds in education or training was 77.3 per cent. at the
end of 2006, an increase from 76.8 per cent. the previous year. We are
seeing some good trends, but that does not mean that we do not take the
problem very seriously. The whole reason for trying to pass the Bill is
that we want to be able to tackle this
problem.</div>
					<a name="08022677000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000354"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I do not want to go down the NEETs road,
Mr. Bayley, not because it is not vital, but because I
suspect you would not let me. Back on this issue of interoperability,
which is critical to this group of amendments, we heard disturbing
evidence from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column662" />Column number: 662</div>Association of Colleges that, in its opinion, the Connexions database,
which lies at the heart of the Bill&#146;s work, was &#147;not fit
for purpose&#148;. I speak without knowledge of that beyond what we
were offered, and certainly with no dogma, but that analysis was
disturbing. That view was later countered by other witnesses, but given
what the Minister was just saying about that database being the heart
of the information that is going to be shared across agencies and
areas, on what basis does he think that claim was made and is there any
substance in
it?</div>
					<a name="08022677000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000355"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Obviously I heard what the Association of Colleges
had to say in response to the question and what was said by the witness
from Connexions who disagreed with that assessment. I have looked at
other assessments of the CCIS by the Prime Minister&#146;s delivery
unit, among others. There is a good degree of confidence in the system.
That does not mean to say that in the period between now and when we
raise the participation age, there is not further refinement to be done
to the system, but we remain extremely confident that is a robust
system, which has been working reasonably well for Connexions in its
present operations.</div>
					<a name="08022677000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 194 will also
allow us to issue directions on another important subject. Young
people, especially in our cities, often go to a school, college or
training provider outside their home area. If for any reason they drop
out of learning, it is most important that that information gets
swiftly to the Connexions provider for that school or college, and that
the provider passes on the information without delay so that it reaches
the authority in the person&#146;s home area. If the young person has
dropped out of learning, it is the home authority that has the duty to
follow them up and to take every possible step to get them back into
education, training or employment.</div>
					<a name="08022677000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 195, makes it
clear that matters in subsections (3) and (4) are those about which
directions can be given. Finally, amendments Nos. 196 and 197 are
important clarificatory amendments. Amendment No. 196 deals with the
effective delivery of a range of important services to improve
opportunities for young people. It makes it clear that directions can
require a local education authority to ensure that whoever carries out
Connexions functions under clause 54, whether it is the local authority
or a Connexions provider, also provides other services specified in the
direction. Those services need not relate to education, but may relate
to social security. For example, it is intended that, if necessary, the
power could be used to ensure that local education authorities and
others providing Connexions services are also responsible for
conducting work-focused interviews with young persons, using powers in
social security legislation. That ensures that a range of activity
aimed at helping young persons into education, training or employment
can be brought together in one place. Amendment No. 197 makes it clear
that different directions, as provided for in this clause, can be
given, depending on the Connexions service in question.</div>
					<a name="08022677000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having set out the case for
amendments Nos. 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196 and 197, I ask the
Opposition not to press amendment No. 95.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column663" />Column number: 663</div>
					<a name="08022677000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000356"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Minister said that he felt we would be pleased
with the amendments, because they clarify and specify various aspects
of how, why and where advice and guidance will be given to young people
in respect of the new provisions in the Bill. He is right: I do welcome
those clarifications. The Bill was insufficiently clear as drafted. For
some of the reasons that I advanced during the debate on the previous
set of amendments, we think that that is unacceptable and seek greater
clarity of the kind the Minister is hoping to provide through the
Government amendments. That is why we tabled amendment No. 95, which
would specify the minimum qualifications and experience required of
providers of services, although I note that the Government&#146;s
panoply of amendments also deals with the nature of providers and their
qualifications.</div>
					<a name="08022677000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important aspect of this debate, which we will no doubt repeat when we
discuss amendment No. 96, is that we need to be absolutely clear about
how, where and by what method advice is to be given. I intervened on
the Minister in respect of interaction between agencies, and I think
that he recognises that that is an important point. I am not sure,
however, that interaction is assisted by the enormous number of
organisations that are now to have a hand in giving advice or managing
the system. For example, there is to be a new apprenticeships advisory
body&#151;the national apprenticeships service&#151;as a result of
the apprenticeships review. It is not terribly clear how that will
co-ordinate its work with all the others that have a role in these
matters.</div>
					<a name="08022677000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could go
on about some of the other risks of lack of clarity and consistency in
the way young people are guided and supported, but the Minister is
right to say that the Government amendments are helpful. They do
provide some of the answers to questions we have posed, and they are
certainly a step in the right direction. It would therefore be churlish
of us not to give them a welcome, if only a lukewarm welcome, or to
divide the Committee on any of them. Neither, on that basis, would we
want to press amendment No.
95.</div>

					<a name="08022677000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
that uncontentious run through a series of procedurally complex
amendments, we move to the altogether more straightforward matter of
amendment No. 96. As we have been discussing, the clause gives the
Secretary of State the power to give directions to a local authority
relating to the exercise of its duty to provide support for effective
participation. There are concerns that the clause will not ensure that
basic standards will be met. I have made the argument this morning that
we need to be explicit in our demands on those who are missioned to
provide support to young people. Amendment No. 95, which I did not
press, was designed to ensure that professional standards were
adequate, and the Government amendments add some of the greater clarity
that I have argued for.</div>
					<a name="08022677000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment may be fairly
technical, but it reflects concerns that through our discussions and in
the Bill we should support high-quality careers advice and a highly
professional careers service. In their memorandum on the Bill, all the
professional bodies involved in careers advice said that the clause
needs to be strengthened. It currently provides a power to the
Secretary of State, but they argue that it should be a duty. The
professional bodies urge
that</div>
					<a name="08022677000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at the appropriate
time in the passage of the Bill, an amendment to this effect be
tabled.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">They feel that
it is</div>
					<a name="08022677000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unacceptable to
leave this to &#145;chance&#146;; the Secretary of State should
ensure that, in every locality, quality is assured to national
specification and
standards.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a great danger that the system of careers advice that is developing
is fragmented because it consists of too many agencies with overlapping
responsibilities. The amendment is designed to address that risk. I
alluded to that point a few moments ago when I mentioned the doubts
about whether the apprenticeship review would add yet more complexity
to the system, obscuring it still further. There is the new adult
careers service that the Government are piloting,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column665" />Column number: 665</div>consisting of Learn Direct and Next Step; skills
brokers, who offer advice in respect of Train to Gain; the new
apprenticeship service that I have mentioned; Connexions, for young
people, which I described earlier as a jack of all trades; and
additional advice that will be offered, as it is now, through schools
and colleges, often completely independently of
Connexions.</div>
					<a name="08022677000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be
hard enough to draw the new young people whom we will be dealing with
into the system, as many of them face all kinds of challenges. I
suspect that the best way of advising and guiding them will be through
a system that is transparent, accessible and straightforward. It is not
certain that the panoply of organisations in the domain will provide
that degree of clarity. Our doubts relate primarily to quality, which
must be assured. That concern has been a theme of our debate thus far
this morning. Secondly, they relate to consistency: what is done must
work across organisations and areas. Thirdly, they relate to clarity
and transparency, and thus the need for a dedicated
service.</div>
					<a name="08022677000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
strong case that the adult service should be joined up, with advice
given to young people through an all-age careers service. If we really
want to imbue a culture of learning as Lord Leitch advocates, we need a
respected and universally recognised source of advice that everyone can
access. That sort of recognition requires a universal service. I do not
want to become tiresome in my advocacy of that approach, but we have an
important opportunity to explore the quality and nature of the advice
that we offer young people. On that basis, I wait to hear whether the
Minister can offer us further assurances on those three areas of doubt
that I have
identified.</div>

Knight:
						</b> We have agreed to all but one of the Government
amendments to clause 55, which make more specific the direction-giving
power that we feel is needed. The amendment largely applies to
subsection (4), which is about joining up services rather than
establishing new services. The amendment concerns Connexions providers
co-ordinating careers information and guidance with Learn Direct and
Jobcentre Plus. It also enables directions to specify Connexions to
carry out functions in services matching young people with employers
offering apprenticeships. As the clause is drafted, even in the amended
form, we have all the powers necessary to do that, as well as the
intention to do that.</div>
					<a name="08022677000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that Connexions
providers liaise with all the local services that are helping young
people to get the skills, training and jobs that they need. As we have
discussed, the directions allowed by the clause will provide the power
to direct those providing Connexions services to co-operate with those
exercising functions or providing services relating to social security,
such as Jobcentre Plus. They could also be used to require co-operation
with other agencies that help young people to find employment,
education or training. Connexions services have a good track record of
working with Jobcentre Plus and other agencies, and we do not want to
disturb that. However, if we feel that we have to direct authorities on
the issue, we will do so. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column666" />Column number: 666</div>We will consult on the detailed content of the directions on the passage
of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022677000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
subject of matching young people with employers offering
apprenticeships, the Committee may know that the apprenticeship review
announced plans for a new national apprenticeships service. I do not
want to say too much about that now as I imagine that my hon. Friend
the Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills
may want to touch on it when we discuss clause 67. However, I will say
that we expect the national apprenticeships service to work closely
with Connexions, perhaps even being based, in some cases, in
Connexions&#146; high street outlets. The national apprenticeships
service will also help careers guidance staff in schools and colleges
to offer well informed and balanced advice about the apprenticeship
programme to all their students. The field force could be invited by
schools and colleges to participate in careers guidance evenings, to
give students direct
information.</div>
					<a name="08022677000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings has concerns about quality
assurance. We have already discussed that, and I have mentioned many
times that the quality standard will have statutory force. Clearly
there is some overlap with other agents, but we want the wide remit for
Connexions personal advisers to continue, and to be developed and
deepened and the quality raised, so that the advisers can hold the ring
for young people and are able to broker access to the range of other
agencies that might be able to provide specific and discrete advice. I
hope that that satisfies the Committee and that the hon. Gentleman will
agree that the amendment is not necessary and will therefore withdraw
it.</div>

							<a name="08022677000359"></a>Mr.

						</b> We have had a good run on this matter this morning
and I think that the Minister has got the message that we are
absolutely determined that the advice and guidance given to young
people should be appropriate, and that we have greater doubts than he
has about the capacity of the existing system to deliver that
appropriate service.</div>
					<a name="08022677000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s
thinking on that might be iterative, in that the piloting of an adult
service could lead to a different perspective on how careers advice is
given to adults and young people alike. Indeed, I predict that, over
time, we will rethink the relationship between Connexions and careers
advice and guidance. The purpose of the amendment was to explore those
issues, and it has done its job. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08022677000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">During our
evidence-taking sessions we heard from two organisations that are
particularly successful in working with young people who have perhaps
become disengaged from education&#151;the Prince&#146;s Trust and
Fairbridge. Both organisations have extremely good track records of
working with people who are not in education, employment or
training.</div>

					<a name="08022677000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
recess, I attended City of Bristol college at a time when a group of
young people who had been through a Prince&#146;s Trust course were
completing their assignments and giving their end-of-course
presentations. The transformation of those young people from the start
of the course to the giving of their presentations to the audience was
quite incredible, particularly given their growth in self-confidence
while under the care of the Prince&#146;s Trust. I have seen similar
journeys by people who have taken Fairbridge access to learning
courses.</div>
					<a name="08022677000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
an assurance from the Minister that the clause opens the way for local
education authorities to engage with the third sector&#151;after all,
we do have a Minister with responsibility for the third sector. Such
organisations should have a recognised role in providing information,
advice and guidance, or access to learning and training courses, which
will perhaps lead to formal qualifications. I would like an assurance
that the clause opens that
possibility.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000361"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The clause principally relates to the
responsibility of local authorities to deliver Connexions services in
line with current practice. It will allow local authorities the maximum
possible flexibility. The clause proposes that local authorities should
have the power to deliver Connexions services on behalf of another
local authority where such arrangements are already made. The clause
can be used by local education authorities to procure services from
others, including the voluntary
sector.</div>
					<a name="08022677000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection

&#145;56(1)(b)&#146;, insert</div>
					<div class="hs_brev">&#145;and subject

					<a name="08022677000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
you will have noticed, Mr. Bayley, after his arduous work
over recent weeks, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton is having a rather quieter time this morning than he has
had thus far. The burden has fallen heavily on me. None the less, he
has been useful and supportive, as always in our team, in reminding me
of the substance of the amendment. According to the explanatory
notes:</div>
					<a name="08022677000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
58 places a duty on the responsible persons for educational
institutions to allow Connexions service providers reasonable access to
pupils and students and to provide reasonable facilities on the
institution&#146;s premises for providing
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is straightforward, and it simply says that the powers that
Connexions service providers are given should
be</div>
					<a name="08022677000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to the
consent of the pupil or
student.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
important, because it underpins the approach that we have taken
throughout our considerations that the Bill must be about engaging
young people by encouraging them to make a positive commitment, rather
than obliging them in a way that is likely to exacerbate their
detachment from learning and skilling. We have relentlessly championed
the cause of those young people, particularly the most vulnerable, and
I make no apologies for doing so. It is my mission in politics to speak
most loudly for those least able to speak for themselves. In that
spirit, I am proud to have moved the amendment that stands in my name
and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, who has given me such assistance in making this short
peroration.</div>
					<a name="08022677000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000363"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I start by congratulating the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings and his scriptwriter, the hon. Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, on that peroration. The effect of
the amendment would be to prevent Connexions services from having
access to students and available facilities in their place of learning,
unless consent was given by the student. That would make it much more
difficult for the Connexions service to provide support to young
people, and it would also create an unhelpful, complicated and
confusing layer of bureaucracy for schools and
colleges.</div>
					<a name="08022677000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Learning
providers already enable all students to access Connexions, so that the
service can offer them support. As local authorities are going to take
responsibility for providing the Connexions service, the present
arrangements should continue. If that were not the case, it would
significantly jeopardise the effectiveness of the Connexions service.
If accepted, the amendment would mean that the Connexions service would
be unable to access in their place of learning young people who failed
or refused to give their consent. Very often, those young people are
the most vulnerable ones, and include individuals with behavioural
problems or chaotic lifestyles&#151;the very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column669" />Column number: 669</div>people whom the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings has told
us it is his mission in politics to
represent.</div>
					<a name="08022677000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would effectively bar Connexions services from helping the
young people who need their support the most. I do not believe that
that is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention. I believe it is rather
to ensure that if learning providers provide Connexions services access
to their students, the students are under no obligation to accept the
offer of Connexions support unless they choose to do so. That is
existing practice, particularly in the case of one-to-one support,
where the student has actively to engage with the Connexions personal
adviser of their own volition.</div>
					<a name="08022677000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause, as drafted, will
continue to facilitate the existing arrangements, which are vital to
the successful operations of Connexions services. There is no question
of a young person being put in detention so that they can be forced to
have a meeting with the personal adviser. It would remain a voluntary
activity on the part of the young person. I would not want Connexions
to be unable to go on to a school site without a specific piece of
consent from a specific
pupil.</div>

						<a name="08022677000364"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): One of the
problems that arises at some further education colleges is that popular
courses are oversubscribed. If there is a hairdressing suite, for
example, it can only take so many hairdressers. Would the provision
interfere with that in any way? Would it enable a Connexions adviser to
force somebody on to a hairdressing course if there was not really room
for
them?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000365"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> No, it would not interfere with that at all. There
is no question of personal advisers forcing individuals on to
particular courses. It is important that young people are motivated to
take
courses.</div>
					<a name="08022677000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000366"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> I did not mean forcing an individual to do a
course, but forcing the institution to take an extra individual when
that course is
full.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000367"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I do not believe that the service would have the
power to force institutions to take individuals on to certain courses.
The only powers of which I am aware are those that require institutions
to accept individuals of compulsory school age. Those matters are dealt
with in the admissions code, which has statutory force. The change that
we made in the Education and Inspections Act 2006 means that a local
authority can require an institution to take a looked-after child if it
is in the best interests of that child&#146;s education. I hope that
in the light of my response to those interventions and my reasoning the
hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000368"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I shall not press the amendment,
although I want to re-emphasise my point: the system will work only if
it inspires young people to make their own commitment to be advised and
trained. It will not work if young people are dragged grudgingly,
kicking and screaming, towards the Connexions adviser, then forced on
to a training course that they do not want to take. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column670" />Column number: 670</div>That will simply not work. During the passage of the Bill, we have made
that point repeatedly&#151;amplified beautifully by my hon. Friend
the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in particular&#151;but
I am not sure that it has been heard clearly by Ministers. Although I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, I suspect that we will

separately.</div>
					<a name="08022677000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 184 would insert additional subsection (c) into the clause, and I
will illustrate the subject with a word or two about the view of the
distinguished educational charity, Edge. Clause 59
says:</div>
					<a name="08022677000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may provide or secure the provision of services for
encouraging, enabling or assisting the effective participation of young
persons and relevant young adults in England in education or
training.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Edge
reminds us, that includes the publication of information, advice and
guidance, and responding to particular requests for information
electronically or by telephone. The provision for advice is important,
and clause 59 should be read alongside clause 66, which requires
schools to provide impartial information and advice for education,
training and
careers.</div>
					<a name="08022677000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">As an aside,
I am anxious that the advice given by schools and colleges and the
advice given by Connexions should be consistent. In our last debate, we
talked about the new powers that Connexions will have to offer advice
in educational institutions, but we did not explore in detail the risk
of inconsistency, which might come from advice being given by different
people to individuals in schools and colleges. The Minister might want
to deal with that in his
summation.</div>
					<a name="08022677000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="08022677000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Edge
foundation welcomes the clauses, because they emphasise the importance
of comprehensive and impartial information, advice
and guidance on educational training and careers. However, it believes
that if young people are interested in a particular course or career,
they should be able to hear directly from people who have pursued, or
are pursuing, that course or career. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column671" />Column number: 671</div>There are many ways in which that can be achieved, but the internet
opens up almost unlimited opportunities. That argument has considerable
merit. Young people are often most inspired by people who have done
something themselves. Through such examples, we can engage people whom
we might not successfully encourage down a particular professional
route by other means. Edge uses as an example the national youth
volunteering service, which provides substantial financial support for
a web-based service called &#147;horsesmouth&#148;. Through
horsesmouth, people considering different options for learning and
careers put questions to people who have faced similar choices. The
website says:</div>
					<a name="08022677000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When faced with a
choice, challenge or change in life, do you ever wonder how other
people have coped in the same situation&#151;what choices did they
make, and how did they turn out? Wouldn&#146;t it be useful if you
could talk to someone who has been there, done that and is willing to
share their first-hand experience with you? Wouldn&#146;t it be great
fun if that could be anonymous, confidential and
secure?&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such services
should form a core part of the service offered by the Secretary of
State in pursuance of the power created by clause 59, and that is the
purpose of amendment No. 184. Essentially, the argument is that we
should use the latest technology, emulate the best existing practice,
and recognise that young people are often most influenced by seeing how
something has been done through the eyes of someone else who has done
it.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Gordon Marsden</b> (Blackpool, South) (Lab): I am listening
with interest to the case that the hon. Gentleman is making for other
mechanisms to give information, advice and guidance, not least the
suggestions from Edge and horsesmouth. Is he aware that the all-party
skills group is conducting an inquiry into information, advice and
guidance? That report will be published in due course, to the
edification, I hope, of everyone, including
Ministers.</div>

do, as the hon. Gentleman knows, maintain a healthy dialogue with the
all-party group. In fact, I am pleased to have been invited to attend
and speak at events organised by the hon. Gentleman, and I pay tribute
to his work in that regard. I hope that the all-party group will come
to a similar conclusion to the one that I have reached on advice and
guidance, which I have articulated at considerable, but not sufficient,
length.</div>
					<a name="08022677000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is good
practice out there, and not all of it revolves around the mainstream
institutions. It stems partly from the dynamism offered by technology,
from which we can learn from and which therefore needs to be built into
our thinking when considering this part of the Bill. I do not know if
the all-party group has had a chance to look at that proposal, but if
they have not, it may not be too late to use the provision as a
catalyst for doing so.</div>

Government, wishes to look carefully at new mechanisms. The question
is: what are the precise devices for using the new
mechanisms?</div>

							<a name="08022677000375"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I did not want to compromise the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s position, as I am sure he knows, but we have had a
helpful exchange. The way in which people gather, exchange and use
information has changed immensely, and continues to do so. That lies at
the core of our considerations today. The fact that we are talking
about young people only exaggerates the significance of that point,
because I suspect that many young people are accustomed to accessing
information wholly or mainly by technological means. That is why Edge
has done us a service in advising us on these matters, and I am
delighted to reflect its perspective in the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022677000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000376"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I agree with Edge, with the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings, and with my hon. Friend the Member for
Blackpool, South, that it is important that young people should have
access to the opinions and experiences of those who are already engaged
in education, training or a particular career. I am pleased to be able
to tell the Committee that the national service, Connexions direct,
provides that material on its excellent website,
www.connexions-direct.com, and I am sure the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings will be reaching as we speak for his hand-held
device to access it, Mr. Bayley, if that is in
order.</div>
					<a name="08022677000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, if
a young person cannot find a case study that is relevant to them, they
can inform the Connexions contractor, who will take steps to find or
commission an appropriate case study. That is precisely what Edge and
the hon. Gentleman are interested in. There are close links between
Connexions direct and organisations such as sector skills councils,
which have databases of case studies that can be accessed. Connexions
direct is an extremely successful service for young people in England,
and it also offers an excellent helpline on 080 800 13219. There are
more than 100,000 visits a week to the website, with an average 6,000
contacts to the helpline. The service has won several awards, and it
offers information, advice and guidance at a time and in a way that is
convenient and tailored to the needs of young people, particularly
those who like to access their information by technology. Connexions
direct is always considering new ways and initiatives to improve its
service, and I am sure it will have listened carefully to what hon.
Members have said, and will listen to what the all-party group report
and Edge might tell
it.</div>
					<a name="08022677000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
consistency between schools and Connexions that the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings raised at the beginning of his speech,
14-to-19 partnerships have responsibility to ensure proper
co-ordination between careers education in schools and the information,
advice and guidance provided by Connexions and local authorities. The
quality standards set out that requirement, and I have already referred
to the importance of those standards. Local 14-to-19 consortiums have
to show that they meet the standards to progress through the diploma
gateway. As the service the hon. Gentleman requires is already
available, and will continue to be so under the clause as drafted, and
given the indications I have made to the Committee, I invite him to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

						</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s remarks. This is
a probing amendment, designed to highlight an important matter. The
Minister might want to reflect further on the generality of this
debate, given what the hon. Member for Blackpool, South and I have said
and what Edge has observed. By the time that the Bill is enacted,
assuming that that is so&#151;we have no guarantee that the Bill will
ever become law&#151;it could easily be the case that anything other
than the advice and guidance that is offered through the means that
horsesmouth uses will be regarded as archaic. In that context, we need
to be absolutely clear about how we use the available technology to
best effect.</div>
					<a name="08022677000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
revolution has only just begun, and although I am a deep Conservative
and am resistant to all revolutions, I suspect that we have to deal
with the inevitability of a changed world with regard to the use,

what the Minister has said and the chance that we have had to explore
those matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

						</b> Indeed. The amendment speaks for itself. We have
not said much&#151;indeed, we have perhaps said too
little&#151;about how the Bill will affect young people with various
kinds of disability. Among the population of NEETs, as I lamented
earlier, is a substantial number of young people with learning
difficulties or other disabilities, and we need to concentrate
particularly on their needs if we are to be successful in providing
them with appropriate training that is likely to allow them to gain
employment. The amendment deals with one group of young people: those
with visual impairment. We ought, however, to find ways during the
passage of the Bill to speak more broadly about disabled young people
and people with learning difficulties.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000381"></a>The

						</b> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that this is
an important but very narrow amendment dealing with visual impairment.
He rightly says that there might be opportunities elsewhere in the Bill
to discuss other disabilities, but we should stick to visual

concerned.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000382"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I take your point, Mr. Bayley. I did
say, very much in that spirit, that we might find an opportunity to
debate the wider issue at another time, but this debate is specifically
about people with visual impairment. The amendment would implicitly add

<div class="Column"><a name="Column674" />Column number: 674</div>value to clause 59. It is important that we make adequate provision for
young people who might otherwise be disfranchised simply because they
cannot access the materials necessary to improve their circumstances. I
find it almost inconceivable that, on that basis, the Minister will
fail to accept the

							<b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): This is an important if
narrow amendment, which gives us the opportunity to right a wrong of
which I was not previously aware, as may have been the case for other
members of the Committee. It was drawn to my attention last year. Hon.
Members may recall a lobby in Westminster Hall called &#147;Right to
Read&#148;, in which parents of sight-impaired children came to
Parliament lobby their MPs about their inability to access textbooks
and learning material in
schools.</div>
					<a name="08022677000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, when a partially sighted pupil in a mainstream school goes to a
lesson, the teacher must identify the relevant pages of the textbook
that will be used and photocopy them. That takes up teaching time and
delays the partially sighted pupil&#146;s ability to start work.
There are also obvious disadvantages with homework, as the situation
deters those children from working independently. Initial inquiries
that I made last year have led me to understand that there is not a
copyright problem in having school textbooks available online, so that
individual partially sighted pupils can enlarge and enhance the
relevant text to their own
needs.</div>
					<a name="08022677000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It follows that
the same problem will apply in college. I would therefore like to take
the opportunity to make teaching materials available to partially
sighted pupils in college, because it gives them independence and they
will not have to rely on the additional service of teachers. If they
could access all their teaching materials and textbooks independently
online, it would be of enormous advantage to them, and it is relatively
simple to make such material
available.</div>

							<a name="08022677000384"></a>Jim

information provision as their
peers.</div>
					<a name="08022677000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I applaud the
hon. Member for Upminster for raising the &#147;Right to Read&#148;
campaign and the importance of school textbooks being accessible to
people with visual impairments. I will not be distracted for long in
responding to her concerns, because I am aware of the narrowness of the
amendment, Mr. Bayley, as you reminded the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings. However, part IV of the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 requires schools and local authorities to plan
to improve access to the curriculum and written materials to disabled
pupils over time. In addition, the new disability equality duty
introduced by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 into the 1995 Act
requires all public bodies, including schools and local authorities, to
promote disability equality more widely. As a result, new subsection
49A(1)(d), which deals with the general duty, includes</div>

					<a name="08022677000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the need to take steps to take

Member for Upminster
discussed.</div>
					<a name="08022677000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members may be aware, my Department&#146;s special educational needs
strategy, &#147;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#148;, sets out
our vision for giving children with special educational needs and
disabilities the opportunity to succeed. Furthermore, as I have said,
there are various duties in the disability discrimination legislation
that cover the needs of visually impaired young people, as is the case
with other disability groups. The national service, Connexions direct,
which is subject to the amendment, has taken great steps to ensure that
its services are available to people with visual impairment. It is
concerned with the provision of information, advice and support to
young people, rather than with the provision of course materials, which
was raised by the hon. Member for Upminster. To meet best practice and
Government accessibility guidelines, the Connexions direct website has
been developed to comply with the web accessibility initiative of the
World Wide Web Consortium. Connexions direct has worked extensively
with the Royal National Institute of Blind People to ensure that, as
far as possible, its materials are accessible to people with visual
impairments. I have a list of about seven things they have done to meet
that standard.</div>
					<a name="08022677000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
result of making those changes and design amendments, Connexions direct
was successful in winning a visionary design award for the
site&#146;s outstanding efforts in ensuring the accessibility of
content for visually impaired users. I am assured that it is committed
to keeping that design on its website, to which the amendment refers. I
trust that, in the light of that assurance, and the fact that this
really is an example of best practice, the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

won that award and that it takes seriously its work for visually
impaired young people. The access to information for visually impaired
people is variable&#151;I am not speaking in particular about
Connexions, but about access more generally&#151;which explains our
determination to highlight the matter by tabling an amendment. The
Minister has responded positively to the matters raised by my hon.

we are sure that those good intentions are carried through and that
visually

area review. In previous debates, I have quoted the report by the House
of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs entitled
&#147;Apprenticeship: a key route to skill&#148;, which
acknowledged that there had been no proper oversight of Connexions by
Ofsted since
2004.</div>
					<a name="08022677000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 99
would ensure that, if local people are concerned about the quality of
the Connexions service in their area, they can trigger an inspection by
the Chief inspector. It would make the process of inspection responsive
to local needs. In responding to the amendment, will the Minister
explain the process which would lead the Secretary of State to insist
on an inspection under the Bill as drafted? Doubts about the inspection
machinery for Connexions underlie the amendment. The Minister has
spoken a great deal about advice and guidance this morning, because
that is the area of the Bill with which we are dealing. Indeed, he has
spoken confidently about the role of Connexions in giving that advice
and guidance. However, if that role is to be assured, an appropriate
inspections regime must be in place, and we are not confident that that

thinks fit. The amendment proposes that if at least 50 pupils, students
or parents resident in a local authority request an investigation, the
chief inspector would be under a duty to conduct one. I reassure the
Committee that individuals or groups are free to petition the Secretary
of State or Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector to undertake
inspections. Such petitions are taken very seriously by both parties.
Indeed, one complaint that identifies a significant risk to the
well-being of young people is all that is needed under the current

benefit of children and employers that services are inspected, and
their levels of satisfaction must be taken into account. Those

						<b class="B"> </b>Between autumn 2002 and autumn 2004, Ofsted
carried out full inspections of 28 Connexions partnerships. It is worth
saying that of those partnerships, 89 per cent. were rated as
satisfactory or better, and 60 per cent. as good or better. There have
been no further inspections focused solely on Connexions partnerships.
Instead, from September 2005, Ofsted, along with other inspectorates,
has undertaken holistic joint area reviews&#151;known in the trade as
JARs&#151;of services for children and young people in a local
authority area. JARs replace the separate inspections of local
education authorities, social services, Connexions services and the
provision for students aged 14 to
19.</div>
					<a name="08022677000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The programme of
JARs will end in late 2008, and from next year, most inspections of
area-level services will be bespoke to an area and triggered by a
multi-inspectorate annual comprehensive area
assessment&#151;CAA&#151;led by the Audit Commission and including
Ofsted. Inspectorates are currently working up arrangements for the
CAA. The first consultation on principles will end this month, and the
inspectorates plan to consult on details in summer 2008. That is the
normal scenario that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
asked about in respect of how the Secretary of State will instruct the
chief inspector to carry out inspections of Connexions. That will be
rolled into the CAA
process.</div>
					<a name="08022677000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides for a flexible and responsive system that allows the views of
service users to be taken into account and that can target inspections
to the level of risk. I do not believe that using a fixed number of
requests as a trigger for an inspection is the best way to use
inspection resources. More importantly, that would risk sending the
message that the receipt of fewer than 50 requests, however serious
they are, is not significant. I hope that in the light of that
compelling reasoning, the reasonable hon. Member for South Holland and
The Deepings will withdraw the

Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector must, in exercising his functions in
subsection (1), inspect any support services provided and make an

this Part applies and who have special educational
needs.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08022677000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Connexions service plays a vital role in helping young people with
special educational needs to make the transition from education to
employment. I have emphasised how significant we believe the challenge
is. There are certainly problems with how many young people with
special educational needs secure appropriate employment. There are some
great success stories, which need to be championed and trumpeted.
However, as an academic study in 2003 found, there are significant
problems with the service. That report
concluded:</div>
					<a name="08022677000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
findings from this project are consistent with other studies in
highlighting the unsatisfactory nature of much transition planning for
young people with learning difficulties...we remain concerned
that, despite efforts to stimulate interest, work and employment hardly
featured. Raising expectations and belief in young people and their
families about work must become much more central to the educational
and the Connexions task. This must be matched by close working between
PAs and Careers Advisors in the Connexions service plus the development
links with local supported employment agencies&#151;where they
exist.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 43 specifies that inspection of the Connexions service should
include the inspection of facilities and services for young people with
special educational needs. It therefore allows a broader consideration
than my previous amendment, which applied only to people with visual
impairment. That academic report&#151;&#147;Connecting with
Connexions: the role of the Personal Adviser with young people with
special educational and support needs&#148;, by Bob Grove PhD and
Alison Giraud-Saunders&#151;highlighted examples of good practice. My
hon. Friend the Member for Upminster and I have both mentioned the ROSE
project, the supported employment project in her area that does exactly
the job&#151;described as vital in the report I quoted&#151;on the
transition from education to employment with appropriate advice and,
where necessary, support.</div>
					<a name="08022677000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation that prevails in
my hon. Friend&#146;s area is not, however, universally enjoyed.
There are insufficient high-quality supported employment opportunities
for young people with special educational needs. As that academic study
identified, that is partly because employment is not given sufficient
priority in the guidance that young people with SEN are offered. To
guarantee that it is given greater priority, the Bill must state that
the Connexions inspection should look closely at the service&#146;s
success in providing such advice to people with SEN. This is another
matter about which members on both sides of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column679" />Column number: 679</div>the Committee have strong feelings, and I feel particularly strongly
about it. The Minister will know that people with SEN figure largely in
the group he is determined to bring back into learning, and thus
employment, because people with such needs clearly do not always do
best under the system at the moment. At the age of 16, they are often
virtually abandoned as far as their employment opportunities are
concerned. I do not want to exaggerate the difference between us, but I
urge the Minister to pay appropriate attention to this issue by
demonstrating in his response to the amendment that the Government are
determined that SEN young people should have just the same
opportunities as their contemporaries whenever
possible.</div>

						</b> I should like to reassure the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings that we, too, take very seriously the
provision of appropriate Connexions services for young people with
learning difficulties and disabilities. The duty on a local education
authority proposed in clause 54 is to make services available to all
young people between 13 and 19, and for young people with special
educational needs between 13 and 24. Young people with special
educational needs are therefore implicitly and explicitly
included.</div>
					<a name="08022677000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The quality
standards for information, advice and guidance will be the centrepiece
of the guidance on Connexions services that we will issue to local
education authorities under clause 54(4)(b). They require that
additional and sustained guidance and support is provided to young
people with special needs or learning difficulties or disabilities.
Clause 60 allows Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector to target an
inspection on the provision of services for a particular part of the
Connexions client group. The clause also allows the Secretary of State
to target a request for an inspection in a similar fashion.
Crucially&#151;I know that the hon. Gentleman would not be satisfied
with the word, &#147;allows&#148;, as he wants something more
concrete than a power and closer to a duty&#151;all assessments and
inspections of children&#146;s services are governed by the statutory
framework for inspection of children&#146;s services, under section
21 of the Children Act
2004.</div>
					<a name="08022677000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The framework
sets out 36 judgments which inspectors will seek to make. Five of the
36 judgments relate to children and young people with learning
difficulties or disabilities. The framework will apply to local
authority Connexions services inspected under clause 60. That being the
case, I do not consider that we need to make an additional specific
reference in the clause to make that
possible.</div>

the Committee:</div>
					<a name="08022677000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In order to ensure that
there is effective monitoring of the provisions for those young people
with SEN we would like to see a requirement for Her
Majesty&#146;s...Inspector...to have available SEN
specialist inspectors...We believe that such a focus would help to
drive up standards.&#148;</div>

							<a name="08022677000396"></a>Jim

sought to reassure organisations such as TreeHouse about the provision.
I take seriously its request that people with specialist skills should
undertake SEN inspections, although I do not think that that is the

							<a name="08022677000397"></a>Mr.

						</b> Will the Minister offer further reassurance to the
Opposition and interested agencies by providing an assessment of how
many NEETs are people with special educational needs? Will he give us a
feel for the modelling that the Government have done as to how the Bill
will apply specifically to people with SEN? Encouraging people to
participate is one thing, but dealing with their needs is another.
Unless they both happen, we are not going to deal with concerns such as
those that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
raised.</div>

However, if that information comes to me at any point, obviously I will
pass it on to the hon. Gentleman and to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08022677000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
Government policy that inspection activities should be proportionate to
risk. Specifying the focus of an inspection in that way would act
against the policy and against our aims of reducing the regulatory
burden. Clearly, there are circumstances when we might want Ofsted to
carry out a specific inspection, and we have the powers to do that.
Those inspections would be based on risk attached to information or to
concerns about a particular service. However, to have the attitude that
there is a general risk is contrary to the approach of specifying such
matters through the overarching framework, which is the right way
forward. May I tell the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
that what he proposes in the amendment is already possible, as it is
addressed in the overarching framework of children&#146;s services?
Therefore, while I agree with the sentiment of the amendment, it is not
necessary and I hope that he will withdraw
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000399"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I am not entirely happy with what the Minister told
us. The truth is that Ofsted does not inspect Connexions, or at least
not very often&#151;not since 2004. The notion that the existing
regime is adequate in that regard is, at best, questionable. Similarly,
I am not sure that the Government have given sufficient consideration
in the Bill to people with special educational needs, not just in terms
of inspection, but more generally. The Minister would do the Committee
a service if he came back with an analysis of SEN in relation to NEETs
and another detailed analysis of SEN in relation to the Bill&#146;s
provisions. The challenge is to bring into training and employment a
much greater of proportion of people with special educational needs
than are there at the moment. Such a challenge will only be met if we
put the right advice and support in place. It is out there, in some
places, as I said, but there are massive gaps in
provision.</div>

Throughout the Committee sittings, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column681" />Column number: 681</div>I have said time and again that we want every young person to be able to
participate and that we need to configure services by local authorities
and others to ensure that everyone, regardless of their needs, has the
opportunity to do so. That is precisely what we want to achieve with
the Bill: the galvanising effect to offer appropriate services for
every single young person in this country, regardless of special

clear that he wants everyone to participate&#151;he would hardly
introduce a Bill that insisted on universal participation if he did not
want everyone to be involved. However, I am arguing that to get
everyone to participate, particularly those with special educational

generosity in giving way. If he wishes to know how seriously we take
this, it might help him to know that the annual destination survey by
Connexions on the activities of young people on 1 November of the year
in which they completed year 11 shows that in 2005, about 25 per cent.
of young people with special educational needs whose destinations were
known were not in education or training, 9.2 per cent of them being
employed, and 15.2 per cent. being unemployed. Support for transition
was one of the issues highlighted in the &#147;Aiming High for
Disabled Children: Better Support for Families&#148; report of 2006,
and there is a &#163;19 million transition support programme for
those young

						</b> That is a helpful addition to our considerations. I
will not press the matter to a vote, but I urge the Minister to look
again at the issue of inspection, particularly with regard to special
educational needs. I think that we underestimate at our peril the scale
of the peak that we must surmount. We will short-change people with
special educational needs unless we put the right systems in place to
allow them to achieve their potential, just like other young people. I
am determined to continue to make that case during the passage of the
Bill by defending and advancing those young people&#146;s interests,

clause 60, page 32, line 34, at

services.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08022677000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a pleasure to take a full part in the Committee&#146;s
proceedings, having been the bag man for my hon. Friend the Member for
South Holland and The Deepings for the past two hours. Clause 60
requires the inspector to conduct an inspection of Connexions when she
thinks fit and when the Secretary of State requires her to do so.
Subsection (3) states:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column682" />Column number: 682</div>
					<a name="08022677000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A reference in

management and use of resources in providing
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does not
say anything about the quality of the service, or that the inspector
should inspect the services in relation to quality, so the amendment
would add the phrase,</div>
					<a name="08022677000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and the quality of such
services&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08022677000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">to the end of
subsection (3). The Government want Connexions to be a high-quality
service, but there are problems, as my hon. Friend the Member for South
Holland and The Deepings has highlighted, given that there has not been
an inspection of Connexions by Ofsted since 2004. &#147;Quality
Standards for Young People&#146;s Information Advice and
Guidance&#148;, which has been published by the Minister&#146;s

that staff should have the</div>

					<a name="08022677000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guidance has
therefore been published requiring quality services to be provided. It
is important that the legislation require the chief inspector to have
regard to the quality of the service, given the problems that have
arisen in the past, and that there is a specific requirement that she
have regard to the quality of provision set out in the
legislation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000405"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> As we have heard, the amendment seeks to include
in the clause the words, &#147;quality of...services&#148;, as
that applies to the scope of inspections. I can understand the concerns
of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, because one does
not see the word, &#147;quality&#148;, when one reads the clause.
However, as I will explain, the amendment is unnecessary because
quality is specified in other pieces of
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08022677000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has repeated the notion that there has been no inspection of
Connexions since 2004. As I think I have set out to the Committee,
there have been inspections of Connexions services since 2004, but not
a specific inspection, as those inspections have been wrapped up in
other local authority inspections. However, it would be wrong for
anyone reading the record to be led into thinking that there has been
no inspection since 2004. Section 118 of the Education and Inspections
Act 2006 provides that the chief inspector has the general duty of
keeping the Secretary of State informed about the quality of services
within her remit, as well as improvements in the quality of such
services. Additionally, section 119 of the 2006 Act sets out that the
chief inspector is to perform her functions for general purposes. That
includes encouraging the improvement of activities within the chief
inspector&#146;s remit, and the carrying on of such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column683" />Column number: 683</div>activities in a user-focused fashion, both of which are measures of the
quality of
services.</div>
					<a name="08022677000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
purposes will apply to inspections under clause 60 in the same way that
they do to all the chief inspector&#146;s existing functions. The
amendment could have the undesirable consequence of bringing into
question the issue whether other inspections should focus on the
quality of services being inspected if that function is specified.
Accordingly, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08022677000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
return to the matter of someone who is in the last year of schooling

educational needs.</div>
					<a name="08022677000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Autistic Society has taken a close interest in the Bill and is
concerned about the narrowness of that requirement. In its brief to the

says:</div>
					<a name="08022677000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
references to learning difficulty and special educational needs are
welcome but not sufficient. In particular, the duty to assess education
and training needs (clause 65) should not be restricted to those young
people who have a
statement.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inspired by
those concerns, which we share, we tabled the amendment, which would
include children who are subject to school action and school action
plus 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column684" />Column number: 684</div>programmes and therefore fall short of qualifying for a full statement
of special educational needs under the provisions of the

says:</div>
					<a name="08022677000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
requirement upon local authorities to assess the education and training

used to inform the development of support services for young

say:</div>
					<a name="08022677000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Government
policy is to encourage local authorities to reduce reliance on the use
of statements, and there is considerable variation in access to the
statementing system across the
country.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that many hon. Members, both in Committee and in the House, could
give examples of constituents who have had enormous difficulty
obtaining a statement of special educational needs for their child.
Obtaining even an assessment can be very difficult and may require
legal action. That is why the National Autistic Society go on to
say:</div>
					<a name="08022677000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The use
of statements as a passport to an assessment of education and training
needs will therefore further exacerbate uneven access to support for
many young people with special educational
needs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">It cites the
example of young people with Asperger&#146;s syndrome who</div>
					<a name="08022677000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may be less likely to have a
statement of SEN than those with autism but would still benefit greatly
from an assessment at 16. Although these young people are able
academically, without the right support they are likely to struggle or
even fail.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the two amendments is to ensure that those children who do not

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): Good afternoon, Mr.
Bayley. I rise not only to support the amendments, but to prove to you
and the Minister that I have not taken any Trappist vows since our
proceedings ended on Thursday. I hope that you are reassured by
that.</div>
					<a name="08022677000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
are important and link with amendment No. 160, which we will discuss
later. They are necessary to ensure that the increasing focus of
statements on a small minority of pupils does not mean that we miss out
on diagnosing the needs of other young people who are covered by School
Action and School Action Plus and who may well need support to continue
in education and training
post-16.</div>
					<a name="08022677000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The briefing
that the Local Government Association provided to the Committee

conceivable comments may be passed on the adequacy or otherwise of
local authority SEN provision/assessments under existing
regulations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022677000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">For many
people across the country, I suspect that that is something of an
understatement. Much concern has been voiced in the past year and
further back about the inconsistency of statementing across the
country. Frankly, there is a concern that statementing is rationed in
many parts of the country, particularly in smaller authorities with
very limited budgets, where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column685" />Column number: 685</div>providing a larger budget for statementing would mean taking money away
from other areas. Therefore, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton set out very clearly, there is concern about some young
people in parts of the country where there are greater budget pressures
and more rationing who may have very similar needs and characteristics
to other young people in parts of the country where there is a more
generous approach. We do not want to have a local lottery where some
young people simply do not have their needs properly captured and so
are not well provided for beyond the age of
16.</div>

statement excessively. They want to use School Action and School Action
Plus more frequently than in the past and, on the whole, that is quite
sensible. We do not want to create a vast bureaucracy around many young
people. We want a lot of their needs to be dealt with as flexibly as
possible, both at school level and by enabling local authorities to
cascade additional resources down that do not require the same level of
bureaucracy and intervention as is inevitable when statementing is
involved.</div>
					<a name="08022677000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because of
that trend in Government policy, there is an even greater risk that
some of the youngsters on School Action Plus in particular, but School
Action as well, could have quite high needs that require support beyond
the age of 16. As well as the concern about rationing and
inconsistencies across the country, there is the concern that if the
Government&#146;s policy is to reduce statementing, we could have
quite a few youngsters who are not statemented but who, because of
their School Action Plus or School Action status, have high needs. Many
times in Committee, we have commented on the difficulties that will be
encountered in keeping young people with high needs in education beyond
the age of 16. It is therefore important that the Bill ensures that
there is a proper assessment and appropriate support leading from that
assessment for young people beyond the age of 16. I hope that in
responding to these amendments and to amendment No. 160, the Minister
can reassure us about the way that this will be
handled.</div>

							<b class="B">Sir
Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): I am sympathetic
to the amendments. The Government are rightly seeking to encourage
local authorities not to rely too heavily on statements of special
educational need and to move increasingly towards School Action and
School Action Plus. Clearly that leaves open the risk that were the
provision to be specified only in terms of those with statements of
special educational need, those on the autistic spectrum and others
might lose out. I hope that if the Government cannot support the
amendment, my hon. Friend the Minister can at least reassure the
Committee that there will be other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column686" />Column number: 686</div>ways in which the needs of those in the relevant age group who do not
qualify for a statement of educational needs can none the less be
met.</div>
					<a name="08022677000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000413"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Under the clause as it stands, a local education
authority is under a duty to arrange for a learning difficulty
assessment for young people with a statement of special educational
needs during their last year of compulsory schooling. The duty also
covers statemented young people who stay on at school after the end of
compulsory schooling. The duty applies where the authority believes
that the person will leave school at the end of that year to receive
post-16 education or training.</div>
					<a name="08022677000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would extend the
duty to include young people who are being supported through School
Action and School Action Plus. Let me explain what these terms mean.
Under the SEN code of practice, if a child&#146;s needs are not
severe or complex enough to justify a statement, their special
educational needs are met at School Action or School Action Plus. At
School Action, the child&#146;s special educational needs are met
entirely out of the school&#146;s resources. At School Action Plus,
the child&#146;s needs will mainly be met out of the school&#146;s
own resources, but the school will also receive some outside help, for
example advice from the local authority&#146;s educational
psychologists.</div>
					<a name="08022677000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
though young people who receive support though School Action, or School
Action Plus are not covered by local authorities&#146; duty to
arrange an assessment, the local authority has the power to arrange
one. There will be many instances where it will be appropriate for
young people who have been supported by School Action or School Action
Plus to receive an assessment. Where a young person would clearly
benefit from an assessment, the local authority will be expected to
arrange one. This will be monitored through performance management
systems, and if it is clear that a local authority is not exercising
its power appropriately, it could be legally challenged. In line with
our expectation, we will confirm in statutory guidance that every young
person who would benefit from a learning difficulty assessment should
receive one.</div>
					<a name="08022677000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
true whether the young person has a statement of SEN or so forth and
falls into the group to which the duty to provide an assessment
applies, or whether they are supported through School Action or School
Action Plus and so fall into the group to which the power to provide an
assessment applies. We therefore expect young people with severe or
complex needs to receive an assessment whether they have a statement of
SEN or
not.</div>

perspicacious individual, would ask me.</div>
					<a name="08022677000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
believe it is the right course of action to compel local authorities to
arrange learning difficulty assessments for every young person
supported through School Action or School Action Plus. Special
educational 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column687" />Column number: 687</div>needs cover a wide span of difficulties; those needs may be specific to
the demands of a school environment, and be no longer directly relevant
when a young person moves into further education, training or higher
education.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000416"></a>Angela
Watkinson:
						</b> The Minister will acknowledge that there is an
inevitable link between the budgetary constraints on local authorities
and the provision of services for children with special needs. Sixteen
or 17-year-olds who are on the autistic disorder spectrum, who may face
moving on from their familiar school environment to a new, college
environment, may not respond well to change. They will need a lot of
support, but there may be cases where the local education authority
simply does not have the funding to give that support. Will additional
funding for local education authorities accompany the requirement, so
that they can fulfil their duties toward 16 and 17-year-olds with needs
of particular
support?</div>
					<a name="08022677000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000417"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> As the hon. Lady says, it is important that
vulnerable young people have the support they need, particularly those
on the autism spectrum, for whom that transition may be difficult. On
the question of resources, I cannot give her a specific answer in terms
of how much, but local authorities have delegated special educational
needs funds in some areas, so they would carry out assessments. We
believe that local authorities are and should be properly resourced to
do this. The fact that we are going to specify in guidance that they
must carry out an assessment, if it is appropriate on a case-by-case
basis, reflects how important we think it is that local authorities
find the resources
needed.</div>
					<a name="08022677000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not in
the best interests of a young person or a good use of an
authority&#146;s resources to compel the authority to arrange an
assessment when one is not necessary. Instead, the decision should be
made on a case-by-case basis, with the local authority making the
decision in partnership with the young person. In particular, the young
person&#146;s personal adviser from Connexions should hold the ring
of deciding, with the young person, their parents and their school,
whether an assessment is required and whether not to carry out the
assessment would be in contravention of the statutory guidance that we
will have issued to the local
authority.</div>
					<a name="08022677000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000418"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister is surely right to say that there may
be some youngsters who will not need support post-16. However, as the
amendment focuses on assessment, can he explain why, in his view, there
is no need to make the assessment itself, which could conclude that
support is not then required?</div>
					<a name="08022677000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000419"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Assessments are ongoing. There is the compulsory
assessment at the end of the compulsory schooling set out in the clause
and the extension beyond, so that there would be considerable
understanding of what needs there are on the part of the young person,
their parents, the school or other learning institution and the
Connexions personal adviser. Assessments continue to be carried out for
young people. The power is discretionary but it is a discretion that we
would expect to be exercised in favour of those who would benefit. Not
all may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column688" />Column number: 688</div>benefit, so it is right that, where an assessment is considered
unnecessary, a local authority will not be compelled to do
one.</div>
					<a name="08022677000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many ways I
do not think there is much difference between us. The hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has said we should proceed on a
case-by-case basis. There is considerable understanding of the needs of
the young people who are on School Action or School Action Plus; and,
as I have said, if a young person would benefit from an assessment we
will be saying to local authorities through the statutory guidance
route that they should carry one out. I do not think there is a
difference between us and I hope, on that basis, the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw his amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022677000420"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I remain unconvinced by the explanation of the
difference between the needs of a child who does qualify for a
statement of special educational needs and one who is subject to the
School Action and School Action Plus programmes. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Upminster said, given the current budgetary constraints on
many local authorities, there is a deep reluctance in some authorities
to award many statements. In the past, children who are now on School
Action or School Action Plus would probably have been issued with a
statement of special educational needs. The Minister says not all
children who are on School Action or School Action Plus would benefit
from assessment, but how do we know that unless an assessment is
carried out? I believe the amendment is important and I would like to
test the opinion of the Committee and press it to a
Division.</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) If a local
education authority in England maintains a statement of special

amendment deals with people who leave school unexpectedly, perhaps
after disappointing GCSE results, to pursue an alternative option, or
who carry on into the sixth form for a very short period before
leaving, having found out that it is not for them. Those people will
not have had the assessment that the clause  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column689" />Column number: 689</div>requires them to have had in the last year of education, as it is
assumed that they will be continuing with their education. The purpose
of the amendment, therefore, is to add a new subsection (2A) to
proposed new section 139A of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 providing
that an assessment should be arranged for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column690" />Column number: 690</div>them. That is an appropriate amendment to ensure that those children who
