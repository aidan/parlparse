<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000203"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> It is a great pleasure to have you back in the
Chair, Mr. Pope. You will see that we have made startling
progress since you were last here, but there are still important issues
to resolve before we complete the Committee stage, one of which is
raised by my
amendment.</div><a name="09070986000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to ensure that before the Secretary of State approves
Natural England&#146;s final proposals for the coastal access scheme
and lays them before Parliament, those proposals are subject to public
consultation. Consultation has arisen on numerous occasions in various
areas of the Bill. I anticipate that the Minister will argue that there
has been consultation, and that there will be extensive further
consultation. I note that on page 9 of the draft scheme guidance on
coastal access prepared by Natural England, there is a helpful flow
chart of the various processes of the designation of the path, which
includes a number of different consultations. I appreciate that, but
the consultation that I propose is for a particular
area.</div><a name="09070986000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be extensive further consultation with local authorities and key
individuals during the drawing up of coastal access reports, and we
support that. However, I wish to make a specific point on an area from
which public consultation seems to be conspicuously  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>absent, and I hope that, in the spirit of the conversations that we have
had on these sorts of concerns, the Minister will be able to reassure
me.</div><a name="09070986000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with public consultation on the coastal access outline
scheme, rather than on the coastal access reports, which will be
consulted on after the outline scheme is approved. The scheme will
outline how Natural England will approach the discharge of its coastal
access duty and will constitute the guiding principles for coastal
access reports. It is therefore extremely important that Natural
England gets it right, and that the concerns of all parties are taken
into account before the scheme is sent for approval by the Secretary of
State and then laid before Parliament, at which point there will be no
recourse to amend it. As the Bill stands, there will be consultation on
the outline scheme with &#147;such persons&#148; as Natural England
&#147;considers appropriate&#148;. That leaves the choice of who
gets consulted completely at the discretion of Natural England. How
will Natural England determine who is appropriate? Surely public
consultation would be preferable, so that all interested parties are
given an opportunity to contribute, rather than an elite few chosen by
Natural
England.</div><a name="09070986000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
Natural England has released the draft outline scheme, and the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has produced a draft
section 3A order indicating both how access will be implemented and the
changes that the Department proposes to the Countryside and Rights of
Way Act 2000, both those documents are subject to change, especially
the latter. So much is being left to the discretion of Natural England,
and we are putting huge faith in an unelected body. It is hard to know
what the final scheme will consist of, and the public must have a right
to be consulted, in addition to the consultation that was held prior to
the drafting of the Bill. The amendment seeks to ensure that all
members of the public are given equal access to the consultation on the
outline scheme before the scheme is approved. That means that the best
informed version will reach the Secretary of State and
Parliament.</div><a name="09070986000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070986000204"></a><b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): I support amendment 42
and would like to give a little more background to amendment 55, which
is in my name. On the basis of the case made by the hon. Member for
Newbury, I support the opportunity for extended public consultation on
any proposals. One issue that has not been covered in the debate so far
is that of the many visitor attraction businesses that exist on the
coastline. A lot of our attention has been placed on coastal access in
relation to members of the public engaged in shooting, or other
recreational activities. However, some businesses will be on either
side of the coastal footpath, and it is reasonable to ensure their
interests in maintaining their businesses. For example, some businesses
have a hotel on the headland, but also have exclusive rights to other
parts of the coastline right up to the high water mark, and sometimes
beyond. That needs to be recognised. In my constituency, there is a
local visitor attraction business, a historic house, which is
increasingly used for wedding ceremonies and other events, where it is
reasonable to expect a certain amount of privacy. That needs to be
taken into account when considering the proposals and should form part
of the
consultation.</div><a name="09070986000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
55 relates to clause 296. It would  add a requirement that
Natural England consult  appropriate representative bodies for
recreational users 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>and land management organisations and consider any
representations from them. The setting of the route on the coastal
margin will be done locally, and Natural England will have a duty to
consult landowners and occupiers and take their views into account.
Natural England is required to consult bodies with a relevant interest,
as we have already mentioned, such as access authorities, the
Environment Agency and local access forums, but it stops there. There
is currently no such requirement for Natural England to consult or
consider representations from user group bodies or the public. Natural
England does not have to consider any representations from members of
the public during the drafting of its reports. Some user groups, such
as the Ramblers Association, believe that that imbalance could lead to
user groups and the public effectively being frozen out of the duty of
fair balance, and thus lead to implementation which favours the
interests of others and not necessarily those other user
groups.</div><a name="09070986000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
debates in the House of Lords, cross-party support was shown for
greater involvement of user groups and the public in the drafting of
the reports. For example, on 21 April, Lord Taylor of Holbeach
stated:</div><a name="09070986000152"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;National
and local organisations will also be important. The briefings that
Peers on all sides have received from some of them show how useful they
can be in identifying the concerns of both potential users and those
who will be affected. To ignore them would be a big mistake. My third
amendment would ensure that they, too, are consulted properly during
the preparatory stages.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 21 April 2009; Vol. 709, c.
1441.]</div><a name="09070986000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
discussion of the Bill on Report, the noble Lord Judd
said:</div><a name="09070986000153"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be reassuring and helpful for these tremendously committed and
important people in our society if my noble friend could unequivocally
say at the Dispatch Box that the regulations will underline the
importance of such bodies being part of the list of people to be
consulted, not least on appeals. That is where the anxiety
exists.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1 June
2009; Vol. 711, c.
49.]</div><a name="09070986000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
same debate, the noble Baroness Hamwee said:</div>
<a name="09070986000154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
Lords, the amendment is about a fair balance. The imbalance is in the
consultation, as Natural England will have to consider representations
from persons with a relevant interest but not to consult bodies
representing user group and the public. That is why this is
particularly important. The imbalance is not corrected in the new
schedule&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1
June 2009; Vol. 711, c.
25.]</div><a name="09070986000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response, Ministers conceded that user groups would have their
representations passed on in full to the Secretary of State, and that
they would be notified by Natural England of reports, but critically
that they would not be included formally in the consultations. On
behalf of the Government, the noble Lord Hunt
said:</div><a name="09070986000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
listened to my noble friend Lord Judd with great care, and we will have
to consult in full on the persons it would be appropriate to include,
but we have in mind that they would include the Ramblers&#146;
Association, the Open Spaces Society, the British Mountaineering
Council, the Country Land &amp; Business Association and the National
Farmers&#146; Union, and we will listen to other suggestions with
great interest...I have already named several bodies that we
expect to include in the regulations, so that their representations
would go in full to the Secretary of State. They include such
organisations as the Country Land &amp; Business Association, the NFU,
the Ramblers&#146; Association and the Open Spaces
Society.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1 June
2009; Vol. 711, c.
51-52.]</div><a name="09070986000151"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">If
the duty of fair balance is to be achieved during the local
implementation of the coastal access duty, bodies representing user
groups and the public must be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>consulted on the content of coastal access reports. I certainly hope
that the Minister will offer reassurances that, although named
organisations beyond access forums and local authorities are not
detailed in the Bill, they will be involved formally in the
consultation. I also hope that there will be a requirement for Natural
England to take fully into account the representations that it receives
and that we receive some further reassurance that the interests of the
public, as expressed during the consultation, will be taken fully on
board because, as written, other than the response of the Minister in
the House of Lords, nothing in the Bill offers the reassurance that we
want.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann McKechin):</b>
Good morning, Mr. Pope. This is an important debate with
which to start our sitting because it is key to making sure that as
many people as possible can take part in the process of devising
schemes and subsequent local reports as we extend coastal access
throughout England.</div>
<a name="09070986000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make it clear at the beginning that we fully intend that Natural
England will consult as widely as possible on both the draft scheme,
which was referred to in amendment 42, and the subsequent reports that
are mentioned by the hon. Member for St. Ives in amendment 55. However,
public consultation and how we define groups to be consulted is a bit
more tricky. I hope to put on the record this morning assurances of the
nature of the consultation that we expect to take place, which I hope
will satisfy hon. Members.</div>
<a name="09070986000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 42
deals with the duty on Natural England under clause 292 to set out in a
scheme to be approved by the Secretary of State the general approach it
will take in implementing the coastal access duty. We have already made
copies of the draft scheme available&#151;the hon. Member for Newbury
referred to it this morning. I hope that that has added to the
understanding of what is intended in the
process.</div><a name="09070986000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070986000205"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I do not expect an
answer on this now, but if these consultations take place across the
country, will there be budgetary implications for Natural England? Is
it sufficiently resourced to manage those consultations or shall we see
a massive expansion in the number of people employed by the
organisation?</div><a name="09070986000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000206"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we have
taken the cost of consultation into account and we do not envisage a
significant increase. I will come on to why we believe that to be the
case.</div>
<a name="09070986000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Newbury correctly pointed out, the scheme has to be approved
by the Secretary of State and then laid before Parliament. That
procedure is recommended by Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee. The input from Members of this House and from the other
place will provide Natural England with an opportunity to take into
account any suggestions about the scheme. If necessary, the scheme can
then be revised from time to time, subject to further approval by the
Secretary of State and it being laid before Parliament.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div><a name="09070986000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
already requires Natural England to consult such persons as it
considers appropriate before it prepares or revises a scheme. Natural
England has developed its draft scheme in consultation with key
organisations and I am confident that it will wish to continue those
consultations as it develops the scheme. I do not believe that
amendment 42, which would require Natural England to put the proposed
scheme out to public consultation, is necessary. As I have said,
Natural England will want to consult as widely as possible, and given
that the scheme or any revision has to be approved by the Secretary of
State, it will want to do that in advance of submitting the scheme to
the Secretary of State. In approving the scheme, the Secretary of State
will take into account the extent and coverage of the consultation
process.</div>
<a name="09070986000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now turn to
amendment 55, which also deals with consultation. Clause 296 amends
part 4 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to
require Natural England to consult with various relevant bodies before
drawing up a report in addition to the persons already included in
section 51(4) of the 1949 Act. It is not necessary to extend the list
of organisations that must be consulted in clause 296 proposed section
55D(6) in the way that amendment 55<b class="B"> </b>would do. The process for
consultation in clause 55D was drawn up to reflect what is already in
section 51 of the 1949 Act and it places sufficient requirements on
Natural England to consult appropriately. Natural England&#146;s
scheme, which was published in December 2008, and which we
have made available already builds in such a draft
report stage.</div>
<a name="09070986000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful if I set out in greater detail the process by which Natural
England will advertise its intention to start work on a particular
stretch of coast and how, once it is drawn up, a draft report will be
advertised so that people may be made aware of the proposals. Local
authorities will be best placed to know of local interests and, where
local authorities are willing to participate, Natural England will
enter into agreements to enable the local authority to carry out
preliminary work to facilitate the preparation of a coastal access
report. We have amended the Bill in the other place to clarify that
point.</div>
<a name="09070986000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a new
stretch is starting to be considered and an agreement with the local
authority has been reached, the local authority will identify and
contact all the relevant local stakeholders and interest groups to
inform them. The authority may also at this stage be asked to issue a
media release to ensure wider awareness. The authority will start to
identify all relevant landowners and other relevant interests in
affected land to start the phase described at paragraph 3.3 in Natural
England&#146;s draft scheme as &#147;Walking the course&#148;.
The authority will visit the land that might be affected and will
discuss the options for the route with those who own and manage it. The
comments made by the hon. Member for St. Ives about a hotel that might
have functions near the coastline on certain days of the week wanting
to ensure privacy is a good example of what we would
expect.</div><a name="09070986000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the draft report, Natural England envisages the local authority
managing the consultation process. In each case, Natural England will
agree a consultation plan with the local authority that will
incorporate all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>reasonable actions to ensure that so far as practicable those who may
have an interest are made aware of the consultation. The contacts made
during the initial &#147;Walking the course&#148; phase will
provide information that will be used to inform individuals at
subsequent stages of the process about their opportunity to comment on
the draft report, their right to make representations and, if
appropriate, object.</div>
<a name="09070986000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every bit of
coast is different. There are many different interests and they vary.
The whole process gets the preliminary survey done so that we truly
know who needs to be consulted and who needs to be aware in any
particular area. In terms of wider awareness, it is expected that the
local authority will issue a media release at the beginning of the
consultation period and write to local stakeholders and interest groups
who will have been identified at earlier stages. Natural England has
already said that it will publish its draft proposals on the internet
and invite all relevant interests to comment on them. It will allow a
period of 12 weeks for people to view the proposals and submit comments
on the report. Copies of the report will be provided in alternative
formats where this is required by particular consultees, but the aim
will be to minimise the number of printed copies, particularly at the
draft report stage, for environmental and cost
reasons.</div><a name="09070986000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
view of the details that I have outlined, it is clear that the
consultation will be extensive and comprehensive.</div>

George:</b> Certainly, the points that the Minister is making
are reassuring to many of the organisations that might be concerned
about not being consulted. However, can she expand a little more and
give further reassurance to those organisations that find or believe
that they are not able for one reason or another to engage in the
consultation process, or feel that they are being excluded? What
mechanism will there be for a local organisation or individuals with an
interest in a route to contest circumstances when they feel that their
voice is not being heard in the consultation
process?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000208"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, because
someone might not take part in the initial consultation process. There
was a parking scheme in my area in which no one took part until the
scheme came out and then they said, &#147;No, we don&#146;t like
it.&#148; That happens and is sometimes in the nature of public
consultations. That is why we say that after the report is drawn up,
when it comes out, everyone can make representations, including
specific bodies as set out in the regulations. It is in Natural
England&#146;s interest to consult such bodies before drawing up the
report, and to ensure that it takes account of the representations made
when it publishes the
report.</div><a name="09070986000042"></a>

find people to consult? If we just throw it out there and say,
&#147;Here is the consultation, here is the deadline,&#148; but no
one knows about it or only half the people who might be interested
respond to it, there is a danger that we could end up having to go back
and consult people again. Will Natural England go out and till the soil
to find people?</div>
<a name="09070986000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000210"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> As I said, there will be a preliminary phase
called &#147;Walking the course&#148;, which in most cases will be
undertaken by local authorities that want to take 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>part and join in partnership with Natural England in the process. That
is the first, important phase. In the second phase, a media release
will be put out, so a public notice will be sent out as well as use
made of the internet, which is increasingly the medium of choice. There
is a two-part process. &#147;Walking the course&#148; is the most
important part, because making such a detailed study in advance, on a
case-by-case basis, is a better way of ensuring that as many people who
are likely to be affected as possible are physically contacted. Local
authorities, particularly, have very good local
knowledge.</div><a name="09070986000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000211"></a>Andrew
George:</b> The main area of potential concern is inevitably
where there is dispute between the interests of landowners, or other
interest groups, and those who may take a different view or access
bodies such as the Ramblers Association. We can envisage that those
interests may conflict, although not always. On most occasions such
issues will be resolved, but in a dispute about access to the coastline
will it be incumbent on Natural England to make clear how it responded
to the issues raised?</div>
<a name="09070986000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000212"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman raises an important
point. I can assure him that there is a duty of fair balance on Natural
England in the Bill. Yes, at times it will have to make difficult
decisions, but it is specifically stated that it must strike a fair
balance.</div>
<a name="09070986000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000213"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> May I intervene, because I would like to help?
Because it has to take decisions, Natural England will upset one side
or another. We do not live in a perfect world where there will be an
equal balance; sometimes the interests of landowners who have to derive
a living off their farms will have to take precedence over the rights
of ramblers, so the Minister cannot have a perfect world. I am saying
that to support her.</div>
<a name="09070986000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000214"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman. Natural
England will have to make decisions from time to time that will not
please everyone. That is why we have said that it has a duty to strike
a fair balance when making a decision, which also needs to be timely so
that people have certainty and know where they will be moving from. I
hope that, on the basis of the reassurances that I have given the
Committee, the hon. Member for Newbury will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="09070986000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000215"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I do not want to put words into the mouth of the
hon. Member for St. Ives, but I think, coming at the same point
independently, we were both seeking to tie Natural England to a
commitment. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne is
concerned about consultation overload; we want consultation that works.
Under a previous regime, my local authority had a habit of consulting
when it knew what it wanted to achieve. It threw out a consultation
that nobody knew about and came down on the side of the decision that
it had already taken.</div>
<a name="09070986000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000216"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point.
Further to the point that his hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne
raised, I can confirm that local authorities will undertake most of the
work, and be enabled to support Natural England. Natural England 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>will in turn fund time-limited posts in local authorities so there will
be no new burden on them. It will be time limited. If local authorities
want to take part, they will know in advance when the consultation will
expire and when they will be expected to have done the
job.</div><a name="09070986000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000217"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> That is helpful. It is much better to have a
quality consultation that everybody can access, that more people know
about and that uses a range of methods to inform people. Through the
Land Registry and other data sources, such as council tax records, it
is perfectly obvious who property owners are. It is less easy to get
access to key interest groups. While I believe that Natural England has
made a good start with this document, which shows a clear approach that
can be made to work in most areas to the satisfaction of most people,
this is a 10-year aspiration, plan or project. We do not know what the
organisation will be like in the future and whether those operating in
certain areas will be as assiduous. The amendment was an attempt to get
more of a duty in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09070986000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000218"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> May I reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is
a review process? The first review will occur three years after the Act
comes into force. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Yes, three to
five
years.</div>
<a name="09070986000178"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000219"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Again, that helps me in deciding what to do with
the amendment.</div>
<a name="09070986000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">In developing
this part of the Bill, many people have come to us&#151;frankly, very
late in the day&#151;saying that they have property or business
interests, or many other sorts of interests, in parts of coastal
Britain and are suddenly concerned about how the legislation will
affect their lives. That is human nature, as the Minister said. We
cannot expect people just to know, as we do in this bubble in which we
live and breathe, about the minutiae of this legislation. They are
getting on with their lives, and they believe that they will be able to
gain access.</div>
<a name="09070986000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
Minister&#146;s assurances, and an understanding that the principles
laid out in the proposed scheme and the attitude adopted by Natural
England will continue throughout the process, as we prioritise
different parts of the access provisions&#151;work on the more
contentious areas might come later&#151;it is in everyone&#146;s
interest to have the quick wins that will satisfy the demands of
tourism. Local landowners, for example, want a coastal path that will
bring people to their bed-and-breakfast accommodation and so on. The
more contentious issues may be dealt with in two, three, four or five
years&#146; time, and we want to ensure that interested parties are
consulted. However, the Minister has given us enough reassurance for me
to withdraw the amendment at the appropriate
moment.</div>
<a name="09070986000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000220"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I concur with the hon. Gentleman. The Minister
offered a number of reassurances, which are now on the record. They
point to a requirement for local authorities and Natural England to
agree a consultation plan.</div>
<a name="09070986000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
to what extent words have been put into my mouth, regarding the
suggestion that I want to create an environment that would result in
consultation overload. I fully accept what the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>Broxbourne said; although Natural England needs to demonstrate that it
is trying to balance the arguments fairly in disputes on access to the
coastline, its ultimate decision will doubtless lead to disappointment
on one side or the other. I was seeking clarity on whether the process
would be transparent, and that if there were disputes, Natural England
would make clear the basis of its decisions, explaining how it had
weighed the arguments. I agree with the hon. Member for Newbury. It has
been a good debate, and it has reassured us both. I hope that we have
reassured those organisations that raised concerns about the
availability of wider consultation than appears to be offered under the
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000222"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> It is good to be under your
stewardship today, Mr. Pope. We had storms as a backdrop to
our last sitting. Today, the skies are clear&#151;just the day for
walking the coast rather than sitting here. However, we have an
important job to do.</div>
<a name="09070986000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
defines the English coast for the purposes of this part of the Bill. It
refers to the</div>
<a name="09070986000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;coast of
England adjacent to the
sea&#148;.</div><a name="09070986000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
includes the coast of any island, except for excluded islands. Islands
that are not excluded&#151;those islands considered part of the
English coast&#151;are those that are accessible on foot. It must be
possible to walk to the island across the foreshore, or by means of a
bridge, a tunnel or a causeway, either from the mainland of England or
from another accessible island. It also includes islands that are
accessible on foot only at certain times, such as at low
tide.</div>
<a name="09070986000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an island
is not accessible on foot, and is therefore excluded, the Secretary of
State may choose to specify by order that it is included in the
definition of the English coast, provided that they are satisfied that
the coast of the island is long enough to offer an adequate walk-in
route. We will consider whether there are any islands that are not
accessible on foot that should be included.</div>
<a name="09070986000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case for
including the Isle of Wight has been made in the other place. That is
our largest free-standing island which, by and large, possesses the
same characteristics as a large part of the English coast and its
hinterland. The Isle of Wight is also a unitary authority in its own
right. The coastal path spans the whole of the island and includes 67
miles of well-maintained paths, and the island can be reached by
regular ferry services. In our view, that puts the island into a
specific category compared 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>with other &#147;inaccessible&#148; islands, and we will take steps
to issue an order to include the Isle of Wight under clause 294(2)(b).

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000225"></a>Andrew
George:</b> The amendment would clarify the relationship of
the coastal path with available ferry services. In estuaries where a
ferry service exists, but does not run all year round or is limited and
operates only on certain days or during certain hours, there are
concerns that it might not provide continuity or connectivity with the
coastal path.</div>
<a name="09070986000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several user
groups have concerns regarding the use of ferries in the discharge of
the access duty as set out in clause 290(7). The use of seasonal
ferries or those with a limited running period as part of the coastal
pathway will lead to disruptions and gaps in the continuous route. That
was confirmed during debates in the House of Lords when Lord Hunt of
Kings Heath said
that</div><a name="09070986000157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
would not be impossible for a summer ferry service to be used as part
of a coastal access route. It is an amenity and enables people to cross
the estuary. If the service is not available during the winter, clearly
the pathway will have to stop at the ferry
point.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 30 March
2009; Vol. 709, c.
930.]</div><a name="09070986000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
result of that and other comments, the use of ferries as a means of
maintaining continuity in estuaries was raised on Second Reading. The
amendment would allow Natural England the flexibility to look at
whether an alternative route could be put in place for use by the
public during periods in which the ferries did not operate. Where that
is practical, it would alleviate the problem. There are a large number
of examples where an intermittent ferry service might provide the
coastal link in an estuarine situation&#151;the Fleetwood to Knott
End-on-Sea route in the Lancashire coastal area is one. On the
south-west coastal path, the ferry across the river Torridge from
Appledore to Instow saves 12 km of walking, but operates only in
summer. There is also only a limited ferry service from St. Mawes to
Place creek in the parish of St. Anthony on the Roseland peninsula, and
from Exmouth to Starcross in south Devon. The primary purpose of this
aspect of the Bill is to maintain a continuous path  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>around the coast. Where the link is essentially provided by an
intermittent ferry service, Natural England should look for an
alternative continuous route which is all-year-round and more
accessible. There should be a duty on Natural England to identify a
continuous path. I hope that the Minister will take into account the
concerns raised in debates in the House of
Lords.</div><a name="09070986000076"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000226"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am concerned that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment would limit the most important quality of the proposal for a
coastal access path&#151; simplicity and clear understanding. There
may be many ways to deal with continuance of the path in the off-season
when a ferry no longer operates. I would hate the Bill to go down the
route of making a complex timed requirement to open up certain other
areas. I have in mind the Cromarty firth, off the Moray firth, where
there is a narrow neck of water with a summer ferry, so people have
good access at that time. If, when it is closed, we create a
requirement to open up what I think is called the
Invergordon&#151;</div><a name="09070986000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000227"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The Bill does not affect coastal routes in
Scotland.</div><a name="09070986000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000228"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am well aware of that, but that is the area I
have in mind, which is similar to many others. It would open a vast
inland area that includes a busy working port. It is an example in my
head. I know it is in Scotland but it may well apply in England, where
a six-month alternative route would cause great complications. I
understand where the hon. Member for St. Ives is coming from and look
forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</div>
<a name="09070986000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment
relates to the list on page 191 of the Bill. Proposed new section 55C
(4) gives four reasons why a route may be diverted, and they
are</div>
<a name="09070986000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;flooding, the
action of the tide, coastal erosion or encroachment by the

seek to add &#147;future coastal developments&#148;. There is
concern that once the coastal path has been designated on undeveloped
land, any future developments will have to take into consideration the
route of that path. There may be times when the route should be allowed
to continue where it is, but there may be other opportunities in which
the chance of development&#151;jobs, securing the legitimate business
interests of landowners or businesses based in that area&#151;would
be threatened because of the path running through the
property.</div><a name="09070986000179"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

coastal developments, in particular those that need to be on the

due to the presence of an existing coastal path. Diversions should
automatically be made around such sites once planning permission has
been granted. We shall go on to talk about planning and the
relationship of the coastal path to planning legislation under later
amendments, but I am respectfully suggesting to the Minister that in
most circumstances, the path should be subordinate to legitimate
development of businesses such as the ones I have listed in coastal
areas. Not to include that in the clause would be of potential harm to
many legitimate coastal businesses, which may well support the proposal
but feel threatened 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>by the fact that future developments will be made very difficult by what
is effectively a new charge on the land around their
property.</div><a name="09070986000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000229"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me first set the backdrop for the two
amendments. Clause 296, to which they refer, inserts new provisions for
coastal access into the National Parks and Access to the Countryside
Act 1949, which sets out the provisions for the designation of
long-distance routes. The clause also inserts new sections after
section 55 of the 1949 Act, including proposed new section 55C, which
provides for Natural England&#146;s report, which we have just
discussed, to identify in addition to the &#147;ordinary
route&#148; an &#147;alternative route&#148;, which
may</div><a name="09070986000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;operate
as a diversion from the ordinary
route...during ...specified...periods&#148;</div><a name="09070986000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
when</div><a name="09070986000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;access
to the ordinary route...is
excluded&#148;</div><a name="09070986000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
restricted&#151;for example, for land management purposes. The
provision also enables the alternative route to operate flexibly, for
example during the nesting seasons of particular species or breeds of
birds, which might vary from year to year, not only from season to
season.</div><a name="09070986000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to amendment 54, I understand its intent. I take the point of my hon.
Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland: Wales is not directly
included in the provisions, but as a north Gower mudflat boy I am aware
that estuarine environments are some of the trickiest environments,
both for walking and access and for habitat and species. The amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for St. Ives would mean that an alternative
route could operate as a permanent alternative route&#151;it would be
a stand-by route. That ordinary route could include a ferry with a
period of non-operation&#151;I take the point made by the hon. Member
for Newbury, that at a certain time of year, or on a certain date, the
ferry stops operating. Some ferries might have well scheduled
operations, but others might decide when the season has come to an end
early, &#147;We&#146;ll stop now.&#148; However, what about
advising people that there is now an alternative route, bearing in mind
what I said about the trickiness of estuarine
environments?</div><a name="09070986000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000230"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Is it not the case in reality that if there is an
alternative route, there is a dual route? It would be almost impossible
to inform and educate people as to when the route shuts and opens. If
there is a ferry route, people can use the ferry; but in reality, if
the map shows that there is a dual route, they will use that, if they
do not fancy getting on a ferry and paying &#163;5.50 or
whatever.</div><a name="09070986000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000231"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. As a keen walker myself, as I am
sure other members of the Committee are, when I set out in the winter,
not least if I am going into a more challenging environment, whether
upland moors or around estuaries and so on, or when I suspect that
there may be some disconnection in the route along the way, either
because of seasonal variations or because of flooding aspects and so
on, I tend to ensure that I plan the route. I take that into account
and think, &#147;Well, there may not be a ferry running, but there
may be alternatives&#148;&#151;a bus alternative and so
on.</div><a name="09070986000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I want to explain to the hon. Member for St. Ives that the flexibility
already in the Bill allows Natural England not only to consult but to
bring forward 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>the appropriate route up the estuary to the first point of crossing.
Alternatively, should there be the option for a permanent route, it
will identify that permanent route. It will identify, mark and chart
that route, and that will become the permanent route
regardless.</div>
<a name="09070986000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000232"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I fully accept the Minister&#146;s point and the
intervention of the hon. Member for Broxbourne. But as I understand it,
regulations that entitle local authorities to designate permissive
footpaths still exist. That is certainly the case in my part of the
world, where the designation of permissive footpaths continues. Those
who seek access to the countryside for recreational and other purposes
often find themselves falling foul of permissive footpath regulations
or being uncertain when those regulations
apply.</div><a name="09070986000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000233"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right: permissive
path regulations are still available. For example, in a particular
estuarine environment, realistically, following consultation and
recognising the difficulties of that environment, Natural England may
recommend going to that first crossing or ferry point and no further,
and that will be as far as it can regularise the route. Then, the local
authority and landowners, in the way that they currently handle their
local access discussions, might well decide to put in place an
alternative route and signpost that&#151;they might even link it to a
bus route or something, in the way that many already do, particularly
where there are popular walking areas throughout the year.</div>
<a name="09070986000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
expect Natural England to stop the route before the first public
crossing point or at an earlier ferry that does not run all year round,
unless there are particular difficulties with taking the route further
upstream to the first public crossing. If Natural England, after proper
consultation with landowners, ramblers and everyone else, sees that
there is a route that it can put round an estuary, I suspect that it
will do that. But if it thinks that the route can go so far and no
further&#151;that is, to the first crossing point&#151;it is not
for us to say that we see an alternative route, which may go way
inland, up and down and in and out. But if Natural England is able to
identify that permanent route, it will do so. Therefore, there is no
need for the amendment. It would apply to alternative routes as much as
to the main route. We consider that we have the balance of the
legislation right, as it applies to estuarine environments. The extra
flexibility that I have described will be of much help. In view of
that, I urge the hon. Member for St. Ives to withdraw his amendment. I
understand the motivation behind it, but I do not think that it is
necessary.</div><a name="09070986000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 47, the hon. Member for Newbury mentioned his worry about
potential harm. Again, I understand his intent, but the current
provision from Natural England&#146;s report will
include</div><a name="09070986000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
alternative route which is to operate as an optional alternative to the
ordinary route, or
part,&#148;</div><a name="09070986000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">where
the ordinary route
may</div><a name="09070986000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reasonably
be regarded as unsuitable for

particular circumstances, including flooding, action of the tide and
coastal erosion. That will ensure that safety and continuity of the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div><a name="09070986000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 47
would mean that the alternative route may operate as an optional
alternative during periods when the route may reasonably be considered
unsuitable for use because of future coastal developments. There is a
moot issue here: when we talk about future coastal developments, are we
talking about developments within the next one, two, five or possibly
10 years, or perhaps even developments on a wish list 20 years down the
line?</div>
<a name="09070986000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment goes too far, but there is provision. I
want to make it clear that coastal access will not be a barrier to
development. The CROW right of access is flexible to allow for changes
in land use. There are a number of different ways in which we can
ensure that coastal access is appropriate and consistent with the needs
of landowners, including any future changes in land use. The line of
the route and the spreading room are not fixed permanently. The 1949
Act, as amended by the Bill, will enable Natural England to review them
and to propose changes to the Secretary of State, subject again to a
full consultation and representation process at a later date. This is
not&#151;nor should it be&#151;a once-and-for-all measure to stymie
future development. The legislation can take account of changes in use
and future developments, including unforeseeable
developments.</div><a name="09070986000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
a route be blocked as a result of development resulting in the land
becoming excepted land, and therefore excepted from the right of
access, Natural England could review the route and draw up a report
proposing a variation. I hope that hon. Members accept that the
existing powers are adequate to ensure that future development is
catered for. In addition, the CROW Act provides for access to be
restricted or excluded by direction in certain circumstances. Anyone
with an interest in land can apply to Natural England for a restriction
or exclusion on a number of grounds, such as land management, which
includes the management of land as part of a
business.</div><a name="09070986000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a land manager were to apply for a restriction or exclusion, Natural
England would first discuss the situation with the landowner to
establish whether less restrictive measures could be effective, such as
advisory notices. However, if the restriction or exclusion is
necessary, Natural England will make a direction restricting or
excluding the CROW right of access. The Bill and the CROW legislation
therefore contain provisions to deal with the sort of eventuality to
which the hon. Member for St. Ives referred. With those clear
assurances, I hope that he will feel comfortable about withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="09070986000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000234"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response; it
is very important to probe these issues. In response to the question
about stopping intermittent or limited ferry routes, he said that
alternative routes can be explored flexibly in consultation.
Organisations such as the Ramblers Association will be seeking
reassurance, where possible&#151;I accept his point that safe,
accessible routes will not always be identified, especially in
estuarine situations&#151;on the establishment of such
routes.</div><a name="09070986000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have discussed the problem of permissive routes and possible
uncertainty. I have some concerns about whether regulations allowing
local authorities to designate permissive routes are being applied
appropriately, although that is another debating point. Permissive
routes&#151;in other words, intermittently available
routes&#151;already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>exist in other settings, irrespective of whether they apply as a
consequence of a resolution to the issue before us. I accept the
Minister&#146;s comments, provided that the consultation allows for
the exploration of a
solution.</div><a name="09070986000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000235"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> It might help to mention another enhanced
capacity in the legislation and underpinning regulation: the ability to
explore, where appropriate, access and egress routes from the coastal
path. Again, that would be done through consultation with Natural
England and engagement with local access forums and local authorities.
At points of disruption along the coastal path, particularly within
estuarine environments&#151;this relates not just to permissive
routes&#151;there might well be scope to have a dialogue with local
landowners and to say, &#147;The route stops here.&#148; I suspect
that, in most cases, access or egress routes will already exist.
However, such constructive dialogue could ensure that a walker can
literally end a route with access to a road or bus stop. Local
authorities could sign post bus transport or other links during the
winter. The legislation provides for such flexibility, and it would be
good to see local authorities engaging in that sort of
approach.</div><a name="09070986000180"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000236"></a>Andrew
George:</b> Once again, the Minister has reassured me still
further by intervening, and I am grateful to  him for that
response. In passing, I will comment on amendment 47, which was tabled
by the hon. Member for Newbury. Although I understand the principle and
sentiment behind it, my concern, which the Minister articulated in his
response, is that it refers to future coastal developments without any
consideration as to whether they are required to be on the coast, such
as port developments, or whether they are simply the kind of
developments that those responsible would find desirable to develop on
the coastline, such as a nice house with a coastal view, in which case
it is not essential that it should obliterate the coastal path. It is
important to put future coastal developments in some kind of hierarchy.
That is essential, because it is impossible to develop port access, for
example, or the other developments that I have described, unless they
are clearly on the coast&#151;it cannot be done any other way. Having
listened to what the Minister said on amendment 54, I am
content.</div><a name="09070986000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000237"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I thought that amendment 47 would be an elegant
addition to that proposal, because it sits comfortably with the issues
relating to erosion. I refer again to Natural England&#146;s draft
scheme, which I think gives good indications on how a path would be
moved if that became necessary as a result of geomorphological change
or erosion. I will not press the amendment, if the Minister can assure
me that he will talk to organisations such as the British Marine
Federation and perhaps fishing organisations, which have been
relatively silent on potential problems surrounding the development of
key areas, because the path could enter constrained environments around
small fishing communities that might need to develop in order to
survive.</div>
<a name="09070986000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
work-based businesses, in particular, in mind when thinking about that,
so I can address the point made by the hon. Member for St. Ives. We
could argue about the legitimate right of a landowner to apply for
planning permission to build or extend a house. Landowners 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>have rights that should be not subjugated by local planning authorities
saying, &#147;Well, you cannot do that because the coastal access
path goes there.&#148; I am much more concerned about businesses
being unable to develop as they might need to over the next 10 years in
order for hard-pressed industries, such as the fishing industry, and
legitimate coastal businesses, such as marinas, to survive. If the
Minister can assure me that either he or his officials will be
available to discuss that with organisations such as the BMF, we will
be able to make
progress.</div><a name="09070986000105"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000238"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I can indeed assure the hon. Gentleman
that we have already, in the Bill&#146;s long fruition, engaged
systematically and repeatedly with all those organisations and others,
and we will continue to do so. I also give the assurance that Natural
England will also be involved in that engagement, both nationally and
locally, when those proposals for the coastal path are brought forward.
It is vital to recognise in respect of amendment 47 that future coastal
development that is critical and to which there is no alternative must
be factored in significantly, whether it affects ports, marinas or
other things. However, a fuzzier wish list of areas for possible future
development on an array of alternative sites should also be factored
into the discussions on the routing of the coastal path. As the hon.
Member for St. Ives has said, there are some things that are imminent
and right in front of us and to which there are clearly no
alternatives, and there are others that we do not want to see as a
necessary impediment to the development of the coastal path. I can give
him those assurances.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000239"></a>Mr.

that they must not see the coastal path as an inalienable charge on the
land that they cannot be flexible about in terms of planning
applications. With those assurances, I am sure that the hon. Member for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000243"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> These are technical amendments to ensure that
the power in the Bill to propose the route beyond the tidal range of a
river on an estuary can work effectively. Clause 295 sets out how the
coastal access duty applies where the coast is interrupted by a river,
allowing Natural England to treat the relevant upstream waters of a
river as though they were the sea. It is necessary because the coastal
access duty in clause 290 applies to the English coast, which is
defined in  clause 294 as being the coast of England
adjacent  to the sea.</div>
<a name="09070986000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) says that where the coast is interrupted by a river, the coastal
route may be extended as far upstream as the first public foot
crossing. However, in order to allow access to the route, the land that
it covers must be accessible to the public as coastal margin, which we
intend to define for the rest of the coast through an order under
section 3A as land adjacent to the foreshore. In situations where the
first public foot crossing of a river is upstream of the tidal range of
that river, there will be no foreshore, so the land cannot become
coastal
margin.</div><a name="09070986000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
60 and 61 remedy that by treating land at the brink of any non-tidal
waters as part of the foreshore for the purposes of the definition of
coastal land in section 3 of the CROW Act, where waters of a river are
treated as part of the sea under clause 295. We feel that in such
circumstances, the main issue is continuity of the route. It is
important that Natural England has the ability to propose the route
beyond the tidal range of the river where it has taken the decision to
define the sea as extending up as far as the first public crossing
point. We are concerned with the route itself only beyond the tidal
range of the river and do not intend that access will be permitted to
the margin of land beside the route on that part of the river. To
achieve that, the order under section 3A of CROW will create another
category of excepted land to remove from the right of access the land
beside the route on those stretches of
it.</div><a name="09070986000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
59 provides that where waters of a non-tidal river are treated under
section 295 as being part of the sea, and the line of the route passes
over land that is coastal land by virtue of section 3A(11) of CROW,
it  is not possible to use the powers in section 55D(2)(a) or
(b). Those are the powers enabling Natural England to draw the boundary
of the margin or an alternative route strip to coincide with a physical
feature. We have taken the view that since the main aim of the
amendments is to ensure the continuity of the route, it would not be
appropriate to have the power to widen the route strip to coincide with
a physical feature in those
circumstances.</div><a name="09070986000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, the power provides for the land beside a non-tidal river to be
designated as coastal margin so the route can pass up the estuary to
the first crossing point or to a point between the mouth and the first
crossing point. However, it does not enable the route strip to be
widened to coincide with a physical feature. In order to be consistent
with the aim of continuity of the route, we intend to provide that the
land beside the route strip on a non-tidal river is excepted
land.</div><a name="09070986000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
the amendments, we believe that Natural England would not be able to
fulfil the coastal access duty on estuaries and continuity of the route
would not be possible. I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000244"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The Minister referred to these as technical
amendments, but they are more fundamental than that, because they
redefine what is meant by the term &#147;coast&#148;. My future
amendments will seek to portray, as have my previous amendments, that
different circumstances exist in many of our estuary environments in
relation to the meaning of the term &#147;coast&#148;.</div>
<a name="09070986000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Government
amendment 59, if the boundary does not coincide with a physical
feature, how will it be defined? Does that mean that there will be no
spreading room on the landward side? We need an explanation, because
the issue is fundamentally important. What constitutes a physical
feature?</div><a name="09070986000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Government amendments 60 and 61, we tabled a number of amendments that
were not selected for discussion, but they reflected the concerns of
many people and organisations that, by including estuaries in the
coastal access provisions, the Government may be going a step too far
by extending the duty beyond the Bill&#146;s original purpose, which
is to improve access to  the English
coastline.</div><a name="09070986000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
inland along estuaries will impose a route that is not necessarily in
the interests of those who wish to follow the coastal path, and that
will draw more businesses, private dwellings and, more importantly,
conservation areas into the scheme. We are forgetting about the vast
majority of people who want to walk in coastal areas. Such people do
not necessarily want to walk the length and breadth of a coastal
region, circumnavigate the whole coastline, or walk along the entire
south-west coast. The majority of such people want to access a point on
the coast by public transport or by car and walk a section of beautiful
coastline before perhaps cutting inland on a right of way to take a
circular route, or they may want to wander back along the same route.
Those are the people that we should be concerned about, and I sometimes
wonder whether our discussions are losing touch with that
fact.</div><a name="09070986000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
estuaries have considerable environmental, developmental and
geographical constraints. The Coastal Access Forum consists of
important organisations, and I will list them for the record: the
Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, the British Marine
Federation, the British Association of Leisure Parks, the British
Association for Shooting and Conservation, the British Holiday and Home
Parks Association, the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers, the
Country Land and Business Association, the Historic Houses Association,
the National Farmers Union, the Tourism Alliance and the Visitor
Attractions
Forum.</div><a name="09070986000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
organisations recognise that estuaries can present different problems
for access provision compared with the coast, and point out that
estuaries are often highly developed with commercial or residential
property, and may be subject to environmental constraints. Most
importantly, the organisations make the valid point that consideration
should be given to the presence of existing public rights of way, the
practicality of establishing a route and the impact of any associated
coastal margin when estuaries are being looked at for coastal
access.</div><a name="09070986000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather
than attempting to redefine estuaries as coast, it would surely be
simpler for the Government to acknowledge that the creation of margin
and route along estuaries is fraught with difficulty, and that it
should not be added to the Bill. Some of the maps towards the end of
Natural England&#146;s excellent draft 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>scheme show how complicated life becomes when one moves beyond what is
more frequently termed the tidal barrier. The Severn estuary, which is
of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne, involves the
communities of Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon and Bristol on one side and
parts of Cardiff, Newport and Chepstow on the other. All along the
estuary are a large number of interests, be they residential or
commercial. We have to be extremely careful how we progress this
argument.</div><a name="09070986000181"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): In order
that there be no doubt about the matter, this part of the Bill does not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000246"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I was once again plucking an example from the air.
Perhaps, to satisfy the hon. Gentleman, I can use the Southend-on-Sea
estuary, which includes Canvey Island, Tilbury and, on the other side,
Sheerness and all the developments around the Medway. He was right to
pull me up on this, but half of the estuary to which I referred was
English coast. The redefinition of estuaries as coast for the purposes
of this Bill does not change the simple fact that estuaries are not
coast.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000247"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The hon. Member for Newbury raises legitimate
concerns about the complexity as we go further up rivers and estuaries.
That is why the Bill gives Natural England flexibility to propose the
establishment of routes up the estuaries. We realise that estuaries can
be small, medium and large. They are very different. Each has its own
unique circumstances. Natural England can decide not to run the long
distance route up the estuary and down the other side if the
difficulties of taking the route around the estuary outweigh the
benefits.</div><a name="09070986000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand that there are challenges. The ability to include estuaries
is bound by a strict set of criteria set out in clause 291. Natural
England must have regard
to:</div><a name="09070986000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
the safety and convenience of those using the English coastal
route,</div>
<a name="09070986000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) the
desirability of that route adhering to the periphery of the coast and
providing views of the sea,
and</div><a name="09070986000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
the desirability of ensuring that so far as reasonably practicable
interruptions to that route are kept to a
minimum.&#148;</div><a name="09070986000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Natural
England must additionally have regard to the matters set out in clause
295(4):</div><a name="09070986000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
the nature of the land which would...become part of the

the recreational benefit to the public of the coastal access duty being

<a name="09070986000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">(e) the
extent to which the land bordering those waters would, if it were
coastal margin, be excepted
land;</div><a name="09070986000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">(f)
whether it is desirable to continue the English coastal route to a
particular physical
feature</div><a name="09070986000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">(g)
the existence of a ferry
&#148;.</div><a name="09070986000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
list is not exclusive. It must be remembered that at all times<i class="I">
</i>when discharging the coastal access duty, Natural England must also
aim to strike a fair balance between the interests of the public in
having rights to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>access and the interests, including the economic interests, of owners
and occupiers. That has to be a fair balance of those
interests.</div><a name="09070986000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000248"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Where the route deviates from the coast up an
estuary and perhaps beyond the estuary up the river, was I right in
thinking that it would not necessarily follow the river bank and that
alternative routes may be
found?</div><a name="09070986000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000249"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> There would be flexibility. We are trying to
make sure that we do not end up with a prescriptive path, which will
end up with further difficulties for users. We have made it quite clear
that we do not think that this will cover all estuaries. It would be an
excessive use of powers. We want Natural England to use its discretion,
but to use it fairly and reasonably and practically.</div>
<a name="09070986000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Newbury asked about the phrase &#147;physical
feature&#148;. Section 55D(2), which clause 296 would insert in the
1949 Act, enables the coastal margin to be expanded to a physical
feature beyond the normal definition of coastal land. A physical
feature might be a fence, a group of rocks, cliffs or a landmark. I
think that a physical feature is easily defined; I think that it is
obvious to the eye what a physical feature is.</div>
<a name="09070986000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the boundary, we simply mean that the route strip will not be able
to be expanded to meet a physical feature. It will just be a route
strip of a specifically defined width. There will be no access to a
margin of land to the landward side of the route strip; there will just
be access to the route strip itself.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000250"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I want to get this matter absolutely clear. So, we
are talking about a different level of designation here, are we? Any
extension of the route that entered the estuary area of a river would
not have spreading room. Strictly speaking, it would be a 4 m path with
no rights of access to either side of that
path.</div>
<a name="09070986000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000251"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I am waiting for inspiration on that issue,
because the hon. Gentleman has raised an important point about
clarification and I am keen to ensure that I address
it.</div>
<a name="09070986000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000252"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> May I assist the Minister, while she seeks
inspiration, by raising another point? In our debate on clause 295, she
quoted the list in the clause
about:</div><a name="09070986000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(b)
the topography of the shoreline adjacent to those
waters;</div><a name="09070986000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
the width of the river upstream to that
limit;&#148;</div><a name="09070986000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so on. However, that list did not include the legitimate rights of
businesses nor the rights of property-owners. Perhaps she could give us
some assurance that those factors are recognised there
too?</div>
<a name="09070986000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000253"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> May I just reiterate for the record that I
actually mentioned that taking account of economic interests would be
integral to Natural England making a decision on the fair balance when
it looks at the economic interests of landowners in terms of
clause 291? So I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that
economic interests will be taken into account.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div><a name="09070986000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
understand that the estuary, after the tidal limit, will be just a
route strip&#151;that is it. It is simply a route strip, which will
be a narrow path.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000254"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am confused about where in the amendment it says
that. It is important to get this point in the Bill. There will be a
great many people concerned at this proposed change to the Bill and I
want the Minister to reassure them, because the Government are now
talking about an entirely different proposal. That different proposal
would exclude all concept of spreading room, there would only be a 4 m
path and there can be no extension from that.</div>
<a name="09070986000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
Minister&#146;s other point, that the commercial interests of people
in estuaries will be considered by Natural England, we need that in the
Bill. That point does not appear to be listed in the Bill. Perhaps the
Minister can clarify where that point enters into our
understanding.</div>
<a name="09070986000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000255"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I point out that clause 295(4)(g) states that
there must be a balance struck between the interests of the public and
the interests of owners and occupiers. &#147;Interests&#148; would
obviously be economic
interests.</div><a name="09070986000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000256"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I apologise to the Minister, but clause 295(4)(g)
is
about:</div><a name="09070986000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
existence of a ferry&#148;.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div><a name="09070986000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000257"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> My apologies. I just want to clarify that, when
we talk about the &#147;interests of owners and occupiers&#148;,
which is mentioned throughout the Bill at other points, we mean their
&#147;economic interests&#148; as well as other factors that may
apply. That point has been made in our debates on other clauses in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09070986000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if
the hon. Gentleman is still concerned about this particular definition
of a physical feature, I would be prepared to withdraw these amendments
at this stage, so that we can seek further clarification that will
hopefully be of assistance to him.</div>
<a name="09070986000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000258"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am really grateful to the Minister. That is a
very reasonable and thoughtful way of proceeding. I can assure her that
I will work very closely to try to achieve that, because I think that
that might be a way forward
here.</div><a name="09070986000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070986000259"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09070986000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
