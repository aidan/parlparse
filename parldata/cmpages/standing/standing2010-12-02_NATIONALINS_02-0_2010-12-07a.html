                           </span> I
welcome you to the Chair, Mr Brady, on a brisk and frosty morning, and
that is just in the Committee room. We had a useful evidence session,
which is an interesting innovation to the Committee stage that I have
not previously been used to in years gone by. Clearly, having had the
benefit of the wisdom of the witnesses, the detail of  the
clauses now makes much more
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000015">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clauses
1 and 2 set out the principal changes to the rates of national
insurance, and that will have a big impact on all our constituents,
whether employees or employers. Clause 1 relates to the primary
contributions to class 1 of national insurance, which largely affects
employees. On Second Reading, the Opposition accepted the need for
those changes. The previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), announced the
measures and the current Government are introducing the legislation on
them. It was my right hon. Friend’s choice to tailor the then
Government’s approach to the deficit reduction not only to
include gradual and temperate changes to public expenditure, rather
than the harsh and speedy cuts to public services that the current
Chancellor has chosen, but to reflect the need for the tax system to
bear a measure of the strain as well, hence the changes that have come
forward. I could not let the clause pass without acknowledging that we
accept that that is necessary. Such a measure will never be welcomed
with open arms by taxpayers up and down the country, but it is
necessary given the wider fiscal and economic climate.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000016">&#160;</a>

was not a Member during the previous Parliament, so I was not able to
question my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West about
the changes to national insurance that he was introducing. This is my
only opportunity to ask those questions, given that the Minister is
presenting the Bill. As I understand it, the national insurance fund
represents all the revenues from the national insurance system, which
was set up after the second world war as part of the Beveridge report,
and it was designed to support the universal insurance system for the
British people.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000017">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I correct the hon. Gentleman’s
history? National insurance was set up in 1911 by my political hero
Lloyd
George.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              <span class="hs_CLMember">Chris
Leslie:<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000322">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> I am corrected on that fact. Perhaps a function of
the national insurance fund changed after the second world war, but the
hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point that echoes the issue that I
was about to raise. As I understand it, the income from the national
insurance fund comprises the contributions from employees, employers
and the self-employed, plus interest on its own investments. Each year,
those amounts are paid into those funds. As I understand it, there is
currently a surplus on the fund—in other words, more money is
being paid into the national insurance fund than is being paid out of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister update the Committee on the current state of the national
insurance fund? Over the years, various Government Actuary predictions
have suggested that the fund is growing in surplus at an exponential
rate, but I am not sure whether the recent credit crunch and recession
changed that profile of expectations. Is the Minister able to set out
how the fund stands? I think that is relevant, because my understanding
is that the surplus on the fund is loaned to the Government—to
the Debt Management Office, which includes the Commissioners for the
Reduction of the National Debt—and interest on those invested
moneys is paid back to the national insurance fund, which is quite a
substantial amount of money in itself. The previous Administration had
what was colloquially known as the golden rule; any borrowed moneys,
including a surplus from the national insurance fund, were not to be
used to finance current expenditure but were only to be used for
investment, in particular capital investment such as
infrastructure.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My second
question to the Minister, if he can bear with me and give us a general
update on the national insurance fund, is to ask him what the
Government’s policy is on the use of the surplus. Given that
much of the background to the debate on the changes to national
insurance in clauses 1 and 2 has been a discussion about deficit
reduction, it might be expected that it could count as part of current
expenditure. As I understand it, however, the rules and conventions of
the Treasury mean that that is not the case.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If we are
embarking on legislation that changes national insurance rates and
brings in revenue, yet there are constraints on how that revenue can be
used, it is important that we know about them. If it is a continuation
of the previous Administration’s policy that that money is for

1 amends sections 8(2) and 9(2) of the Social Security Contributions

increases the class 1 secondary rate, which is the employer

previous Government so I am not entirely surprised that he supports
them. Indeed, as we learn more about the Opposition’s policy and
their belief that in the balance between spending cuts and tax rises
more should be raised from taxation than they had planned at the time

potential disadvantages. As a whole, this Government believe that the
previous Government got the balance wrong, in terms not only on the
ratio of spending cuts to tax increases but on the increases in taxes
on labour that that represents. Although it is not part of the Bill, we
will raise the thresholds through a regulatory order. That will mean
that much of the increase on labour will not occur, which is consistent
with the 2010 Conservative manifesto
pledge.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000028">&#160;</a>

I have said, this is not a particularly controversial element of the
Bill, but I will try to answer the questions raised by the hon. Member
for Nottingham East on the national insurance fund. He is right to say
that there is a projected surplus for the national insurance fund,
which is currently projected to be £50 billion for 2010-11. That
surplus, however, will change as a result of policies announced in the
emergency Budget, including the triple-lock pensions guarantee and the
reduction in the secondary threshold. It is important that we do not
make decisions on the national insurance fund by looking just at the
balance as of today; it is important that we are prudent. Pensions will
be paid from the fund, so we need to look at projections over the
longer
term.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also asks whether we are using the national insurance
fund surplus to fund other Government commitments and what our position
is on that. The national insurance fund is run on a
pay-as- you-go basis, with current income paying for current
expenditure. Although national insurance contributions fund
contributory benefits, they also come within the wider fiscal
framework. It would be imprudent to use the surplus in one year to
increase benefits without regard to the long term. Obviously, we cannot
have benefits going up and down according to short-term conditions and
how much money is coming into the national insurance fund. We have a
surplus, but it is

                           </div>sensible to use that to reduce the deficit in the short term, which
clearly is to the long-term benefit of the UK’s public
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is the crux of my inquiry. In general terms,
people have used the shorthand that the surplus, national insurance
changes and the derived income are used to reduce the deficit. My point
was that if there are constraints on the use of the surplus, surely
that does not offset the general current expenditure fund. Those moneys
are specifically earmarked for capital investment. If the Minister is
not able to walk us through the line-by-line detail of Government
accounting practice, perhaps he could simply confirm that Government
policy remains as it has always been, with the surplus being used
solely for capital
investment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000031">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Nothing in what we are doing is a change to the
usual practice on the national insurance fund, but for reasons that all
Governments have recognised, the amount of money going out of the fund
and the amount of money going into the fund do not match on a
year-by-year basis. Having a surplus does not give us the opportunity
to increase spending in a particular area, and I do not think that the
hon. Gentleman is suggesting that it does. Without walking him through
the details of Government accounting, there is no change to the
approach that all Governments have followed—I suspect, since
1911, although I cannot entirely confirm
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000032">&#160;</a>

to the national insurance fund has not changed and that, essentially,
the rules and the way in which the fund is accounted for remain as they
did under the previous Administration. Many people are sceptical and
think that national insurance is simply another form of income tax by a
different name. It is, therefore, important to reiterate that there are
certain constraints and rules related to the amounts of national
insurance paid by employers and by
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000033">&#160;</a>

want to press the Minister on whether there is a shortfall between the
rhetoric that his party—and indeed the Liberal
Democrats—enunciated before the general election, and the
reality of the changes that are now being made. Although the Bill
simply talks about the rise in employer and class 4 national insurance
contributions, the suite of policies that both parties in the coalition
Government were pursuing implied that they would stop the rise for
employers. The coalition agreement talked
about<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000037">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are not
simply looking back at what the parties in the Government said before
the general election, when a lot of their campaigning against what they
called “the jobs tax” and how it had to be reversed
created an assumption among the general public that any proposed
changes to employer national insurance contributions would be reversed
and not enacted. That was, by and large, the expectation that came from
the general election campaign. I concede that the small print of the
Conservative manifesto noted that the 1% would be counteracted with a
change in the thresholds, which, no doubt, the Minister will refer to.
However, it was not necessarily highlighted that the threshold change
would only counteract around two thirds of the amount involved. As I
understand it, the yield from the changes to employer national
insurance contributions is roughly £4.5 billion in 2011-12, yet
the expenditure by increasing the threshold in 2011-12 comes to only
£3.1 billion. That gives a £1.3 billion shortfall, which
may be welcomed by many employers, but it may fall short of their
expectations given what they heard during the general election
campaign, and what they read subsequently in the coalition
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Accuracy for
the general public is exceptionally important, and there was an
understanding that the policy would be reversed, rather than simply
chipped away at. I wonder whether the Minister can explain how, in the
coalition agreement, the words on page 25 came to describe it as
a<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000040">&#160;</a>

Liberal Democrats themselves promised that they would reverse the
change to employer national insurance contributions. I am not sure
whether that was simply for employers; it may even have been for
employees as well, but it was certainly in the Liberal Democrat
manifesto. In recent days, we have become used to Liberal Democrats
explaining that, “Well, what was in our manifesto doesn’t
actually stand; it was superseded by the coalition
agreement”—as though year zero suddenly came into being.

public particularly remember what the Liberal Democrats said before the
general election, when they were skipping around the country trying to
hoover up votes with any number of promises on a whole series of
different fronts. The Conservatives had clearly learned lessons from
previous electoral defeats and inserted a set of subsections and small
print into their pledges all along, although the tabloid press did not
necessarily pick up on them. On 30 March, <em>The</em>

Government who are implementing a tax change in exactly the way that
the larger party in the coalition Government said it would do in its
manifesto. I note the point that setting these things out in a
manifesto is seen as being the small print, but conventionally that is
seen as something quite significant. To be fair, the electorate and,
specifically, employers understood what we were doing. There was
certainly no attempt on our part to conceal what we were

the most vulnerable in difficult economic conditions, we focused on
raising thresholds and raising the personal allowance. It will mean
that anyone earning £35,000 or less will not be affected by the
national insurance contribution increases. It will mean that employers
find that the damaging effects of the increase that was proposed are
mitigated very substantially and, as I said, it is exactly consistent

                           </strong> We have looked at the best way to stop the damaging
tax on jobs, and the most effective way of doing that is by raising the
thresholds in exactly the way that we are proposing. In clause 2, we
are increasing the lower profits limit and the income tax personal
allowance, and in clause 1, we are increasing the national insurance
threshold and, indeed, the income tax personal allowance. That stops
the most damaging elements and it will reverse them. Given the
difficulties we face with the public finances, and given the
constraints that we have inherited, that is a wise use of limited
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000050">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the end, what would have been damaging to jobs provoked hundreds of
business leaders to write in support of our policy. Tony Blair wrote in
his memoirs that when 35 leading chief executives said that they would
support our policy, that was the moment when he thought that the new
Labour Government were finished, particularly as there was no response
from any business leaders in support of Labour’s tax
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
measure demonstrates our commitment, despite the ruinous state of the
public finances that we inherited, to ensure that the damaging jobs tax
proposed by the previous Government will be substantially reversed in a
way that is entirely consistent with the pledges that my party made in
advance of the general election. We are pleased to be able to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000052">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to address a couple of points of fact that were raised by the hon.
Member for Nottingham East. The regulations that will increase the
thresholds will be laid in late January, which is the same as would
have happened under previous Governments. That will coincide with the
laying of the Department for Work and Pensions benefits uprating
regulations and the Government Actuary’s report on the changes.
The primary threshold is increasing to £139 a week in April
2011. The secondary threshold—in other words, the
employers’ threshold—is increasing to £136 a week.
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the indexations, which were
announced in a ministerial statement last week, will be increased by
RPI. I will save him getting out his calculator, because the answer is
yes.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000053">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is a good soul, who tries his best to
do a diligent job for the nation and its finances, but it must be noted
that those of us in opposition who want to articulate our critique of
Ministers sometimes struggle to find the right language. I know that
the description of arguments that may or may not be misleading, for
example, can sometimes get us into the realms of unparliamentary
language. I would never accuse the Minister of that, but there are some
in the coalition, to whom he may have implicitly alluded when he said
that the main Opposition party, as was, had set out the proposals out
in the small print of its manifesto. Perhaps the Liberal Democrats were
not quite as specific, but that is a second-order
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000055">&#160;</a>

shorthand and a lazy, sloppy bit of drafting, which was deliberately
designed to give the outside world the impression that the change in
national insurance would be reversed in its entirety. The Minister may
baulk at that as a minor issue, but he has acknowledged that it might
have been better to use the phrase “substantially
reversed”. The £1.3 billion shortfall may be short change
to some in the Treasury, but it is a significant amount of money. Some
employers may have expected it in return, but it did not come back as a
result of the rhetoric used by the parties in the

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
8 is short and simple, but it may require some explanation. Clause 3
refers to the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and the
percentage rates that form part of the health service allocation. The
Bill seeks to change the additional primary percentage rate and the
additional class 4 percentage rate from 100% to 50%. The additional
rate in both cases is being increased from 1% to 2%. The
Government’s intention is that the same quantum of money raised
by the original 1% additional rate should continue to go to
the health service allocation, but that the revenue from the additional
1% should go not to that allocation but to the general national
insurance
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause and the amendment are crucial in many ways. The clause reminds
us that expenditure for the national health service, which is cherished
by many of our constituents throughout the country, is at the front and
centre of people’s minds during general elections and beyond,
because they want to protect NHS investment. The clause and the
amendment give us the opportunity to discuss the sums of money
allocated to the NHS. The NHS benefited considerably from the 13 years
of Labour Administration when increases in its resources grew at a rate
never before seen. We have seen great improvements in the quality of
care.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000064">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It was absolutely necessary that the expenditure
increased at that rate during that period. Is it not the fact that
health service expenditure when we came into office in 1997 was so
appallingly low that  we had to do something about
it?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000065">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed, that is absolutely the fact. My hon.
Friend will remember that in 2003, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer
felt it necessary to go even further and boost NHS investment above and
beyond that which normally resulted from spending review processes. The
introduction of the additional 1% of national insurance came with
hypothecation—something that the Treasury traditionally resists,
but it acquiesced in that case; the money it raised was earmarked for
the health service allocation. That is certainly something of which I
am very proud.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000066">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to note that the Bill seeks for all the additional revenue
from all that extra 1% to go generally to the national insurance fund.
We have heard this morning that the fund is already in healthy surplus
and that it cannot be used for current expenditure, but that it could
perhaps be loaned back to the Debt Management Office and, in turn, be
used to fund certain capital expenditure or infrastructure
expenditure.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth noting that in the spending review the Chancellor and the
Health Secretary did a bit of double counting on the changes to the
national health service budget, because, as hon. Members may recall,
over the four-year period the definition of NHS health care has
changed. Whereas the Conservative party manifesto and the coalition
agreement promised that the NHS would grow “in real
terms” year on year, in reality that is not the case. The
Government are counting £950 million on average over those four
years, but that money is actually for social care and social services,
and would otherwise have been line-itemed in a different part of the
nation’s account—local government social care
expenditure. By changing the classification with a stealthy accountancy
trick, they are somehow able to claim that there is a real-terms rise
in the NHS budget of 0.4%. But on the traditional basis, looking beyond
the spin, the NHS will receive a 0.54% real-terms
cut.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000068">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed, Mr Brady. I appreciate your reining me in
slightly, but it is important that we note that the 0.54% equates to a
£500 million shortfall. That figure is important, because, in
essence, it is the amount represented by my
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

rise in national insurance—essentially moving from a 50% take to
a 90% take—so that the £500 million shortfall in the
Government’s promise of a real-terms increase would have to be
delivered to the NHS allocation through the national insurance change.

that we are debating today is the proportion of those additional rates
of national insurance that ought to be allocated to the health service
allocation. It is important that we reflect on those amounts, and I am
attempting to press the Minister on that point. My calculation is that,
roughly speaking, there is a £500 million shortfall in what
would be needed for the Government to keep their promise of a
real-terms increase in the NHS health care budget. That is based on the
traditional definitions, had they not made that slight double-counting

                           </strong> That is indeed true. The Government have already
allocated some of that money to specific items of expenditure. We may
come to that point later. The amounts we are talking about are needed
by  the national health service for several reasons. First, the
drugs budget in the NHS is considerable and traditionally has more
inflation than most other areas of the economy. Medical technologies
are changing apace and they too require significant investment. Our
ageing population means that a real-terms increase in the national
health service budget is needed and it is something that the general
public expect and have voted for historically. Again, they may have
felt that they were voting for the parties now in government under the
illusion that they would be getting a real-terms increase, but detailed
exploration of what is happening to the national insurance revenues and
other NHS allocations shows that the Government are falling short of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000078">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes; it would be useful for the Treasury to embark
on a fresh wave of public information about national insurance more
generally because there is a lot of confusion among members of the
public about where their money goes. For a start many do not recognise
that there is a pay-as-you-go element. They sometimes feel that the
money is paid into a fund, invested for the long term and then called
upon at a later date, which  is not the case. There is an
understanding that there is some NHS amount in that, which is,
essentially, the point of our debate today. The amendment would ensure
that 90% of that additional revenue was allocated to the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000080">&#160;</a>

being protected,
stating:<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000084">&#160;</a>

Royal College of Nursing points out that there are 27,000 potential
redundancies and that posts are being removed across the national
health service. In my constituency the ambulance service is very
worried about the shortfall from the real-terms increase that is
implicitly promised by the Bill and the other package of measures that
the Government have put together. The service may have to reduce the
number of ambulance staff from 3,000 to 2,600. Those are significant
cuts. Dr Peter Carter has

real-terms increase, which is why the figure 90 needs to be substituted

it is important that we look at things specifically in terms of the

                           </strong> I thank Opposition Members for tabling the
amendment. It may help if I provide some history to put it in context.
Hon. Members know that during the 2003-04 tax year there was a 1%
increase in national insurance contributions, and the introduction of a
new national insurance contributions liability—the additional
rates—on earnings above the upper earnings limit and upper
profits limit. The allocation of the additional rates is the subject of
the amendment. In 2003, the whole of the increase was earmarked for
improvements to the NHS, and the legislation reflected that policy with
the whole of the additional rate being allocated to the NHS, as well as
the 1% increase in the main rates of national insurance contributions
on earnings below the upper earnings and upper profits
limits.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Following the
election, the coalition Government confirmed in our programme document
that we would increase the rates of national insurance contributions by
1%, but that we would reverse the most significant impacts of those
rises through increases in the employees’ and employers’
thresholds. The Government and, as far as I am aware, the previous
Labour Administration when announcing the increases in the pre-Budget
reports of 2008 and 2009, did not at any stage announce that the 1%
increases are specifically for the NHS. The Government have said that
they will increase NHS spending in real terms in each year of the
Parliament. We can afford to do so without additional funding from the
national insurance contributions increases as proposed by the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
emergency Budget on 22 June, the Chancellor announced that from April
next year we will re-link the basic state pension to earnings.
Pensioners will also be protected by the triple lock, which will
guarantee each and every year a rise in the basic state pension in line
with earnings, prices or a 2.5% increase, whichever is

			Column number: 63<a class="bkMark" name="Column63">&#160;</a>
                           </div>greater. I know that this is a point that we debated earlier, but
although the national insurance fund is currently in surplus, the
commitment makes it sensible for the whole of the 1% increase to be
channelled into the national insurance fund rather than the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000094">&#160;</a>

I may, I shall address one or two points that arose in the lengthy
debate we have just had. The hon. Member for Luton South made a point
about the impact of the national insurance contributions rise. Due to
the increases in thresholds that reverse much of the effect of that,
that will indeed reduce the burden on the NHS. I am grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to that point. It will enable us
to fund new cancer drugs by up to £200 million per
year.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000095">&#160;</a>

really address the issue of the double-counting of the social care
element, because that is absolutely the  crux of why we needed
to table the amendment in  the first place. He ought to have
confirmed that had we

                           </div>been following the previous classification of NHS health care
expenditure, that equates to a 0.54% real-terms cut in the NHS
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would also
have been grateful if the Minister had confirmed my calculations that
in order to bridge that gap, and return to the 0.4% real-terms increase
that the Government claim to be pursuing, would have equated to roughly
£500 million. That was the purpose of the amendment. Clearly,
the Government seek just to rebut it, and to deny that they are
reducing the health care budget in real terms, but the evidence is
actually there, not just from the comments that I have made, but from
the real-life experience of health service users and health service
staff who report daily the squeeze that they are feeling on the NHS
allocation. We will clearly need to return to the issue on

want to look in more detail at the specific amounts of money. The
Minister has not been able to detail the rationale for the change in
the accounting for social care, so we need to burrow deeper into it.
The clause is a central component of the Bill and I am not content with
the Minister’s simple claim that all is fine and dandy, and that
real-terms increases are happening. That is not what people are
experiencing, nor is it what we see in the reports when we look at the
real accounting
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000105">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I support my hon. Friend’s point.
Real-terms increases are absolutely necessary to the health service to
retain and support the level of service, not only because, with an
ageing population, there are more demands on the health service, more
techniques in medical treatment and more drugs on the market, but
because labour intensity in the health service cannot be reduced.
Therefore, to ensure pay and pay increases that are comparable to the
rest of the world, we have to have above-inflation increases in health
service spending to keep pace with necessary
pay.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000106">&#160;</a>

it will, I hope, be of value. If the Minister’s prediction that
400,000 employers and 800,000 employees will seek benefit from it over
the next three years materialises, we will certainly welcome it. We
hope that areas such as mine in north Wales will benefit from the
scheme and that if new businesses come forward, are sustained and
survive, it will provide them with a great deal of help.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000126">&#160;</a>

politicising the initial discussion, we face some big challenges over
the next three years. We face a £1 billion cut in my area in
Wales to the National Assembly for Wales’ budget. We face major
cuts in public spending across the board—in local
councils, in capital spending, on education—that will cause
tremendous pressures on existing employment both in the public and, if
I may say so, in the private sector, which will face the knock-on
effects of public spending cuts in areas such as capital expenditure,
construction and Building Schools for the
Future.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000127">&#160;</a>

steps that the Minister can take to help alleviate the great pain that

Office for Budget Responsibility’s growth forecasts have been
downgraded in the past six months from 2.6 to 2.1%, so we
need to face the real pressures that are ahead. We can debate, and we
have debated, the different political approaches of the Opposition and
the Government on public spending, but if the scheme helps, it would be
a positive thing, and I welcome it. I hope that is taken in the spirit
of conciliation in which  I put it
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000129">&#160;</a>

we disagree, and where the amendments go to the heart of that
disagreement, is in relation to how that cake, which the Minister has
determined to help support new businesses, is distributed. He has
confirmed in the Bill, in the evidence sessions and on Second Reading
that some £1 billion will be spent on the scheme over the next
three years. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow ably questioned
the Minister in the evidence session about whether we use those
projections, whether they will be met and the basis on which they have
been put forward. We can debate that, but if the Minister’s
scheme does what it says on the tin, and if it achieves the objectives
that he and his officials have set out, we are expecting some
£940 million to be spent in benefit of the scheme, with an
administration cost to the Government and businesses on
top.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000130">&#160;</a>

amendments go to the heart of how that £1 billion is
spent. Given that we are cutting back regional development agencies,
and given that we are cutting back on public spending in general, let
me put all that to one side for a moment, and let us not argue about
those issues. They are important issues, and they affect the economy,
but let us put them to one side. Let us look only at the opportunity
that the Minister has to invest £1 billion of taxpayers’
money, from the whole of the United Kingdom, into areas that help
generate new employment. Let us look at what the Minister’s
choices have been with that £1 billion, and whether they meet
areas of need, of deprivation, of high unemployment, and of high impact
of public spending cuts—one of the Minister’s
objectives—and whether it is, in the spirit of equity and
fairness as well as economic necessity, best spent in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000131">&#160;</a>

do not want to stray into later amendments, Mr Brady, but,
because it is in the context of today’s debates, I will suggest
later on that we set a budget for the expenditure over the three-year
period of whatever that will be—if it is £1 billion, we
set it. I will suggest that the Minister

we accept the Bill as it is drafted, large swathes of the United
Kingdom will receive its benefit. My area in north Wales, the area of
my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East, and the areas of the
hon. Members for Cleethorpes, for Burnley, for Hexham and for Central
Devon will all be able to access that resource to help support new
businesses for that three-year period. They will be able to have that
benefit of £5,000 per employer, which might encourage
businesses, which might help alleviate the public spending cuts and
which might have an impact in those areas. Yet the areas of my hon.
Friends the Members for Walthamstow, for Lewisham East, for Luton
North, for Luton South and for West Ham, those of the hon. Member for
Watford, the Minister himself, and the hon. Member for West Suffolk,
who is not in the room, but is on the Committee, will not be able to
access that resource. Is that fair and equitable? If we are going to
spend that resource, is that its best use in order to tackle the issues
that we
face?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000133">&#160;</a>

1 addresses the total exclusion of London, the south-east and the
eastern region, and seeks to ensure that those areas are included in
the scheme. If we accept the Bill as drafted, those regions will not be
able to access the benefit at all; the £940 million will be
spread over the rest of the United Kingdom. The Minister could have
determined that the same budget would be available for the whole of the
United Kingdom—and he could still do that if he accepts later
amendments—which might mean that there would be a shorter time
scale for that budget to be spent, or that there would be fewer
businesses to secure the budget. He need not, however, increase the
amount of the budget; he can simply spread it across those three
regions as well.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000134">&#160;</a>

London to begin with; of the top 12 most deprived local authorities, as
outlined in the economic deprivation index, no fewer than seven such
authorities are in London—I will return to my hon. Friends the
Members for Luton North and for Luton South in a moment because those
areas are also important, but I want to focus on London for now. The
scheme will not apply to the boroughs of Hackney, Newham—the
borough of my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham—Tower Hamlets,
Islington, Barking and Dagenham, Haringey or Lambeth. By any stretch of
the imagination, those boroughs are seven of the most economically
deprived in the country.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000135">&#160;</a>

nature of the business that we are in. The hon. Gentleman
knows  that part of the objective is to look at the issue. I do
not agree that that scheme would be ineffective. I have  said,
openly and honestly—this is a big thing for an Opposition Member
to say to the Minister—that it is a positive scheme, which may
be helpful. If it helps the 400,000 businesses, and if it
helps 800,000 employees to get into and sustain employment, it will be
a good scheme. Time will tell, however, and later we will debate
amendments that will give us an opportunity to assess the effectiveness
of the scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I criticise
not the objective of the scheme but its application, which is unfair
because it means that London, the south-east and the east will not
benefit. On Second Reading, the Minister said—he has said this
in other formats, and he may even have said this in notes to the Bill
that I have seen in the past—that the reason behind the policy
is that<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister

spending cuts hits, it will hit areas—my area, and those of
other members of the

			Column number: 69<a class="bkMark" name="Column69">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Committee—outside those three regions harder than it will hit
London, the south-east and the east, but the information does not stack
up. In many ways I would love it to do so—if that were the
Minister’s honest intention, and his belief—but I do not
think that the facts bear that out. The constituencies of Oxford East,
of Luton North, of Lewisham East, of Canterbury, of Southampton, Test,
of Eltham, of West Ham, of North Thanet, of Hackney North and Stoke
Newington, of Tooting, of Islington North, of Dulwich and West Norwood
and of Brighton, Kemptown will all miss out on the scheme, but they are
in the top 10% for levels of public sector employment in the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If I look at
the list of public sector employment by constituency across the whole
of the United Kingdom, no fewer than 23 of the top 100 constituencies
for public sector employment—my maths tells me that that is
23%—are in London and the south-east. Not only the
constituencies that I have mentioned, but those of Worthing West, of
Leyton and Wanstead, of Hastings and Rye, of Portsmouth South, of
Lewisham, Deptford, of Maidstone and the Weald, of Greenwich and
Woolwich, of South Cambridgeshire, of Cambridge and of Winchester are
all in the top 100 for the highest levels of public sector
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the
Minister’s logic, nearly one quarter of the constituencies that
are in the top 100 for dependence on public sector employment will not
benefit from the scheme, which he is establishing because he is
concerned about the impact of public spending cuts on public sector
employment. It is not only my hon. Friends who represent those
constituencies but, as he knows, Members from other parties as well.
That may be why some of  his colleagues have also expressed
concern about the implications of the policy for those
regions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Leaving aside
the arguments from public sector employment, and from local authority
deprivation, if we look strictly at unemployment and how it is spread
across the country the Minister knows that the employment rates of the
regions that are excluded are much more challenging than those of the
regions that are included. Unemployment rates from the International
Labour Organisation show that across the United Kingdom no area has a
higher unemployment rate than London, at 9%. We face a situation where
the Government are bringing forward a scheme to help new businesses,
but the area with the highest unemployment rate in the country is not
included in that scheme. The jobseeker’s allowance claimant rate
from the Office for National Statistics shows us that unemployment in
London is higher than it is in the south-west, in the constituency of
the hon. Member for Central Devon; it is higher than it is in my area,
Wales, where it is 3.6%; and it is higher than it is in Scotland, in
the east midlands and in the north-west. Indeed, it is above the UK
average of 4%. The unemployment rate in the constituency of my hon.
Friend the Member for West Ham is 6.8%. In Tottenham it is 7.7%. In
Camberwell and Peckham it is 6%.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000149">&#160;</a>

the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham, which
currently has an unemployment rate of 6.8%. What is the logic of trying
to start new businesses across the whole of the north when, for
example, Tatton has an unemployment rate of 2.1%? Richmond in
Yorkshire, the seat of the Foreign Secretary has an unemployment rate
of 1.8%. Unemployment in Derbyshire Dales, the seat of the Government
Chief Whip, is 1.6%.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000150">&#160;</a>

people in work in Walthamstow, Lewisham, West Ham and Luton will pay
taxes to put money into the Treasury coffers to transfer wealth to
support new businesses in Tatton, Richmond and Derbyshire Dales. I have
no problem with the people in those three constituencies, but if the
Minister wants to focus this issue on a scheme I welcome, I remind him,
he needs to focus it in a way that impacts on the areas of highest
deprivation and highest unemployment as well as those who will benefit

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is right. Let me remind the
Minister what I am arguing for initially. I argue in amendment 1 that
London, the south-east and the east region should be included in the
scheme. I am simply asking him to make the scheme a national scheme and
to make it fair so that all those constituencies like Walthamstow can
access it. If that means that the scheme runs for two years instead of
three, so be it. If that means that the scheme runs for three years but
is capped at £940 million and when that money is gone, it is
gone, so be it. I have not tabled amendments to reduce the length of
time of the scheme, but I could have done. I might even do so on
Report, depending on what the Minister says.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am not
asking the Minister to spend more money. He has estimated that it would
cost around £660 million if it were extended on the current
level for those areas. That may be the case. The Minister could retain
the existing amount of resource for the scheme and spread it over a
thinner base to encourage new businesses in those areas. There is no
logic for him, based on deprivation, on unemployment or on the concerns
of public sector employment, to exclude three regions which have a
higher level of public sector employment, a higher level of deprivation
and a higher level of
unemployment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000154">&#160;</a>

North, Luton South, Lewisham East and Walthamstow, the constituencies
of my hon. Friends who are in Committee today. The hon. Member for
Watford has a current unemployment rate of 3.6%. His constituency will
not benefit from this national insurance holiday and yet the
constituency of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has an
unemployment rate of 2.1%, will. Is that a fair and equitable way to
distribute the scheme today?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000155">&#160;</a>

Exchequer, who will benefit from the scheme in Tatton. I have nothing
against the good burghers of Tatton, but, if we are trying to encourage
businesses, it seems inequitable that those in Watford will not benefit
from the scheme while those in Tatton, which is adjacent to your
constituency, Mr Brady, and, although it has pockets of deprivation,
has great pockets of wealth, will
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
preference is to make the scheme UK-wide so that every part of the
United Kingdom can access the holiday benefits in a similar way to my
area and to others represented on the Committee. I hope that the
Minister will reflect upon that preference before Report. If he does
not reflect upon it, will he consider chopping the scheme up in a
different way? It could be done by the unemployment rate—it
would be doable by postcode in constituencies, similar to the way it is
being done by region—or by the percentage of public sector
employment, or by the discretion of the Secretary of State for local
authority
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Business
births are also relevant. The Office for National Statistics released
its “Business demography 2009” last week, which is
helpful for the Committee. It notes that the percentage of business
births in the east and south-east regions of 9.9% and 9.7% respectively
were lower than the national average of business births. There have
been fewer business births in the south-east and the east over the past
year than in the north-east, the north-west and the Yorkshire and
Humber region. There are fewer business births in the areas represented
by my hon. Friends the Members for Luton South and for Luton North than
in the north-west, which is your region, Mr Brady, and which
is adjacent to mine. My region depends on north-west
employment—I am one and a half miles from the English border, so
business births in  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 72<a class="bkMark" name="Column72">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the north-west employ people in my area. Business births in those
regions are higher than those in the regions that the Bill excludes for
new
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are more business births in London than in those regions. The rate for
business births in London is 12.6% compared with an average of about
10% in the north-east, north-west and Yorkshire and Humber. The point
that is important to this discussion, however, is that the level of
business deaths in London of 13.7% is higher than anywhere else in the
United
Kingdom.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
east and south-east regions have fewer business births than the
regions—the north-west, the north-east and Yorkshire and
Humber—that are included in the Bill’s scheme. Moreover,
although London has a higher level of business births, it also has a
higher level of business deaths than any other region in the country.
Does that not give the Minister a sense of logic? If we are trying to
help maintain businesses at the start of their difficult lives,
particularly in areas with a high level of public sector employment or
of unemployment, or of deprivation in general, should not the logic
driving the Minister to his choice of regions say that he should
consider including London in the scheme? If schemes are dying quicker
in London than anywhere else, and if they are being born slower in the
east and the south-east than anywhere else, surely a scheme designed to
nurture new businesses by giving them a £5,000 holiday in their
initial three years should focus on those three areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want now to
conclude my initial remarks, because my hon. Friends also want to speak
on these issues. I want to help and support the Minister by
saying that, if he were to accept amendment 7, the Secretary of State
could, at any point, apply the scheme to specific local government
areas that he feels need help and support. To give him one example,
which is not in London or the south-eastern region, but it could have
been, just before February this year there were major redundancies at
the steelworks in Redcar in the north-east. If such a scenario were to
happen in London, the south-east and the east regions, which is
perfectly possible, the Minister might want to apply the scheme to a
particular local authority area to help with a particular challenge
following particular levels of
redundancy.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not want
to pick on any particular business in London, the south-east or the
east, and put a scourge on them, but I am sure that hon. Members can
think of sectors that are very dominant in a town, that are very
important to the economy of an area, and that could, given the
challenges that we face over the next three years, go belly up. We
could find massive redundancies in a particular area. The Luton area
could be hit by the failure of a particular business—say,
Vauxhall Motors, which I know well, because there is a Vauxhall plant
in my constituency. I do not wish to put a blight on the area, but such
a situation could happen; anything could happen. In the event of a
major employer in the borough of Luton having difficulties, would it
not be sensible for the Minister to be able to apply the scheme to that
borough, to help create new employment and replace the employment that
was
lost?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000165">&#160;</a>

Brady; that is always good to know. As the Government Whip will know, I
have the ability to talk for ever to try to keep the business of a
Committee going, but this is not one of the occasions on which I am
trying to do that. I am trying to indicate to the Minister our real
concerns about not the principle of the scheme, but its application. It
currently excludes three regions represented by five of the seven
Labour Members on this Committee, and by some Government Members
present,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000169">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Luton South makes a valid point. My point is
that if the Minister were to accept amendment 7, which is on local
authority areas, he would have the power to apply the scheme to a
borough in London, the south-east or the east in the event of a
particular situation, even if he chose to continue excluding London,
the south-east and the east. Such a situation, although we do not want
to see it happen, might be the consequence of a tightening of the
fiscal position, an economic downturn, or a lack of public confidence;
or a major employer in a particular part of those regions could find
itself so challenged that it ups sticks. What tends to happen in such
situations is that businesses, companies and other local authorities go
into the area to help create new jobs and find new employment. Would
that not be a useful scheme for the Minister to have in his back
pocket?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have no wish to put a plague on Luton, but in the event of a major
employer in Luton having great difficulties and causing thousands of
redundancies, would it not be good for the Minister to have the power
to say that one step that the Government were taking to help mitigate
the effects of that massive unemployment was ensuring the ability to
designate the borough of Luton, so that it could apply, under the
scheme, for a national insurance holiday for new businesses? That may
help only 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 people to start a new business, but
it is a tool in the armoury that could be used to help support areas in
the three excluded regions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
tabled the amendment simply to say that we want all areas to be
included. We could talk about putting a cap on the amount of money or
shortening the years, and all the ranges within that, so that, without
increasing the cost to the Treasury, we could allow all areas to
benefit, for the reasons I have mentioned—unemployment,
deprivation and so on. If the Minister cannot accept that, will he
split the cake via the public sector, or via levels of unemployment? If
he cannot do that, can he at least give himself a power that allows him
to offer help

			Column number: 74<a class="bkMark" name="Column74">&#160;</a>

county boroughs of those three areas? Those all seem reasonable
propositions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have tried to approach the issue in a constructive way and tried to
make the case for why my hon. Friends and I believe that we need to
review not the principle of the scheme, but its application, to make
sure that it is generally beneficial. I find it difficult to allow the
current scheme to stay in place when my hon. Friend the Member for
Luton North had 2,390 people out of work last month—a 5.1%
unemployment rate. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton South had 6.7%
unemployment in his constituency, with 3,245 people out of work. My
hon. Friend the Member for West Ham had 5,915 people
unemployed last month—a 10.8% unemployment rate. My hon. Friend
the Member for Walthamstow had 3,950 people unemployed, which is an
8.5% unemployment rate. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East had
a similar level of unemployment. The figures for Lewisham East seemed
to have disappeared from my piece of paper, but I am sure that my hon.
Friend will have those figures to hand in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
figures show that the scheme, in its application, does not address some
of the areas where there is greatest difficulty. Having spelled that
out, I hope that the Minister can reflect on the scheme in a positive
way and look at those suggestions. Again, I stretch out the hand of
friendship to him. I will not press the amendment to a vote. If he
wishes to reflect and come back to the matter on Report, and to
rephrase and look again at the scheme, we will happily take his hand.
In fact, I will give him a second hand of friendship: if he changes the
scheme, I promise him that I will not crow about the fact
that he has done so. I will say that it was done in the spirit of
co-operation, and that, discussion having taken place about the three
areas—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> My hon. Friend the
Member for West Ham always takes a hard line on such matters. That is
perfectly understandable, given the level of unemployment in her
constituency, but she will know that if I wanted to, I could and would
kick the Minister very hard, metaphorically.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000174">&#160;</a>

a very strong case as to why the Conservative-Liberal Democrat
Government are ignoring the needs of the constituencies represented by
my hon. Friends, but I think it better to ask the Minister to reflect
on the arguments we have made. There may just be a kernel of sense in
some of those arguments about how we distribute the scheme. If he
reflects on that and brings back suggestions, we will simply give him
our thanks and say, “Well done”; that is the purpose of
the debate and the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000175">&#160;</a>

speaking, I, too, have been studying the Library report on the November
unemployment statistics. If he looks at the map of Greater London on
page 46, he will find that while some of the constituencies he has
named are indeed in the top quintile of unemployment, just a matter of
a mile or two away there are constituencies in the bottom quintile of
unemployment. Is the flaw in his argument that our constituents are not
confined by boundaries? Those boundaries are relevant to us; they are
not relevant for travel-to-work

                           </div>more than six miles at its furthest point from the constituency of
Wythenshawe and Sale East, which has high levels of unemployment. We
could start businesses in Tatton, and that would suck people from the
estates of Wythenshawe and Sale East down into the rich pastures of
Knutsford, close by. That may or may not happen, but the principle is
the same in regions where the scheme applies and in regions where it
does not. If there is higher unemployment in constituencies in London
and the south-east than in many areas of the north, we should examine
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000177">&#160;</a>

mid-Cheshire, where I grew up, for many years. There are many
prosperous areas. I grew up on a council estate with a
prosperous ward—the richest ward in Cheshire—not three
miles away, so that fluid movement happens all over the place. If we
look at the matter in any particular statistical way, there is no
getting away from the fact that there are areas with high unemployment
in London, the south-east and the east that will not benefit from the
scheme. People in those areas may be within seven tube journeys of the
Cities of London and Westminster, but it does not mean that they will
benefit from employment there.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000178">&#160;</a>

in the room, I will keep them firmly on. Members will also be pleased
to know that I will not repeat the speech I gave on Second Reading in
its entirety, but there are probably some salient points worth

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I read
through the Second Reading debate on the train on the way here, and I
noted that it was not only Labour Members raising concerns about the
regional holiday and the exclusion of London, the east and the
south-east. I can see from <em>Hansard </em>that the hon. Members for
Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron), and for Portsmouth North (Penny
Mordaunt), asked the Minister to look at the decision to exclude
certain regions. The shadow Minister talked about the 12 most deprived
local authorities in the UK and the fact that a large number of them
are excluded from the regional holiday. In those areas, levels of
unemployment are high, and there is significant reliance on the public
sector for jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My local
authority, Lewisham, and my constituency, Lewisham East, are not on the
list, but that part of London struggles significantly with its local
economy. It has the fourth smallest business base in London and more
jobseekers chasing locally advertised jobs than anywhere else in the
country. I understand that that is symptomatic of the nature of the
London labour market, in that many people will use buses, trains and
bikes every day to go to work, but that says something important about
the experiences of my constituents when they go to the jobcentre. I
receive many letters and e-mails, and many people turn up at my
surgery, every week asking me to help them find
work.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in the local
economy, and probably micro-businesses in Lewisham, the exclusion from
the national insurance holiday of firms that are setting up in my
constituency is seen by many to be patently unfair. As I said on Second
Reading, two firms could be operating in exactly the same trade, and
might have exactly the same number of employees and exactly the same
profit and turnover, but the business setting up in the north would
stand to benefit from an exemption of up to £50,000 in the first
year, whereas the same business setting up in London, the south-east
or, indeed, my constituency would
not.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn about business
births and deaths is incredibly important. In Lewisham, only 59% of
businesses survive their first three years, whereas the national
average is 65%. Those businesses need support in their first few years,
and many people who are setting up new enterprises would like to
receive the sorts of concessions that other businesses elsewhere in the
UK
might.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have discussed why the regional holiday is unfair, but it also does not
do what the Government want it to do, which is stimulate private-sector
growth in areas that are reliant on the public sector for jobs.
Yesterday, I spoke in a debate on cuts to local government. In Lewisham
and many parts of London, we envisage significant job losses as a
result of the reduced funding available to local government and local
councils. That will add to the number of people going to the jobcentre
in my constituency, and it will be much harder for mums and dads to
find local employment, which the public sector often provides. If you
take the boroughs 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>of Lewisham, Lambeth, Southwark and Croydon together, 185,000 people are
employed in the public sector there; that is more than the public
sector work force of Tyne and Wear. Yet that whole swathe of London is
excluded from the national insurance holiday, and I cannot see the
fairness in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
measures fail to understand the nature of the economy in London. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn has said that we recognise that
we have the City and Canary Wharf, but just a stone’s throw away
from them we have pockets of considerable deprivation. The local
economy is key to those places, and anything that can be done to help
stimulate the growth of private firms should be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to comment on the evidence that the Committee received last week
when we met for the first time. We talked at some length about
administration and the cost of doing the national insurance holiday
differently, taking it down to a smaller geographical area, as opposed
to focusing only on regions. We received evidence from HMRC, which told
us that technically, it probably would not be that difficult to make
differences between postcodes in a local area and the regions, but we
were told by the Minister that, ultimately, the issue came down to
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Treasury seems to say that there is a lot of uncertainty about how the
initiative will work; nothing like this has been done before, and the
Treasury’s memorandum refers to that level of uncertainty. Will
the Minister retain some flexibility, and an open mind about whether
the geographical application of the scheme could be changed, if and
when evidence is obtained to show how it is
operating?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">During
the evidence session, my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow
robustly questioned the Minister and his advisers about the lack of
information on any behavioural change that the national insurance
holiday might have. I believe she asked, quite rightly, for some
written communication in advance of today’s Committee. I do not
know whether that has come through, but I have not seen it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It seems that
we do not know exactly how the scheme will play out, and much is based
on assumptions. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn said, we
know that London and the south-east are proven areas of
entrepreneurialism where many people want to set up a business. Will we
keep some flexibility to respond to the needs of areas where businesses
are being set up and where the national insurance holiday could make a
difference?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000194">&#160;</a>

evidence submitted by the Treasury in its impact assessment suggesting
that were the scheme to be extended to the entire country and include
some of the areas mentioned, an extra 300,000 new businesses would be
eligible? If the Government see that targets for the number of new
businesses to be set up under the scheme are not being reached, would
that not make the case for more flexibility so that we can tap into
that ability to generate more businesses in those
areas?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000195">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a pleasure to speak under your
chairmanship, Mr Brady, even though it is a rather cold day. First, I
want to express my support for everything that my right hon. Friend the
shadow Minister said  in his powerful and passionate speech. I
will reinforce what he said with some specific points about my
constituency. The constituencies of Luton North and Luton South are
similar in many ways and my hon. Friend the Member for Luton South and
I work together in solidarity, comradeship and friendship, to support
the town in every way. There are, however, some slight differences,
such as in the rate of unemployment because the most affluent part of
the town happens to be in my constituency, which somewhat moderates
unemployment levels. In some pockets of my constituency, however, there
are serious levels of unemployment and our local economy needs all the
help it can get.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On Second
Reading—unfortunately I did not attend most of the debate
because I was detained on parliamentary business elsewhere—it
was specifically mentioned that Luton North has one of the highest
levels of public sector employment. That means that it will be
disproportionately affected by cuts to public spending and public
sector jobs. Therefore, Luton North is threatened by Government plans
more than some other constituencies. I disagree profoundly with the
Government’s strategy, but that subject is not for this
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Luton is
close to other regions and towns that will not be disadvantaged by the
Government’s policy on this proposal, such as Northampton in the
east midlands or Milton Keynes in the southern region. Those large
conurbations will have the advantage of the scheme, but Luton will not.
The illogicality of the scheme is shown up by the joint town of
Leighton-Linslade and Leighton Buzzard, which is close to Luton. The
Leighton Buzzard part of the town is in Bedfordshire, while Linslade is
in Buckinghamshire. The division between the counties and, indeed, the
regions goes through that mini conurbation. I have a friend with a
small business in Leighton Buzzard, and he will not understand why
someone just half a mile away enjoys the advantages of the scheme,
while he does not. The scheme is clearly illogical, even outside my
borough.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government should change their position and understand the points that
the shadow Minister made very strongly. Unemployment is the key
problem. If I may digress somewhat, I thought that the contribution of
Mr Pichon, from Wenta, in our public meeting last week was very good.
He suggested that one way forward would be a substantial increase in
the minimum wage, which I heartily endorse. He suggested that that
could be compensated for by abolishing the employer’s
contribution to national insurance. That is a radical step, but putting
more money into the pockets of low-paid employees is the best way to
generate demand in the economy, because they tend to spend all their
money, which goes straight back into the economy, generating employment
elsewhere. Tax cuts for the better-off do not make that
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Giving
additional income to low-paid workers is the best way to generate
economic recovery and bring down unemployment. The key to tackling the
problem faced

                           </div>by the Government and the nation is to bring down unemployment, not to
create it through massive public spending cuts, which will not only
create unemployment in the public sector, but as we have heard from
PricewaterhouseCoopers and others, it will lead to massive cuts in the
private sector. There is even a suggestion that, at its peak, the
Government’s strategy of cuts could destroy as many as 1.5
million jobs. That is completely the wrong direction for us to go in;
indeed, I tabled an early-day motion to that effect two or three weeks
ago. It has been signed by a number of my hon. Friends, but not, sadly,
by Government Members.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000201">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have made the points that I wanted to make. These exclusions are
illogical. They will unfairly affect not only Luton, but many other
parts of the country. Even in areas that are not quite so badly off as
Luton, there will be illogicalities, which the local populations will
not understand. As I said, Leighton-Linslade is perhaps the best
example that I have come across in my locality. However, I think I have
made my point, and I will leave the floor to other
colleagues.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000202">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is good to be able to speak to the amendments.
Obviously, Government Members would prefer a scheme that was extended
across the country, but we recognise, as we heard in evidence last
week, that there are restrictions on the amount that can be spent and
that the Government are unwilling to shorten the time for which these
national insurance holidays are in place, so we have to find another
route.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000203">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 7,
5 and 6 offer innovative ways of tackling a problem that may seem
distant to those of us in the Committee right now, but which is very
real to people in Luton South, which I represent. I spoke about that on
Second Reading. Luton North and Luton South are great places to do
business. They benefit from great road and rail connections and
proximity to London. Businesses really like our town. The
majority—82%—of the businesses in our town are small
businesses, with fewer than 10 people working in them. We have a
creative work force.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000204">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Many people
may choose to set up a business, but the proposals in the Bill will
mean that they do not receive the equivalent of the £50,000
golden hello that they would 15 or 20 minutes up the road or railway
line, and there is something profoundly unfair about that. I would have
to defend that difficult situation to my constituents, so I want to

North and Luton South are two areas to which the amendments speak. I am
almost certain that Luton South would be one of the 350 constituencies
covered by amendment 5, and that Luton North would be among the 350
covered by amendment 6. I hazard a guess that both areas fit into both
camps, but the holiday would not apply in either of them, and we would
therefore be at a serious disadvantage in comparison to areas that
border us. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton North—my good
friend—made that point

proposals in the Bill will have a serious effect. There will be the
£50,000 golden hello available to new businesses just up the
road, but the effect on my seat will be a double, triple or even
quadruple whammy. The road and rail links and the other great
infrastructure that attracts businesses to Luton also represent the
ability for businesses and talented individuals to move away from
Luton. The public sector cuts that are coming, which will be deep and
which are beginning to take shape in Luton, will further increase
unemployment, and without something stepping in to increase and boost
private sector employment we will be at a
disadvantage.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000209">&#160;</a>

my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn has laid out, the lower rates
of business birth in Luton already put us at a disadvantage, and there
will be a quadruple whammy for my constituents if the Bill is left
unamended. The fundamental question is that the Government have put
forward their position, that the changes are essential for boosting
growth in areas with high public sector employment. They have said that
they will stimulate the economy in those areas, and that they want the
scheme to be in place so that they can rebalance the economy between
the south and the north, yet we see from the Minister’s answer
to a question in last week’s evidence session that that might,
in fact, not be the full

my mind, the Bill is neither one thing nor another. It does not

south-east being exempted? My constituents deserve a clear answer as to

                        <p class="tabbed">I
turn briefly to amendment 7. I can see an incredible amount of credit
in the idea that local authority areas could be designated by the
Treasury and by appropriate Ministers as areas that could benefit from
the holiday. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn has already
laid out, there are situations—I can think of one or two in
Luton right now where potentially we could lose large
employers—where the stimulation would be necessary. It seems
funny to argue from the Opposition side for greater powers in the hands
of the Treasury to determine where this goes, but I see advantages to
that approach. Local authority areas already produce information about
public sector employment and levels of deprivation. Indeed, in my local
authority there are wards that we are spending a lot of time and effort
trying to
revive.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000214">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> What is clear from those comments is that the
scheme as it is intended is a simpler scheme than one looking at local
authority areas and individual constituencies—either the 350
with the highest rate  of unemployment or the 350 with the
highest rate of public sector employment. But we are in politics not
only to administer schemes but to address inequalities in our society.
For us to constantly say that we just want the simplest and most
straightforward scheme is an argument that produces a blanket scheme
for a shorter period. This scheme does neither one thing nor the
other.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
see advantages to amendment 5, which relates to the 350 constituencies
with the lowest rate of unemployment. Unemployment is an issue in many
of our communities and there are pockets of unemployment not only in
regions but in constituencies. We are being presented with quite an
innovative scheme. We certainly heard that from the evidence given by
different experts. The question why we will not allow that innovation
to extend to individual constituencies is one to which I still see no
answer in the evidence that was given. When we want to tackle
unemployment, or areas with very high public sector employment where we
are hoping to rebalance the economy—as in the coalition’s
stated aim—the amendments could make a real
dent.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000220">&#160;</a>

where there would be a significant movement of people. But That

			Column number: 82<a class="bkMark" name="Column82">&#160;</a>
                           </div>answer recognises that there will be a significant impact on several
communities that border those areas. If we approached it from a simpler
and more straightforward perspective and said that there are certain
objectives and policy aims that we are trying to
achieve—reducing unemployment in areas of high unemployment and
rebalancing the economy in areas of high public sector
employment—we could hold our heads high when we come out of the
Committee and say that there was a simple and clear strategy behind
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000221">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly, a
blanket approach across the south-east, the east and
London—termed collectively as the greater south-east—does
no credit to constituents in the massively diverse area of the greater
south-east. If we are to make a strong case for the Bill, do we accept
that there needs to be an increase in national insurance to address the
deficit, which all parties seek to reduce? If we accept that there are
businesses that will not start up as a result of this measure, we have
to adopt a consistent approach, which must come from an ideological
belief that it is our responsibility not just to administer schemes but
to tackle deprivation where we find it, so that we end up with an
economy that is fit for all people and that produces jobs as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000222">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On a point of clarity, we supported a national
insurance rise during the election and we supported it today. The
Minister has brought forward a scheme to help the start of new
businesses. Those new businesses are needed because the Government are
cutting back massively on public spending, exorcising regional
development agencies and making damaging cuts to regional assemblies,
such as my own one in Wales. The hand of friendship extends because
this is a scheme to help create new employment from the devastation of
public sector
cuts.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000226">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I note that comment. Perhaps I am being churlish,
but I must point out that employers’ national insurance
contributions will affect start-up businesses, existing businesses and
employment. I wish that we could do more in that area, but we are very
constrained. None the less, we are trying to do something, which is
more than can be said of the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000227">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me turn to the amendments. The right hon. Member for Delyn is right to
say that we have to take some difficult decisions on the public
finances. I am pleased that the OBR has reduced to 330,000 its
projections 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 83<a class="bkMark" name="Column83">&#160;</a>
                           </div>for the number of public sector jobs that will be lost as a consequence
of the fiscal consolidation. Whichever party came to power was going to
have to take tough decisions on public spending and that would have had
an impact on the numbers being employed by the public sector. The
intention behind this scheme is to seek to redress that and to
encourage private sector growth and enterprise. I am genuinely pleased
that there is support from both Government and Opposition for that,
although I understand that there are issues about how such help is
targeted. I believe that we have the right approach, and I will seek to
explain why.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is fair to
say that people of goodwill can hold different views on this,
particularly those representing constituencies that do not benefit from
the scheme. Of course a Member will want to speak out for their
constituents if they think that they will be significantly
disadvantaged. Let me see if I can explain our thinking. The amendments
relate to the regional nature of the NICs holiday, which was a debate
that we had on Second Reading and at the evidence stage. Amendments 1
to 4 taken together would make the holiday a UK-wide scheme. The NICs
holiday is aimed at helping the formation of new businesses that are
employing staff in those countries and regions most reliant on public
sector employment. The reason that Greater London and the eastern and
south-eastern regions are excluded is that the proportion of the
population in public sector employment is lower than in any other part
of the United Kingdom. We estimate that the scheme will cost an
additional £660 million over the three years.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">During the
evidence session, I was asked whether, if take-up is lower than
expected, there is a plan to expand the holiday to cover the whole of
the United Kingdom. It is not only about cost, but about the policy
rationale for the holiday, which is to target incentives on new
businesses in regions with higher public sector employment. During the
evidence session, the representatives of the Federation of Small
Businesses and the British Chambers of Commerce made it clear that the
greater south-east is more resilient than the rest of the United
Kingdom. The formation of new businesses would not be significantly
harmed because the holiday was not available. It must not be forgotten
that all new and existing businesses in the greater south-east will
benefit from the increase in the employer national insurance
contributions threshold, which we have discussed, and the reduction in
corporation tax rates. Reducing the deficit is the priority. We have
limited resources in the application of this holiday, which was why we
focused it in the way that we did.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Member for Delyn proposes an alternative. To be fair, he made it
clear that he is not proposing anything that would cost more than we
have scored already on this policy. One proposal that he made was that
we have this as a national scheme, but that we have a fixed budget, and
that it stops when the money runs out. That would enable it to work
across all regions, if I have correctly summarised one of his
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
difficulty with the fixed-amount approach, which is what the previous
Government did with the car scrappage scheme, is that while it may be
appropriate in some circumstances, we have to look from the viewpoint
of someone who wants to set up a business and is planning and is aware
of this particular scheme and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 84<a class="bkMark" name="Column84">&#160;</a>
                           </div>wants to make use of it. Imagine the situation if, having spent several
months preparing to start a business, shortly before they did so, the
person discovered that the scheme had run out of money. Imagine if
someone who already had a business was benefitting from the national
insurance contributions holiday and had taken on a number of employees
and then, six months through, with 10 employees benefitting, the
Government announced that the scheme had run out of money. We would
have fundamentally undermined the whole policy, because we would have
created a degree of uncertainty.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we hear constantly, businesses want certainty on how their tax system
works. If we want the scheme to have a beneficial behavioural impact,
that degree of uncertainty within it would substantially undermine it.
It would also cause considerable administrative costs and difficulties
for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in monitoring where the
money was being spent and in identifying at which point all the
£940 million had been spent, especially because much of that
information may not come to light until afterwards. Although I
understand the reasons why the hon. Gentleman suggests that this
holiday could be done on a national basis and still remain within the
cost envelope that we have identified, it is not a practical
solution.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000233">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If the Minister refers back to my hon. Friend the
Member for Walthamstow and the discussions that we have had, the basis
on which he is determining the potential uptake of the scheme is
woolly, if I am honest. In the event of the scheme being
over-subscribed, will he stick to £940 million, or will he then
apply the cap that I argue he should apply from the beginning, so that
the taxpayer, and the businesses that may apply, know the extent of the
scheme’s
contribution?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000234">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I answered that question in the evidence session,
and I hope that I will give the same answer here. The £940
million is a forecast for what the policy will cost, not a cap. If the
uptake is greater than we anticipate, the cost of the policy will be
greater and we will not cap it as such. Businesses need certainty that
the scheme is the same as what we are putting on the statute book, and
that the holiday will be available to their employees in exactly the
same way as we have set
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000235">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, this is an important point: one of the
Minister’s arguments against the amendments is that the extra
cost of £660 million will be incurred by the scheme being
applied to London, the south-east and the eastern region, and that he
cannot guarantee his hon. Friends that the £940 million will not
become £1.3 billion at the end of the scheme, if the
take-up is large enough, which it may well be. We need clarity on what
basis the Minister has made the assessment of £940 million,
because his argument against our proposals is based partly on cost, as
well as partly on application.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000236">&#160;</a>

than we had projected, that would suggest that there had been a greater
behavioural impact than we had anticipated, and that the policy would
have been a greater success. Whenever the Treasury, under whatever
Government, sets out a tax policy, it forecasts what the cost will be.
Sometimes, it is accurate—at least in theory, that
happens—sometimes it is an overestimate, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 85<a class="bkMark" name="Column85">&#160;</a>
                           </div>sometimes it is an underestimate. However, on the basis of the numbers
available to the Treasury and HMRC, it is the best estimate of what the
policy will cost. For this particular policy, the best estimate we have
is £940 million, but that will depend on take-up, and
we will see how that develops. As I see it, there is nothing
particularly difficult or novel about that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000237">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Can the Minister clarify this point? By that
logic, there is no reason to be against the entire process being
extended to the whole of the UK. You say that it would cost £660
million and that essentially you have a blank cheque for the policy,
dependent on take-up, so you could apply the same metric to the whole
of the country and say, “We will intervene at a later date if

                           </strong> I hope that that was not the approach that the
previous Government took when they were in power. Essentially, one has
to make a best estimate of how much a particular policy would cost,
just as one would on how much a tax increase might bring in, or how
much a tax cut might cost. It is an estimate and that does not mean,
for example, that if a tax increase brings in more money than was
expected halfway through the time period, one automatically reduces it.
That is not how such things work. Our estimate is that the scheme will
cost £940 million pounds, based on the regions and countries
that are currently included. It would cost an additional £660
million if we included the areas that are currently
excluded.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000240">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Even if there were an indicative cap—an
estimate of how much the scheme would cost—one approach might be
to reduce the generosity of the scheme per enterprise, and have the
scheme applied across the whole country. I would not choose that route
myself; I would choose more generosity in general, but it is a
possibility, is it not?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000241">&#160;</a>

would be more generous generally, and it is interesting to learn that
he is an instinctive tax-cutter. We learn many things in Committees and
it is a particular pleasure to hear of two Luton MPs working closely
together, which is progress from the previous Parliament. If we made
the scheme less generous, the chances of it having much of an impact
where it applies would be weaker, and the essential impact would be
limited. We would rather focus and target the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000242">&#160;</a>

£940 million over the three years would affect would still
potentially be the same. It would still be 400,000 businesses. It would
still be 800,000 employees. It would just be spread over three other
regions. There is no increase necessarily in the impact. What is the
problem in doing that, given that there are already 23% public sector
employees in London, the south-east and the eastern region who will not
now qualify for this scheme?<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000243">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point that I was trying to make was that if we
had reduced the eligibility per employee falling within the scheme then
the chances of the scheme being particularly effective would be weaker.
We might be spreading the benefits too thinly for it to make any
noticeable behavioural impact or benefit for a business in those
regions. I accept that this is a question of judgment, but our judgment
is that if we were to do that the scheme would be less likely to be
effective.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000244">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 5
and 6 would remove eligibility from areas which benefit under the
Government’s proposals. I will turn to the policy and practical
merits of these proposals in more detail shortly. However, a further
consideration prevents these amendments from being accepted: no
provision is made to protect those new businesses that are already
benefiting from the operation of the scheme and which would be excluded
under these amendments. If they were accepted, such business would be
obliged to repay the employer’s national insurance contributions
they have withheld to date. Perhaps just as damaging, those who are
actively considering starting a business or who are in the process of
arranging the necessary finances to start their new businesses, could
see their business plans wrecked. That surely would be unfair. I hope
that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that such outcomes are highly
undesirable, and concur that these amendments cannot therefore be
accepted.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 5
and 6 propose to exclude from the holiday new businesses located within
the 350 constituencies with the lowest percentage rate of unemployment
or lowest percentage rate of public sector employment respectively. I
have said before that using smaller units such as constituencies does
not recognise that in practice labour markets span larger areas. It is
also worth repeating that ring-fencing small geographical areas would
create multiple borders up and down the UK. The hon. Member for Luton
North highlighted a town that spans Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire.
He pointed out, entirely fairly, that they are in different regions,
although both fall within the excluded area. The hon. Member for Luton
South was generous enough to say that he found the borders argument to
some extent compelling. The right hon. Member for Delyn touched on the
borders issue and I tried to tempt him to say more on that
subject.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have to accept that, as we have targeted this, there are border issues
but were we to break it down even further those border issues would be
exacerbated. There is the central point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Bristol West when he said that working patterns do not
necessarily reflect constituencies or even local authorities and to
some extent, particularly when we look at London, the south-east and
the eastern region, not even regions. Thousands of my constituents in
Hertfordshire travel to London every day. I am one of them. A point
that I would make more broadly in some of the discussions when we look
at London, unemployment rates and dependency on the public sector is
that the London labour market is substantial and expands and includes
much of the home counties in the eastern region and the south-east. We
would face great difficulties with borders if we had a holiday scheme
that was designed on the basis of constituencies or local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000247">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Making
a distinction between the 350th and the  351st constituencies
might create some issues. Data at constituency level are based on
samples and will be subject to considerable margins of error, and
rankings

                           </div>are likely to vary over time. I know this is only a temporary policy,
but it is likely that by the end of the three-year period, the list of
the 350 most deprived constituencies would be different from the one we
will start off with, and those who found themselves in the list at the
end would have reason to complain. We are not likely to see similar
changes with regions, so we might face some difficulties
there.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
7 targets the holiday at local authority level. It suffers from the
same problems as I mentioned under amendments 5 and 6. It creates more
uncertainty by not specifying the criteria that local authorities must
satisfy to feature on the list, and by leaving open the possibility
that those could change. Steve Hughes of the British Chambers of
Commerce said in his
evidence:<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“When
there are limited resources, it is better to focus them on the regions
most in need.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,
National Insurance Contributions Public Bill Committee, </em>2 December
2010; c. 6,
Q8.]<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, the NICs holiday is targeted at regions and countries that
have the highest proportion of public sector dependence to encourage
new businesses to start up and to take on employees. Expanding the
holiday to the whole country would undermine that policy rationale.
Introducing new criteria at constituency or local authority level would
increase complexity and, without much more complex legislation, lead to
some employers currently participating in the holiday losing the
benefits and having to pay back the NICs that they have withheld.
Consequently, I ask the right hon. Member for Delyn to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000250">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for what he has
said. For the purpose of completeness, I can tell my hon. Friend the
Member for Lewisham East that in her constituency there are currently
1,985 people unemployed, which is an unemployment rate of 5%. I
apologise for missing her off my list
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000251">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister made some interesting arguments, but the nub of it goes back
to the question of why key areas in the east, the south-east and London
regions are excluded from the scheme. I have offered him what I hope
are helpful suggestions. We have not put them down as amendments, but
they have been part of the discussion. On reflection, he might on
Report make this 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 88<a class="bkMark" name="Column88">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a two-year rather than a three-year scheme, which would operate from
June 2010 to June 2012. During that time, he might have extended the
scheme to the three excluded regions, monitored the extra cost arising
from those exclusions and looked at the £940 million he is
currently spending. Based on what has already been said, he might have
evaluated the take-up of the scheme, which may not come anywhere near
meeting the expected 400,000 businesses and 800,000 individuals over
that period. At the end of that two-year period, he might also have
judged whether he wanted to continue or extend the scheme based on the
economy, which he believes will pick up through the Government’s
other fiscal measures over that
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
complete exclusion of certain areas still misses the point. My favoured
option is to ensure that we have a scheme that is applicable across the
whole country. I do not want to repeat the arguments,
but—very pithily—there are three basic reasons for my
wanting that. There are levels of unemployment in areas of the east,
the south-east and London regions that merit the challenge of having
Government help to generate new businesses. It is important that we
encourage such new businesses in those areas as well as in the country
as a whole. His logic on the public sector means that, as I have
mentioned, we have a situation in which 23 of the top 100
constituencies by public sector employment are excluded by their being
in the three excluded regions. On the deprivation index, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Lewisham East said, seven of the 12 authorities
are excluded by the removal of the three
regions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000253">&#160;</a>

offer to the Minister, which I hope he will consider, is that I will
happily not press amendments 7, 5 and 6, because I recognise that there
are administrative issues that need further reflection, as he pointed
out. We tabled those amendments so that he could consider our concerns
about local authority areas, unemployment and the public sector as a
whole. I will happily not press them, but we need to maintain our
concerns on amendment 1 and subsequent
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120748000254">&#160;</a>
