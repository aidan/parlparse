<H4><center>Clause 52 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Incapacity benefit: reduction for pension payments </center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [20 April]: No. 141, in page 50,  line 24, leave out the word `payable' and insert the word  `paid'. [Mr. Oaten.]  
<P>
<H5>10 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be  made.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this  it will be convenient to take amendment No. 88, in page  50, leave out lines 36 to 39.  
<P>
Before I call the hon. Member for Grantham and  Stamford (Mr. Davies), a Committee member has  unkindly suggested that I should declare an interest in our  proceedings because I am using a walking stick. I remind  the Committee that, regardless of where it thinks my  brains may be, they are certainly not in my knee.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): It  occurred to me to declare an interest when my back was  giving me trouble a few weeks ago. I suspect that under  the all-work test, I would have failed to qualify for  benefit, but I passed the test to decide whether I was  capable of work.  
<P>
When our previous sitting was adjourned, we were  discussing amendments Nos. 141 and 88. The former is  a Liberal Democrat amendment and the latter, narrower  amendment was tabled by Conservative Members.  
<P>
I have made it clear that, in the clause, the Government  are taking powers to claw back incapacity benefit if  someone is in receipt of pension or insurance income.  That is a double attack on the living standards of the  disabled. If people are forced to take their pension early,  the value will be savagely reduced and they will lose their  incapacity benefit. Amendment No. 88 would remove new  section 30DD(2)(c) and would deny the Government the  power that they seek to impose on people who decline to  bring forward the time at which they take their pension  which would reduce its value a notional income, and to  means-test their incapacity benefit against that notional  income.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have no wish to interrupt the  hon. Gentleman. As the Room is warm, it is in order for  hon. Members to remove their jackets, but it is polite to  ask first.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I had a terrible feeling, but could not quite  believe, Mr. McWilliam, that you were about to tell me  that I was wide of the subject. This is perhaps the worst  clause in this dreadful Bill and it is vital that we should  have the opportunity of a stand part debate, so I am being  particularly self-disciplined on this matter. I shall ask  some precise, technical questions of great practical  importance to all disabled people, who are being targeted  by this pernicious clause and the concept of notional  income, which our amendment would remove.     <P>
<P>
The Government have thought through their unpleasant  proposals attacking the living standards of disabled  people. But we must ensure I say that with scepticism  based on the Government's performance on the Bill so  far that they have also thought through the restrictions  on incapacity benefit. From the Bill, the explanatory  memorandum or the glossy document entitled "A new  contract for welfare"	 it is not clear whether the  Government have thought that through. They certainly  have not revealed their answers to the public or  Parliament.  
<P>
My first question relates to notional income. How will  it be calculated? Will actuarial science be applied to work  out what annuity what pension income someone could  achieve if he or she exercised the right to take an early  pension? Is notional income to be calculated by referring  to the annuity that that person could obtain? Let us be  clear: will the calculation be based on annuity, actuarial  methods or something else?  
<P>
If the calculation is based on annuity rates, will notional  income be annual income, broken down into weekly  amounts of annuity, as outlined in the clause, or will it be  penal? That is my second question. The Government  could calculate what a disabled person might be able to  obtain by way of advance pension payments or annuity  payments and add a penal element for not claiming it.  Will there be a punitive measure? It is difficult to get  answers out of the Government, so I am speaking slowly  and distinctly. I am repeating my questions so that they  have no excuse not to respond.  
<P>
I asked about penal rates. It occurs to me that, if this  appalling Bill comes into force, it might be sensible for  disabled people, who are being viciously targeted by the  Government, not to take the pension to which they are  entitled but to wait until normal retirement age or family  circumstances are right and future plans are in place. The  reduction or elimination, complete with withdrawals, of  their entitlement to incapacity benefit could be accepted  on the grounds that they would be receiving only one  blow a single whammy rather than the double blow  that the Government have planned for the disabled.  
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for  Social Security</b> (Mr. Hugh Bayley): I am grateful to the  hon. Gentleman for putting a clear question, but I need  some clarification. Is he arguing in principle against the  use of a notional income rule or against the use of a  notional income rule in this circumstance? The  Conservatives introduced a notional income rule to take  occupational pensions into account when calculating the   jobseeker's allowance, and that reduces the allowance in  circumstances harsher than those that we are considering.  Is he suggesting that the notional income rule that is used  for the jobseeker's allowance is wrong and should be  changed, or would he be satisfied if the same rule was  used for incapacity benefit?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am going to answer that question. The  Under-Secretary will appreciate that in the context of the  dialogue between Government and Opposition that must  take place in the House and in Committee, it would create  the wrong impression if I evaded such a question. But I  do not want to be drawn into the Government's trap by  answering a question that is not directly germane to my  amendment, only to be told that I weakened our case for  the all-important clause stand part debate.     
<P>
All Conservative Members are opposed to the  application of the notional income concept in this  circumstance. We are, frankly, appalled. It is hideous that  the Government do not appear to be able to distinguish  between someone who is unemployed and someone who  is disabled. Unemployment is, hopefully, transient and  can be remedied 100 per cent., but a disability is often  permanent and most people will not be able to return to  their previous job or achieve the same stream of income.  The Government seem incapable of understanding that  there is all the difference in the world between the two  situations.  
<P>
The disabled are a vulnerable group, and we should not  argue, by analogy, that whatever is justified in relation to  the unemployed is ipso facto justified in relation to the  disabled. That logic has been used too often in this context  by the Government.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The notional income rule and the offset  in relation to occupational pensions, which applies to the  jobseeker's allowance, will be applied only during the  year or two before a person's normal retirement date. As  we know, such people find it difficult to get back into the  labour market. Notional income is used not in relation to  short-term cases but in relation to people who retire early  because of sickness on an enhanced pension.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not think that the Under-Secretary  understands his own rules. He tried to draw an analogy  between the contributory jobseeker's allowance and the  situation in which notional income is relevant. In relation  to the jobseeker's allowance, the issue does not arise after  the six-month period, when that allowance is no longer a  contributory jobseeker's allowance. We all agree that it is  right for payments to be means-tested in that context. The  issue arises only during the first six months, and it is  therefore by definition a short-term problem for those who  are unemployed.  
<P>
In relation to incapacity benefit, the issue is not a  short-term problem. A person's IB will be means tested,  savagely reduced and eliminated if a person's income is  more than £179 a week, which I hope we all agree is not  a great income. The problem will apply indefinitely for  as long as a person continues to receive IB.  
<P>
No comparison can be made between the contributory  jobseeker's allowance and IB. The financial blow that the  Government plan to deliver will be much more  devastating if you receive IB, because means testing and  the notional income rule   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that it may be tiresome  to point this out, but I am not in receipt of IB.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): How could  anyone think that?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Apart from the fact that you have a  walking stick, Mr. McWilliam, that thought would not  cross anyone's mind. No one is more vigorous or active  than you, not least in your ability to interrupt me at critical  moments and when I am in full flow.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I interrupt the hon. Gentleman  not because I want to but because he transgresses.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Misusing the pronoun in the second  person is a terrible habit of mine, Mr. McWilliam. It is a  terrible sin, for which I shall no doubt have to perform  some complicated penance in the afterlife.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend should use the word "thou"	  in future.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If reincarnation is a fact, the  hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford may be a  Standing Committee Chairman in a future life.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I must return to my argument. There is no  comparison between the position of the disabled and that  of the unemployed. Unemployment is a transient  phenomenon about which people can do something, and  we want to encourage them to do so. Invalidity and  permanent disability are involuntary situations about  which people can do very little. They can follow their  doctor's advice and hope for an improvement but, with  the best will in the world, they cannot do anything about  their condition.  
<P>
To impose a financial sanction on such people in an  attempt to force them to do something about their  condition is cruel and inhuman. However, that is exactly  what the Government are doing. They argue that the  disciplines that apply in relation to the jobseeker's  allowance should also be applied to the disabled. We  reject that revolting proposal outright. I must inform the  Under-Secretary that, frankly, the Government's proposal  sticks in our gullet, and I hope that we shall hear no more  about it.  
<P>
The two situations are not comparable even in purely  financial terms. If the notional income rule is applied to  someone who has lost the contributory jobseeker's  allowance, a six-month period, at the most, will be  involved. That is not the case in relation to IB the  exclusion may continue for years. The Government are  levying a much greater financial burden on the disabled  than the unemployed. In the case of the disabled, it is  utterly unjustified.

<P>

<B> The Minister of State, Department of Social Security  (Mr. Stephen Timms) rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps the Minister of State is trying to  spare the embarrassment of his hon. Friend the  Under-Secretary by rising to intervene. I shall of course  allow him to do so, but I should say that the Government  are digging themselves even deeper into a nasty hole.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I simply wanted the hon. Gentleman to  acknowledge that, in this respect, the jobseeker's  allowance regime is in fact harsher. Where the measure  before us proposes that 50 per cent. of the notional income  be taken into account, the jobseeker's allowance takes  100 per cent. into account.  
<P>
<H5>10.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> This is a complete sleight of hand. Once  again, new Labour thinks that it can bamboozle the public,  the Committee and the Opposition, but it cannot. Under  the clause, where income exceeds £179 a week, the whole  of a person's invalidity benefit will be extinguished. The  Minister of State is looking through his papers for that  calculation. It is in the relevant Library research paper,  the page reference for which I shall provide in a moment.  <P>
<P>
I put it to the Minister that £179 a week is not an  enormous amount of money. Under the clause, wealthy  people, whose assets will mostly be business assets,  stocks and shares, and so on, will not suffer at all.  However, people with modest incomes from insurance  policies or pension funds will have their benefit fully  extinguished. Through what is a modest threshold, the  50 per cent. rule will lead to the 100 per cent. removal of  incapacity benefit.  
<P>
One of the advantages of being in government is that  one has wonderful, invisible people who provide  information during proceedings such as ours. I do not  enjoy that advantage, but I am grateful to helpful  colleagues such as my hon. Friend the Member for  Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), who has just provided the  page reference for the calculation to which I referred a  moment ago. Page 73 of Library research paper 99/19  states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"So, for example, where a person is on the basic long-term rate  of Incapacity Benefit of £64.70 per week with no other additions,  their Incapacity Benefit would be extinguished if their occupational  or personal pension exceeded £179.40 per week."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of my hon. Friend, I am able to  provide a more precise figure by adding 40p to the £179  to which I had referred.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): I think that I am right  in saying that, based on those figures, the annual income  will be about £10,000, which is below the poverty line.  Therefore, the people who will lose out through the  removal of incapacity benefit are those who are below the  poverty line.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am glad to have my point reinforced.  
<P>
I hope that you will testify, Mr. McWilliam, to my  sincere efforts to focus strictly and narrowly on the  amendment, and to the severity of my self-discipline in  that respect, excepting those occasions when points are  made to which, in the interests of a fair debate, I must  respond. I must ensure that the Opposition's case is not  lost by default.     
<P>
I shall now return to my questions on the amendment.  I hope that the Minister who is to reply took note of the  two that I have already asked. If he fails to answer them  in his winding-up speech, I shall ask them again. I asked  whether the calculation will add a penal element to the  notional annuity, and I intended to make a point that is  highly relevant to the amendment and the concept of  notional income. If I were a disabled person who faced  the prospect of compulsory early collection of my  pension, which would reduce substantially its long-term  value, and the loss of my invalidity benefit, which would  be means-tested against the pension, I would decide not  to face that double attack by the Government on my  standard of living, but instead to take a single whammy  hit. I would not claim my pension, which would preserve  its value, but instead face the Government's imposition of  a notional income based on the amount of the pension had  I taken it early. I would accept the loss to income and  even the complete loss of incapacity benefit, because that  would be extinguished if my income exceeded £179 a  week, but at least my pension would not be reduced in  value. On reaching normal retirement age, I would get the  pension income that I would otherwise have received. It  would be logical to do that. Either the Government are too  stupid to have thought that through or they are planning a  penal rate.  
<P>
My third question also relates to the calculation of  notional income. As it is possible for me to use the first  person singular in a non-specific sense, even if I am not  allowed to use the second person singular, let us suppose  that I am the disabled person. If I decide not to take my  pension early, which the Government are trying to force  me to do, and have a notional income imposed on me,  will that notional income be calculated on the basis of a  single annuity on my life or an annuity on two lives, that  of myself and my spouse? If the notional income  calculation is annuity based, will it be linked to a single  or joint annuity?  
<P>
Fourthly, will the annuity be fixed-rate indexed? Will  the Government assume that the annuity is indexed to  prices, earnings or the stock market, because it is now  possible to get annuities that are based on an indexed  contract on the futures or derivatives market?  Alternatively, will they assume that the annuity is a  straight annuity that provides constant nominal payments  calculated on my actuarial life and paid to me on the basis  of my actual life.     
<P>
My fifth question relates to the personal pension lump  sum. For the purposes of calculating the notional annuity,  will the Government assume that I am taking 25 per cent.,  as I am allowed to do under tax rules, out of my personal  pension when I claim it? As you know, Mr. McWilliam,  25 per cent. of the value of the pension and the market  value of the assets held in the pension fund can be taken  as a lump sum at the beginning of retirement. If I am  going to be forced either to take early retirement and draw  down my pension early, thereby reducing its value, or to  have a corresponding notional income imposed on me,  will it be assumed that I have taken the 25 per cent. lump  sum? That would make an enormous difference to the  calculation. The amount that would be available to  purchase the annuity would be different by a factor of  33.3 per cent., depending on whether the 25 per cent.  capital sum had been removed from the initial pension  fund.  
<P>
The rules are slightly different for an occupational  pension scheme. What can be taken as a lump sum  depends on the terms of the scheme. A final salary scheme  is usually based not on the value of a fund, because there  is no individual fund, but on an earnings factor so many  times final salary. That could be once or twice final  annual salary, or six months' worth, depending on the  pension rules.  
<P>
My sixth question relates to the occupational pension  lump sum. What assumptions will be made about that?  Will notional income be tailored for each individual on  whom it is going to be imposed according to the terms of  the occupational pension scheme? That is a fantastically  complex and wasteful bureaucratic exercise. One can  imagine bureaucrats sitting in offices and writing endless  letters to trustees of a pension fund to ask for the rules of  the fund and how they might be interpreted in the case of  a particular person. Will a notional lump sum payment be  taken into account or not? Alternatively, will there be a  standardised notional lump sum amount taken out of  everybody's calculation, irrespective of any individual's  entitlement, under any given occupational scheme, to a  salary-related lump sum on retirement. Those are  fundamental questions relating to notional income, and  they require clear answers.  
<P>
At what age will the notional income rule be applied?  Will it be applied at any age at which a person becomes  disabled, or will it be applied from age 60? If it is applied  from age 60, will that not involve a degree of  discrimination between men and women? Women can  take their state retirement pension from the age of I  think 61 or 62. Men cannot do so until they are 65. The  incomes of people whose circumstances were otherwise  the same would, as a result of the implementation of the  notional income rule, differ according to their sex. A  disabled woman will have a higher income than a man  whose medical and financial circumstances are otherwise  identical, as she will have a state retirement pension.  According to the explanatory memorandum, the  Government do not propose to offset incapacity benefit  entitlement against state retirement pension. Will the age  at which the notional income rule is applied therefore be  the same for men and women? Otherwise, will not sex  discrimination be an issue? I suppose I have asked  questions seven, eight and nine.     
<P>
Will the notional income rule be applied to those with  state earnings related pension schemes? I am told that the  Government plan not to do so, which is an appalling  discrimination against people who have contracted out of  SERPS into a personal pension. For those who stayed in  SERPS, the income under that scheme will be protected.  If a person becomes disabled, any money received under  the SERPS pension will not be set off against any  entitlement to incapacity benefit. The contract between  the state and the individual was that there would be no  subsequent discrimination, but people who have opted out  will be forced to take the pension early, which will reduce  its value, or will find that their personal pension is subject  to a notional income charge. That is clear discrimination  between those who contracted in and those who  contracted out, which is unprecendented in this area of  the pensions market.  
<P>
Alternatively, will the Government calculate what  portion of someone's personal pension is a result of  contracting-out rebates? It could therefore be ring fenced  and relieved from the calculation of notional income. The  notional income charge would only be calculated on the  basis of the portion of the value of someone's  accumulated personal pension that has resulted from his  or her employer's contributions and not from  contributions under the Contributions Agency's rebate  system.  
<P>
That was my 10th question. All of my questions require  clear answers if we are able to have a meaningful debate  on the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I shall try to answer all of the questions  to the satisfaction of hon. Members. I shall start with those  raised by the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)  when he moved his amendment on Tuesday. He said that  he was probing the Government's intention and asked  what would happen to the pension entitlement of someone  who deferred his pension until the age of 65 and had the  notional income rule applied, but died before the age of  65. The answer is the same as in any circumstances in  which someone dies before a pension becomes payable.  A choice must be made. Those of us who are fortunate  enough to have some flexibility on retirement date and  pension must make a choice. If a pension is payable at  either 60 or 65 and the later date is chosen but the  beneficiary dies before that, the pension is not paid,  although there may be some underlying rights to widow's  pension and so on.  
<P>
<H5>10.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</b> I understand that, but I asked the Minister  to acknowledge that it would be unfair in those  circumstances if someone had the notional incomes taken  from his incapacity benefit but never benefited from the  pension because he died before the age of 65. That is the  aspect that I want the Minister to deal with.     <P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is  saying, but the decision to defer payment of a pension is  made by the beneficiary. If he is entitled to receive the  pension at the age of 60 and chooses to defer it to a later  date, he will receive a higher pension. That decision faces  anyone who has a choice of date on which to start  receiving a pension. The point of the notional income  rule it has existed in social security legislation for a long  time is to deal with a situation in which someone  chooses to put off receiving a pension simply to maximise  the amount of money that he or she receives from the  social security system. There would be no question of  someone being forced to call in a pension earlier and,  therefore, at a lower rate, if they had a legitimate  expectation of receiving income from the pension at the  age of 65 and that was the basis on which they planned  their finances. We have no intention of doing that under  the existing notional income rules, which were introduced  by a Conservative Government, or under the changes that  we are introducing to the rules in relation to incapacity  benefit. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) referred  to someone who defers a pension with a variable date  for commencement of payment for example, sometime  between the ages of 60 and 65. If, at the age of 60,  someone decides to exercise his legitimate choice to  receive the pension at 65 and subsequently becomes  incapacitated at 62, the notional income rule will not  apply because no pension income will become available.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs  (Mr. Flight) made some interesting points, but, as he is  not in the Room, I shall pass over them because they were  reflected in points raised by his hon. Friends.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does the Minister accept that it is  impossible for the Government to distinguish between  those people who deliberately defer payment of their  pension to maximise incapacity benefit and those who  would have deferred it anyway, perhaps because annuity  rates are low?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to the existing  notional income rules, which distinguish between personal  pensions and occupational pensions. It is easier to deal  with occupational pensions because most of them have a  defined date on which the benefit will be paid. Normally,  the date is fixed but there may be flexibility in some cases.  The notional income rule would apply only when there  was flexibility and when it appeared to the Department  of Social Security that someone had decided to create an  entitlement to social security payments that he would not  otherwise have had.     
<P>
The rule for personal pensions is much simpler. They  involve a fund of money that is used to buy an annuity  that will provide an income stream on retirement. An  occupational pension involves a more elaborate contract  between the member of a pension scheme and the pension  trustees. Payments are made according to certain rules and  against a guarantee that the member will receive a certain  income stream, which is normally related to final salary,  on retirement.  
<P>
Personal pensions involve a real kitty of money, and  the individual decides when to turn it into an annuity.  The hon. Members for Arundel and South Downs and for  Grantham and Stamford discussed the general principle  that the later a pension is turned into an annuity, the  higher the weekly rate. We also need to consider when it  is best to buy an annuity.  
<P>
Personal pensions involve both real money and  flexibility. The notional income rules that the  Conservative Government operated for many years they  introduced them in relation to personal pensions set a  specified date at which the social security system would  regard it as appropriate to take pension income into  account, namely, at the age of 60. Unlike a policeman, for  example, whose pension could, in certain circumstances,  be paid before he reached 60, someone with a personal  pension has an absolute guarantee that his pension will  not be taken into account before he reaches that age. The  rules state that the pension will be taken into account at  that age. That does not require the person to cash in his  kitty of money to buy an annuity at that point. He may  decide, perhaps after receiving financial advice, that it  would be better to defer. The relevant legislation makes  it clear that that is the point at which a personal pension  kicks in, and the same rules apply to incapacity benefit.  
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): In relation to the case  that I raised on Tuesday, the Under-Secretary stated that  if someone does not take his pension and becomes  incapacitated, the pension will not be payable and will not  count under the rules. I imagine that there are schemes  under which it is open to the member of a scheme to take  the pension at any time between the ages of 60 and 65.  Would it count in this context?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The Government are keen to preserve all  the legitimate choices that the public currently have. No  one would seek to prevent a person who can legitimately  take his pension at a certain time from doing so. Most  schemes set a particular date for retirement. If the scheme  has infinite flexibility personal pensions do the  notional income rules will be relevant.  
<P>
We shall not require people who have a legitimate  choice and who have saved in a pension scheme, on the  expectation that they would draw a pension at a certain  age, to forego those benefits. No exceptional steps are  required to take the pension into account at an earlier date.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked  how the notional income will be calculated. The simple  answer is that it will be calculated according to the rules  that currently apply to those benefits that require notional  income to be calculated. He also asked whether a  deduction would be based on an actuarial calculation or  set a penal level. I can reassure the Committee that the  rules will take account of income that would have been  available to claimants if they had put their pension into  payment. In making that calculation, my Department will  seek the best available evidence from the claimant and, if  necessary, from other sources. Where a claimant believes  that an unreasonable calculation has been made, he or she  will have the right of appeal.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Under-Secretary used the ambiguous  phrase, "take account of"	. One could take account of the  actuarial calculation but add a penal rate to it. Is he saying  that no such penal addition will be made to the actuarial  calculation?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I am not being difficult, but I would like  the hon. Gentleman to elaborate on his comments. The  Government intend to take account of income that would  be available if the pension were put into payment at that  point. People have the right not to put their pension into  payment. Where a person takes such a decision, which  may be taken for entirely legitimate reasons, we shall not  attempt to load on an additional penalty. However, I may  have missed the hon. Gentleman's point.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If the Under-Secretary is assuring me that  the Government will make the actuarial calculation on the  basis of the amount of money that a person would have  received if he had taken the pension, that is a clearer and  better answer than the alternative. Of course, the  consequences of that answer are the ones that I set out  when I posed the question.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I am given to understand that, in broad  terms, that is the Government's intention. Clearly, I  cannot comment on a particular calculation. People use  many different financial instruments to provide for their  retirement. Certainly, we do not intend to load on an  additional percentage for the extraneous purpose of  nuisance value.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that  the Government's proposal to apply an offset against  pensions in incapacity benefit was not comparable to the  situation pertaining to jobseeker's allowance. If I  understand him correctly, he said that the application to  JSA is confined to the first six months of unemployment,  when contributory jobseeker's allowance is paid. That is  not correct. After six months, 100 per cent. of a pension,  not 50 per cent. is taken into account. There is no  disregard of £50.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not know whether the  Under-Secretary is trying to confuse the Committee, or  whether he is himself confused. After six months, all  unemployment benefits are in any case means tested. All  income is taken into account when calculating  entitlement. The only relevant comparison that he could  possibly make would be between the contributory  incapacity benefit and the contributory jobseeker's  allowance, which, by definition, is paid only during the  first six months. That is the only period in which people  have a national insurance entitlement to a benefit that, in  normal circumstances, ought not to be means tested. The  Under-Secretary is trying to introduce into incapacity  benefit the version of partial means testing against  pensions that exists for jobseeker's allowance. The  analogy is inappropriate and cruel, but it is his analogy.  He is comparing contributory jobseeker's allowance,  which is available for six months, with incapacity benefit.  National insurance benefit, which is a contributory  benefit, is paid for the period of incapacity, which may  be for life.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bayley:</b> I am not trying to mislead the Committee,  and I am sure that that is not the hon. Gentleman's  intention. let me make it clear what proportion of a  pension would be taken into account in respect of each  claim. Under the existing rules for jobseeker's allowance,  a person who becomes unemployed but who is not  incapacitated from work would have a disregard of £50  for a pension that he was receiving and would lose  100 per cent. of all pension payments in excess of £50  during the first six months of the claim. Under the rules  for non-contributory jobseeker's allowance, a claimant  would not have a disregard of £50 after six months. As  the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, his  party changed the rules and made jobseeker's allowance  a means-tested benefit after six months.  <P>
<P>
When someone becomes unemployed and there is no  incapacity, there is a £50 disregard and 100 per cent. loss  of income thereafter for the first six months. After six  months, there is 100 per cent. loss of all pension income.  Our change to incapacity benefit will allow a £50  disregard for as long as someone receives incapacity  benefit. It will remove not 100 per cent. of the income  in addition to that £50, which will be removed from the  incapacity benefit, but 50 per cent. The notional income  rule would apply to both the first six months and the  subsequent period of jobseeker's allowance. We propose  that it should also apply to incapacity benefit.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am afraid that we are in danger of  wasting our time. We all understand that the Government  are trying to extend the notional income regime that  applies to contributory jobseeker's allowance to  incapacity benefit. We believe that the analogy between  the two benefits is inappropriate and vicious. Both are  national insurance contributory benefits. What happens  after someone has received jobseeker's allowance for six  months is neither here nor there. That is a means-tested  benefit, not a national insurance benefit. It is irrelevant.  
<P>
There is a major difference between a disabled person  and an unemployed person. It is astonishingly insensitive  of the Government not to understand that. I stand by my  point that a beneficiary of incapacity benefit may suffer a  financial loss, possibly involving a substantial multiple.  People may be on incapacity benefit for the rest of their  working lives until retirement. The amount of benefit that  is clawed back from contributory jobseeker's allowance  must be limited to six months. People can lose only a few  hundred pounds. Means testing of incapacity benefit will  result in people losing tens of thousands of pounds over  the rest of their working lives.     
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be brief.  That was a bit long.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and  Stamford is sadly mistaken if he believes that a person  who loses his job close to retirement will easily get back  to work. I hope that the Government's measures to extend  new deal initiatives to older people will make it easier for  someone in those circumstances to find work, but we do  not have a magic wand.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The opportunity lost to the individual is  within the six-month period. It cannot be longer than that  because, after six months, the jobseeker's allowance is  100 per cent. means-tested, as the Under-Secretary knows.  An income of £179 a week is a lot of money about  £8,000, according to previous calculations. Losing £8,000  a year for several years is equivalent to losing several tens  of thousands of pounds. It would not be possible to lose  such an amount as a result of the application of the  notional income rule and partial means-testing to a  maximum of six months of contributory jobseeker's  allowance. It is extraordinary that the Under-Secretary has  not grasped that I cannot believe that he is so obtuse.  I am also afraid that he may be trying to bamboozle the  Committee rather than dealing with my questions  precisely.  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Order. I have already ruled on the  length of interventions. The Committee should also  recognise that the amendments under discussion are  narrow they do not relate to jobseeker's allowance.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and  Stamford told the Committee that what happens after six  months is irrelevant. People who are out of work and  facing living on a pension or benefit   
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is an irrelevant comparison.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> It is relevant. How the notional income  rule applies is extremely relevant. The rules that were  introduced for people who are nearing retirement and out  of work but not incapacitated are a great deal harsher than  those under discussion today.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This has been a technical debate. I want to  establish the ground rules in simple terms, so that people  can understand what it is about. Am I right in saying that  as soon as an individual's combined income from  incapacity benefit and a personal pension reaches £6,071  a year, he starts to lose incapacity benefit? Furthermore,  when that income reaches £9,537 per annum equivalent  to half of the national average male earnings of £21,252,  and a very small income you will lose incapacity benefit  entirely. Are those the facts?  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, I am not losing  anything I know that it is tiresome. Secondly, I have  already warned the Committee that the amendments are  narrow and the debate is now going much too wide.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Member for Gainsborough is  I believe referring to the House of Commons Library  calculations, according to which people who are entitled  to the long-term rate of incapacity benefit would lose all  entitlement to IB when their weekly income reached £179.  That is almost correct. It was correct when the document  was produced by the Library, but the April upratings mean  that the figure is now slightly higher at £183.50.  
<P>
However, it would be wrong, to say that that will apply  to all people in all circumstances. Rates of incapacity  benefit vary for a number of reasons, such as age and  dependency additions. For some people in the early stages  of their claim without additions entitlement to IB  could be fully extinguished at a lower figure. There will  not be many such people, but there will be some. For  somebody who receives the maximum additions, the  figure is merely £16,000. The figure mentioned by the  hon. Member for Gainsborough has increased slightly as  a result of the April upratings, but that figure does not  apply to every person in every circumstance.     
<P>
I shall respond to the six technical questions that were  asked by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford  about pensions calculations. He asked when the notional  income rule would be applied. Will the pension that will  be available be calculated in terms of a single person or  a couple? The answer is that it will depend on the person's  circumstances and on whether he is a single person or part  of a couple. The notional income rules will use the best  possible calculation of the pension that will actually be  available if the person sought payment of it.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> That is appalling. A wife, for  example, might be considerably younger than her husband  and have her own earnings. To include her in the joint  annuity calculation would vastly reduce the value of the  annuity because of the different life expectancies that are  involved. On the other hand, that would not be a sensible  use of the family's resources because she was younger  and had her own earning and pension prospects. A  married person might therefore have good reasons for  preferring to take a single annuity. The notional income  test would artificially impose a different choice on the  couple. The Under-Secretary has given an appalling  answer.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> In my reply I was thinking about an  occupational pension, which often includes a spouse's  pension. I have already said that the Government do not  intend to constrain in any way the legitimate choices that  people can make about their pension.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made an  interesting point. I would not want to impose requirements  on someone who had legitimately planned to convert an  annuity for his or her, but not for his or her spouse's,  benefit. I shall examine the matter and write to him  about it.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the annuity would  take account of inflation or whether it would be a  fixed-rate annuity. Again, the answer depends on what the  individual has bought into and on the nature of the  pension scheme. If a personal pension was used to buy an  annuity, any legitimate choice that a person made would  be acceptable.  
<P>
The notional income rule will be applied in cases in  which someone defers a pension that otherwise would  have been paid on the grounds that taking the pension  would extinguish his right to a social security benefit. The  rule will not require people to make choices that they  would not normally be expected to make.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I fear that the Under-Secretary is  answering a question that I did not ask, and he is therefore  likely to be in trouble with you, Mr. McWilliam, and  with me.  
<P>
I accept that making a legitimate choice will discharge  the obligation that the clause will impose on an individual  to take a personal or occupational pension when one is  available, but that does not answer my question. I asked  what would happen if a person declined that choice and  did not take the pension when he otherwise might have  done. How will the notional income that is used to means  test that persons's IB be calculated? Will the notional  income be premised on the assumption of a joint or single  annuity, on an indexed annuity or on whether or not a  25 per cent. lump sum had been taken? We need to know  how the notional income will be calculated.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman referred  to the clear, legitimate choices that a person has about  converting his savings in a personal pension fund into an  income stream. The notional income rule will take  account of the income that will be available if someone  takes his pension at the normal age. For a personal  pension, that is deemed in statute to be 60, and for an  occupational pension, it will depend on the date on which  the pension matures under the pension scheme rules.  
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked  about the position in relation to a lump sum. Again, it will  depend on the rules of the scheme. The hon. Gentleman  casts his eyes to the ceiling, but it does depend on the  rules of the scheme. If the scheme allows for a lump sum,  no one is going to say that the person must forgo it. He  will have saved on that basis and he should be able to  take his pension on that basis. I have already referred to  the ages involved it will be 60 for a personal pension  and the normal age of payment for other pension schemes.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman seemed to be angry that the  notional income rule would not be applied to SERPS. The  reason for that is simple: SERPS comes into payment at  the normal pension age. There is no doubt about when it  comes into payment and no opportunity to play about with  the date, so the position is clear.     
<P>
The amendments would remove the power in the Bill  to assume a notional income when a claimant deliberately  fails to avail himself of a pension payment with the  intention of increasing or maximising his benefit.  
<P>
The power to assume a notional income is a  long-standing feature that runs right across the social  security system. It is there to prevent abuse of the benefit  system where people deliberately deprive themselves of  income in order to qualify for benefits or increase the  amount of their benefit.  
<P>
I recognise that concern has been expressed that this  measure could force people to take their pensions early.  That is not our intention. We do not want to interfere with  the choices that people are entitled to make about when  to take their pension and how much to take in the form  of a lump sum, but we need to have the power to deal  with situations if someone acts unreasonably to maximise  his benefit income.  
<P>
The details will all be in regulations and we shall be  able to look at specific concerns when we are framing  those. We intend to base the incapacity benefit rules on  those that currently apply to the income-related benefits  and contribution-based jobseeker's allowance, which were  introduced by the Opposition when they were in  government.  
<P>
Under those regulations, people under the age of 60  with a personal pension are exempted from the effects of  the notional income rules. This recognises that flexibility  is an essential feature of these pension schemes. A  claimant who is over 60 would be expected to take up his  pension if he had not already done so. This does not seem  unreasonable in striking a balance between individual  choice and the need to prevent abuse of the benefits  system.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> May I return to the intervention that I  made just before the end of Tuesday's sitting? Does the  Government's proposal imply that people over 60 will not  go back into work? I thought that the point of the  Government's thesis was that even those who had some  incapacity should be given every opportunity to go back  into work. The Government now say that when someone  is over 60, he is not expected to get back into work.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> That is not what the Government are  saying. The hon. Gentleman makes a pertinent point, as  there are some variations to the benefits system that  reflect and acknowledge the fact that for men over 60, the  opportunity of getting back into a job is far less than for  younger men, but it is certainly not the Government's  intention to write people off to a life on benefits at the  age of 60. The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood  the reason why the Government have introduced a point  at 60 at which the notional income rule will come into  operation for personal pensions only. In some ways, there  is a measure of protection that is not available to people  on occupational pensions, because there is a guarantee  that the notional income rule will not apply to people with  personal pensions before the age of 60.  
<P>
A date has been set in relation to personal pensions  because, rather than contracts, they are savings funds in  which a series of pension contributions are converted at a  specific age into pensions paid according to fixed rules.  Therefore, the Government have to stipulate an age at  which they come into operation, which is why the age of  60 is specified in the existing notional income rules on  personal pensions. We need to specify an age.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> In practice, does that not mean that those  who have such a personal pension will, when they get to  60, be more or less forced to take it otherwise it will be  included against their incapacity benefit anyway? Once  they have taken it, there will be a discouragement to go  back to work, as they will earn less if they have a  pension as well, they will be taxed at a higher rate, and  so on. The Government are giving them a disincentive to  go back to work by forcing them to take the pension that  they have paid.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> All individuals must make choices in  relation to their own circumstances. If people believe that  they will be out of work, with no alternative, from the age  of 60 to 65, many will exercise the option to put their  personal pension into payment from the age of 60, albeit  in the knowledge that it will yield less per week than if  they had put it into payment at the age of 65. Others will  believe that their period of unemployment will be fairly  brief and will decide not to put their pension into  payment. That choice will depend on individual  circumstances.  
<P>
In the case of occupational pensions, the notional  income rules can in theory apply at any age. However,  in such circumstances it is usually the trustees or  administrators of a scheme who decide whether an  occupational pension will be paid early. That has to be  done in accordance with the rules of the scheme and the  Inland Revenue guidelines. In practice, the amount of  choice that the individual has is limited, so the provision  is unlikely to affect people.  
<P>
Of course, we are in favour of allowing people to take  their pensions more easily. Proposals for new flexibilities  on when occupational pensions can be taken have been  the subject of consultation by the Inland Revenue and  were set out in the pensions Green Paper. When the  flexibilities are introduced, we will need to consider again  the rules for benefits that currently take account of  notional income and the future rules for incapacity  benefit.  
<P>
The notional income rules are of long standing and, to  the best of our knowledge, have not caused any significant  problems in practice, either with occupational pensions,  where as I explained their impact is limited, or with  personal pensions, where they apply from age 60 only.  
<P>
I assure the Committee that when the incapacity benefit  regulations are introduced, we will give full consideration  to any concerns about how the rules may affect people in  certain circumstances. For the present, we are discussing  the need for a power to make regulations to prevent abuse  of the social security system. The amendment would  remove our ability to prevent such abuse and I urge the  Committee to reject it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am afraid to say that the  Minister's performance has been thoroughly  unsatisfactory this morning. It is clear that the  Government are shambolic and incompetent and that he  did not even know the answers to the questions that I  asked him.  
<P>
The Minister ended by making another complete  howler by pretending that the position for occupational  pension scheme members is analogous in the cases of  unemployment and disability. Occupational pension  schemes make no provision for people simply to take their  pension early on the grounds of unemployment. There is  always a minimum age at which they can be taken. Many  occupational pension schemes include provision under  Inland Revenue rules for people to take an immediate  pension at any age if they become disabled, but not if they  simply become unemployed. So the position of someone  who claims contributory jobseeker's allowance is not  analogous to that of someone who claims contributory  incapacity benefit.  
<P>
The second point on which the Under-Secretary went  wrong is that, although it is true that trustees have limited  powers to give people early pensions if they become  disabled, they are limited by Inland Revenue rules and  the rules of the schemes and under no circumstances will  trustees give someone an early pension unless an  application is made to them. The potential beneficiaries  must apply and say, "I am now disabled. Here are my  medical reports. Please pay me an early pension."	 That  can be done at any age. The rules of such a scheme must  correspond to the Inland Revenue's rules, otherwise it  would not have approved the scheme.  
<P>
It is wrong of the Under-Secretary to say that trustees  have limited powers and, therefore, the problem does not  arise. Of course, the problem arises. The individual has a  choice: he either makes an application to the trustees for  the early payment of pension on the grounds of disability,  or he does not. In a sense, he has exactly the same choice  in occupational pension and personal pension contexts. It  is extraordinary that the Under-Secretary should portray  his ignorance of such matters, but I am afraid that he has  done so.  
<P>
All the questions that I have asked have been on  notional income. The amendment deals with whether the  Government should be given the power to impose a  notional income rule. Clearly, we could not possibly  responsibly give the Government that power because they  do not know how it would be applied. The Committee  knows no more about that than it did an hour ago. It does  not know whether or not the 25 per cent. lump sum will  be taken into account in the calculation of the notional  income. It does not know whether the annuity rate will be  applied to the calculation. It is not known whether the  annuity calculation will involve the imposition of a  notional income, nor whether it will be an indexed  annuity. The Under-Secretary has not told us perhaps he  will now.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a mountain  out of a molehill. Is he aware of a single case in which  the notional income rules applied to JSA have created any  of the problems that he alleges might happen? I assure  him that we simply intend to apply parallel notional  income rules to those that already exist.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Under-Secretary is now confessing  his complete ignorance. If he knew the answers to my  precise questions, he would tell us. Perhaps the  Department of Social Security has foreseen such matters  and made some plans accordingly, but he has not had the  nous to ask questions about them or the Department has  not told him or perhaps the whole bureaucracy has not  yet focused on these important matters and no answer is  available in the whole Department.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> rose   
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Under-Secretary has received a  message, so perhaps he can now answer my questions.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I have answered the hon. Gentleman's  questions fully and frankly. I return to the question that I  asked him to answer fully and frankly. Notional income  rules are already laid down in regulations. We shall  introduce parallel regulations under the clause. Is the hon.  Gentleman aware of any case in which the difficulties that  he mentioned have occurred under the existing rules? If  he is, he should tell us and we could consider introducing  different rules. If he is not, he should sit down so that we  can move on to other matters.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have already said that an appropriate  analogy cannot be drawn between contributory JSA and  incapacity benefit. I will not go back over that. If I were  to do so, I would be accused of repetition and we could  lose the chance to hold a clause stand part debate. That  debate is becoming more important every second, as we  see the confusion that the Government are in. I shall refer  to notional incomes the subject of the amendment.  Ministers cannot possibly tell the Committee that they  want to impose notional, income-based means tests  without defining how that notional income will be  calculated. We have heard no definition and no precise  answers to the precise and pertinent questions that I have  asked the Minister, who has once again been trying to  throw sand in our eyes. He has said constantly this  morning that the Government will accept any reasonable  decision that someone makes about the basis on which  that person takes his pension. That is not the point. Of  course we need to know in what circumstances the  notional income rule will be applied and it is reassuring  to know that someone who makes what the Minister calls  a "reasonable choice"	 about the formula under which he  draws down his pension will have his incapacity benefit  set off against that pension income and that no attempt  will be made to say that he should have made an  alternative choice in terms of, for example, indexation or  of joint or single annuities. We have established that, but  that does not begin to answer my question about how  notional income will be calculated if someone declines to  draw down their pension in advance.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?  
<P>
<H5>11.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</b> I must finish my point before I give way,  but of course I shall do so; I always have and always  will in these Committee sittings, subject to your approval,  Mr. McWilliam.  <P>
<P>
We must be clear about that point. Before Parliament  gives the Government the power to make a notional  income calculation, we need to know the formula on  which it will be based. The notional income stream will  differ depending on whether the pension is indexed and  whether 25 per cent. is abstracted before the calculation.  All the points that I have made this morning are just as  relevant as they were when I made them the first time  round, but they are now of searing political significance,  because the Government are trying to take a power from  the House and do not know or at least will not tell  Parliament how they propose to exercise it.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The debate is becoming  seriously repetitive. Unless the Committee sorts itself out  shortly, I shall have to ask the hon. Member for Grantham  and Stamford to resume his seat.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Well, Mr. McWilliam   
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I shall stay strictly within the terms of the  amendment, which relates to the rules on notional income.  I have asked the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford  a question twice. I do so a third time and hope that he  will reply. I have done him the courtesy of replying to his  questions; he may not like the answers, but I have done  so. We intend to apply to incapacity benefit rules on  notional income that are analogous to the rules that  already exist in the social security system that the  Conservative party introduced. They will be the same  rules. Is he aware of any problems that those rules have  created? If so, he should tell the Committee so that the  Government can consider them when drafting the  regulations. If not, perhaps we should move on to the  wider issues that the clause raises.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Mr. McWilliam, you have put me in an  extremely difficult position, because I must do nothing to  risk our opportunity for a clause stand part debate. I must  observe to the letter your strictures and must not repeat  myself. I am afraid that I have already dealt with the  Minister's question about the extent to which an analogy  exists between contributory jobseeker's allowance and  contributory incapacity benefit.  
<P>
I believe that you will consider this a fair point to make,  Mr. McWilliam, in the context of the amendment, without  the slightest repetition. Every time that a Government ask  the House for a notional income power which is a penal  power to impose on the citizen that power must be  justified in the case in which it will be applied and  Parliament is entitled to know the details of its  application. The Government have not told us the details.  
<P>
The Minister is thrashing around, desperately trying to  find a way of hiding the fact that he does not know the  answers to my questions. We have not received an answer  about the 25 per cent. lump sum or indexation. We are  now witnessing the extraordinary affront of a Minister of  the Crown asking the Opposition to tell the Committee  how a power that the Government propose to take should  work. That is inconceivable. It shows that we have a  thoroughly incompetent Government. It is important that  we have the opportunity to vote on the amendment. It  would be irresponsible for Parliament to confer this power  on a Government who are in such confusion about the  meaning of it.     
<P>
If I am not following the correct formal procedure  to secure my obvious purpose, I hope that you,  Mr. McWilliam, or the Clerk will tell me. It is crucial  because the Opposition set great store on being able to  vote on amendment No. 88. I must draw that to the  Committee's attention and formally do so.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> We moved this narrow amendment on  Tuesday in order to establish the Government's intentions.  The Minister has admitted his fear that, to avoid the  impact of what is going to happen to incapacity benefit,  some individuals will want to defer their pensions. The  Government do not want that to happen and they are  introducing these measures to prevent it. That is clear, but  the Minister has not made clear exactly how the provision  will work in detail.  
<P>
I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments.  I remain confused about why he persists with the  argument that because of what is happening to JSA, the  principle is not being broken or changed. He was  persistently questioned by the hon. Member for Grantham  and Stamford on that point. The difference seems to be  that JSA is a six-month benefit: what individuals do about  deferral in relation to a six-month impact is clearly  different.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman, too, misunderstands  the point. The notional income rule is applied to anyone  on long-term JSA, whether contributory or  non-contributory. That has happened for some years and,  as far as I am aware, it has caused none of the difficulties  mentioned by the hon. Member for Grantham and  Stamford. The point about application to a six-month  period is a red herring. The notional income rule applies  to the whole period in which JSA is paid five years or  longer.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Oaten:</B> Individuals' perception of how their  pension will be affected over a long time will make them  change their pension habits in a way that has not  necessarily happened with respect to JSA in the past.  People's concern about the unfairness will make them  rethink their pension plans. That is our worry about the  impact of the clause. The Minister is wrong if he believes  that individuals will not decide to defer; on the contrary,  in these circumstances, some individuals will decide that  they have to take their pension early. It narrows down  options and people are likely to rethink their habits.  
<P>
We are not convinced by the Minister and we believe  that the provision could lead to an administrative  nightmare. We shall thus press the amendment to a  Division.

<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 193, in page  50, line 33, leave out  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`exceeds such limit as is specified' and insert `is greater than the  sum of £50 together with the sum available in means tested benefits,  entitlement being as if no savings were held, and for the sum of £50  to be uprated annually in line with the general increase in prices'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following  amendments: No. 194, in page 50, line 44, at end insert   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) Where the pension payments exceed that outlined in section  (2)(a) for the specified amount to be no greater than 30 per cent. of  the excess.'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 195, in page 51, line 10, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`subject to that specified amount being no greater than 30 per cent.  of the excess.'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> We are about to consider some important  principles. The previous clause dealt with changes to the  contributions principle. The amendments get to the heart  of the consequences of a form of means-testing, which the  clause introduces. We considered that briefly when we  discussed the previous amendment. Are the Government  sure that a form of means-testing is the right way in which  to proceed? The Government's thought process is  illogical.  
<P>
Time and again, Ministers talk about the need to  encourage people to be responsible and self reliant, and  to save.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It has just come to my attention  that the count for the Division on amendment No. 141  was wrong. The ayes were 2 and the noes were 13. It does  not matter, because an education Minister is not replying  to the debate.  
<P>
Secondly, I have been unfair to the hon. Member for  Winchester because the bell is about to ring. Therefore, it  may be convenient to adjourn.  
<P>
It being half-past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman  adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant  to the Standing Order.  
<P>
Adjourned till this day at half-past Two o'clock.
