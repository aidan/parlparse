<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 44, line 38, leave out '21' and insert '35'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 59, in page 44, leave out line 39 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'relevant election is held, or, in respect of expenditure incurred under Part II of Schedule 7, the date on which the expenditure was incurred.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 84, in page 44, line 40, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
No. 58, in page 44, line 41, leave out '30' and insert '42'.
<P>
No. 85, in page 45, line 1, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
No. 96, page 45, leave out lines 3 and 4.
<P>
No. 93, in page 45, line 3, after 'makes', insert 'without reasonable excuse'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I aplogise to the Committee both for my shortness of breath and for the delay to our proceedings.
<P>
The amendments would ensure that those who have to make returns must surmount a realistic set of hurdles before they are deemed to have committed an offence. They should be taken in the context not only of subsections (1) and (2), but of subsection (3), which says that a person commits an offence if he fails to fulfil the requirements set out in subsections (1) and (2). The first requirement relates to the length of time before an item of expenditure is notified to the party treasurer and the second to the period of time before a claim must be settled. The Government have tabled an amendment that deals with one of those points, and which to some extent makes my case for me.
<P>
The amendments seek to differentiate between the different circumstances in which returns are required. The first is where campaign expenditure has been incurred at a national level as part of the run-up to an election and the second is national campaign expenditure that has been incurred during an election period. I have sought to differentiate between the timetable of the first and the second, so that during an election period national reporting phases in with the reporting of local expenditure.
<P>
In any case, the 12-day notification followed by 30 days seems exceptionally short, bearing in mind that failure to submit an expense in that period leads to an automatic offence. That offence can be relieved, but only by going to the High Court or a county court. Therefore, if somebody is on holiday, a cheque goes astray in the post or an invoice or receipt is mislaid, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) has said, it is not simply a question of phoning somebody up and saying, "Send another one", the clock is ticking away on an extremely short timescale. I accept, the Minister's point that one would expect there to be a difference in scale and efficiency between the treasurer of a major national party and poor old Mrs. Brown doing her best in a local election campaign. Even so--and again I draw on the words of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield--not all national parties have huge substance and professionalism. I think that it was the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) who suggested that the Liberal Democrats might be running the average primary school. I said that it might be nearer to a secondary school.
<P>
I do not make this plea on behalf of the national treasurer of the Liberal Democrat party in regard to dealing with matters once they have come to his or her attention, but the information supplied may sometimes not be of the highest quality, nor may the time in which it is submitted be sufficient. Even the most centrally directed, authoritarian and efficient party must sometimes pass messages down the line to tell people to buck up and make an effort. In the middle of an election campaign that could easily absorb 21 days, or at least the time left when one realises that 21 days have nearly expired.
<P>
As the penalty for misreporting is as severe as the penalty for not reporting at all, there is no way out of the problem. A national treasurer who received a report that a certain part of the campaign had cost £1,000 might ask for the invoice and receive the reply, "It's all right. I've got the invoice in front of me. It is only for £920." He would then have to say, "That's not good enough. Send it in. "He could not say, "We could put £1,000 in the return and we would know we were covered", as submitting an inaccurate return is just as much an offence as putting in no return.
<P>
Therefore, we need some breathing space for these things to be worked through properly in the ordinary course of events in a national campaign outside of an election period. Even if the Parliamentary Secretary is not inclined to accept that argument, which I believe is strong, I hope that he will bear in mind that, during an election campaign, the timetable would not be in synchronisation with the timetable of local or general election constituency campaign returns.
<P>
During an election there is not only a national campaign, when the expenditure requirements set out in the clause are operational, but also a general election campaign with many local constituency parties taking part in elections. Again it depends on how the party incurs expenditure, but I draw the Committee's attention again to the wise words of the hon. Member for Battersea. He said that in North Dorset there could be posters saying, "Vote Walker" in the local election campaign and posters that say "Vote Conservative" in the national campaign. Depending on the parties' procedures, they may be paid for separately, or by settling a bill that has to be apportioned. If there are two timetables for reporting that expenditure, the national treasurer's task will become almost impossible. One might think, other things being equal, that the national party would have longer to put its act together than the local party, but, as the timetable is set out in the clause, the national party has less time than the local party agent, and he or she is even more remote from the action than those at the local level, so there seems to be something wrong there. The Government's amendment may go some way towards acknowledging that there is a problem, but the problem must be dealt with specifically.
<P>
Subsection (1) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the period of 21 days beginning with the date on which the expenditure was incurred"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and subsection (2) states that the 30 days begins with the date mentioned in subsection (1). It seems that the 30 days runs from the date on which the expenditure was incurred. It is not an additional 30 days from the time when the information reached the treasurer. I do not think that I am misreading that. My amendments make some effort to deal with that problem.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. The 30 days runs from the date on which the expenditure was incurred and his amendment No. 58 would extend the period to 42 days. He has recognised the Govemment's amendment and is pushing an open door.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for his intervention, which, apart from anything else, saved me some breath.
<P>
The parliamentary draftsmen created the problem and provoked the amendment, partly because they are not fully aware of the hurly-burly of national and local campaigns and how they work, and partly because of subsection (3), which makes it an absolute offence not to report, to be late or to be inaccurate. There is no leeway. I attempted to draft an amendment to subsections (3) and (4) so that, provided the amount submitted was inclusive of the final invoice, a submission within the timetable but not strictly accurate would be acceptable. In other words, if the branch secretary telephoned and said, "Oh yes; the submission is behind the clock, but I've got it here. It's for £980", it would be acceptable for the treasurer to write in £1,000 and to say that the late invoice would be submitted to show that the amont had not been exceeded. The Minister may have shared my problem in drafting an amendment to meet that case.
<P>
The Minister said that I am pushing an open door, but it may become jammed. Perhaps he will consider drafting an amendment so that, provided no attempt has been made to conceal what has been going on and a full submission is made, the reference to the High Court, county court and so on can be put on one side. Otherwise, treasurers will be in real jeopardy because they will be damned if they do, damned if they do not and damned if they make their best estimate. That puts them in a very difficult position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): The Minister will realise from the number of amendments that have been tabled that the clause is problematic. Having read it several times with the associated clause 71, I am left with the gravest doubts about its propriety. I shall deal with that when we come to clause stand part, but it is only fair to inform the Minister of that at the outset.
<P>
Clause 70 up sets out to interfere with contractual relationships. We have heard how, at the previous general election, my party succeeded in spending £28 million--how it did that beats me--and the Labour party spent £26 million. Some of that will have been spent on staff salaries and so on, but 1 suspect that the bulk was spent on commercial contracts with organisations that were not affiliated to the party but simply made money from the bonanza offered by a general election.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 70 places a series of fetters and restrictions on the ability of parties involved in campaign expenditure to make, conclude and then sue under or obtain benefit on a contract. It is a serious infringement of what would normally be described as private rights. My concern is directed not so much at the political parties, although I am concerned about them, but at the poor commercial enterprises that supply the services.
<P>
Let us consider the clause in detail. It may seem innocuous, but it states that a claim for payment will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not be payable if the claim is not sent, together with the relevant invoice,"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
within 21 days. We live in the real world. Some businesses send their invoices within 21 days, but we all know from our experience of being invoiced for services that it is often more than 21 days before an invoice is received. Perhaps such people should not be involved in commercial activities; perhaps they are not acting in their own best interests; they may have trouble with their paperwork if they do not have someone to do it and they are too busy to settle down and deal with it. Those people will be under an obligation to submit their invoices within 21 days if they wish to be paid. The clause is unreasonable in principle and, as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) said, the time allowed is much too short.
<P>
I am mindful that the Minister will explain the background principles and I understand that we do not want the payment of invoices and claims that may arise on them to take so long that a party cannot make a full return on its campaign expenditure.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Or collusion, if there is evasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I note that and I should be interested to know whether the Minister believes that there will be many instances of collusion. I simply do not know. My experience is that most tradesmen who supply services to parties during general election campaigns want to be paid if they incur substantial expenditure. 1 would expect them to demand payment in a normal commercial way. We have often discussed that in the House when considering the charging of interest on the late payment of invoices. The Minister may recollect that at other times in the House, hon. Members who operate in commerce have said that some businesses survive only by delaying the payment of invoices. There is a long tradition of invoices being a mechanism for obtaining payment, but it is certainly not always followed absolutely and immediately by the writing of a cheque. 253 254 The Minister may argue that a political party should write the cheque at once, but I return to my original comment that, in my experience, invoices are frequently not sent out within 21 days.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove suggests that the correct figure would be 35 days. That would be a considerable improvement in terms of allowing a business sufficient time in which to issue its invoices. How does the Minister intend to ensure that small tradesmen--or, as will sometimes be the case, large commercial organisations--know that if they do not submit their invoice within 21 or 35 days they will never be paid or will be paid only after reference to the courts? As the Minister knows, all resorts to litigation are costly, add to overheads and, in this case, would be likely to make some people reluctant to supply services to political parties. Amendment No. 55 would at least improve the current situation. I shall decide whether that is sufficient when I listen to the Minister's reply.
<P>
If the provision is extended to 35 days, will that be too long a period in terms of the compliance that the Minister wishes to achieve for the rapid rendering of invoices and their payment? If extending the period to 35 days would negate the whole thrust of the clause, that calls into question whether the clause is required or, if it is required, whether we should be approaching the issue in a completely different way.
<P>
Amendment No. 59, which was also tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, would change the claim period so that it started on the date on which the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"relevant election is held, or, in respect of expenditure incurred under Part II of Schedule 7, the date on which the expenditure was incurred."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, he is trying to ensure that payment would have to be made on the date on which the expenditure was incurred, rather than the date on which the contract was made, in which case the invoice may have been rendered in advance. That appears to be sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendment would create two categories for dealing with expenditure--first, during an election period, in which case the time would run from the date of the election, not from the date on which the expenditure was incurred; and, secondly, during a national campaign outside an election period, in which case the time would run from the date of incurring the expenditure, as the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his clarification. That would mean that in some circumstances the period would fall to be less than 35 days if it started with the date on which the election was called.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Language is always important in Bills and amendments. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that the amendment uses the words "election is held", which means that the days would start from election day--as is the case with the return of election expenses, among other matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That was my original understanding, which is why I commended the amendment to the Minister as a sensible proposal. However, it could mean that an invoice need not be rendered until 35 days after the date of an election, followed by the period in which payment can be made. It will be interesting to hear from the Minister how his officials view that in terms of satisfying the Neill committee's objective of ensuring rapid payment of invoices so as to allow people to know exactly how much a party has spent during an election campaign.
<P>
We have to be realistic about the clause. It will act as a fetter on what are ultimately private contractual relationships, and I am anxious about that.
<P>
Amendment No. 84, which was tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) and myself, would leave out subsection (2). I am mindful of what the Minister has already indicated, by nods and interventions, about the aims of the clause. Rendering the invoice in time will place  an onerous requirement on the contractor--that is, the person supplying the services. However, I am almost as worried about the impact on a political party of paying an invoice in the required period if a dispute has arisen.
<P>
Without wishing to stray too far, I have to touch briefly on clause 71, which allows a claim to be disputed. That is somewhat ponderous. As clause 71 allows one to dispute a claim, why is clause 70(2) necessary? If a disputed claim will have to be accepted by the Electoral Commission and cannot be taken into account until a much later date, why make a positive requirement that payment must be made within a 30-day period? Clause 71 would become unnecessary if clause 70 could be reworked to require payment within 30 days unless there is a dispute. That would be simpler.
<P>
I recognise that the Minister wants to prevent collusion. However, collusion does not strike me as being particularly likely. It will not happen if the invoice has to be rendered in the first place, because the existence of the invoice will indicate a possible debt, which will add to the total expenditure incurred by the party in the course of the election. A straightforward way of dealing with the matter would be to say, "You have to declare the invoices that you receive within a particular period from the date of the election." The invoices would then be registered by the Electoral Commission. However, if one chooses not to pay the invoices because a dispute has arisen, that is entirely one's own business. What mischief is the Minister trying to prevent?
<P>
Although I hope that it would not happen to my party, some parties exist in a state of chronic indebtedness, the extent of which depends partly on the backers who are prepared to bankroll the party. The bankers of most of the main parties seem to think that they are a reasonably good bet in terms of advancing money. I do not know what the Labour party's position is nowadays, but my party has a substantial outstanding bank loan. However, the Morecambe Bay Independents may not be in that happy position. During election campaigns, parties sometimes spend more than they have in their coffers. That is one of the realities of life.
<P>
Under the clause, a party that cannot pay an invoice within 30 days, and which is not involved in a dispute, will not be allowed to pay it other than by going through the ponderous process of applying to the High Court, a county court or the Court of Session in Scotland. We seem to be moving away from the real world.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has considered a further aspect, which I would describe as commercial blackmail. A supplier involved in a dispute over payment will be able to say to a small party that, if it does not settle, it will end up in the High Court. The provision will drastically accelerate the process of settling disputes by enabling them to be taken to the High Court after a very short interval.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. The Government are straying into individual private commercial relationships--an area into which Governments should be reluctant to go.
<P>
As a professional man, I try always to pay my bills on time. I have also experienced the other side of late payment. About three months ago, I was paid for some work that I did as a barrister in 1991, so I have some sympathy for those who invoice me, and I do my best to satisfy them rapidly.
<P>
We are straying into a world of commercial relationships in which, as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove rightly says, there are all manner of subtle pressures and methods of dispute. For example, as the Minister realises, unscrupulous contractors may submit invoices that are too high, which creates many problems for small organisations. The clause adopts a clinical approach, and will deal with such problems by enabling cases to be taken quickly to the High Court. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove rightly says, many a small organisation finds that a terrifying prospect.
<P>
My anxieties remain. We could, and perhaps should, consider getting rid of subsection (2) entirely. The requirement to render the invoice would be retained, thereby establishing to the Election Commission's satisfaction the level of possible debt incurred by a party during an election. Excessive expenditure that could not be justified by any commercial dispute would rapidly be brought to the attention of the Election Commission. However, my doubts remain, and that is why we tabled amendment No. 84.
<P>
I shall not speak at length about what the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said about amendment No. 58, which would extend the time frame, rather than delete the subsection. I prefer the approach taken in our amendment. Will the Parliamentary Secretary explain how he thinks amendment No. 58 would work? If a period of 35 days were followed by one of 42 days, how would the Election Commission's ability to assess campaign expenditure be affected? Clearly, that issue must be considered carefully in deciding whether to withdraw the amendments or press them to a vote.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said, subsection (3) will introduce a series of draconian penalties. During this morning's debate, we have heard much about the penalty clauses that are peppered throughout the Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary knows that I and other members of the Opposition are concerned about the introduction of a series of criminal clauses. Indeed, some disquiet has been expressed even by supporters of the Government. The criminal clause is particularly onerous because it is absolute. If an invoice arrives on Mrs. Brown's desk at the Morecambe Bay Independents the day after the specified period ends, and if her perhaps understandable reaction is to say, "Oh dear!" and to pay Mr. Bloggins down the road for paper that was used during the election campaign she will have committed a criminal act, however innocent her intention to honour the commercial agreement. I find it slightly shocking that a mechanism is being introduced that will prevent people from concluding commercial agreements. In small communities and smaller political parties, one person may depend on receiving payment from another.
<P>
Unless everybody is fully cognisant at the outset of the extraordinary fashion in which the legislation will interfere with individual commercial rights, some people will be distressed and disappointed to be told, "You can't pay", or, "If I pay you, I will be committing a criminal offence."

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): My hon. Friend refers to the Morecambe Bay Independents, but the problem will also arise in respect of our national political parties. Let us take the example of a party official who, during a campaign, contracts a Morecambe business to provide a hotel room for the party leader as part of national expenditure. That poor hotelier may not have read the legislation and may not realise that, if he does not submit an invoice within a certain time, he will not be paid. National parties will be affected as much as small local parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I have tended to concentrate on small parties, and I would not wish to suggest that my party does not run its affairs and manage its commercial contracts with great efficiency. We should remember that only three parties are represented in this Room. I do not know the likely number of registered parties--
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> There are more than 100.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Indeed. Some of those parties will be completely unknown to us, yet they will be subject to the regulations. If we adopt a patronising attitude, and disregard their problems simply because they will not affect us, we do a great disservice to the cause of democracy in this country. Nevertheless, I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset that some of these issues may impinge on major political parties as well.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 85, 96 and 93 offer differing approaches to the problem. As I have said, the first solution is to leave out subsection (3), which, on the whole, I prefer. If payment is made, where should the offence lie? What is wrong with not creating a criminal offence? I think that the Parliamentary Secretary envisages a circumstance where a payment is made that proves to be more than a party is allowed to spend--I see him nodding gently in agreement. Such a circumstance could be dealt with by the Election Commission, but should not the proper remedy involve a financial method 257 258 which the party has to repay that sum, or double that sum? Preventing the payment from being made is too draconian.
<P>
Amendment No. 96 would delete paragraph (b). If the amendment were agreed to, it would be an offence to pay a claim that by virtue of subsection (1) was not payable, but it would no longer be an offence to make a payment in respect of a claim after the end of the period that is defined in subsection (2). I hope that the Minister agrees that a proper distinction is involved. In the first case, one might say, "You have committed a criminal offence if you make a payment that was not submitted to your treasurer or deputy treasurer, if proper accounting methods were not used or if the payment was not submitted to you within a set period." However, we do not want to treat payments that are made outside the 30-day or 42-day period--or whichever period is prescribed--as a criminal offence.
<P>
That approach has some merit. One might become involved in a dispute, but 10 or 40 days later one might suddenly realise that the other side had a good point. I come across such cases all the time in my civil litigation work. My client might think, "We had better settle the case as quickly as possible. The other side is entitled to the money," and pay up. However, the Bill's drafting will not allow people to do that--it will be a criminal offence--unless application is made to the courts. Speaking personally--I still practise at the Bar--anything that raises the prospect of lawyers' involvement is beneficial to me and my colleagues. One of the great accusations is that life is complicated by the arrival of lawyers. The moment that the High Court or county courts become involved, some of my more robust colleagues in the House--including some, but probably not many, of my hon. Friends--might comment, "Pigs to the trough." That approach would also add enormously to the bureaucracy that will be involved and to the anxieties that will result.
<P>
What about the poor old party treasurer who is involved in this business? When the Bill is enacted, few positions will be less desirable than that of the treasurer of a national political party, especially of a small one--although being a Trappist monk might be an exception. The amendment therefore proposes deleting paragraph (b).
<P>
Amendment No. 93 is the last and, the Parliamentary Secretary might agree, the most reasonable of this group of amendments. Adding the words "without reasonable excuse" to the clause would convert an absolute offence into one in relation to which a person could say, "I owed the money, but I didn't realise that the invoice had arrived a day late. When I realise that it had, I decided that the proper thing to do was to pay it. I had forgotten about the regulations. Besides, I couldn't lay my hands on the 750-page booklet that the Government produced for the benefit of political parties." I assume that the Government will produce some kind of booklet for political parties--
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That will be done by the Electoral Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Indeed. If it is not done, there will be a serious risk that many people will commit offences through ignorance of the law, which is, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, no excuse. However, if large numbers of people are ignorant of the law, the law is brought into disrepute. The amendment would allow people to use such an argument in their defence.
<P>
Would introducing a reasonable excuse provision in relation to a matter that is as simple and straightforward as this one make the clause unworkable? That is a difficult issue, and the Parliamentary Secretary may want to seek his officials' advice. Courts up and down the land may have to consider complex issues when they decide whether people should be prosecuted. I believe that civil liberties are important. People with criminal convictions may be prevented from becoming the treasurer of a party. People who will be prosecuted under these provisions will be fined and, unlike a speeding offence, such prosecutions will carry a considerable stigma and may prevent small parties from operating thereafter. Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that a reasonable excuse clause should be inserted?
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that I have confined my argument strictly to the amendments. As I said, I want to return to the relevant broader principles during the clause stand part debate. Meanwhile, I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I shall refer to the amendments collectively because they deal with a specific problem in the clause, to which we shall return during the clause stand part debate.
<P>
The provisions relating to time limits appear to have been drafted by someone who has no experience of the political world, of the way in which campaigns are run, even by the most efficient political parties, or of the commercial world--not all business men are so efficient that they submit invoices within 21 days and secure payment from creditors within 30 days.
<P>
This morning, I revisited chapter 10 of the Neill report to establish whether Neill had any thoughts or recommendations on 21-day or 30-day limits, and I found some references to legislation and corrupt practices. I do not regard someone who submits or pays an invoice late as being guilty of anything that might be described as a corrupt practice. However, in chapter 10 of the Neill report, which deals with campaign expenditure, I found a classic quotation:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Not only could it be said that corrupt practices had increased, but the expenditure incurred at the last Election was excessive. The expenditure was not only detrimental to the public interest by deterring persons who would have been excellent representatives of constituencies in the House of Commons from standing for election, but also had the effect of accustoming those engaged in elections to consider that an election was simply an affair of money, and thus leading to corrupt practices."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That comment related to the 1883 general election. I am more concerned about the commercial consequences of the clause, which would be corrected by our amendments and, to some extent, by those that were tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove.
<P>
What effect will the time limit have? Let me describe one scenario. Let us suppose that a company had not submitted an invoice within the required period and that a political party had not paid an invoice within that period. In relation to subsection (3), which amendment No. 85 would delete, the treasurer of that party could say, "I am sorry, I would be committing an offence if I paid your invoice" and the company could respond, "That's all right. Regard it as a donation." That company might not have had shareholder approval for the donation, so it would be caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. Does it pursue its case for payment, or do risk being accused at the next shareholders' meeting of making a donation without shareholder approval? That situation could arise when the clauses on corporate donation in the Bill come into effect, as we believe they should. We shall debate those clauses fully in due course.
<P>
The provisions on time limits will leave people in an impossible situation. They do not reflect the real world. As I said when I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, the real world contains small traders who contract with large, national, political parties, such as the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Those small traders may not be efficient enough for their systems to ensure that in every case their branches in the west of Cornwall or the north of Scotland, which contract to provide services to Millbank or Smith square, are computerised and have done all the necessary paperwork, sent it to head office, produced an invoice and received payment within the prescribed period.
<P>
The clause is unworkable, which is why we tabled the amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has already spoken to amendment No. 84, so I shall not detain the Committee for long on that issue. That amendment would delete subsection (2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any claim sent in accordance with subsection (1) shall be paid within the period of 30 days beginning with the date mentioned in that subsection."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That will be unworkable because it is impossible to impose a time limit within which a payment must be made. The treasurers of large and small political parties would really have to get their act together, to get the systems moving.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would have been asking a considerable amount even of the ultra-efficient treasurer of the Conservative party to approve and pay every invoice to the tune of £28 million within four weeks, without slip-up, hesitation or deviation during the previous general election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a point. Many invoices from companies large and small, up and down the country, would have been coming in to Smith square. Some may have been sent to the wrong address or to our regional offices; they would then have had to be forwarded to the national office. I accept his point that even we, in our efficient way, might have difficulty making sure that all are paid within the prescribed period--I was going to say "paid on time", but even the small trader, although he might be a little annoyed if he had not been paid within 30 days, would not expect that an offence had been committed. Clearly, that would be nonsense.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary referred earlier to the fact that there are 100 registered political parties in this country. Will the treasurers of all those registered political parties who, through the grandfathering clauses in the Bill will be registered for at least six months under the new regime, be able to pay bills with such efficiency? The House of Commons Library kindly provided me with a list of all registered political parties. Will the treasurer of the Alternative Labour List be able to make sure that any expenditure incurred in the north of Scotland is paid within the period? Will the treasurer of the East Cleveland Independent party be similarly efficicent? I suppose he would have a list of local traders, whose invoices could be submitted fairly quickly. He could probably pop round if they had not been submitted. An organisation such as the Legalise Cannabis Alliance might not be able to pop round--
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): Pot round.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Indeed, even pot round--to ensure that invoices are in and paid on time. That is impractical, and we would not want it in our legislation.
<P>
Amendment No. 85 relates to subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person commits an offence if he pays any claim".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is it desirable to introduce an offence of someone paying a legitimate claim for goods and services provided? It could lead to the trader not being paid and he would then be extremely aggrieved. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, who is more learned in legal matters, would probably suggest that the trader might seek redress in the courts for not having been paid. On one side, the treasurer of the party would be saying, "I cannot pay this m'lud, because I would be committing an offence", while on the other side, the trader would be saying, "Yes, but you bought these goods from me, and I want my money." That is nonsense. It will make the law an ass. I, therefore, suggest that the amendment, which would delete subsection (3), should be accepted.
<P>
While amendment No. 95 would deal with all payments, amendment No. 96 would specifically deal with payments after the end of the period. Again the man is committing an offence by not meeting his obligations on behalf of the party. Amendment No. 93 suggests that the words "without reasonable excuse" should be inserted into subsection (3)(b) as a let-out. If the Government were not willing to accept our earlier amendments simply to delete subsections (2) and (3), they should at least allow the treasurer a reasonable excuse for committing the offence. A reasonable excuse is that a small trader in a remote part of the land sent his invoice to the wrong place, the treasurer discovered that it had gone to the wrong department in the party, it arrived on his desk on day 31, after which he submitted his return, he was not necessarily aware--
<P>
10 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I did not want to interrupt my hon. Friend, but it would also be a reasonable excuse if, 261 262 although the invoice was rendered out of time, the party knew, first, that it was due and payable and, secondly, that, if it was not paid at once, the trader would go into liquidation in the period between the date on which the payment could be made and the date on which the first High Court hearing could be obtained to get leave.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. We, as as political parties, could thus become responsible for companies that got into severe political difficulties. It is not unreasonable to suggest that political parties might contract with traders, which because they had a particular expertise, would find that a substantial part of their turnover was contracted to one party. If they then fell foul of the provisions of the Bill, they could be driven out of business. That might happen and because the money did not exist--the party would already have budgeted for it in its campaign expenditures declared in its return to the Electoral Commission as a piece of campaign expenditure--but because of the timing of the payment. We are simply arguing about the technicality of when a invoice arrives on a treasurer's desk and when the treasurer wrote the cheque. It is nonsense that the Bill should create this commercial chaos. As I said, it is not that the party does not have the money, that it has not contracted for these services or that it has been corrupt in not putting the expenditure into the return to the Electoral Commission; it is simply that somebody has screwed up in delivering an invoice or paying a cheque. That is intolerable.
<P>
Another scenario might arise. The local branch of a public company might contract with a political party to supply it with a commercial service that had legitimately been ordered by a treasurer or deputy treasurer and authorised by the party. Somebody in the local branch, who was not an avid reader of Hansard or of Acts of Parliament, might not realise that he or she had to get the invoice in quickly.
<P>
Invoices would normally be submitted at the end of the month. Let us say that the order was contracted on the first of the month. It happened to be a 31-day month, so the invoice did not go off until the 31st. It was sent to the local office of the Labour party, which was not the right address. The treasurer realised that the invoice was not for them but for Millbank, so he stuck it in an envelope with a second-class stamp on it and sent it off to Millbank. When it reached Millbank, nobody was sure what it was, because Millbank's return had already been submitted to the Electoral Commission. Millbank thought, "We can't pay this. It's out of time. We will commit an offence if we pay it." Let us assume that the company was the Co-operative Retail Services and that it had supplied the service to the Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Davidson </B>(Glasgow, Pollok): I assure the hon. Gentleman that not only would the Co-operative Retail Services know the law on these matters, but it would certainly not supply material to the Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am intrigued by what the hon. Gentleman says. I must disabuse him on this matter. I have bought items from the local Co-op in political campaigns on behalf of political parties. I have paid for them at the check-out and submitted a receipt, so they were duly recorded. However, it is not inconceivable that a company, which would otherwise find this embarrassing or illegal, could be deemed to have made a donation to a political party simply by falling foul of the provisions.
<P>
A lawyer in the High Court, who encounters the treasurer saying, "I can't pay you because I am committing an offence," and the company saying, "But we can't give it to you, because we don't have shareholder approval to make a donation to your political party," will say, "Who's right here, or are they both wrong?" If the company says, "We don't have shareholder approval," does the company that submitted the invoice late have a legitimate claim in the county court against the political party for non-payment of an invoice? The invoice was submitted according to normal commercial practice, but a court looking at commercial matters would say, "The Bill may be the will of Parliament, but it is unreasonable in a commercial transaction." The commercial transaction stands and somebody has to pay. If the company is not willing to back off and say, "We will not demand payment, because that would mean that we are making a donation to the political party," the law, if the Bill is unamended, would be proved to be an ass. The Bill would be so unworkable that I suspect that judges would do the equivalent of tearing their hair out--take their wigs off, as one Labour Member suggested.
<P>
We shall return to the thrust and basis of the clause when we reach the stand part debate. The amendments that we have tabled, and that tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, are entirely reasonable, and I hope that they will be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The Committee got off to a breathless start. What started as a sprint up the stairs has become something of a marathon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): It could get worse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> There are dark forces on the other side of the Room. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)--the Whip--and I are always keen to discuss timetables. I confess that I have been somewhat surprised by the strength of feeling on the matter, and by the arguments that have been deployed. During the early part of the debate, I had some sympathy with some of the points made. As the discussion has continued, however, my heart has hardened. I fear that I may not be able to satisfy the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the amendments seriously, even if he feels that they may be golden nuggets in the wider conglomerate. We are in danger of making a mistake and creating a Bill that does not work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am always keen to look at golden nuggets, even if they are in the wider conglomerate. What is the rest of the conglomerate? At the moment, it looks like a field of mud--[Interruption.] I can hear my hon. Friends describing it as other things. However, I am keen to explore the issues raised.
<P>
Before I discuss the details of the amendments, I want to draw attention to two points. The first, which was made by the hon. Members for Beaconsfield and for North Dorset, was that the mechanics of the Bill will not work in the real world of commercial practice. A supplier should, in principle--the practice may be different--supply an invoice as quickly as possible. Invoices often come with the goods. Clearly, prompt payment--as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield recognised, despite his difficulties--is also good commercial practice. I remind the Committee that other parties have introduced legislation on late payment of bills. It is a good aspiration, and we should recognise the need for good commercial practice. The argument is about whether the strictures of this part of the Bill are workable or too difficult.
<P>
That brings me to my second point. I am always interested when hon. Members say that officials do not understand the real world, and that they are detached from the hurly-burly of politics, or the feel of a Committee Room during the action of a general election campaign. I must scold members of the Committee a little as I remind them that the exact provisions--the exact timetable--contained in section 78 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 are contained in this part of the Bill.
<P>
Invoices have to be made available within 21 days and paid within 30 days. That has not proved impossible. Looking back over the record, I can find few, if any, court cases on the matter. Those of us who operate in the real world, and the officials who have devised this legislation, can see that it has been made to work. That is why my sympathy for the case put forward by the Opposition has run out. Section 78 of the RPA has existed since 1983; it has caused few real problems.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister. Obviously, it is right to scold us when we are wrong. However, the RPA sets the timetable from the date of the election, not from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the date on which the expenditure was incurred."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Later, I hope to demonstrate that that is a rather dodgy phrase in relation to this provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The argument also works the other way. I hear hon. Members talk about the hurly-burly of the three, four or six-week period of an election campaign; here, we are talking about a campaign period of 365 days for political parties at a general election, and four months for an election in the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly. The pressure, therefore, will not be great.
<P>
I am reminded that the Representation of the People Act 1983 consolidates the 1883 Act. This legislation has been around for a long time. I have listened carefully to what hon. Members have said, and I will reflect on it and try to pick out the nuggets of gold. However, I must be blunt: I cannot see that the difficulties raised in Committee exist in reality.
<P>
In support, the hon. Member for North Dorset quoted from the Neill report. Let me draw his attention to paragraphs 10.114 to 10.120 of the report, in which the sanctions in the RPA were examined. The draft Bill containing the sanctions that we are now discussing was sent to the Neill committee; we received no response. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove said that we need to erect a "realistic" set of hurdles. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield also talked about being realistic. I believe that the provisions are realistic.
<P>
As the hon. Member for North Dorset said, people will have to get their act together. They will have to make plans and be aware of the provisions, to ensure that the systems that political parties put in place can cope with them. They have coped with them, through the Representation of the People Act 1983, at a local level. We have discussed that level on many occasions and parties have handled matters at that level in 650 constituencies. I find it inconceivable that a national party could not handle the Bill's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary says that the proposal reproduces provisions in the Representation of the People Act 1983. I was puzzled by Lord Neill's comments in this context. In relation to deadlines, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In certain circumstances a candidate or his election agent may apply to the court for relief when there has been a failure to deliver the return or a declaration or in respect of an error or false statement ... The circumstances include ill-health, inadvertence or other reasonable cause. Want of good faith defeats the application."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take that to involve exemption from criminal sanctions. Where is that proposal in the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> We shall come later to matters of defence. The hon. Gentleman has been taxed by that issue in this context and on previous occasions, but he is a fair man and he will agree that the Bill contains defence provisions. The proposal will work in terms of good commercial practice and in relation to current legislation. Political parties will have to adapt and systems will have to be applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): As my hon. Friend said, the Bill will set high standards for 365 days a year. The fact that political parties will set such high standards will be welcomed by many small traders up and down the country who regularly complain to their constituency Members about difficulties in obtaining past payments from businesses with which they deal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend reinforces a point that I made in passing earlier. Political parties have responded to small businesses' need to have prompt payment by introducing legislation. He rightly said that that approach involves good commercial practice.
<P>
This group of amendments falls into two parts: that which deals with timing and payment schedules and that which deals with criminal offences. I shall discuss them in turn.
<P>
I inform the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that I shall agree to amendment No. 58, which will extend the payment period from 30 to 42 days. He made a fair point when he suggested that a longer period could be used during a longer campaign. Government amendment No. 83, which we shall discuss later, deals with that matter. We shall introduce another amendment on the Floor of the House to bring harmony to the Bill. The hon. Gentleman did the Committee a service by tabling the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 84 would remove restrictions on the period during which payments could be made, but the key issue is that it would create scope for abuse. Suppliers of goods or services will be required to be prompt in submitting an invoice, but there is no logic in not making an equivalent requirement in respect of payment. I am sure that that will not satisfy Opposition Members. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield has expressed the view that we should pray in aid the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
<P>
Amendment No. 59 is a more interesting amendment. It picks up on a modification of the 1983 Act arrangements which has been incorporated into clause 70. The clause provides that the relevant date for determining the period within which claims must be submitted and paid is not the date of the election, but the date on which the expenditure was incurred.
<P>
There is a simple reason for that. In the case of a candidate's election expenditure, the expenses in question will normally be incurred in a period of only four to six weeks before the election. However, in the case of expenditure by a national party--on a poster campaign, for example--the expenses may be incurred a year or more in advance of an election. It therefore makes sense to focus on when the expenditure is incurred, rather than the date of the election. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove knows, the 1983 Act operates from the date of the election being called. There is no such provision during a longer campaign, and therefore the only milestone from which to begin to measure is the date on which the expenditure takes place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The intention, and I hope the meaning, of the amendment is that expenditure under part I, which relates to expenditure within an election period, would have the election day as its relevant date, but expenditure under part II would be exactly as he has described, in other words, the amendment is intended to ensure that national campaign expenditure that takes place during a local election period would be connected to that timetable, but the preceding expenditure would be as the Minister has described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman. However, he and other hon. Members have pursued the need for simplicity because this part of the Bill is too onerous and rigorous, and the amendment would complicate matters.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 55 and 58 deal with the period within which claims must be submitted and paid. The provisions of clause 70 follow those of the 1983 Act, except that a claim must be paid within 30 days of the relevant date, rather than the 28 days required by the Act.
<P>
Despite what members of the Committee have said, I can see no difficulty with the 21-day period for the submission of claims. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) pointed out, there has been a long and persistent campaign in favour of quicker payment. It is good business practice to submit a claim within 21 days. If a party received a claim on the 21st day after the expenditure was incurred, that would allow only nine days for payment, as I said to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove in connection with amendment No. 58. The hon. Gentleman has made a fair point, which has prompted the Government to table an amendment. We shall also need to amend clause 108(2) on Report to bring matters into line.
<P>
The hon. Members for Beaconsfield and for North Dorset have talked about the criminal sanctions in this part of the Bill, and I expect them to pursue that theme further. I understand their concerns, and have no difficulty in agreeing that defences should be included in the Bill as safeguards.
<P>
However, the issue is straightforward. The treasurer will be required to make a payment within a fixed time limit, which is within his control. I have thought about the matter and I cannot see why a defence is needed. The treasurer is faced with the bill, which he must pay. The issue of a defence does not arise. There must be a criminal sanction.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's point. He will remember that I read to him a paragraph of the Neill report that deals with the working of the RPA, in which I claim no great expertise. He replied that other provisions in the RPA provide general defences. Where in the clause are provisions that will have a bearing similar to the RPA? I have been unable to find them, but that may be my fault.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right: the clause contains no defence. There are defence clauses elsewhere in the Bill because we believe that, in certain respects, a get-out should be provided for the treasurer and others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for that clarification, which puts a slightly different complexion on what he said earlier. Are the provisions identical to those in the RPA? If so, why did Lord Neill say in paragraph 10.119 of the report that there is a relief from criminal sanctions on the grounds of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ill-heath, inadvertence or other reasonable cause"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those grounds do not appear in this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I do not want to avoid the hon. Gentleman's questions, but we are moving on to technical ground. We are discussing provisions that can be found throughout the Bill, and the way in which they relate to the RPA. I have noted his concerns and I shall write to him on the matter. The provisions in the Neill report that he mentioned relate to the candidate's return, not the payment of the bill, although I realise that that answer may not entirely satisfy him.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked how the clause mirrors the RPA. As I understand it, section 78(3) of the 1983 Act, on which it draws, does not provide a defence. There is no defence in that part of the 1983 Act and there is no defence in this part of the Bill. I shall re-examine the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman, but the bottom line is that the making of a payment within a fixed time limit is within the control of the treasurer or his deputy. He has the bill and he must pay it. There is no conceivable way in which to defend his not paying it.
<P>
At the outset, I said that I was surprised at the strength of feeling on this point and the various arguments that have been advanced. However, I am inclined to agree with amendment No. 58, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. It would bring the rest of the Bill into line, but other changes to payment and the time period are unnecessary. The provisions have worked in practice and I see no reason to change them.
<P>
On the issue of criminal sanctions, again, as I said, this part of the Bill reflects the RPA, which has worked in the past, I know that this issue will continue to exercise members of the Committee and I suspect that I have not satisfied them on this point. They may want to divide on it and to return to it on Report.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for accepting amendment No. 58. I hoped that he would stick with his first thoughts on amendment No. 55, but I appreciate what he said.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary has done a great deal to reassure me about the intention behind this measure. Extending the period from 30 to 42 days here and elsewhere in the Bill will give some flexibility. I try to be careful about the company that I keep in the Committee, as elsewhere, and I would not want it to be thought that I necessarily agree with all the arguments deployed by those on the Labour Benches in this debate. However, we need provisions that work not only for the major parties but for other parties, too.
<P>
We have heard this morning that over 100 parties are already registered. We know from Neill that only two of those 100 exceeded the newly suggested statutory limits, to which we shall come in due course. It is probable that 15 to 20 of those parties ran a national campaign. In the European elections, that was about the number that claimed to be running national campaigns. Therefore, the rules apply not just to the two at the capping limit but to between 15 and 20 parties that will run national campaigns and be a long way short of the limit. It is worth recognising that the likelihood of parties transgressing is inversely proportional to the likelihood of their reaching the cap. What concerns me is not whether the Labour party or the Conservative party messes up its invoices and has to make a claim, but whether a much smaller national party such as the Green party, which will be millions of pounds short of any limit imposed by the Bill, could fall foul of the provision on a technicality.
<P>
I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that the Government intend to make the provision parallel to the provisions for elections for a particular candidate. I accept his point that it has proved possible for parties to accommodate that and for the business community that they trade with to accept it, but I still have some worries about the way in which that might happen.
<P>
Amendment No. 59, which the Parliamentary Secretary is not inclined to accept, relates to the situation in an election as opposed to outside it. It is intended to achieve, and I hope it is clear that it does, separation into two different regimes--one outside the election period, which would remain as the Parliamentary Secretary intended, and the other in the election period, which would be a period of grace for a national party such as the green party. Such a party will know that it will be millions of pounds short of a capping limit, and during an election period any headquarters staff that it has will be devoted to ensuring that the campaign runs. They will not be devoted to checking up which invoices have come that day, whether they are within 21 days of the expenditure being incurred and whether they have been paid in a further period, now somewhat extended. That becomes a little more difficult when one considers the meaning of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the date on which the expenditure was incurred"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not have any detailed knowledge of the Green party, but I would not be surprised if it hired a few sound systems for a week or two. If it did, was the expenditure incurred on the first day that it was used, the last day that it was used, the day that the invoice was received or the day that the contract was signed for supply in a month's time? Those issues can be sorted out--
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point. The man from whom the Green party was hiring the sound system might say, "I will send you the invoice when I know how many days you have had the system." The question then arises: when was sound system hired? Was it hired when the person knew how many days it would be hired for, or from the first day that it was operated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary could say that the Electoral Commission will make it all clear, and I would not object to that. If the code says, "The day on which the expenditure was incurred will be deemed to be such a day", that would be fine. If that day is at the end of such periods, that would be fine too. We could handle a proposal that the clock starts ticking on the last day of the hire. However, during a general election campaign--this is why my amendment stipulates a separate regime--the timetable for the invoice and payment for hire equipment is different than that for an individual candidate's expenses. I shall not go into what might happen when sound equipment is used partly in support of one candidate and partly to blast out somewhere else where there are no candidates making a general point about voting Green.
<P>
I am not talking about a national billboard campaign that is booked two years in advance--or whatever one has to do. Neither the Liberal Democrats nor the Green party enjoys the luxury of worrying about things like that. I am thinking about the practicalities during a general election campaign of small parties having to organise two different timetables for payment, validation, and so on. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials to have a second look at the complications that that would cause, together with the definitional points, which are not insuperable.
<P>
As I said at the start of our proceedings, it is not my intention, nor that of my hon. Friends, in any way to undermine or weaken the Bill--we want it to be enacted--but stipulating a number of technical breaches for parties that will not be within a million miles of the overall cap creates problems.
<P>
I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary has accepted amendment No. 58. 1 do not mind that he has not accepted amendment No. 55, because it would seem that, contrary to what I thought, the Representation of the People Act provides for the same timetable. However, I ask him to look again at amendment No. 59, because the issues that it raises bear further examination.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have had a long discussion on the amendments to clause 70, so I hope that we shall not repeat too much of what has gone before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I undertake not to repeat what has gone before, Mrs Michie. We must now consider whether the clause, as amended, is acceptable or whether we want to press it to a Division.
<P>
I want to raise with the Minister one central issue: criminal sanctions. I might have been able to raise it earlier, but I have only recently been able to peruse the Representation of the People Act 1983 in sufficient detail. The Minister said earlier that the issues were fairly simple and that if there was a failure, the criminal sanctions should bite. It is clear from the clause that the offences are absolute. I am not criticising the Minister, but there was some lack of clarity in the way in which he expressed that. No defence is provided and if the offence is committed, there is no question of reasonable excuse and, as the Committee knows, we have rejected the notion of reasonable excuse.
<P>
The argument is that the clause replicates provisions in the Representation of the People Act 1983. That was a surprise to me, because 1 did not know that the Act worked in that way. Having examined it, it is clear that it does not work in an identical way to that set out in clause 70. 1 shall explain briefly why that is and why I have fundamental objections to the clause standing part of the Bill.
<P>
The 1983 Act includes a number of important provisions and identifies illegal practices. If candidates or election agents carry out illegal practices, various draconian sanctions can be visited upon them. One of the sanctions on a barrister is to be reported to his Inn of Court and to be disbarred subsequently. I have always been lurkingly aware of the provision as I pursued my political career, because the sanctions go beyond those which non-lawyers may attract, and properly so. Section 86 of the Act provides that, notwithstanding all the requirements for declarations and payments similar to those identified by the Minister, when such a breach has occurred, penalties may be visited on the person who perpetrates it, including disqualification from holding office or standing as a candidate, and financial penalties. First, they are penalties and not criminal offences in the same way, although I accept that the distinction is blurred, but it becomes apparent when one considers that relief can be obtained from those penalties. Relief may be granted to a candidate in respect of a whole range of failures, In particular, under section 86 of the 1983 Act, it can be granted to a candidate,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in respect of any failure to transmit the return and declarations as to election expenses, or any part of them, or in respect of any error or false statement in them"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"application for relief may be made on the ground that the failure, error or false statement arose--by reason of the applicant's illness; or
<P>
where the applicant is the candidate, by reason of the absence, death, illness or misconduct of his election agent or sub-agent or of any clerk or officer of such agent; or
<P>
(c) where the applicant is the election agent, by reason of the death or illness of any prior election agent of the candidate, or of the absence, death, illness or misconduct of any sub-agent, clerk or officer of any election agent of the candidate; or
<P>
(d) by reason of inadvertence or any reasonable cause of a like nature, and not by reason of any want of good faith on the applicant's part."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To return to our earlier discussion, unless the Parliamentary Secretary tells me that I have misunderstood--although I used Lord Neill's references to the Representation of the People Act 1983--in relation to mistakes that the agent or candidate makes at election time, the possibility exists of relief by reason of inadvertence, or any reasonable cause of a like nature. That seems to be an eminently sensible provision. I accept that there is no direct marriage between the two, because one deals with electoral malpractice, while the other, in a more draconian way, deals with criminal offences. Nevertheless, the parallel between the two was used by the Parliamentary Secretary to justify the clause. Therefore, if we are trying to mirror the one provision with the other, there should be a prescription for a reasonable excuse to be provided. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is a reasonable man, and can reconsider the matter, but he has chosen to reject the amendment.
<P>
I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time. We have already discussed clause 70 at great length. However, nothing in the Bill's general provisions in relation to offences provides relief in such circumstances, or the opportunity to be exonerated by the court. No defence is made available. Unless the Parliamentary Secretary corrects me on that, a provision to allow and define a reasonable excuse should be inserted in clause 70. I think that he will agree with me on that.
<P>
That brings me back to the problem that was so well expressed by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove--we are introducing a series of penalties that have serious consequences for the person who incurs them, in terms of financial loss, loss of reputation, and the inability to act as a treasurer of a party. We are not providing a defence; we are creating an absolute offence. On that basis--and with regret, as I want to be co-operative--I urge the Committee to reject the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I will not repeat the arguments that I made when we were discussing amendments. However, this is a bad clause, for four reasons. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield pointed out, it criminalises simple actions to the financial detriment of others. That will result in conflict. People will commit offences by doing certain things that, in other circumstances might be considered reasonable. Not doing those things, because of the criminal sanction, will cause a considerable amount of financial harm to others. The Parliamentary Secretary, in summing up the debate on our amendments, suggested that many of the subsections are already replicated in the Representation of the People Act 1983 in regard to candidate expenses. That is all very well, but this provision relates to national campaign expenditure. If the invoice is late, it is not simply a matter of popping round the corner and saying "Look, Joe, you really should have got this invoice in. Otherwise, I shall not be in a position to pay it." Some of our smaller political parties may not be able to pop round the corner and ask for an invoice to be delivered, as orders are often placed with companies elsewhere.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the Parliamentary Secretary said earlier, there are some 100 registered political parties. We are not making law simply for the major political parties, which may be better organised. I suspect that some of the parties on the register are less well organised than we are about making their traders aware of the provisions of the Bill and getting their act together to have invoices delivered and have payments made. I know nothing--[Laughter.] I know nothing of the internal workings of the Official Monster Raving Loony party, other than that its headquarters is in a pub in Ashburton in Devon, where it also normally holds its annual conference. I am sure that the pub is registered as the party's office, but when one of its candidates elsewhere in the country contracts an expenditure on behalf of the party, as he must under the Bill, rather than on his own behalf, will the trader know that he has to deliver the invoice to the pub in Ashburton, whose name escapes me for the moment? The same will apply for the Pink Elephant party, the Tax-Avoid for the Self-Employed party and the Walked-over-Women party. I hope that the Walked-over-Women party will support my private Member's Bill, the Sex Discrimination (Amendment) Bill, which will be debated next Friday on the Floor of the House. I am concerned about the severe impact that the clause will have on the smaller parties.
<P>
The third point that gives me concern about the clause is the impact on smaller businesses if a trader has to submit an invoice within 21 days, beginning on the date on which the expenditure was incurred. That is a different requirement from the provision in the 273 274 Representation of the People Act. I hear the Parliamentary Secretary's argument that we are dealing here with campaign expenditure that might continue for 365 days, however smaller traders will be placed at a severe disadvantage. We have amended the clause so that payment must be made within 42 days. Again, that is not the same provision as that in the Representation of the People Act. The time allowed starts when the expenditure is incurred and not from the date of the election. In respect of a candidate's expenses, 30 days from the date of a general election could be seven weeks or more from the date on which the expenditure was initially incurred. The clause is onerous not on efficient, national businesses but on smaller businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am trying to follow the argument and I thought, at one point, that the hon. Gentleman may have been on to something. However, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield seems to have referred to the wrong section in the RPA. Section 78(4) of the 1983 Act seems virtually to be repeated in clause 70(4)(b) of the Bill. As the existing provision has worked perfectly well, even for small parties, during what he calls the hurly-burly of campaigns, why should it not work now for national parties?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point. I admit that I have not read in its entirety the section to which he refers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Can there be an hon. Member who has not read it in its entirety?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I have read it, but not committed it to memory. That I will do before we consider the Bill on Report.
<P>
There are two answers to the hon. Gentleman's point. First, it is normal for an election agent to pull all the pieces together at the end of a campaign. He would not do that every day during the campaign, but delay it until the end. That is common practice.
<P>
The more important point is that we are not dealing with a tightly controlled situation such as that of a candidate's expenditure during an election campaign. The measure deals with national expenditure, in which a party treasurer in one part of the country may place a contract with a trader in another part of the country. In those circumstances, it may be difficult to contact the trader to remind him to submit an invoice, or to remind him of time limits. We ought to consider a more flexible arrangement. I am not suggesting that we should not ensure that all campaign expenditure is paid within a reasonable period of time. In speaking against clause stand part, I suggest that it is unreasonable to impose criminal sanctions on the treasurers of smaller political parties.
<P>
My final point concerns the party treasurer who realises that he has a late invoice and says, "I cannot pay it", only to be told by the company that supplied the services that he must pay it because he has incurred the expenditure. The party treasurer says that he cannot commit a criminal offence, only to be told by an accountant with Bloggs and company, a public limited company: "You've got to pay it, otherwise we'll be in schtuck. If we give you those goods and services, we will have made a contribution to a political party, and we are not authorised to do that under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which specifically says that we have to seek shareholder approval beforehand." The clause creates a conflict that makes it untenable and unworkable, and I seriously advise the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The nub of the hon. Gentleman's concerns, and those of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, is the way in which the clause mirrors the Representation of the People Act 1983.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Let me make a substantive point. The hon. Gentleman described me as reasonable, for which I am grateful. He also said that he has been co-operative, as he has. By and large, there has not been a great deal of disagreement in the course of the Committee's proceedings. The disagreement in this case has arisen over how the Bill and the 1983 Act link together. The hon. Gentleman prayed in aid section 86 of the 1983 Act, which is headed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Authorised excuses for failures as to return and declarations."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister makes a valid point. However, I invite him to consider section 167 of the Act which, in my view, provides potential relief to a person who carries out the mischief that is covered by sections 76 and 78 --that is, paying a sum outside the period. The Bill provides no such relief for a just cause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to section 167. Of course I will consider the matter and write to him about it. If necessary, we will return to it on Report. I draw his attention to section 78 of the 1983 Act, which is headed:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Time for sending in and paying claims."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That section is the parallel provision to the part of the Bill that we are discussing. Section 78(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An election agent who pays a claim in contravention of subsection (1) or makes a payment in contravention of subsection (2) above shall be guilty of an illegal practice".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what I am praying in aid. The Act is parallel to the Bill at that point. Its provisions and those of the 1983 legislation link together and are workable. In the spirit of co-operation, if the hon. Gentleman reflects on section 78, especially subsection (3), he may conclude that the issue is not quite as clear cut as it may seem.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I accept that an attempt is being made to mirror the 1983 Act in terms of the Bill's detailed provisions on time. The Parliamentary Secretary has persuaded me on that issue, but I remain unpersuaded on the question of the lack of a reasonable defence. I accept that a criminal sanction is different from an illegal practice, but section 167(2)(b) of the RPA would allow a person who has paid a bill that should not have been paid to maintain that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The act or omission arose from inadvertence or from accidental miscalculation or from some other reasonable cause of a like nature, and in any case did not arise from any want of good faith."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My understanding is that that would provide relief from penalties. Clearly, penalties are different from a fine or a criminal sanction. However, if the purpose is to mirror the one with the other, it would be beneficial to include a reasonable excuse clause that is perhaps defined in the same way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Unlike the courts, the Committee is not paid by the minute--an arrangement with which the hon. Gentleman is familiar. I have said that I will look at section 167 of the RPA, and I will write to him on the matter, but I hope that the clause will remain part of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I will not take up much of the Committee's time on this clause, but it cannot pass without comment because it is clearly linked to clause 70. It provides a complex mechanism through which a disputed claim may be quarantined, as it were, and a return made.
<P>
I seek clarification on the clause because, if political parties may dispute claims in such a way as to avoid the clause's provisions, what is to prevent an unscrupulous party that wishes to muddy the waters of its election campaign expenditure from choosing to query many of the bills that it receives? The Parliamentary Secretary said that collusion was one of the mischiefs at which the proposals were aimed. No collusion is easier than for two willing parties to spin out legal proceedings. One criticism that the judiciary often makes is that members of the legal profession collude to spin out legal proceedings. Everyone dances around maypoles saying, "I consent to this or to that."
<P>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the two clauses together. It might be possible to escape the provisions of clause 70 by alleging that a claim was disputed. If there was such a let-out clause, it would be possible for a political party to dispute a claim unmeritoriously in order to spin out proceedings, and if there was collusion, it would be possible to spin them out for a very long time indeed. There is no way to decide whether a dispute is bona fide, especially if parties are colluding to extend the proceedings. Does not that drive a coach and horses through clause 70?
<P>
I conclude my remarks with that thought, and I await the Parliamentary Secretary's response with interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I wish to emphasise my hon. Friend's argument. Although we have ordered clause 70 to stand part of the Bill, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will comment on the fact that it involves the possibility of abuse.
<P>
Most of the major political parties do not spend on elections money that we have not got, but if we do, we negotiate adequate banking arrangements. The clause will allow an unscrupulous political party to spend money on its campaign and to dispute claims by saying that it does not have enough money to meet them. It would thereby avoid having to go to its bankers to ask for an overdraft to cover the outstanding money and it would not have to pay interest on a loan.
<P>
An extension of that form of abuse would involve an unscrupulous trader who supplied the goods. He could, in effect, make an interest-free loan to the party on the grounds that it did not have sufficient money at the time. The trader might say, "If we stick this claim for however much money into a bin and call it a disputed claim, we shall, until such time as the party has the money, carry on with the dispute and register it with the Electoral Commission. We shall not rush to court too soon. We shall spin out proceedings and eventually manage to grapple together the money in order to settle the claim."
<P>
I oppose the clause because of the abuses that it is likely to cause, but I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> This is an interesting point that parallels our previous discussion. The clause derives from section 79 of the 1983 Act. I remind Committee members of the genesis of that section. It is designed to protect registered political parties by safeguarding them against fraudulent claims that might be made against them and which might be politically motivated. If a political party made a fraudulent claim, it might appear that it had incurred greater campaign expenditure than it had done. Our proposals are designed to give succour to political parties rather than a potentiality--
