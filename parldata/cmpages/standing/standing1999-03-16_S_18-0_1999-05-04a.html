<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 825, in page 44, line 22, after `claim', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for protection on the basis'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 826, in page 44, line 24, leave out `Article 3 of'. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We have reached what is, in the eyes of many people, the most contentious part of the Bill. It deals with support for asylum seekers. The amendments start the ball rolling in a gentle way, and I hope that they will help the Government. They would extend the Secretary of State's powers to provide support to asylum seekers during the appeals process. 
<P>
The Bill attemps to simplify the appeals procedure into a one-stop appeals procedure and to incorporate into that the United Kingdom's obligations under the European convention on human rights. We have had those obligations for some time, but they have been given added force by the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998. 
<P>
When the Secretary of State considers whether to provide support to someone entering the appeals process, the amendments would ensure that he could provide it not only on the basis of article 3 of the European convention on human rights. That article enables people to appeal on the ground that they would be sent back to a country where they might be subject to torture or to inhuman and degrading treatment. We wish to extend the provision to include all the grounds that are covered in the convention. 
<P>
However, amendment No. 825 makes it clear that we are not referring to the general grounds that might be raised in a deportation case or those that deal with family circumstances or the querying of the decision of an entry clearance officer. The amendment refers specifically to ``protection'', and it is right that protection issues should be incorporated in the clause. 
<P>
Article 4 of the convention prohibits slavery and forced labour; article 5 is on the right to liberty and security; article 6 is on the right to a fair trial; and article 7 states that there should be no punishment without the law. All those articles provide legitimate grounds for an asylum claim. 
<P>
The Government's intention is that someone should be supported in those circumstances; they have already accepted that someone who claims that he might be tortured should have an appeal heard and that he should be supported for the duration of the appeal. Therefore, it would make perfect sense for the Secretary of State to have at least the discretion to award support to someone claiming under the other articles of the convention. 
<P>
If the Government do not accept the amendments, we fear that the Secretary of State might not have the discretion to provide support to someone who has a valid claim to appeal. The articles to which I have referred might be raised during the appeals process. At that point, the Secretary of State might need to consider a special adjudicator's recommendation or might wish to hear further representations. For example, it would be valid to raise the article on the prohibition of slavery and forced labour, and we all know that domestic workers in this country have faced many problems. The Secretary of State might rightly want to consider the issues further, but he will find himself without the discretion to offer support to someone appealing on those grounds. 
<P>
Although we shall have arguments later about the nature of the support being offered, we believe that the Government wish to provide some support while asylum and ECHR claims are being considered. The amendments would help the Government to achieve that objective and we hope that the Minister will accept them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I cannot accept the amendment. The Government are fully committed to proper protection of anyone fleeing from persecution. The insertion of article 3 of the convention into the definition of claims for asylum ensures that the small number of people falling outside the 1951 convention but within the scope of article 3, which states that no one should be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, are covered by the scheme. While we were framing that measure, we considered whether there was a need to extend protection to article 2 cases&#151;the right to life. However, we concluded that it would be unnecessary in practice. ECHR claims based on a threat to life are invariably analysed under article 3. 
<P>
The provisions already deal with people fleeing from persecution or from inhuman and degrading treatment. The amendment would make the support that can be offered under part VI of the Bill accessible to a far wider range of people&#151;for reasons very different from those that we normally associate with refugee status. It would allow claims for support to be made under article 8, raising all sorts of issues about family life, or under article 12, raising issues about rights to marry. That would result in a much broader definition of asylum, and would be open to exploitation by many people who could enter the country, make a variety of claims going far beyond refugee matters and thereby access the benefits system. 
<P>
Many people with ECHR claims are already here and have their own means of support, so it is unnecessary to extend this particular system of support to them. The amendment would also result in a significant increase in the cost of support. That is not the purpose of part VI so I cannot support the amendment. There is no positive duty under the ECHR to pay welfare support. 
<P>
Anyone who fears a breach of article 7 in their home state can either make an asylum claim under the 1951 convention or under article 3 of ECHR. A claim under article 3 will stand if it would be inhuman or degrading for the UK to remove or deport a person into a condition of slavery or to be persecuted for retrospective criminal offences. Many of the major issues about which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) was concerned are likely to be covered, in practice, by article 3. However, we do not want support to be extended beyond refugees or beyond those who might be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading punishment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister's response started off as disappointing but improved towards the end when he clarified the scope of the use of article 3. That was helpful and addresses some of our concerns. The Minister referred to the extension of the costs of the scheme. However, we believe that the wholly unnecessary costs are attributable to the scheme that the Home Secretary and the Government have devised&#151;hugely costly in proportion to the benefits. We will return to costs later. 
<P>
We remain concerned that some people could have claims that are valid, even though they are not covered by the broad definition of article 3, which the Minister helpfully clarified. However, in order to expedite matters I shall not press the amendment to a Division at this stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 316, in page 44, line 30, after `him', insert&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) is a child for whom the asylum seeker or his spouse is responsible, who is under 18 and dependent on him'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: 
<P>
Government No. 752 
<P>
No. 319, in page 45, line 7, leave out `such' and insert `the'. 
<P>
No. 320, in page 45, leave out line 12 and insert&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and ending 28 days after (a) or (b).'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 899, in page 45, line 15, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of his, or of his spouse'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No. 318, in page 45, line 18, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless he and the child are granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom in which case the provision in Section 73(3)(a) applies.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 754, 759 and 761. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is the interpretation clause for the new system of support for asylum seekers. We are worried about the definition of ``dependants'' in the clause. The amendments reflect our anxiety. 
<P>
The support system is designed to meet the living needs of asylum seekers and to implement the Government's dispersal policy. We do not oppose that policy in principle, but we are worried about the workability of the scheme in practice. We have already heard about the cost of the scheme, which we shall discuss shortly. We believe that the costing is based on shaky and optimistic assumptions about the determination of asylum claims. We are worried that the scheme will bemuc more expensive than anticipated. 
<P>
We are worried about the workability of other aspects of the scheme. That reflects the great weight of concern that was expressed in the evidence of a range of a range of organisations, not only those that deal mainly with the interests of refugees, such as the Refugee Council, but others, such as citizens advice bureaux, charities, religious orgnaisations and individuals. Their anxiety suggests that we should examine the provisions carefully. 
<P>
The provisions that affect children are among the most important. Our anxiety about children lies at the heart of amendment No. 316. We want reassurance from the Government about the way in which children will be treated under the new system. In subsection (1)(b), a dependant is defined as: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a child of the asylum-seeker, or of his spouse, who is under 18 and dependent on him''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The Immigration Law Practitioners Association claims that the definition excludes children other than sons and daughters. It recommends that ``child'' should mean any minor who is de facto dependent on the asylum seeker, and not simply a biological son or daughter. The association stated: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A much wider definition is required or the price will be on the one hand hardship and on the other hand a proliferation of asylum claims by actual dependants who do not meet this restrictive definition and thus have no access to support unless they themselves claim asylum.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We do not want either of those consequences to happen. It is most important that children do not suffer hardship, but we do not want a proliferation of asylum claims that will mean extra cases to clog up the system. We look to the Government for reassurance, and to deal comprehensively with ILPA's criticism. 
<P>
Those who are concerned about the welfare of refugees and that of children are also worried about the clause. The Refugee Council is worried about the possibility of families being separated when accommodation is allocated. It has in mind nephews and nieces, grandparents and grandchildren, and the children of friends, who often travel together when people genuinely flee persecution. Recently, we have heard terrible stories from Kosovo. Unexpected tragedy can occur, and children have to be taken by adults who are not their fathers or mothers. 
<P>
I commend to the Committee a submission that I received from Barnardos, Save the Children, UNICEF, the Children's Society and the Refugee Council's children's section. They are worried that the wording of the clause implies that asylum-seeking children who arrive in the United Kingdom with relatives from their extended family would not be supported under the new arrangements. They say that they can assume only that in practice it would lead to separation from the carers and presumably that the children would then be treated as unaccompanied children. The implication of that would be that local authorities would have to exercise their duties to provide for these children under the Children Act 1989. The charities' submission states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Many asylum seeking children do arrive without their biological parents. Children are frequently separated from their parents, when parents are killed or harmed or imprisoned, or in the general chaos during mass population movements. Parents may feel that the safety of their children depends on them leaving the country with a relative or family friend.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> For example, recently the Refugee Council were advised of a 15-year-old Kosovar girl who walked for a week with her uncle to Macedonia. Her parents chose to stay in Pristina because they were fearful that if they lost the family home they wouldn't be able to substantiate their right to their property and access to country of origin.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The submission continues: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the UK, established good child care practice would consider placing children with extended family before considering other care arrangements such as foster care or residential units. This has special relevance to some cultures, where it is more acceptable for children to be cared for by extended family. Additionally, Department of Health Guidelines recognise that it is of crucial importance for refugee children to maintain their cultural links and identity.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
We look for reassurance from the Government&#151;or at least an explanation of how the arrangement will work, given that the definition of ``dependants'' does not include those other than the biological children of their parents and does not seem to cater for the extended family. We want a categoric assurance that children entrusted to the safe keeping of members of their family other than their fathers or mothers, or to friends, will not be separated as a result of the definition. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 319 and 320 are designed to probe the timing point in the determination of asylum claims. We understand that when a claim is considered to have been determined, support can be cut off following a notice period. The explanatory notes describe this period as no fewer than 14 days. Organisations that have submitted evidence to us&#151;they include the Refugee Council&#151;think that 14 days will not be sufficient time to obtain benefits, employment or alternative accommodation when status is granted. Accommodation can be a particular problem. I will not quote it, but anyone reading the memorandum from the Refugee Housing Association would realise how hard it is for refugees to obtain alternative accommodation. Their experience would put a big question mark over the 14-day period, especially in some parts of the country, but they feel that 14 days is insufficient.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a feature of that settlement period may be that individuals may wish to relocate from where they are required to go to somewhere nearer their own community? A good example of that was the Vietnamese boat people, who often relocated, so the longer period that the hon. Gentleman suggests would help if people wished to do that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That may well be so, but as the Bill is drafted&#151;we shall come to this later&#151;that may not be their only problem. The Bill seems to be in a state of flux. We shall have to identify problems and worries when we discover what it will do eventually, because apparently there will be changes to it. But I will not stray into future problems because we shall debate those later. 
<P>
Amendment No. 318 relates to subsection (5). The explanatory notes state that families with dependent children will continue to be eligible for support for as long as they remain in the country. We look to the Government for greater exposition, and confirmation, of this. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Amendment No. 316 would extend the definition of dependants for the purposes of support under part VI. Immigration rules currently define a dependant as being a spouse and minor children of an asylum seeker who are under 18 or who, in the absence of documentary evidence, appear so. 
<P>
I understand some of the hon. Gentleman's worries, but I can reassure him that they unnecessary. The Government want to ensure that the definition of a dependent child for support purposes remains in line with existing immigration rules, which are more flexible than those proposed in the amendment. We would therefore not wish to expand the definition of dependant as proposed at the moment. However, hon. Members will be aware that clause 73(1) gives us the flexibility to amend the definition of dependant to take account of any changes in the operation of the immigration rules. 
<P>
Just as with unaccompanied children, nephews and nieces under the age of 18 who arrived with an asylum seeker would initially be referred to local social services who would decide how to care for them. The aim is always to keep family units together. I can reassure the Refugee Council about that. Guidance to local authorities on this is not changing. Wherever it is reasonable and proper to do so they will ensure that they can stay together. Barnardos was concerned about separation. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that it no longer needs to be concerned. 
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, Department of Health guidelines on these matters say that we should seek to maintain cultural and family links. We will certainly continue to have that view about the development of these children while they are in this country. If the child is to be treated as a dependant of the asylum seeker for the purposes of the asylum application we would want him to be treated as part of the group for support purposes also. We would consider using regulations under 73(1) to achieve that. 
<P>
The best way to approach this is for Barnardos and other organisations that may have concerns to take part in the consultation which is completely open to them. They will have seen the various consultation documents that have been put forward; the most recent is the asylum seekers support document. They will see that we are putting forward a number of propositions for discussion and consultation and this is the sort of area where it would be productive for us to engage in serious discussions about how best to ensure that we deliver effective support within reasonable budgets. 
<P>
Amendment No. 899 raises an interesting point. As the Bill stands it is open to us to extend the definition of the family group entitled to support by regulations relating to the definition of ``dependant'' under subsection (1). There is no comparable scope for extending the definition of the family who remain supported under subsection (5) after the end of an asylum application. I should like to reflect on this as it is a good point. I want to be sure that we have covered it appropriately. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) for raising the issue. We may need to look at this again. I shall write to her to let her know whether we can cover this and, if so, how we intend to proceed. 
<P>
Government amendment No. 752 is a technical amendment to extend the definition of a ``supported person'' under the Secretary of State's scheme to include either the asylum seeker or his dependants. At present, the definition is limited to the asylum seeker. There may be circumstances in which we may wish to support an asylum seeker's dependants despite the fact that we are not supporting the asylum seeker himself because, for example, he is detained. Clearly we have obligations to any dependants of an asylum seeker who are in this situation. We wish to be able to fulfil those obligations and hence the need for this amendment. Government amendments Nos. 759 and 761 are consequential to amendment No. 752. 
<P>
I turn now to amendments Nos. 319 and 320. Asylum seekers who have been receiving support under the Secretary of State's scheme will no longer be eligible to receive it, first, if a positive decision is made on their asylum claims, secondly, if their application is refused and they do not lodge an appeal or, thirdly, if their appeal against refusal of asylum is decided and the original refusal is upheld. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate will wish to terminate support as quickly as is reasonably possible in such circumstances. 
<P>
The Bill as drafted does not lay down the length of such a period of grace, but clause 73(3) allows the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying how long it should be. The draft process manual&#151;a copy of which is in the Library&#151;sets out how it is envisaged that the claims for support will be handled. It suggests that the period should be 14 days, which would allow time for the successful asylum seeker to move to the social security system or to make arrangements to work, and for the unsuccessful applicant to make arrangements to leave the country. It is important to note that the latter does not apply to families with children who will receive support for as long as they remain in the United Kingdom. It is envisaged that the only people who are not likely to be supported beyond the suggested 14-day period are single persons without children. The aim is for flexibility. Different circumstances may apply; some people may more easily be able to transfer to another system of support, to go to live with relatives or to change their circumstances quickly, others may take more time to make arrangements. 
<P>
Flexibility is needed and that is more likely to be achieved by regulation rather than by the Bill. We want a broad-based consultation on the proposal of 14 days to decide matters such as if so, for whom and in what circumstances, and to discuss other periods. We shall take careful note of submissions already made by various organisations and to those made in the coming months. We shall publish a further set of more detailed regulations in due course after wider consultation during the summer to consider how we might develop a workable, efficient and effective system. 
<P>
Having taken further consultation, we shall bring regulations before the House, although no doubt some will pray against the negative resolution. The House will have an opportunity, if it is considered appropriate, to consider the matter in detail. 
<P>
We have still to undertake further negotiations, discussions and consultation. The published documents set out a broad principle approach and contain much detail. The Home Secretary's introduction to one such document makes it clear that the purpose of the documents is to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``act as a starting point for further consultation with all those who will have continuing involvement in the new support arrangements, including local authorities, registered social landlords, registered housing associations in Scotland, housing associations, private sector providers, voluntary and community groups and education and health services.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Amendment No. 320 would prejudge the consultation by fixing the period of grace at 28 days, which the Government believe is not only too long but may be inappropriate in other respects. In some cases, it may even be too short. It is unwise to fix the period of grace at this stage in the Bill. The best approach is to go through the consultation period and listen with care to the points made, frame a series of proposals, take further consultation and bring them before the House. 
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 318. We accept the hon. Gentleman's proposition, which is addressed in slightly different terms by Government amendment No. 754. There is no need for part VI support arrangements to encompass people granted refugee status or exceptional leave. The support arrangements in the Secretary of State's scheme are intended to apply only in the short term, for so long as a destitute asylum seeker and any dependants have an application for asylum or an appeal against refusal against asylum pending. 
<P>
<H5>11 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
We therefore intend to speed up considerably the rate at which such applications and appeals are processed. Once the application or appeal has been disposed of, it is intended that asylum seekers or any dependants will move into work or the UK benefits system, to which they will have full access if they are recognised refugees. However, should their application or appeal be unsuccessful, they will be expected to make arrangements to leave the country. 
<P>
I turn to Government amendment No. 759. Clause 75(1)(c) allows for the provision of assistance to help asylum seekers supported under the Secretary of State's scheme meet the non-legal expenses of their asylum application, such as stationery or postage stamps. However, it is intended that such assistance will be available only to the main asylum seeker. 
<P>
Government amendment No. 752 alters the definition of ``supported person'' to include dependants and the main asylum seeker. In view of that change, we must qualify the term ``supported person'' in relation to the provision of non-legal expenses to clarify that such assistance is to be available to the principal asylum seeker alone, as he or she will be the person requiring such support. 
<P>
Government amendment No. 761 is a drafting amendment and removes words rendered superfluous by Government amendment No. 752 
<P>
I commend the Government amendments to the Committee and request that the other amendments in this group be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Ms Diane Abbott (Hackney, North and Stoke Newington):</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response to amendment No. 899. This morning, we all saw affecting photographs of the Prime Minister with refugee children. It is therefore appropriate that the Committee should examine how Britain will treat refugee children under the Bill, which&#151;all things being equal&#151;will be law by summer. 
<P>
Amendment No. 899, like other amendments, attempts to probe definitions of dependants. For people affected by the Bill, quite how the Government and the authorities define members of their household will be crucial. It is important that the Committee spends time on this matter because definitions of family and household in the countries from which such people come are slightly different from those in modern Britain. 
<P>
In Africa, the Caribbean and the middle east, it is common for children who are not someone's biological offspring to belong to that person's household. Such children may be the person's grandchildren, nephews or nieces, or may even come from his or her village. However, the person's responsibilities to such children are exactly the same as if they were his or her biological children. 
<P>
It is sometimes difficult to convey that concept to British people and the immigration service, although the immigration service has&#151;to some extent&#151;taken it on board. However, in considering a Bill with far-reaching consequences, it is important that we debate the matter in Committee. When there is turmoil and military upheaval, there is all the more reason for people to entrust their children to members of their extended family. 
<P>
In the coming days we hope to debate many other parts of the Bill that will affect children, especially the removal of asylum seekers' children from the provisions of the Children Act 1989 and the cash provision for children, which is 50p a day. For some time, I have said that that sum is quite unacceptable. 
<P>
However, the Minister gave a constructive response and he has offered to write to me about the terms of my amendment. Therefore, I will not press my amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I, too, listened carefully to the Minister's response. I will deal first with the timing. The Minister is still being rather optimistic with 14 days, so I am pleased that there will be consultation. The hon. Gentleman said that the time allowed will differ according to circumstances. The evidence given by the Refugee Housing Association makes it difficult to accept that there are any circumstances in which 14 days will suffice. The association looks at the matter from the viewpoint of a person who is recognised as a refugee who then moves on from the asylum support system and seeks to regularise his position either in the mainstream benefits system or by finding support for himself in other ways. 
<P>
The association's evidence sets out the process for rehousing that a person must go through when he receives recognition as a refugee, and it is quite complicated. The RHA's evidence, which I invite the Minister to examine, states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In our experience the whole process takes between three and four months in the North of England where, because of the surplus accommodation in the social housing sector, it is relatively easy to rehouse refugees in a relatively short period of time. In London, however, it takes between four months and four years to obtain a successful outcome.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will repeat that, because fourteen days is completely unrealistic. If asylum seekers in Hackney were rehoused in 14 days, they would have heart attacks and need other forms of social service help and support. In practice, it takes months and months to rehouse asylum seekers: this is certainly so in the London boroughs and the inner cities that are under most pressure from asylum seekers. Ministers must do something about it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The concluding comments from RHA support that. The assocation states 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``From the practical experience of this orgnaisation we believe that the 14 day grace period proposed by the Home Office to be a woefully inadequate timescale in which to secure rehousing, let alone resettle asylum seekers getting a positive decision.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Let us remember that the association deals with many such people each year. However, the Minister said that he will consult; I hope that the RHA will be one of the organisations consulted. 
<P>
I remain a little concerned by what the Minister said about amendment No. 316. I welcome his assurances, which I rather expected, because I did not think that the Government intended to break up families. However, I am concerned about the way in which the provision will work; I fear that it may have unintended consequences. 
<P>
The Minister said that it would be possible to make regulations that defined ``dependant'' under subsection (1). I am sure that I will be caught out here, but I cannot see a regulation-making power in clause 73(1), which is a definitional section. The Minister referred to immigration rules&#151;we will wait to see what they provide. 
<P>
Meanwhile, all we have to go on is what is in the Bill. The importance of the interpretation and the definition of ``dependant'' is that only a person who is defined as an asylum seeker or a dependant can obtain support from the Government's intended system, which can support only persons who are asylum seekers or dependants. There is apparently no power in any of the following clauses for the Secretary of State&#151; 
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): It is in line 31. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is hearing a sedentary response from my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) to the effect that line 31 of the Bill, clause 73(1)(c), under the definition of ``dependant'', gives a power. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is the question of a ``prescribed''category. Frankly, it would be better to have it in the Bill rather than leave up in the air what might happen in future. There is no use in the Government giving us assurances: it would be better to write in a provision. We know that there is a wide range of people looking after children who are fleeing from a hotspot, or a place that is in chaos. My concern is that a child would come in under these provisions and that there would be no power to support him or her, so there would be a claim on social services. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> It is true that line 31 gives the Home Secretary power to support additional categories at his discretion. One of the problems with the clause is the number of times at which discretion will be left with the Home Secretary or, in practice, with the immigration authorities. I bow to no one in my respect for the hard work and zeal of the immigration authorities, but I have spent 12 years dealing with immigration casework. Therefore, I would like much more to be spelt out in the Bill and much less to be left at the discretion of those good people. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is right. The Minister said that social services will look after the people who do not come within the definitions. Does that mean that children will be taken into care by the social services and then be provided for by them? I do not want to be difficult, but would it not be simpler for there to be a more wide-ranging and inclusive definition of ``dependant'' in the Bill? 
<P>
I shall not press the amendment to the vote, but the clause is unnecessarily restrictive. We do not know what will be in the regulations, but the clause might result in horrible cases. Children who have fled to this country with their extended family or friends might be separated from them as soon as they get here. I look for reassurance from the Minister, but I do not understand why we cannot have a better definition in the Bill. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 827, in page 44, line 32, at end insert&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` ``essential living needs'' means the costs of day to day living including, but not limited to, food, household fuel, the purchase, cleaning, repair and replacement of clothing and footwear, weekly laundry costs, miscellaneous household and personal expenses such as toilet and pharmaceutical items, cleaning materials, window-cleaning, the replacement of small household goods (for example, crockery, cutlery, cooking utensils, light bulbs, etcetera) and such other needs as are essential to the individual asylum seeker given his particular circumstances and those of his dependants;'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
This important amendment tries to define the criteria for access to the support system that the Government have set out. I restate my opposition to the Government's proposed support system. It will be overcostly and inadequate in providing for people's needs. However, if such a sytem is to be introduced, it is crucial to determine the criteria by which someone gains access to support. 
<P>
Under the Bill, it appears as though the Home Secretary will be able to make an arbitrary judgment on whether someone is destitute or is likely to be come destitute. I looked for more details of the definition of ``destitution'' in the Government's publication ``Asylum Seekers Suppport'' and elsewhere in the Bill. I am not convinced that the criteria for deciding whether someone is destitute are sufficiently objective. I tabled the amendment for that reason. 
<P>
The ``essential living needs'' definition that we have proposed might seem odd in terms of what it does and does not include. However, our probing amendment tries to establish the definition that the Government will use, and I seek to persuade them to put one in the Bill. 
<P>
Our definition is based on that in the Social Security Act 1980. It provides the criteria for access to supplementary benefit, which was the predecessor to income support. The definition was in force from 1980 to 1988 and it defined the floor at which access to benefit was possible. If such a floor were defined in income support legislation, it would be far more straightforward to use that and to use the income support mechanism to deliver a basic level of support. However, under the system proposed, it is crucial that we define the criteria that will determine access to the support system. 
<P>
We must consider the background to the proposals. Changes have been made since the Asylum and Immigration Act 1966 was introduced as a result of court cases that considered the definition of destitution and what was and was not acceptable. The Joint Council for the Welfare Immigrants brought one such case and it was decided that people could not be left utterly destitute, but had to be supported under the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989. That led to the current position in which some asylum seekers are provided for by the benefits system and others by the fairly ad hoc mechanisms of the NAA and the Children Act. 
<P>
The Government's proposals in the Bill are an attempt at reform, but they have not been clear and open and put a definition of ``destitution'' in the Bill. They have left it to the Secretary of State's discretion. However, the issue is too significant for it not to be defined in the Bill. 
<P>
I bear in mind the Chair's comments about reading quotations, so I shall quote briefly from Justice's evidence to the Committee. It used its expertise to consider whether aspects of the Bill complied with our international and, under the Human Rights Act 1988, domestic obligations. It said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The provisions for removing, or refusing, support and accommodation to asylum-seekers who are destitute and whose protection claims are still not finally determined raise serious questions of compliance with the ECHR and the 1951 Convention. They create the risk of undermining the protection of Article 3 ECHR and Article 33 1951 Convention by forcing asylum-seekers to leave. They also create the risk of directly breaching Article 8, Article 3 and (in extreme cases) Article 2 of the ECHR.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 16 March 1999; c. 80.]
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It recommended amendments appropriate to that problem. 
<P>
<H5>11.15 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
It is our view that if the Home Secretary is allowed to define the threshold of destitution, we will end up with people being required&#151;as was intended by the previous Government under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996&#151;to leave the country because they have no means of supporting themselves while in the UK. That would be a direct contravention of our requirements under the 1951 convention to offer shelter to asylum seekers. That is a real risk. Justice pointed to a significant gap in the Bill regarding the definition of the gateway of destitution as a criterion for accessing the new support system. 
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees was also critical of this aspect of the Bill. Its representative, Ms Hope Hanlan, gave some interesting oral evidence. She made it clear that although our support system was basically compliant with UNHCR's requirement, she expected far more from a wealthy country such as the United Kingdom. The Government can argue that in respect of the definition of destitution they escape an absolute breach of the 1951 convention, but they are open to the criticism&#151;from UNHCR and other organisations&#151;that their definition of destitution does not reflect the relative wealth of this country in comparison with other refugee-taking countries. UNHCR stated: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``All asylum seekers are entitled to be treated in dignity and in a way which protects their minimum core entitlements''.&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 16 March 1999; c. 140.]
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
However, it wanted the UK Government to make a stronger commitment than the mere protection of minimum core entitlements. 
<P>
The Children's Society dealt particularly with the problems created for impoverished children. It stated: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Clause 74 creates an unacceptable situation by preventing access to the asylum support agency until families and children `appear . . . to be either destitute or to be likely to become destitute'''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That poses the key problem again&#151;that without a proper definition of destitution in the Bill, children could be living in appalling circumstances before the Home Secretary's definition of destitution kicks in&#151;a loophole that should be plugged. 
<P>
Organisations that operate current systems also provided evidence. The Local Government Association, a collection of local authorities that has provided support under the National Assistance Act and the Children Act, was clear about the need to look further into defining the categories of people for whom support should be provided&#151;or may be provided, as we are talking about discretionary support. The Bill avoids the provision of mandatory support at a basic level through an objective test, yet the Home Secretary is allowed many exceptions where he can decline to provide support. 
<P>
The LGA said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are concerned that local authorities should not be inadvertently left to support those who do not meet the definition. This may apply in particular to those asylum seekers whose cases have been dismissed but who retain a legal right to be in the UK''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We shall discuss that issue later. 
<P>
The Local Government Association was also worried that some people might fall through the net as a result of the loophole, and if those individuals are destitute and without support, local authorities will have to pick up the pieces, just as they do for people in similar circumstances who are not asylum seekers. Local authorities will incur costs by having to take responsibility for anyone who does not fall within the Home Secretary's definition of destitute. 
<P>
Finally, I have compelling evidence from Kent county council, a local authority that has significant dealings with the current system, introduced under the 1996 Act. Its experience of that system leads the council to believe that there will be problems with the proposed system. It envisages that the introduction of such a system will create operational, logistical and resource difficulties and reiterates that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it will be important to ensure that the definition for those eligible for support and the circumstances in which they become eligible for support is dovetailed carefully with the proposed legislative amendments''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
to remove the requirements to provide support under the Children Act and the National Assistance Act&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``. . . Failure to do so could inadvertently leave the United Kingdom at risk of being in breach of its duties under the 1951 Convention if loopholes are inadvertently created.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It cannot be the Government's intention to create loopholes and leave people utterly destitute and unable to claim their rights under the 1951 convention. I hope that they can reassure us in that respect. If they cannot do so, they should inlcude in the Bill an objective definition of destitution that includes items essential for living, which can be tested by individuals who are refused and which make it clear that it does not mean having no food whatever. The proposal should reflect the real experience of people already in this country, such as that of the Somali asylum seeker whose case was brought to our attention by the citizens advice bureaux. That individual was very ill with an HIV symptomatic infection but was described by CAB as being left basically starving. Clearly, a Somali asylum seeker with such an infection has a different set of essential living requirements from others. 
<P>
The measure will affect a range of people whose significant needs may differ because of the conditions under which they arrived and their experience before arriving in the United Kingdom. The definition must be robust and have a fairly high threshold, so that those who fall below it are scooped up by the system&#151;inadequate as it may be&#151;and provided with some support, rather than being allowed to plunge further into what most of us would accept as destitution, even if the Home Secretary's working definition does not include the particular things that they lack. 
<P>
I hope that the Government will respond favourably to the principle of putting a definition of essential living needs in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The amendment is designed to test what the Government mean by essential living needs in the context of the proposed new system of support. I say now, and I shall say it again, that I am opposed to the new system of support; I was opposed to the partial withdrawal of benefits when the Tories did it and I am opposed to the Government's proposal for the complete withdrawal of benefits. 
<P>
The proposed support system of hostels, food vouchers and &#163;1 a day for adults and 50p a day for children is wrong in principle. It will prove unworkable and will ultimately be more expensive than giving benefit. The Government have already conceded that it will be more expensive in terms of unit costs; I suspect that it will be more expensive in total. Last but not least, the proposed system of support will cause unnecessary suffering and hardship. However, with the support of the serried ranks of my colleagues behind me, I know that the Government will get their system of support, come what may, whatever is said in Committee. Therefore, amendments that test definitions are very important both to the asylum seekers and to the groups that work with them. To ask what constitutes essential living needs and what constitutes destitution are key questions. 
<P>
Some of my colleagues have hundreds of asylum seekers in their constituencies: I have thousands. That will continue for the foreseeable future. I do not want a stream of mothers coming to my surgery because they cannot get new trainers for their children or pay their bus fares or pay to get legal documents photocopied. That is the nitty gritty and the human cost of the support system that the Government propose. That is why the definition is so important. 
<P>
The Government seem to think that an Algerian or Somalian asylum seeker in Hackney who does not have the money for new trainers for her son to go to school will think, ``Maybe that Mike O'Brien is right. Maybe I should not have put in this wholly bogus economic asylum claim.''&#151;but it will not be like that. Putting in place an unworkable and parsimonious support system will force more and more people into social exclusion. Constituencies such as mine will have to live with the symptoms of that social exclusion, be it begging or other types of antisocial activity. 
<P>
The very least the Government can do as the Bill goes through Committee is to put flesh on the bones of the system. Leaving the definition of essential living needs to the ladies and gentlemen at Lunar house will not inspire my constituents with confidence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We will have a broad-based debate on clause stand part and I shall deal with some of the points that my hon. Friend has just raised. 
<P>
The main issue is whether the essential living needs of asylum seekers should be defined in the Bill. We do not intend to spell out what essential living needs are in the Bill any more than they are defined in social security legislation. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) said that his definition derived from the Social Security Act 1980. Perhaps he was not aware of this, but that legislation was replaced in 1988 and the definition was not continued, because it is almost impossible to get an agreed definition of precisely what the essential living needs of an individual will be. 
<P>
Individuals vary as do their essential living needs. However, we must settle on a sum that is not unreasonable. 
<P>
That is the approach that the social security legislation has determined and we shall follow it too. It is not exactly the same definition for reasons that I shall set out. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asks for a high threshold to catch everyone who might possibly want support. Asylum support at present is in excess of &#163;500 million. It is projected to rise to about &#163;800 million and under his definition could go well above &#163;1 billion. The hon. Gentleman is being rather free and easy with taxpayers' money. We have a responsibility as custodians of those resources to ensure that they are properly and appropriately spent. I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would want us to protect public resources in that way. 
<P>
We also have a responsibility to ensure that people do not fall into destitution. The objective of the legislation is to ensure that none do. The essential living needs of individuals are likely to vary according to the person or the family. It is for each household to exercise its own judgment as to how best to use the available resources. The list set out in the amendment seems reasonable on the face of it, but let us examine it and see how much needs to be in there. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman talks first about an obligation to meet day-to-day living expenses. As anyone who goes shopping knows, day-to-day expenses vary. Prices go up and prices sometimes go down under this Government and people are better off. The idea that we can vary the amount paid from day to day is completely unreasonable. No one would disagree that food should be included, but household fuel is different. Utility costs will be met under accommodation provisions. Therefore, the cost of household fuel does not need to be included&#151; 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way? 
<P>
<H5>11.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a moment. 
<P>
The cost of the household fuel will be paid by those who provide much of the accommodation. 
<P>
We need to consult about the extent to which specific circumstances mean that asylum seekers will not have to pay directly for some of the items we have mentioned, and cases in which asylum seekers&#151;perhaps those in self-contained accommodation&#151;may have to fund such items. However, we currently intend those who provide the accommodation to cover fuel and utility costs. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I understand why my hon. Friend imagines that the cost of household fuel will generally be met by those who provide the accommodation, especially when the accommodation has central heating. However, it is common for older estates to include some flats that do not have central heating. The people who live there have to provide their own heating, for example, calor gas fires. Assuming that all asylum seekers will have accommodation where heating is provided and funded centrally could leave some very cold asylum seekers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend is quite right. That is why we need to give the matter more careful thought than the loose definition of people's living needs set out in the amendment. Our concern for those needs will go beyond the definition in the amendment. 
<P>
Many people are worried about key meters. Metering and providing keys to enable people to gain access to household fuel could be a way of directly tackling fuel provision in self-contained accommodation. 
<P>
I assume that the definition of ``cleaning'' in the amendment does not mean employing a cleaner. However, its meaning is not clear. I draw attention to those matters to emphasise that it is almost impossible to devise for inclusion in the Bill a formula that is sufficiently clear and specific to cover every requirement. 
<P>
The amendment refers to, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``repair and replacement of clothing''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Income support provisions are intended to enable someone to live on income support for a long time, if necessary. Its amount is not enormously generous&#151;anyone who has had to live on income support will testify to that. However, the provision for direct support to asylum seekers is not intended to be long term. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman bear with me while I set out the argument? We can discuss it later in our proceedings. 
<P>
We intend the funding to be on a short-term basis while someone waits for the outcome of an initial decision, or an appeal. Our target is to reduce the time from the years and years that we inherited from the previous Government to two months for an initial decision and a further four months for an appeal. In those circumstances, the short-term funding will meet different needs from those fulfilled by income support. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is now coming to an important point. He claimed that it was impossible to include every item in a definition of essential living needs, and made it clear that the clause provided for a short-term system. He unwisely made party political comments about the system that he inherited. Will the Minister confirm that the Bill is constructed on the assumption of a two-month waiting period? At the moment, the waiting time for determination is 17 months. Should the Minister have a different figure, would he give it to the Committee? The figures on applications determined in the last three months, show that the system is on the verge of collapse. The number of applications being determined has fallen from the thousands to the hundreds, and the backlog has grown by 10,000. Whatever the reason for that, is it not an inauspicious time to introduce a system which, according to the Minister, will take two months? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentions something happening for whatever reason. Should he wish to make party-political points, rather than address the issues in a constructive and serious manner, then he should allow me to make a few such points. 
<P>
We inherited an asylum system in complete shambles with massive backlogs. People were waiting years for decisions and the appeals system was unable to make decisions in a reasonable period. We have certainly reduced the periods in which many appeals are heard. 
<P>
The system was wide open to abuse and the previous Government made no attempt to deal with unscrupulous immigration advisers, tackle the problems in the asylum system and deal quickly with the processing of decisions. We inherited a contract, entered into by the hon. Gentleman's Government, to provide a computer system that was not subsequently provided. We had to rescue the whole contract. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way on those points?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman listen? He has been dishing it out, so perhaps he can take a little himself. 
<P>
The system set up by the previous Government did not work, so they set up another system to rescue it, but that did not work either. Now we have to rescue that rescue package. We have to rescue the Siemens contract and sort it out. One way we are doing that is by re-employing many people made redundant under the contract to which the hon. Gentleman's Government signed up. 
<P>
The Immigration and Nationality Directorate must be computerised. However, I am not sure that we would have wished to engage in the all-singing, all-dancing computer system with IND reorganisation in which the hon. Gentleman's Government seemed determined to involve themselves. However, that is as may be. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's Government created a shambles, which they passed on to us, along with a mechanism for undermining it. We are now in the process of sorting out the system. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to engage in party-political point scoring, so I will not give way. 
<P>
I wish to tackle seriously the important issues raised by the hon. Member for Hallam. Everyone's essential living needs are different. What does amendment No. 827 mean by laundry costs, for example? Does that mean the day-to-day change in the price of washing powder? I am sure that it does not, but I am trying to show that getting down to definitions is enormously difficult. 
<P>
What sort of cleaning materials does the amendment refer to, and under what circumstances would such materials be used? The amendment also mentions window cleaning: I hope that such window cleaners do not charge as much as those whom we use. 
<P>
The amendment would also cover: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the replacement of small household goods (for example, crockery, cutlery, cooking utensils, light bulbs, etcetera)''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We do not intend that the cost of such items should be met by individual asylum seekers, as happens with those claiming income support. Those items will be provided by those who have entered into contracts to provide the essential equipment for the accommodation which they have been contracted to put in place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It is a pleasure that the Minister should treat my probing amendment so seriously as to give an item-by-item rebuttal. 
<P>
Light bulbs are a classic example of problems with the current system. What the Minister says suggests that such problems will continue. Should a light bulb go in someone's place of residence, I would rather that he or she nip down to the corner shop and pay 59p for a new one than ring up the provider and get him or her to ship over a light bulb at, inevitably, much greater cost. Similar cases occur under the current system, and they seem likely to continue. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Landlords who provide accommodation will also be obliged to provide light bulbs, cutlery and any other necessary equipment. That is how we envisage it. If there is the problem that the hon. Gentleman has described, it can be considered in consultation. However, at present, I am not aware that the problem is that great. I have received complaints about local authorities not providing lighting as quickly as they should, but not so many about private landlords. However, other hon. Members may have different experiences. 
<P>
Reference has been made to pharmaceutical items. Some can be purchased over the counter, but others cannot. If someone needs drugs for a particular medical condition and is on the scheme, I can reassure Committee members that he will be entitled to free prescriptions and that he will be dealt with in the normal way. 
<P>
The key point is that asylum seekers will be provided with vouchers or an alternative system of support. They will make the choices as to what to do with their overall purchasing power. When support is provided in kind, we shall specify the essential living needs that the supplier should provide&#151;and some of those are listed in the amendment. 
<P>
I appreciate that there will be times when people are faced with difficult choices. However, that is true now of asylum seekers who are in receipt of social security benefits and of the very much larger community of people who have to rely on social security. The Department of Social Security does not prescribe the essential living needs that social security benefits provide for&#151;and neither should we. Taking such a step would provide a raft of opportunities for judicial review and the system for providing support might find itself facing unnecessary difficulties. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the refusal of assistance. If the Secretary of State refuses assistance to someone on the ground that he is not destitute, that person can appeal to the asylum support adjudicator. We shall come to that subject in due course. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also said that some local government systems had not worked that well, and I listened to his comments about Kent county council with great care. It has dealt well with difficult circumstances and worked closely with hon. Members representing Kent constituencies. The county council and borough councils have managed a high-pressure situation with great skill. Tempers have been kept and they have maintained a reasonable level of public support for asylum seekers despite the exceptionally difficult circumstances created by the comments of some local newspapers. The council took the difficult step of setting up a system of support for asylum seekers, which has, by and large, worked well. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the fact local authority support is more expensive for asylum seekers than it needs to be. It is not organised nationally, so negotiations are often made with particular supermarket chains. Therefore, asylum seekers can spend their vouchers only in certain supermarkets. We intend to negotiate through a national agency and to set up the system nationally. That should make it more constructive and cheaper and it should ensure that there are no transitional problems. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman wanted us to ensure&#151;and mentioned Kent county council again&#151;that there were no loopholes or lacun in the transitional provisions. He is right that it is our intention not to create unnecessary loopholes. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the evidence of Ms Hope Hanlan, the UNHCR representative. The Home Secretary has already expressed the Government's view on that matter. The Government were concerned about some of her evidence and we intend to discuss the variety of public and private comments privately with Ms Hanlan. We intend to take up any outstanding matters with the UNHCR in the normal way. We are working closely with the UNHCR and I spoke to Ms Hanlan yesterday about Kosovo. We have a good relationship. 
<P>
We also intend to work with refugee groups in setting up a system of support for Kosovans coming into the country. As part of that exercise, we hope to build up an awareness among local authorities of what measures can be taken to deal with the new demands that will arise from the new system. The Local Government Association's response has been constructive and our private meetings have resulted in its willingness to work with us in setting up the new system. It may not have secured everything that it wanted, but I suspect that nobody ever does. 
<P>
Our aim is to create a mechanism that will deliver essential living needs on a short-term, temporary basis for those who are applying for asylum and for their families. We believe that the Bill will help us to achieve that. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The Minister said, and I am trying to quote him as accurately as I can, that asylum seekers will have to make their own decisions in the light of their overall purchasing power. Let me remind the Minister that the overall support package is worth only 70 per cent. of income support. So asylum seekers will already have less purchasing power than people on income support. Out of that package, they will have &#163;1 cash a day per adult and 50p a day per child. On that level of purchasing power, the scope for making decisions is limited. 
<P>
If the seven-year-old son of an asylum-seeking mother comes home from school with his jeans ripped, it is going to take two weeks, on 50p a day, to buy another pair. Children are going to be kept home from school because their mother cannot afford the shoes and clothes that they need&#151;a situation that many people would not have believed could happen in this country. Without more clarity and flexibility, that will be the consequence of the Bill. It is nonsense to talk about overall purchasing power when the amount of cash available to asylum seekers will be &#163;1 a day for adults and 50p for children. What sort of purchasing power is that? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Lady's point is complete nonsense. The aim is not to make people pay out of the 50p for jeans or other items that can be purchased in supermarkets. A family of two with two children and perhaps a baby would receive around &#163;28 a week in cash. Vouchers would provide a means for replacing clothing and could be used at supermarkets. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington is engaging in hyperbole, but we need to get down to the reality, which is that most asylum seekers would not face the sort of difficulties that she mentioned. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> We are coming to the heart of the Bill. What I said is not hyperbole. A child may need new trainers or other items to cope with one of the little crises that happen in children's lives, but the parent might have used up the week's vouchers on food. The amount allocated is 50p per child per day. That is what is stated in the document ``Asylum Seekers Support'' dated March 1999. It is all well and good to talk of hyperbole in the context of a House of Commons Committee, but it is not hyperbole to say that the spending power of a mother who has used her vouchers will be pitifully small.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister owes the hon. Lady and the Committee a better answer than he has given so far. I can understand him wanting to go over the party political ground about Lunar house. He has traversed that ground many times in the past, with decreasing productivity. The situation there has got worse and worse and the chaos has grown to historic proportions, but it will not do for the Minister to try to take refuge in those tired old arguments. 
<P>
The Government's new system is constructed on the assumption that the time taken to determine claims will be shorter. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington was right when she referred to the new arrangements being set at 70 per cent. of the benefits that were available. Under the old system people received 90 per cent. of income support. The reason for the difference between the income support given to a UK resident and that given to an asylum seeker was that it was assumed that the asylum seeker would not be here for such a long time and his needs would be less. That was the rationale. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Under that system it was 90 per cent. of income support for adults but 100 per cent. of income support for children. One of the most painful aspects of the Bill is that we are now going to 70 per cent. for children and this wretched 50p a day in cash. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Lady is right. The Minister can contradict me if he wants, but the information document ``Asylum Seekers Support'' states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The proposed provision is set at 70 per cent. of the equivalent support levels because:
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
the asylum support scheme is intended to be a short-term basic safety net arrangement''. 
<P>
The longer it goes on the more tattered that net will get. If the Minister does not want to engage me in debate and answer my point, will he at least answer the Refugee Council which, like many of the other organisations, highlights that in its evidence? In its written evidence it says that one of the key assumptions that the Government have made is fundamentally flawed. It adds: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government has stated that the time taken to dispose of any asylum application and appeal will be reduced to six months and the backlog of initial decisions will be cleared by 2001. Given that the backlog of asylum applications awaiting initial decisions went up by approximately 13,000 last year and that the Home Office is currently moving offices and does not envisage getting back to 1998 levels of efficiency until April, we believe that there is no prospect of these targets being reached. The consequence of this will be that the new system will become more and more costly to administer, possibly making it unsustainable.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> From the point of view of the asylum seeker, the six month deadline is equally important as it will be increasingly difficult for asylum seekers to sustain themselves after this period of time.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 16 March 1999; c. 5-6.]
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is the problem that the Government must face up to and the Minister owes a better answer than we have received so far. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I have only a couple of brief points. I can understand what the Minister is saying about the way the amendment is drafted and how it talks about the needs 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``essential to the individual asylum seeker given his particular circumstances and those of his dependants.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The idea that one would start to construct systems where the living expenses of every individual are assessed is unworkable, but at the root of this is the problem of how destitution is defined and the cashless system. 
<P>
I have not yet received a sensible explanation of why it is okay to give someone a voucher that is worth &#163;30 and can be spent in Sainsbury's but not to give him three &#163;10 notes that he can spend in Sainsbury's or wherever he likes. At the root of many of these problems is the definition and how people can decide how to spend their money. We shall come on to the arguments about the levels of cash later in the Bill. The amendment gets at the root of the problem of trying to run what is essentially a cashless system. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I shall deal briefly with two points. First, the hon. Member for Walthamstow asked why vouchers rather than cash and we shall discuss that issue at greater length during the stand part debate. 
<P>
The point made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) is valid in terms of its background, although perhaps not in the way that he put it. The system is intended to be temporary but we have to ask what would happen if the chaos that we inherited from the previous Government continued indefinitely. The hon. Gentleman asked if we would carry on with the system. The answer is that if we are not near our target by April 2001, the Bill will enable us to consider how best to approach the matter. It has sufficient flexibility to enable us to deal with the issues constructively and sensibly, should the need arise. Refugee groups such as the Refugee Council, which the hon. Gentleman quoted, who are concerned about the issue can be reassured that we intend to deal with such developments in a constructive and sensible way in due course. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will express concern, as no doubt we all shall in the debate, about the use of secondary legislation, but it is precisely the use of that secondary legislation that will enable us to adapt to and accommodate unforeseen circumstances. The Bill is drafted widely enough to enable us to deal with the problems that the hon. Gentleman identified. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We have had a useful debate on this important matter but the Minister has told me nothing that will calm my fears on the clause. One of the pleasures of sitting on the Opposition side of the House is that when the great bogeyman of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is raised, we can proudly ignore him while Members on the Government Benches have to quake in fear. The Minister raised the issue of cost, which is always in our minds, yet we are dealing with the fundamental matter of what we do with people who are resident in this country, especially families with children. At that stage, the prime motivating factor is not the difference in cost between a system that provides what we deem to be the basic level of support for anyone else's essential needs&#151;the income support level&#151;and that which provides for a new category of people who require less than the others. The prime motivating factor is providing humane conditions. 
<P>
The Minister asked what examples we had of inefficiencies in the current system. I have heard of social workers, paid I do not know how much an hour, driving round with toothbrushes for children because they cannot give them the money to buy one themselves. To judge by what the Minister said, there will be similar, if not worse, situations under the proposed system. Perhaps someone will be sent round to sew a pair of ripped jeans because we cannot give people the money to buy a needle and thread to do the repairs themselves. 
<P>
We must be clear about the fundamental problem in the Government's argument, to which the hon. Member for Hertsmere drew attention. Ministers manage to be both pessimistic and optimistic about the targets. The Minister talked about costs, which relate to delays under the current system; in the next sentence he said, ``Well, of course, when we reach the new targets we won't have these problems,'' but either the new targets will be met and the costs will fall or they will fail to be met and the costs will remain high. To use both arguments at the same time points to a fundamental flaw in the Government's argument. 
<P>
I suspect that the Government are pessimistic about meeting their targets. There was evidence for that pessimism in an earlier sitting in which the union representative of those who process the claims argued strongly that even with the new money in the comprehensive review the backlog would continue to grow. I reached no clear conclusion during the exchange between the Conservative and Labour Front Bench spokesmen as to whose fault it was that we have a dodgy computer system and I am not sure that it really matters. The fact remains that getting people off the system within the six months for which the Government designed it is unlikely. All the factors relating to essential living needs, including clothing and so on, will come into play because people will be on the system for far longer than the Government suggest. 
<P>
<H5>12 noon </H5>
</P>
<P>
I refer members of the Committee to the amount that the Government propose to pay these people&#151;this brings me back to the point about destitution. It will, I suppose, be equivalent to the figure at which the Government decide a person is, or is not, destitute. For a family of two adults and two children, the document proposes the sum of &#163;90.80 a week, which would be set against the &#163;129.70 paid to UK residents on income support who have older children. If we categorise two UK adults and their two children as destitute and decide that they require support, we will provide for their basic needs &#163;129.70 a week while two Kosovar parents with two children who arrive here will have to manage on &#163;90.80 a week. The Minister tried to encourage us by saying that they would get a generous cash settlement so they would be all right. With this example they would receive &#163;21 of that in cash each week&#151;&#163;1 each day for two adults and 50p a day for the children, with the remaining &#163;69.80 in vouchers. I understand that good progress is being made on what type of vouchers these should be, and that the Government are talking to Luncheon Vouchers Ltd. about this. I believe that security for the vouchers such as watermarking and striping is also being considered, although perhaps the Queen's head would make them look better, and that they might be distributed through an existing facility such as cashpoint machines. We are moving towards creating an incredible framework merely to provide another currency. They will be able to spend &#163;21 on anything they wish but what asylos&#151;the currency for asylum seekers&#151;may be spent on will be clearly defined by the Government. My understanding is that it will be primarily food needs.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> For information, a person applying for asylum who is recognised as a refugee will be entitled to have the difference between what they have received and what they would have received on income support made up, so, in a sense, they will receive a lump sum when they are recognised as genuine refugees. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is useful clarification, but, given the length of time it will take to resolve their claims, these could be significant lump sums for people who for perhaps a couple of years will have lived at destitution level. 
<P>
Young adults aged 18 to 24 form a significant number of those who come here, especially those who have been fleeing the recent conflicts in former Yugoslavia. They have been a prime group because we are aware of what happens to young men who stay in their country. They will be expected to live on &#163;27.90 as opposed to &#163;39.85. I suspect that unless they can demonstrate that their needs, or their destitution, have fallen below that level, they will not be eligible for support. The &#163;27.90 a week&#151;&#163;7 in cash and &#163;20.90 in the asylo voucher&#151;will be it; that will be expected to provide everything. I think that another parallel economy will grow, as happened with the existing voucher system. Vouchers may be devalued even further as people, with understandable motives, try to exchange them for cash. 
<P>
If we continue with the non-explicit definition of destitution that the Government work to, which seems to correspond to approximately 70 per cent. of income support, we will move towards creating a class of significant social exclusion where people will be identifiable on account of their clothes not having been repaired because, unlike people on income support who are destitute, they will not have had included within their definition of social need the costs of their clothing. People will sit in their accommodation ringing their landlord or provider at 11 pm asking for a light bulb to be brought round as soon as possible&#151;at a cost which will eventually be charged to the Home Office because providers will charge all fair costs for services&#151;rather than nip round to the corner shop for a Happy Shopper light bulb like everyone else. Such occurrences will take place because the person's limited resources will not be deemed to apply to light bulbs. Asylum seekers will be told that the accommodation provider should deal with such problems. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman speaks eloquently about the position of the refugee. Is not it also important to consider the taxpayer's position? The Government play the taxpayer card, but the system depends on tackling issues in a short time. As matters stand currently, the system will prove vastly more expensive for the taxpayer. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a useful point. When we add up the costs in future, as we did for the systems that local authorities operated under the National Assistance Act 1948, we shall find that, by avoiding the straightforward definition of destitution and living needs, and the straightforward way of providing for them, taxpayers will have forked out far more money than they would otherwise have paid. 
<P>
Leaving people in destitution at greater cost to the taxpayer is absurd. The Government could attempt to provide a realistic definition of essential living needs, instead of leaving uncertainty about whether the Secretary of State will use the system. Even if he uses it, his definition of essential living needs for an asylum seeker is 70 per cent. of the needs of any other poor resident of the United Kingdom. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps mentioning 70 per cent. However, the scheme is temporary and, therefore, in addition to that 70 per cent., the costs of accommodation, equipment, furnishing and ordinary utilities will be met by other means. The costs will not be funded directly, or constitute the same responsibility as those of someone who is on income support. The total package does not simply involve an administrative cost; we shall pay for other requirements in different ways. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I accept that a proportion, especially utility costs, which should be taken into account, will be covered in other ways. But if people end up in the system long term&#151;and I believe that that will happen&#151;some of the costs that the Secretary of State removed in calculating the 70 per cent. figure are unrealistic. The asylum seeker's essential living costs will not be 70 per cent. of the costs of those on income support. A proportion may be taken out, perhaps for a utility bill, but the system for replacing items such as children's clothing&#151;to which the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington referred&#151;is incredibly cumbersome. The asylum seeker will end up paying for such items. They will not be provided in the way in which the Government intend, just as the reality for those living on vouchers is different from the Government's initial intentions. 
<P>
The Bill misses an opportunity to undo some of the damage of the 1996 Act. The Government compound that damage. Ultimately, the asylum seeker will suffer, but compelling evidence suggests that the Government and the taxpayer will also suffer if we fail to adopt the sort of definition of essential living needs that the amendment proposes.

<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Amendment No. 740 deals with the end of the process, when claims have been decided and eligibility for the support scheme is involved. We discussed that earlier, when the Minister said that there may be flexibility on the 14-day period suggested for single people. Of course, people with families are not covered, and remain in the support system as long as they are in the country. However, that is not the case for single people. 
<P>
In some circumstances, people need to know with certainty that they will still be eligible. We are talking about taking away basic living expenses from people who have reached the end of the road and whose cases have been decided. 
<P>
I accept the arguments about vulnerability and understand why the Bill makes provision to support families with children and keep them in the system. However, single people may be just as vulnerable as a result of disability, age or poor health. There are many such reasons for single people being vulnerable and good arguments for them staying in the support scheme in the same way that families with children receive protection. 
<P>
However amendment No. 740 involves more than that. It relates to circumstances in which there may be good reasons why proceedings are on-going. The amendment would insert into clause 73 subsections (3A)(a) and (b), which deal with possible further legal action once a decision has been made on an asylum claim. 
<P>
In general, an asylum seeker may try to get a judicial review of the decision. Although the majority of cases with an application for leave to make a judicial review do not get very far and leave is not granted, it is interesting to examine what happens to those cases in which leave is granted. According to 1996-97 figures, when leave for judicial review was granted, the success rate was very high. About 80 per cent. of such cases were successful. Even though the initial numbers might not be very high, the cases involve a significant number of people. 
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
When decisions are made, it is possible that the Secretary of State might choose to make a legal challenge in the High Court. That has happened in a small number of cases. The Minister might say that that will not happen under the proposed system, but it might. If people are able to take further legal action and even if only a few of those legal actions turn out to be unsuccessful, we should not leave people unsupported while their case is being considered. 
<P>
Legal action can take some time. The decisions on leave to move to judicial review are usually taken fairly quickly, but the action of judicial review itself could take a considerable time even before it gets to court. It could be a matter of months and, as the Bill stands, it is not certain that someone taking legal action will receive support in that time. 
<P>
The third paragraph is about the possibility of the Secretary of State reconsidering after a decision has been made. Many hon. Members who have dealt with asylum cases will be aware of cases that have gone to appeal and been turned down by the adjudicator. However, in turning down the appeal, the adjudicator may make a recommendation that the Home Office should reconsider the case, not as an asylum claim, but on compassionate grounds, by using other sections of the immigration rules or even by considering it outside the rules. Such reconsideration might allow the person to remain in the United Kingdom. It is not that unusual for adjudicators to make recommendations even when they reject an appeal. 
<P>
If an adjudicator makes a recommendation and the Home Office considers it, one should not cut off support to the person involved while that process is taking place. That is also true if representations are made to Ministers on compassionate grounds or if there are reasons to consider the case outside the rules. 
<P>
The final paragraph deals with cases in which a claim is rejected, but it is not possible to remove the person from the country. There may be a variety of reasons for that. For example, a claim might be rejected, but a person might not be removed immediately for health reasons. Similarly, a woman in the latter stages of pregnancy would not be removed. 
<P>
In some cases, it is virtually impossible to remove someone from the country.Whether we like it or not, we know that it is extremely difficult to return someone undocumented to China. In other cases, the Home Office decides that it is unsafe to return people to some countries. At present, the current position in Angola means that even if an Angolan asylym seeker has a claim rejected, he will not be removed from the United Kingdom. Sierra Leone and Zaire are other countries that have fallen into that category in recent months, and others are bound to from time to time. If the Home Office decides that it cannot remove someone, it cannot be reasonable to leave that person with no access to cash or other support. For a number of reasons, people who have had their claims rejected should still be considered to be within the support system. 
<P>
The Minister might tell us that the flexibility that we spoke of earlier in relation to the 14 days could be used to cover the cases that I have described. If such flexibility is available, it would be helpful to have that on the record. The amendment's drafting might mean that it would not achieve what I seek, but I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that it deals with issues that need to be considered. Even if the amendment does not provide the best approach, I hope that he will consider what we can do to ensure that people in the circumstances that I have described are not left destitute. We can all envisage the consequences of relatively young single people remaining destitute for a long time.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I support my hon. Friend on this important amendment. It deals with the circumstances in which a single person is still in the country even though his or her claim has been rejected. 
<P>
In some cases, people's claims might be rejected, but the Secretary of State will not force their removal because of the situation in the country from which they came. I have such cases on my books at present. For example, people from Sierra Leone have had claims rejected, but they are not being removed because of the chaos there. Under the Bill, if such people are single, they will be left entirely destitute. 
<P>
The other important circumstance is when someone has made leave for appeal or to bring judicial reivew. However, it undercuts people's human and legal rights if they have the legal right to appeal or to bring judicial review, but do not have means of support while the process is taking place. The amendment's working may not be ideal, but my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow has raised an important issue that should be addressed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It is wonderful to see cross-party support on this issue. I am sure that the Labour Members who have spoken reflected the views of all their colleagues who want people to be able to take legal action. 
<P>
I referred earlier to Justice's submission on the requirement for people to have their essential needs provided for. The organisation is involved with human rights, and it is especially concerned with support. It referred to the judgment on the 1996 Act and to Lord Justice Simon Brown's view that the withdrawal of all support. 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``necessarily contemplates for some a life so destitute that to my mind no civilised nation can tolerate it.'' <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My amendment and that tabled by the hon. Member for Walthamstow address that problem. Someone might legally be entitled to stay in the country and proceedings might be under way, but he might be left in a state of destitution that, as a Lord Justice has said, no civilised nation should tolerate. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider what would happen if the Secretary of State wished to take further legal proceedings. We are concerned tha the support system seems to exclude the Secretary of State from offering support in many circumstances. What would happen if someone won a favourable decision, but the Secretary of State chose to challenge it? 
<P>
Legal proceedings can take place subsequent to the part IV appeal that has been disposed of in subsection (4) as drafted. In those circumstances, we cannot see how the Secretary of State can continue to provide support in cases in which he takes action. Both issues worry us; obviously, the prime motivation is to ensure that asylum seekers are able to take all available avenues under the law. They do not ask for anything that is not legally due to them. 
<P>
I am anxious about the matters raised in the Local Government Association's submission, which referred specifically to the category of people who are legally entitled to be in the country. They may be involved in ongoing legal proceedings and, as I said earlier, the LGA seems to share my view that local government will have to pick up the pieces. I understand that such people will lose their right to accommodation and therefore be made homeless because, under the Bill, the Secretary of State will no longer be empowered to offer them accommodation. People will, literally, be put on to the streets. Local authorities will do everything they can, but it is an appalling situation for people to be placed in. 
<P>
I use the Government's logic about the desperate state of people who seek asylum, and I thus suspect that people will choose to live destitute on the streets rather than be forced out of the country. People whose claims are not recognised, but who may have a valid fear of returning to their country of origin may end up living on streets. The fear that drove them to apply for asylum, to take their case to appeal and subsequently to take whatever steps they could to stay in the country may lead them to make the awful choice to live destitute on the streets in the United Kingdom while they exercise their legal rights, rather than simply leaving the country at that stage. That is a real cause for concern even though few people may be affected. It would therefore not be a big problem for the Treasury and the Chancellor. 
<P>
To accept the clause without our amendment or that tabled by the hon. Member for Walthamstow would leave the Bill at serious risk of breaching our obligations under international conventions and, possibly, creating a humanitarian problem that local authorities would have to solve. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> There must be a clearly defined end to the asylum process, at which point people should be expected to return to the country from which they came. They cannot expect continually to be supported by the United Kingdom taxpayer when their claim has finally been determined. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Walthamstow set out a variety of circumstances in which we should consider extending financial support. The primary circumstances to which he drew attention was that of people whose case is under judicial review. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the main way for people who want to remain in the United Kingdom, but whose initial claims for asylum, and their appeals, have been rejected, is to seek judicial review and try to drag out their cases even further. In recent years, only 6 per cent. of judicial reviews have succeeded. The vast majority of such cases&#151;94 per cent.&#151;are without merit, as the hon. Member for Walthanstow said. The amendment would create an incentive to people, after an initial decision had been made and an appeal had been rejected, to consider mounting a frivolous judicial review as a way of remaining in the country and continuing to gain access to the support system. We have to draw the line somewhere. It is always difficult because of the choices that have to be made, but we must be prepared to make difficult choices. 
<P>
Extending support as suggested in the amendment would invite the pursuit of further unmerited claims and legal challenges with a consequent burden on the court system and with very little practical prospect of success. It's absurd for people to seek further proceedings merely to continue being supported. By the time most people are relying on judicial review, their case will have been examined on several occasions. 
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
If individuals want their case to be taken further, they will have to reflect on how they can support themselves. They could look to the voluntary sector or to their own communities for support. The Government are committed to supporting families for as long as they remain in the United Kingdom. Everyone accepts that in this case we are talking about single people, or at least people without children, and we do not want to encourage such people to make further frivolous legal challenges and representations. If families remain within the system, our only aim is to support children. 
<P>
We want the most effective means of ensuring an early and orderly departure of families: once they have pursued every available avenue of appeal, they must be removed from the country. Where removal is to a safe third country, there is no case for supporting people to remain here for a further challenge through judicial review. If their essential fear is persecution in the place from which they fled and they are being removed to a safe third country, they can pursue in that country an asylum claim or an appeal against their removal from the UK. There is no case for supporting such people here. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow picked up the point about the Secretary of State seeking to carry out a judicial review. When that situation arises, the Secretary of State may well feel that it is appropriate to test a particular judgment. In those circumstances, the Bill is flexible enough to allow regulations to be made to accommodate deportation of appropriate persons. It could be done through voluntary organisations or in other ways. 
<P>
An appeal is most likely against people who have been granted a right to work or who are on benefit&#151;the most probable reason for mounting a judicial review. People on the benefits system, people authorised for a grant or people on the benefits system, people authorised for a grant or people who have gained some other success are most likely to be those against whom the Secretary of State wishes to appeal. If that were not the case, regulations could be drafted that would allow the particular circumstances of a person who had good reasons for remaining here to be considered. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about adjudicators' recommendations. Our intention is that they should be dealt with quickley in future. Adjudicators are discouraged from making recommendations, though some of them still do. We want to change the system so that compassionate issues can be addressed not at the end of the process&#151;as they are now, further dragging out the proceedings&#151;but soon after or at the time of the intitial decision. 
<P>
It is important to grasp that in future the initial decision will not be solely about refugee status. It will also be about whether human rights grounds exist under the ECHR, which would allow that person a status in the UK. Immigration grounds other than asylum or ECHR will also be considered to establish whether a person should be allowed to remain in the UK&#151;including compassionate issues within concessions. Once a decision has been made about a particular person, by issues that would have gone to the Minister at the end of the process under the current system, will in future go to the Minister&#151;perhaps for a decision on concessions or tissues outside the rules&#151;during the interim period between the decision and the appeal. The Minister would have an opportunity to deal with representations from Members of Parliament earlier in the process than is usual now. Only a small number of cases produce compassionate grounds at the end of rather than during a case. They can be tackled quickly.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not necessarily disagree with the substance of the Minister's comments. He claims that a Minister will take account of compassionate circumstances at an early stage. I may be wrong, but I thought that he said that such circumstances would be examined by the decision-maker in the Home Office before being considered by a Minister at an early stage. I may share the Minister's views, but it is not good enough for the ECHR, because the case would have to go before an appellate authority&#151;a court. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The initial decision about a person who enters the country and wishes to make a claim will be based on whether he has an ECHR point on which to remain. A Home Office official will consider that on behalf of the Secretary of State. He will also consider whether the person has a claim to refugee status or whether the concessions include any compassionate circumstances that would enable the entrant to remain in the United Kingdom. There are many compassionate reasons for granting someone exceptional leave to remain, but not refugee status. The official who made the initial decision would take all those matters, and any other immigration grounds, into account. 
<P>
There are other circumstances, which are outside the concessions, the usual grounds for compassion and the rules. Those circumstances would probably be presented to a Minister after the initial decision and before the appeal. Such cases are currently brought to a Minister after the appeal. A Minister would&#151;as I do&#151;usually refuse to consider those cases until after the appeal. 
<P>
I believe that we should speed up the process and ensure that people who have compassionate reasons for remaining in the United Kingdom do not have to wait for an unnecessary appeal, which they may lose, when ultimately they have a good case for remaining. That is not the best way of tackling matters. It is better to act earlier in the process so that a Member of Parliament or whoever can present the compassionate grounds to the Minister, who can decide whether to exercise his discretion. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Walthamstow envisaged a process whereby the Minister would deal with compassionate cases after the appeal. That will happen rarely. In practice, the Minister is unlikely to reopen a case that should have been tackled before the appeal. Members of Parliament should be discouraged from raising matters that should have been presented after the initial decision. However, there will be flexibility; we would not prevent a Member of Parliament from raising a constitutent's case. 
<P>
Some lawyers and immigration advisers ran a scam of making representations late on a Friday. Members of Parliament decided not to become involved in those last-minute representations. Many Members of Parliament believed that they were being deliberately put upon by unscrupulous advisers. That has now stopped. Consequently, I deal with substantially fewer cases late on a Friday. Unless the grounds are exceptional, removal will go ahead. 
<P>
Under the new system, Members of Parliament will be free to make representations after the initial decision. The Minister will consider them fully. However, should there be circumstances at the end of the process which the Member of Parliament feels could not have been presented earlier and which the Minister ought to consider, the Minister will have to do so. However, he will be reluctant to do so unless there are good and exceptional and grounds for reopening the case. 
<P>
We are therefore seeking an end to the process of constant prevarication. We are seeking to create a system in which everyone knows when they have reached the end of the process. They will have received a decision and had a chance to appeal, and they will know when it is time to go. We will not allow appeals to be mounted one after another to delay the inevitable decision. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said that she had come across cases in which people were being encouraged to bring unnecessary appeals. We must try to stop that process, cracking down on unscrupulous advisers and lawyers. We must create a system that has finality for asylum seekers, their families and everyone one else. 
<P>
I was asked about people who could not return to Sierra Leone and other countries. Such circumstances may well arise and we must ensure that the regulations deal with them. 
<P>
However, there is a difficulty surrounding circumstances such as those relating to China. People know at the beginning of the process that the Chinese Government are reluctant to accept back certain asylum seekers. Indeed, they accept hardly anyone. 
<P>
Such circumstances make it difficult to deal with particular groups of people. We are in discussions with the Chinese authorities and have had successful discussions with the Ethiopian authorities. I met the Minister with the relevant responsibilities in Addis Ababa last year, and discussed how to ensure that Ethiopia accepted back refused asylum seekers. Ethiopia is now accepting such people, so the system is working. We are trying to work with the Chinese authorities to see whether they will accept back some of those who ought not to be here. 
<P>
Therefore, difficulties are involved and we must examine ways of addressing them. Clearly, we are presented with a problem if someone cannot be returned under any circumstances. We envisage providing the voluntary sector with funds to support those in such a position for period. However, if such a period is prolonged, we will have to examine the case in that context, as is true all too often now. 
<P>
It is right that hon. Members should raise the issue of difficult cases, as we have to cope with such problems in the detail of the regulations and the detail of applying the provisions. However, we want to send the vast majority of asylum seekers the clear message that, once their case and appeal are rejected, the end is in sight. 
<P>
For the sake of the children, families will be supported until they leave the United Kingdom. However, individual asylum seekers who are not responsible for children must realise that they will be expected to leave once their appeal is rejected. That is what our decisions and how we make them are all about. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will the Minister clarify something? He referred to the Secretary of State challenging decisions in exceptional cases. Does the Minister expect provision for discretion to be made in the regulations so that the Secretary of State may do that? Will the Secretary of State have the power to continue discretionary payments under Part VI of the Bill? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We have already said in a previous discussion that we will consult on the 14 days, therefore we are prepared to consider how the support mechanisms will operate in particular circumstances. The Bill and our documents set out the broad principles on which we expect to operate the system and, in the case of the Bill, the principles on which the system must operate under the law. There is a greater degree of discretion on these issues in our policy statements. 
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State will probably undertake a judicial review of only a handful of cases in any year. Those people will either be supported directly or, more likely, we would encourage the voluntary sector to make some payments and we would fund it to do so. Support would therefore be provided indirectly. That would be one of the ways that we would intend to do it. The aim is therefore not to create a whole series of circumstances in which we would exercise a ministerial discretion to continue payments. We intend to ensure that the regulations set out clearly how the system will operate. Individual cases will have to be dealt with via other means, primarily the voluntary sector making direct payments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I understand that judicial review is sometimes used to string cases out. I have seen quite a few cases where solicitors have told constituents that they should go for judicial review when it is blatantly obvious that it would be a complete waste of time. The only reason to do it is either to string things out or, more likely, to get a bit of money into the solicitor's pocket. The Minister says that 6 per cent. of cases succeed, so 100 per cent. are not futile. Perhaps he might be prepared to consider a mechanism for extending support at least in cases where people get leave to move the judicial review. A great many cases fall at the first hurdle. The futile, frivolous ones do not get leave to move a judicial review. The court examines them, says that there is no case and that is the end of it. Those who go beyond that point, however, can sometimes continue for a considerable time. Could that be looked at? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> When I said that 6 per cent. succeeded at judicial review, that does not mean that 6 per cent. got the right to remain. A judicial review is on a point of law and they may well have succeeded in winning that, but it did not result in their being allowed to remain in the UK. Many will not remain in the UK and will subsequently go on to lose other points of law. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I accept that only a small number go through the process and as a result of the judicial review are allowed to remain in the UK, but I am worried that even a small number of people should not be left high and dry in the process. There might be some way to look at continued support for them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend raises a valid point. I will consider it and write to him. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I am grateful for that helpful response. I support what the Minister was saying about better quality initial decision making. That is critical. The more resources that are put into making good-quality decisions at the beginning, the better. There will be fewer unnecessary appeals and fewer cases that are completely pointless. I wish that I were convnced that this will work easily for us. Having said that I support it, I suspect that as Members of Parliament we will still have a great many people turning up to see us at the end of the process when everything else has failed. We get people now who have had an initial refusal and are waiting for an appeal, but a great many come to us right at the end of the process and I fear that that will continue. I do not wish to undermine the Minister's point about initial decision-making as that is very important.

<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> It is the well-known ``You're my last hope'' syndrome. Even if the Minister were a genius and completely transformed the system, I suspect that we would still see people on Friday afternoons who tell us that we are their last hope. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that. When I sit in my advice surgery or pick up the phone and those are the first words I hear, my heart sinks. I know that there will be few cases that I can do anything about. People will still come to see us and we will have to deal with them. I do not believe in going to Ministers with trivial cases that have no hope of success. 
<P>
Finally, I turn to the question of people who cannot be removed such as those from Sierra Leone and the like. I understand the difficulties with countries such as China but if there is something in the regulations that can be looked at, it would help. People need a degree of certainty so that they know where they stand and what to expect at the end of the process. The more uncertainty there is, the more cases will come to our surgeries and the more Ministers will receive representations to do this or that outside the rules or to extend support. That is not a helpful way to run any system. The more certainty there can be, the better. It would be helpful if those points could be looked at in the regulations. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 755, in page 45, line 18, at end insert&#151; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) For the purposes of this Part, the Secretary of State may inquire into, and decide, the age of any person.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The amendment appears to be technical, but it raises some important issues. It gives the Secretary of State the power to decide the age of any person. We have already referred to the issue in previous debates. It is necessary because asylum seekers may claim to be a certain age to achieve a benefit. Certain young men who appear to be well into their 20s, 30s or 40s have claimed to be 17 in order to be supported under the Children Act 1989 where the benefits are more generous. 
<P>
Given that we are setting different levels of benefit for different age groups, we might face the same difficulties in the future. Clearly, if the applicant can produce a birth certificate or some similar evidence of age it may be conclusive. In the absence of proof, the Secretary of State will need to make a reasonable decision about a person's age in order to assess whether he is entitled to a particular level of support. I stress that the decision must be a reasonable one based on the evidence before the Secretary of State. Obviously these matters are subject to judicial review in the normal way and in some circumstances appeal rights may arise. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I rise briefly to say that we will return later&#151;with amendments&#151;to this important subject. I heard what the Minister said, but not all decisions taken by the Secretary of State&#151;under any Government, I am not making a party political point&#151;prove to be correct in the long run. As I said, we will table amendments on this important subject later. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased that the Minister spoke to this important amendment. It is helpful for the provision to be built into the Bill so that it can be challenged when a decision is disputed. Can the Minister shed any more light on the mechanisms that the Secretary of State will use? Part of the problem with age determination is the conflict of views about who should make that determination&#151;should a panel of expert paediatricians be consulted or should it be done on a more ad hoc basis? Does the Minister have any idea at this stage about how the process of age determination can be improved so that those who support the asylum seekers and the Secretary of State can agree on a definition rather than end up in conflict about it, which frequently happened in the past with Secretaries of State of both parties? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Essentially, it amounts to making judgments on the balance of probabilities and weighing up the evidence presented. Judgments can be made through documentary medical evidence or simply through observation. It would be decided that someone who looked the hon. Gentleman's age was not 17. If he looked my age, that certainly would be the conclusion. As I said, the decision has to be made on the balance of probabilities as to whether a medical report is required. 
<P>
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said that it is extremely difficult to make an objective age assessment. I gather that the college will try to provide us with some guidance. I repeat that it is difficult to establish age on the basis of appearance, when people's medical and nutritional circumstances, for example, vary so much. 
<P>
Because of the difficulty of making such judgments, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a guarantee that we will get it right in every case. We will endeavour to do so and the law will require us to be reasonable in making the judgment. In the light of Pepper v. Hart, I have already mentioned that a decision will be taken on the balance of probability in the light of documentary and other evidence, including the evidence of assertion that any person can make. If someone says that he is a certain age, that has to be given some weight. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien It may be useful, because the clause deals with aspects of part VI, to set out the Government's broadapproach to the Bill and to examine how these specific provisions fit into it. </B><P>
<P>
Clause 73 provides definitions of several terms that are integral to the new support arrangements. It also defines the end of the asylum process and provides that support will end on a prescribed day after that period, although there will be a safety net for families with children. We are presently minded to opt for a period of 14 days, but we have agreed to reflect further after consultation. 
<P>
I should like to set out, in the limited time available, how the Government regard the Bill. The objective is to ensure an immigration and asylum system that works. With particular respect to the asylum provisions, the aim is to secure integrity to a system that is under considerable stress. My own comments and those of the hon. Member for Hertsmere have already highlighted the shambles that is the asylum system. We can investigate how we arrived at that shambles, and how to get out of it. Everyone agrees that the current system&#151;
