<H4><center>Tuesday 18 January 2000</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. John Butterfill in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/003/2000003.htm">Government Resources and Accounts Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Davis </B>(Haltemprice and Howden): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I am concerned about the accuracy of the official record of our proceedings because they have a constitutional dimension and will be examined by members of the other place. It is important that not only the report of our proceedings, but what is said during them is accurate. Last Thursday morning, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury told the Committee, when referring to my amendment No. 24, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the amendment would prohibit the flexibility to adopt the new and revised standard because the format would be specified in the Bill."--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 13 January 2000; c. 96.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An exchange followed between my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and the Economic Secretary, who intimated, no doubt with briefing from her civil servants, that such detail was not specified in the Companies Act 1985. I would not want that to be taken as authoritative by anyone who reads our proceedings--people may take the Treasury's view as authoritative. I have made available the relevant part of the 1985 Act, which highlights in more detail than my amendment the requirements on companies. Is it possible to make those pages available to all members of the Committee, because the 1985 Act clearly prescribes the form and content of the accounts to be submitted, unlike my amendment, which was straightforward and limited to the principle rather than the detail?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for me, as the right hon. Member is aware, but I have no objection to the papers being made available for the convenience of the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Resource accounts: scrutiny</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [13 January]: No. 33, in page 4, line 2, at the end to insert the words--
<P>
'(3A) The Comptroller and Auditor General may examine any performance statement which he receives from a department under section 5(4A) and report thereon.'--[Mr. David Davis.]
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis) has been reading the Committee's proceedings, and I was doing the same late last night. I must beg the Committee's indulgence because, perhaps as a result of inspecting the inelegance of my exposition or the incoherence of the Economic Secretary's logic, I developed a severe eye infection and had to go to hospital late last night to have it dealt with. I discovered that under the new Labour Administration, the accident and emergency unit at Guy's hospital has been moved and that I had to traipse across London, as a result of which I am somewhat lacking in complete coherence today. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I take a little longer than usual to get to the point.
<P>
I was explaining why we must support amendment No. 33. I reflected on the comments that have been made and perhaps the best and quickest way of making my argument is to examine the contrapositive position. Let us suppose that amendment No. 33 had been proposed in the opposite sense and that instead of saying that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Comptroller and Auditor General may examine any performance statement which he receives",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it had proposed the opposite and stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Comptroller and Auditor General may"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"examine any performance statement".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would have been a remarkable amendment. All members of the Committee will agree that the Comptroller and Auditor General has, through the many tenants of that office, always performed the role of acting for Parliament in the public interest. It would be remarkable if such a person were prohibited form examining performance statements that he receives.
<P>
As I understand it, all that my right hon. Friend's amendment would ensure is that we enshrine in law the principle that we would not wish to see defeated in law: the Comptroller and Auditor General may examine any performance statement. It is an extraordinarily weak amendment. My right hon. Friend could well have tabled one suggesting that the Comptroller and Auditor General must examine any performance statement or that Departments must submit performance statements. The amendment would simply ensure that no one can interpret the Bill as in any way prohibiting the Comptroller and Auditor General from examining performance statements.
<P>
I cannot believe that it can be the intention of the Economic Secretary or the Government so to prohibit the Comptroller and Auditor General, so I hope that we will hear either that she and the Government accept the amendment or that, again, an amendment is not necessary. If the latter is the argument, I suppose that there is more merit in it in this case than in some others, because I can see that, in the absence of a prohibition, it could be argued that the Comptroller and Auditor General may examine the statements. However, my right hon. Friend, in his capacity as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has told us that he and his colleagues on the PAC and the National Audit Office believe that there is a doubt. I hope that the Minister will make an unequivocal statement that the Government would expect the Comptroller and Auditor general to examine such of the performance statements as he wants to examine and would be enabled to do so, and that, if they do not want to accept the amendment, they will clarify the Comptroller and Auditor General's ability to examine the performance statements in some other way. That is a minimum condition of acceptability.
<P>
I want to relay to the Committee the fact that, in another incarnation, the guru on these matters said something very interesting. I am not often in receipt of letters from those who are not constituents of mine, as nobody who is not a constituent of mine has ever heard of me, but I was in receipt of a letter from someone called Mr. Des McConaghy of 5, Glenluce road, Liverpool. In this extraordinary democracy of ours, Mr. McConaghy has been following our Committee's proceedings in great detail. He wrote to the secretary of the Public Accounts Commission and to me. He has been reading the book written in 1998 entitled "Public Expenditure: Who really controls it and how?", which was written by none other than the head of the Government accountancy service, Professor Likierman. Mr. McConaghy has drawn my attention to this book.
<P>
I know, Mr. Butterfill, that you upbraided our colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Bench when they sought to give what the Economic Secretary later uncharitably called a book review. Although I would not have the temerity to offer any review of a book written by the head of the Government accountacy service--albeit before he became head of it--I want to relay to the Committee the direct relevance to my right hon. Friend's amendment of his statement in that book. In his book, Professor Likierman said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This situation"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the relationships between Parliament, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the PAC on one side and the Government on the other--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may not be satisfactory for supporters of open government".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was right about that; it is not. Nor, he said, might it be satisfactory for supporters
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of a stronger role for Parliament"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was right again: it is not satisfactory for those of us who want a stronger role for Parliament. He went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If a stronger role does emerge, departmental Select Committees are likely to be the engine pushing it forward."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the point behind my right hon. friend's amendment. By giving the Comptroller and Auditor General the ability to review performance statements, Select Committees will be alerted to the significance of such statements, which will give them another lever with which to begin the awesome and tremendously important task of bringing the Executive to heel and trying to ensure that they are living up to their own performance statements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has not only received a letter from Des McConaghy, but has had a chance to read that gentleman's article in the October to December issue of Public Money and Management, entitled "Measuring (Accountable) Success-Analysis of "The Government's Measures of Success'". At the end of his article, Mr. McConaghy states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A systematic external process of validation is a technical and a constitutional necessity."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He has put his finger on the issue. If we were to follow his advice, we would certainly vote for the PAC's amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is, as so often, right. [Interruption.] The fact that he represents the wrong party does not mean that he cannot occasionally be right. I believe that that is referred to as big-tent politics by Government Members.
<P>
The Chief Secretary, the Financial Secretary and the Economic Secretary should have accepted the offer that I made towards the conclusion of the debate on Second Reading that we would withdraw our amendment if the Government set up a Special Standing Committee before which evidence could be brought. People such as Mr. McConaghy would then have been able to appear before us and expose matters such as that raised by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). Perhaps the embarrassment to the Economic Secretary of having to accept this eminently sensible amendment, or the worse embarrassment of having to reject it, would not then have arisen. She would have been able to hear such evidence and rephrase the Bill of her own accord.
<P>
However, that did not happen, and we now need to find the levers with which the PAC and departmental Select Committees can publicly scrutinise the Government's performance. Unless those performance statements can be so inspected, there is no point to them other than glitz and glitter. The over-modest amendment, with its merely permissive intent, represents the minimalist position, and deserves the Committee's support.

<P>

<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B>
<P>
I am grateful to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen for the points that they have made during debate, which now spans both last week and this week.
<P>
The Government strongly believe in the importance of modernising our public services and continually improving their quality, efficiency and customer responsiveness. In order to do that, we have set each Department, and some cross-cutting areas and units, public service agreements explaining what targets will be achieved, and by when, with the resources allocated. If that is to be a force for accountability, as the Government wish, the information that supports those targets must be of high quality. It cannot be overemphasised that that is in the interests of everyone--front-line staff, Ministers, Parliament and the public.
<P>
Amendment No. 25, which was rejected when we debated it last week, suggested that performance information should be the subject of a report from the accounting officer. Amendment No. 33 suggests that such a report could in turn be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden said that that would be a straightforward matter, and cited the example of our target of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"increasing the coverage of nursery places for three-year-olds from 34 per cent. to 66 per cent. by 2002, focusing on the most deprived areas of the country."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to explain that the Comptroller and Auditor General would then
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"check the systems for collecting the information, the veracity of the conclusions and whether the outcome has been represented fairly."--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 13 January 2000; c.137.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How straightforward a matter is that? The CAG would need to be able to go into local authority, and even private sector, nurseries and form a judgment about how many nursery places each could reasonably be expected to provide. I do not believe that nurseries would welcome such intrusions. Moreover, he would have to form a judgment as to which were the most deprived areas of the country, which is a matter of policy if ever there was one. That highlights the difficulties that would take the Comptroller and Auditor General away from auditing and matters of fact into a political arena which he has always rightly avoided.
<P>
I believe that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden agrees with the need to stay out of the policy arena in these matters.  I remind him of his comment when questioning the Chief Secretary to the Treasury at the Public Accounts Committee hearing last Wednesday. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am entirely happy that the Government should define what performance measurement should be. After all, that very often arises straight out of a political party's manifesto." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Traditionally, the role of the Public Accounts Committee and of the comptroller and Auditor General has been kept out of the political arena. It is important for the credibility of their role that they do not become tied up in political debates, but concentrate on matters of fact that can be substantiated.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Ministers are responsible for the performance of their Departments, hence the system of published targets formally presented to Parliament and the annual reporting against them that the Government have introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Economic Secretary respond to a point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden during our proceedings last Thursday? During a discussion on bringing the Comptroller and Auditor General into politics, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Let me point out quite how ridiculous this argument is. The CAG is explicitly tasked with the assessment of value for money in Government activity. Time and time again, that takes him close to the effectiveness of policy."--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 13 January 2000; c.139.] <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Lady agree that that is so?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The Comptroller and Auditor General has a role in a number of areas and has undoubtedly done valuable work on value-for-money studies. The hon. Gentleman made a point about taking the CAG close to the effectiveness of policy. Taking something close is different from taking it into an arena. In this case, taking something into that arena is very different from being careful to avoid it, despite going close to it on occasions.
<P>
I should like to say something more general about the Government's approach to guaranteeing the quality of the information that they collect and publish. This is important for ensuring the credibility of the new performance management framework that they have introduced. Ministers and officials are aware that they need to be clear from the outset about which measures they have chosen to monitor and target, and why. They have to be sure that those measures provide a strategic focus for work in an organisation without wrecking its balance. Above all, they recognise the need for the information that they collect to be owned at the most front-line levels of organisations, while being subject to some form of checking to ensure accuracy and consistency.
<P>
Quality assurance checks are already in place. Information from many measures is needed by local line management to make day-to-day decisions and set priorities. It is often in the interests of people near the coal-face to ensure that the data that they return to the centre is of high quality. Departments have analytical services and internal auditors who make systematic checks of data quality and advise on methodology and technical matters. Policy experts in the Treasury also hold quarterly meetings with Departments to go through returns against their PSA targets, and use them as an opportunity to raise any data quality issues. The Government are doing more than that. Our new arrangements for national statistics will provide a source of central expertise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Economic Secretary says that the Treasury will be able to raise the question of data quality with Departments. How will it be able to do that without conducting the kind of checks that nursery schools, for example, might find obnoxious?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The Treasury is looking at the way in which information supplied by Departments is panning out against their PSA targets, and raising quality issues. There is no reason to believe that that raises the issue to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
The Government's new arrangements for national statistics will provide a source of central expertise to help Departments with the statistical validation of the measurement systems, and an independent and external check in the form of the new statistics commission. Discussions are still going on as to which measures will be covered by the national statistics banner, but there is a growing presumption that statistical measures used to support PSA targets will be included.
<P>
The Government have not ruled out considering other  options as the new system settles down. Officials from the Treasury and elsewhere are working with National Audit Office officials on a series of relevant projects. Novel ways in which to draw on the expertise of the National Audit Office, the Audit Commission and other bodies will be considered.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for West Dorset for his even-handed observation that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The amendment is not essential to the Bill".--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 13 January 200; c.142]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is precisely the point. The Comptroller and Auditor General already produces some very useful reports on performance measures, and no Labour member of the Committee wants to undermine that in any way. Our proposals for the statistics commission show that we are committed to producing reliable figures, in which the public can have confidence and against which our success can be measured. As my right hon Friend the Chief Secretary pointed out during the recent Public Accounts Committee hearing, a number of bodies have legitimate interests in this matter, and we do not want to rule out other options at this stage.
<P>
The Government are conscious that this new and challenging system requires enormous efforts from departmental public servants on the ground who collect, analyse and interpret information.
<P>
We want the system to improve public services and make them more accountable, and we believe that it will. If the Opposition do not intend to withdraw the amendment, I invite the Committee to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I shall start by reminding the Committee that the key aspect of the resource accounting revolution is the measurement of outcomes, on which, as I pointed out last week, the Bill is completely silent. If the matter is not handled properly to Parliament's satisfaction, that policy revolution may be lost.
<P>
Secondly, the Economic Secretary has advanced many technical arguments on the various audit options. The central issue is the role, rights and powers of Parliament, but her suggestion--if it amounts to any form of audit option--would bypass Parliament. The Public Accounts Committee found that suggestion unsatisfactory, and so should this Committee.
<P>
Thirdly, the Economic Secretary offered the alternative of the new statistics commission. The proposal for an independent statistics commission was one of the most attractive in the Labour party manifesto, but what is proposed in the Green Paper--or White Paper, I cannot remember which--does not constitute an independent body. It is in no way as independent as the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is appointed by the Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, and can be dismissed only by the House of Commons and House of Lords. The Comptroller and Auditor General has a separate budget that is provided by Parliament, not the Treasury. Within the limits imposed by the Bill, he is completely unfettered. That is true independence. The new statistics commission offers not true independence but an appeal to the Prime Minister, who is being regarded as impartial. Clearly, in this context, no Prime Minister is impartial.
<P>
The Economic Secretary, who offered an Aunt Sally in respect of nursery schools, has not been properly briefed by the Treasury on the extent to which the National Audit Office liaises with the Audit Commission and private sector auditors.
<P>
Such liaisons work, provided that power rests with the Comptroller and Auditor General, who can issue directions and requirements for which the Economic Secretary's proposals do not allow.
<P>
The Economic Secretary referred twice, in detail, to the oblique comments that the Chief Secretary made to the Public Accounts Committee last week, on 12 January. He said that there was a risk that as the Committee 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"came closer to some of these perfomrance and target issues... you get drawn closer to the political arena".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The idea that a Select Committee should be near to something important in the political arena is a terrifying prospect. Those who drafted the National Audit Act 1983 foresaw such a pack of excuses; I shall not put it more lightly, as that is what it is. The Economic Secretary did not repeat her incorrect assertion of last week. It was perhaps not incorrect in her terms but misleading for the Committee to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Legal advice suggest that such constraints"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the constraints in the 1983 Act--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would also prevent him from critising the performance measures and targets that the Government, as included in its service agreement".--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 13 January 2000; c. 101.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that is not the case--the Comptroller and Auditor General already does that, as he acknowledged in his closing remarks. The Treasury foresaw the possibility of such an argument, which is dealt with in section 6(2)of the 1983 Act. It says that subsection(1), which empowers the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out examinations of economy, efficiency and effectiveness
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall not be construed as entitling the Comptroller and Auditor General to question"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
these words are important--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the merits of the policy objectives of any department, authority or body in respect of which an examination is carried out."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In debate at the time, the then Chief Secretary, Leon Brittan, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"broadly speaking, it is in accordance with the current practice that policy objectives can be questioned in the sense of saying what they are, but their merits cannot be questioned. One can question the instruments used to secure these objectives",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is what would happen in a value-for-money study. The then Chief Secretary went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying, "I do not understand what the policy objectives are' that is different from saying "I think that they are wrong'. The latter he cannot do, but I do not see how one can stop him doing the former".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The formulation, "merits of policy objectives", was inserted as an amendment, in place of "policies". Its importance was recognised by Mr. St. John-Stevas, as he was then known, when he stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>""policy'is very imprecise, and could have been interpreted by departments to obstruct attempts by the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the instrument by which the Government chose to achieve their objectives."--[Official Report, Standing Committee C, 25 March 1983; c.117-20.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, such a line of defence was foreseen in 1983. Subsequently, the section has been interpreted to mean that the Comptroller and Auditor General can look at how policy objectives are implemented, including whether policy instruments are consistent with the Government's objectives, as long as the merits of those objectives are not questioned. In terms of assessing performance measures, the Comptroller and Auditor General has already done so in the Meteorological Office--which was perhaps not especially controversial--in the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, which would be controversial, and in the Benefits Agency, which would certainly be controversial.
<P>
I cannot see how any of the Economic Secretary's arguments stand up. Yet again, the mandarin line has been taken. I do not hold her responsible for that--she has to defend the line that she is given. That line was foreseen in 1983, when the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General were last updated, on behalf of Parliament, to ensure that the Executive can be held to account. As a result of the unsaid half of the Bill, a revolution in policy delivery is in process. It is vital that Parliament has the right to have its say on that, and the right to be able to trust the figures put before it. There is only one person whom Parliament can properly trust in that regard: the Comptroller and Auditor General. I intend to press the amendment to a vote.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I should like to reiterate some of the comments of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden.
<P>
The amendment is designed to help the Government to achieve their stated objectives. The Government talk about modernising public services, improving their performance and making them more accountable. The Prime Minister spoke on television of his frustration at the slowness with which Whitehall meets his Government's aims and objectives, which include transforming and modernising public services. To speed up that process, the Government rightly want to impose performance measures. The framework of the Bill contains the correct approach.
<P>
If the Government really are frustrated and want to modernise public services, they should ensure that the proposed framework is not captured by mandarins. Whitehall could mess about with the framework--mandarins could turn it around or upside down. They are highly intelligent people who are more than able to invent performance measures and ways of collating information that shroud the real situation.
<P>
That is the crux of my argument. I am trying to help the Government. If they want to promote efficiency and quality in the public services, they must ensure that someone outside the bureaucracy checks the figures. Otherwise, when reports reach the Economic Secretary's desk and civil servants tell her how well the Treasury is doing, how will she be sure that what she is told is the truth? She may move to another Department or be promoted to the Cabinet, and have to judge how well the Treasury is doing. If she wants to be sure that she can rely on what she is told, there must be external validation.
<P>
The amendment is so much in the Government's interest that it should be completely acceptable to them. I accept that the new data that will be produced under the framework, which will involve public service agreements and output and performance analysis, will be complex and difficult to collect.
<P>
We are at the start of a process that contains the right measures. It will not be easy to get full agreement about how to make the system consistent or how collation should be conducted. The process will be complex, but that does not mean that we should leave the matter to mandarins and to the internal workings of Government; such complexity is a strong argument in support of external validation. However, the Economic Secretary's arguments in this context appeared to go in the other direction. If her arguments are unpicked, she appears to be pushing in the opposite direction to that which is suggested by the conclusions that she seeks to reach.
<P>
The Government have made much of the need for greater transparency in public services. The Treasury claims to have led the way in that regard in relation to how the Government issue figures and accounts. How can the Economic Secretary claim that the Government are pursuing transparency if the relevant performance measures are not externally validated? That does not make sense--it defies all logic.
<P>
If the Economic Secretary does not accept the amendment--it appears that she will not--I urge her to say to her political colleagues, "We want to take the public service by the scruff of the neck and turn it around. We want to be sure that the data about our performance are correct, so that we can do what we came into politics to do."
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden said, if the Minister used some of the provisions of the National Audit Act 1983, that would deal with many of her arguments. If she tables on Report an amendment with parallel words to those in the 1983 Act to try to ensure that performance standards and their validation are put on a statutory basis, she will have all-party support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): In 2000, and in relation to a Bill that is about starting to bring up to date Government accounting, I considered the Treasury's response to this extremely modest amendment scarcely creditable, for all the reasons that we have just heard and at three levels: that of the public at large being able to gain information on performance that they can believe, rather than figures that are merely political footballs; that of Parliament doing its proper job of keeping a check on the Executive; and, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, that of the Government knowing whether they are being flannelled by Ministers or whether their policies are working. As he said, we need proper, independent auditing of performance figures.
<P>
I cannot resist saying that when my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset was speaking to this amendment, I saw Professor Likierman put his hand over his face, which I felt expressed some agreement in principle.
<P>
What the Minister said was analogous to the manager of a pension fund in the private sector saying, "I assure you that we intend to produce reliable performance figures, but I don't want them to be independently validated." Wearing our hats in that area, we would want to prosecute such an approach. It is axiomatic that everyone wants independently validated performance figures. That may be much easier to achieve than many of the territories covered in the Bill, and this amendment is unbelievably mild in relation to amendment No. 64.  It does not require the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit independently; it simply says that he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may examine ... and report thereon."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Where the benchmarks may make a full audit quite difficult, the Comptroller and Auditor General would report that he could not comment in an audited fashion because of the problems, but if had varied comments on the benchmarks, that is what the public, Parliament and Ministers should want to hear in order to get it right.
<P>
The extraordinary thing that comes across to me is that the Treasury should go on thinking that it is any use having performance figures that are not properly and independently audited. Why on earth should it take that view? We all know the political issues involved, but that is completely out of date. In a sense, we are wasting our time with the Bill unless we address all the territory that must be addressed. The amendment is a modest, weak and milky beginning, which I should have thought the Government would welcome if they are worried that it would take a while to put in proper independent auditing and performance data.
<P>
Not only Parliaments and Governments but the public are fed up with the political ping-pong about performance data: they are not impressed. Ordinary citizens want to know the truth about performance; they do not want to hear Government and Opposition parties endeavouring to make silly political propaganda. That approach is not what the public want and we should look silly in their eyes if we adopted it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to return briefly to the Economic Secretary's statement that I had said on a previous occasion that performance audit was not essential to the Bill.  I stand by my statement.
<P>
It is arguable that the Bill is related exclusively to the cost and revenue side of Government accounting, and that it should have nothing to do with the value for money or performance. If that argument is correct, I should be less worried about whether the amendment was agreed to because in our consideration of a future Bill we should need to establish, for reasons that we have previously discussed and that do not need to be rehearsed, a proper system of audited performance measures. If we have public performance measures, they need to be audited properly. It is astonishing that we have to debate that subject.
<P>
The Economic Secretary may argue, "The amendment is not the subject of the Bill and is therefore not acceptable.  I shall sweep away from the Bill the slightest reference to this matter. However, I accept that on another occasion we shall do something about the performance side," but she appeared to argue that it would be somehow impractical and/or dangerous--she presented both sides of the argument--for that radical, eccentric and irresponsible figure, the Comptroller and Auditor General, and for that group of radical and eccentric figures, the Public Accounts Committee, and for that group of unelected busybodies, Parliament, to inspect whether performance measures were being satisfied. She should reflect on her comments.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's previous proposals amount to a remarkable set of utterances. For reasons that we have exposed, hers is not a tenable position and it will not survive scrutiny  in the other place. It would be instructive if she said that she opposed the amendment because it does not belong in the Bill rather than because the Government deny that their figures should be properly audited--the latter would be a completely ludicrous proposition.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Although we have already debated this matter and I have already given several responses, it might be worth while making a couple of new points.
<P>
Pension fund results are part of financial results, but other aspects of a fund's performance, including, for example, customer satisfaction, are not, and they are not subject to an independent audit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The Economic Secretary appears to want to knock down analogies. Performance measurements in local government provide a precise analogy to national performance measurements. Why are local government performance measurements required by law to be audited by the Audit Commission?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> There are many differences between local and central Government. The idea that we should mirror the exact arrangements in local government is ridiculous. It would be farcical to argue that the situation in the House should mirror that in local government or that local and central Government would not be treated differently, because they do things in different ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I dispute the Economic Secretary's example. The best practice in private sector companies is for customer satisfaction to be independently audited. Customer satisfaction surveys that are conducted by blue chip companies are almost invariably audited, so that the figures can be trusted. Therefore, the Economic Secretary's own argument undermines her position.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), whose contribution has proved helpful to the Government. He will forgive me if I do not always detect precisely how helpful he is--[Laughter.] Nevertheless, I appreciate his efforts and realise that he has the best possible motives.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also rightly referred to our enthusiasm for modernising government. It is this Government, not previous Governments, who raised these matters, and we are discussing them because we care about them. We are keen to look at the way in which money is spent and what is gained in return. In many ways, it is the Government who, through public service agreements, are making the changes that are before Departments and Parliament. We have an honourable record in respect of the changes that Committee members want to bring about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should correct the Economic Secretary by pointing out that this is a long-standing, tripartisan endeavour. Elements such as performance measures have been discussed and introduced for as long as I can remember. Does she accept that we are discussing not performance measurement but the question of auditing it? Is she maintaining the disanalogy that local government's figures should be honest but central Government's need not?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is deliberately misleading us: he knows that I neither said nor meant that. Clearly, targets that the Government set for themselves are outside the Comptroller and Auditor General's scope as a matter of policy, but it is proper for him to consider target clarity and the accuracy of outturn information. Hon. Gentlemen are failing to acknowledge that distinction.
<P>
We should remember that the 1998 study of EU countries described the UK as a leader in the field of performance measurement, rather than, as some hon. Gentlemen have suggested, a country that is dragging its heels.
<P>
Several hon. Gentlemen have rightly acknowledged that the matter is complicated. We are embarking on a course that, to judge by my experience in local government, will involve jumping through many hoops to gather the correct information, and we are keen to ensure that we do so.
<P>
However, we have not ruled out considering other options as the new system settles down. I reiterate that point because hon. Gentlemen seem not to have paid sufficient attention to it. We are working on a series of relevant projects with officials from the National Audit Office, and considering new ways in which to involve it and the Audit Commission.

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I could almost sense the rising but controlled panic in the mind of the Government Whip, but, alas, we cannot see that translated into fury. Clause 6 is inadequate, but I am confident that you will stop me discussing it further, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The other place will be able to do that for us and we shall return to the matter later.
<P>
I went on at more than usual tedious length when discussing  a previous clause about the number of times that the Treasury is given discretion. When I reflect on my verbosity, I reflect also on the accuracy of my comments. We have now come to clause 7 and we find that, again, the Treasury is to do everything. Subsection (1) states that it  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may direct a government department to prepare...accounts".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not require much imagination to hear the instructions to parliamentary counsel to leave no stone unturned. Having directed a Department to prepare accounts, it could be taken as read that they would be prepared in accordance with directions, but the parliamentary draftsman is at pains to state in subsection (2) that the accounts should be prepared in accordance with directions issued by no less a body than the Treasury. We then see that the Comptroller and Auditor General must report to the Treasury and that the Treasury will lay the certified accounts--I have no objection to that--and that, finally, in subsection (4), that the Treasury may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"direct that this section shall have effect",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on.
<P>
This is another Treasury clause and it is not how we want things to be. I am sure that the Economic Secretary will assure the Committee that in practice the Treasury will always direct a Department to prepare accounts and that it will direct that they be prepared according to the Resource Accounting Manual, to the extent that one can say that that defines anything. I am sure that she will tell us that that has been normal practice for a long time and that there is no reason to enshrine convention in statute. However, I note that she is enshrining convention in statute; she did not need the clause in the first place.
<P>
There was no need to enshrine anything other than normal practice in legislation, and no need to enshrine normal practice, for the reason that it is normal practice. Given that logic, why are subsections (1) and (2) necessary? One may as well simply allow normal practice to continue, and begin the clause with subsection (3). That must involve some degree of intent on the part of the Economic Secretary, unless it is a mistake. Perhaps what she really intends to do is to enshrine, against all possible future contingencies--other than a further Act of Parliament--the principle that the accounts should be properly prepared. In that case, the body that directs the way in which they are prepared should be independent. As the proposed national accounts commission has been rejected, perhaps some other body should be appointed. The obvious candidate is the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being rather unfair to the Government. Subsection (5) makes it clear that they are getting rid of sections in other Acts, and replacing them with subsections (1) and (2). The purpose of the debate is therefore to modernise the language on the statute book. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is a good use of the Committee's time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Subsection (5) may be the operative subsection--in other words, subsections (1) and (2) become necessary once one has undertaken the surgical operation of subsection (5)--although I doubt it. If that were so, I would agree with the hon. Gentleman. However, if the purpose of the clause is to try to modernise the way in which things have been done since 1921, that should not involve merely putting an ancient gloss on them. The matter must be put on a proper footing. Giving the Treasury the power to issue the directions does not do that.
<P>
Another line of attack which could be used against the amendment is that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not a proper person to be directing a Department to do anything. I have some sympathy with that view. It would have been far preferable for a national accounts commission to have been given the role.  Indeed, if the Economic Secretary had accepted the relevant amendments, we would have tabled subsequent amendments to that effect. However, we anticipated that we would not persuade the Economic Secretary in that direction, which is why the amendments are as they stand. We are entirely open to the proposition that another body should be appointed to the task of directing Departments to prepare accounts--for example, the Public Accounts Committee or Parliament.
<P>
In fact, the direction need not have an author. The clause could be rewritten to state that Departments "shall prepare for each financial year accounts" without reference to who directs them. The question would then centre on subsection (2)--in accordance with which standards should the accounts be prepared? The relevant body in that respect would have to be a national accounts commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General, or--if we want to make subsection (2) bodiless--the standard accounting principles of the Accounting Standards Board or another such body.
<P>
We are open to any such rephrasings. If the Economic Secretary believes that it would be improper for the Comptroller and Auditor General to direct Departments, let the subsections be rewritten so that they become authorless or are given an author that is an independent person or body. In those circumstances, we would willingly withdraw the amendment. It is not our purpose to insist that the Comptroller and Auditor General must be the person who directs the accounts to be prepared, or the format of those accounts.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to dwell on a further point relating to the two subsections and the amendment.  If the Economic Secretary believes that the directions issued by the Treasury should govern the preparation of the accounts, that merits further explanation. What will typically be in those directions? Will she tell the Committee how divergences between standard accounting practice as defined in the private sector and the public sector are to be governed? Throughout our discussions, she has made great play of the fact that, in general, the standard accounting principles will govern and that we are discussing only such divergences as are necessary. Indeed, in clause 5(3), there was a specific reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such adaptations as are necessary in the context of departmental accounts."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Economic Secretary has attached great importance to that idea, as do we all.
<P>
We accept that the general background for the preparation of accounts in the public sector will be standard accounting principles. We do not find that difficult to believe. The big issue is that of deviations. How far will deviations be permitted or deemed necessary? What will be the character of those deviations? How will they be limited? As a bare minimum, the Economic Secretary owes us an explanation of the practical limits that will be applied to those deviations. If the amendment were accepted, the problem would not arise because the extent of the deviation would be decided by an independent body. If, however, it is to be negatived, and no proposals of the sort that I have described are to be tabled in its place, the Committee deserves an explanation as to the extent of those deviations.
<P>
After the length of time that the Committee has spent discussing these matters, we particularly need the Economic Secretary to tell us which deviations will be permitted in respect of liability. So far, we have discussed on several occasions the liabilities relating to private finance initiatives, public-private partnerships and pensions. The Economic Secretary has admitted that these issues will not be recognised in an ordinary way on the balance sheet in the accounts that are to be prepared. If she rejects the amendment, will she tell us what limits will be placed on what gets excluded from the balance sheet, in terms of liabilities? Unless we know that, we cannot describe the Bill as a resource accounts Bill. Instead, it will turn into a kind of permissive or creative accounts Bill, which is the intention of neither the Economic Secretary nor the Committee. We need proof that there are to be notes, even if they are limits of practice rather than the set of limits enshrined in law that we would prefer and that the amendment would have instituted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> It would be tempting to rehearse many of the arguments used in our debate on clause 5. Many of the issues are similar, especially those that related to clause 5(2), because they concern the manner in which the accounts should be prepared and the standards to be applied to their preparation, as the hon. Member for West Dorset said. I do not intent to repeat those arguments, but I shall cite one more witness, to whom I did not refer during that debate.
<P>
I referred in a subsequent debate to the book "Audit, Accountability and Government" by Fidelma White and Kathryn Hollingsworth. You will be pleased to know, Mr Butterfill, that I do not intend to give you a history today. In reading the book and looking for other academic works that might give us some theoretical, independent instruction as we go about our work, I found that piece of academic research to be the most recent, up to date and rigorous. Naturally wanting to get the opinions of the authors of the text, I e-mailed them--as one can now do many academics throughout the country--sent them a copy of the Bill and our Second Reading debate and asked for their comments. I am very grateful to Fidelma White, a lecturer in law at University college, Cork, who replied to my request for comments. When we looked together at the question of who should direct the process of setting a framework for the accounts and the form that they should take, she repeated her comments in the book. She said that it was a great shame that the Bill missed the opportunity to put the Financial Reporting Advisory Board on a statutory footing.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset is suggesting with these amendments--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will turn to the amendment before us and will not rehearse previous arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I was in the process of doing that, Mr. Butterfill. I was about to say that, in these amendments, the hon. Member for West Dorset is suggesting that the National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General should direct how the accounts are prepared, not the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. He said that he was not wedded to the proposal, but that if the Government accepted the principle underlying the amendment, he would be happy to withdraw it--I believe I heard him right--and consider other options, such as the Accounting Standards Board or the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. In her reply to my e-mail, Fidelma White said that it was a shame that there was no longer an independent body on a statutory footing.
<P>
I wanted to make that point because of the standing of that academic work and the view that the Government should take of it. Those academics have not only done a study of the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission but looked at the European Court of Auditors and at international practice of auditing public accounts. They argue in their book that this country needs an independent body of that kind.
<P>
Therefore, I and my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) will support the hon. Member for West Dorset if he presses the amendments, but, like him, we want the Government to come back on Report with well-thought-through proposals that develop the practice used in the preparation of the Resource Accounting Manual to ensure that the public, Ministers and Parliament can rely on the accounts and on the way in which they are directed and that the Treasury does not have yet more powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As has been said, much of the debate relates to clause 5. The arguments for the independence of accounting standards are not just for the sake of independence. If we are to have modern national accounts, people must be able to understand the figures easily. The point that my hon. Friend the Minister for West Dorset made about divergence from private sector accounting practices is also extremely important.
<P>
Last Friday, I visited the finance director of a NHS trust in my constituency that is building a new mental hospital under the private finance initiative. We were discussing this issue and I was quite surprised by what he said. The point that he made to me was that the differences between all the accounting projections that he had to produce for the PFI business sector, which had to be produced under Treasury directions, as they would have to be under the clause, were quite substantial. They led to very different figures and to the burning up of an enormous amount of time and money on reconciling the two. I merely point out, at a practical level, that the mysteries and hang-ups in the Treasury's accounting principles will be a significant on-going problem if the Government wish greatly to extend the number of projects built under the PFI. An unnecessary cost and complication would be added.
<P>
There is also the issue of what are, and what is the reason for, the differences in the Treasury's directions with regard to normal standards of commercial accounting. I do not know what they are, and I doubt whether other Members of Parliament do. That exposes the other problem with national accounts. Those of us who understand company accounts would be wrong to think that national accounts are the same; there are many significant divergences.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is ranging rather widely. I am prepared to tolerate that on the understanding that there will not be a stand part debate. He is moving into stand part territory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I accept your point, Mr. Butterfill, and thank you for it.
<P>
I shall summarise by saying that national accounts will simply be produced in accordance with the mystery of Treasury directions. The Bill will not achieve the objective of national accounts on a modern resource basis, which people understand and which would allow collaboration with the private sector. The alternative is to have independent standards analogous to commercial principles, where differences are clearly explained. Otherwise, the Government must set out clearly their standards of accounting, the Treasury's directions, the differences from private sector accounting principles, and the impact of such differences on understanding the different territories covered by national accounts. In terms of its ultimate objective, the Bill is self-defeating.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to answer some of the points made by Opposition Members. I was about to say that it would be in their absence, although I see that one of them has returned to the Room.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for West Dorset, the Government have made it completely clear that normal accounting practices will be followed in respect of matters such as deviations and liabilities. Indeed, normal practices will be enshrined. What the hon. Gentleman refers to as "normal practice" is already set out in legislation. Clause 7 is a replacement for section 5 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921, which allows the Treasury to direct the form of the accounts. I was grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton for pointing that out in his helpful intervention. Indeed, I was glad to see him develop his helpful role in a more promising way, although that took a downturn when he asked questions outside the ambit of this debate.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset, the main accounts that are expected to be prepared under these provisions are those of executive agencies. They will follow the Resource Accounting Manual, and, therefore, generally accepted accounting principles, except where adaptations are necessary in the context of departmental accounts. However, the provisions will also allow for accounts to be prepared on a cash or other non-standard basis where appropriate.  In practice, the form of the accounts will need to be determined in close consultation with the Department by which they are prepared and the National Audit Office.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Economic Secretary has just used the oft-repeated phrase "except where changes are necessary in the context of departmental accounts", but what does it mean?  Who will judge what constitutes a necessary adaptation and to what extent will the accounts deviate from private sector practice?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We had that debate several days ago--the Financial Reporting Advisory Board will determine such matters.  I noted then the hon. Gentleman's reluctance to discuss proposed deviations from standard accounting practices that were set out in information with which all members of the Committee were provided.  There are valid reasons why, in certain cases involving the public sector or particular Departments, unmodified accounting practices are irrelevant or inappropriate.
<P>
It is the Treasury that must consult closely with Departments and the Comptroller and Auditor General, and it is the Treasury that is best placed to determine what accounts are required and their most appropriate and useful format.  It is directly responsible to Parliament for such matters, and particularly for ensuring consistency across Departments.  Consistency in respect of accounts and information is a benefit that Parliament has appreciated since the Gladstone reforms of the 19th century.  We should remember that the Treasury already operates within a framework that the previous Government put in place to limit its discretion in setting accounting policies.  As I have said, the Treasury takes very seriously the independent scrutiny of the FRAB.
<P>
Perhaps I am wrong, but it seems that hon. Members believe that all references to the Treasury should automatically be deleted from all Bills.  They may even believe that Departments should be deleted as well, although they will doubtless expect me to be rather more cautious about that.
<P>
Before turning to the question of the auditor's role, I should express my regret at the verbosity of the hon. Member for West Dorset.  Although he apologised, I am left with no clear impression of his argument.  The ability of auditors to comment independently on accounts is a fundamental principle of auditing.  No one can argue with that premise.  The amendments, which would make the auditor responsible for determining which accounts are to be prepared and on what basis, fly in the face of that principle, because the Comptroller and Auditor General's ability to take an independent view would be compromised.
<P>
Opposition Members proposed a national accounts commission to secure independent standard setting in public accounting, and are now contemplating arrangements that would call into question the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General--the very person whose independence is recognised in statute.  I find that bizarre.
<P>
There is a further possible inconsistency in the Opposition's approach, in that the amendments do not square with their proposals for resource accounts.  Why establish a national accounts commission to issue directions for resource accounts, while at the same time requiring the Comptroller and Auditor General to issue directions for other accounts?
<P>
The amendments are undesirable and unnecessary, and I encourage members of the Committee to oppose them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall first deal with the Economic Secretary's last point, which is either consciously mischievous or unworthy.  She knows--I repeated the point--that we would prefer that the matter be dealt with by a national accounts commission. She and her Whip also took steps to ensure that the Government positively negatived our amendments proposing a national accounts commission even though we were prepared to withdraw them. She thereby made it impossible to use the national accounts commission in this context. She also signalled her intention to negative any further efforts in this regard. She knows perfectly well that we are trying to find another route that involves independence. I thought that I had laboured the point heroically--perhaps to the extinction of the consciousnesses of Committee members--but I reiterate that we are willing to accept more or less anything as a substitute for the Treasury in this regard. We were far from arguing that the Comptroller and Auditor General was the only or the proper body to make such decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making exactly the right point. The Economic Secretary is digging herself into a large hole by arguing that Opposition Members will change their minds. My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury and I tabled relevant amendments in this regard, but because the amendments that referred to the national accounts commission were negatived, you, Mr. Butterfill, were not able to select them. If the Government had accepted our proposals, perhaps we would not need to discuss the relevance of the national accounts commission in this context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I had forgotten that the amendments to which he referred had fallen when our amendment was negatived. That makes my point abundantly clear.
<P>
From time to time, the Economic Secretary amuses herself, and, marginally, the rest of the Committee, by teasing me about my supposed unwillingness to discuss points of substance in "The Background to Whole of Government Accounts", which is a remarkable document that she helpfully provided to Committee members. I returned to the comments that I made earlier in our proceedings on that document, and I realised that I had engaged in the dangerous art of irony. My irony of course failed to be conveyed in the Official Report. That was not a failure on the part of Hansard staff; it happened because my tone of voice was not evident in Hansard and because my sense of humour is insufficiently acute to indicate irony. When I make ironic utterances during my discussions with the Economic Secretary about the Bill, perhaps I should hold up a notice that says, "Irony". In my earlier comments, I tried to suggest that I did not want to bore Committee members by discussing the substance of this matter. However, that is obviously what the Economic Secretary wants me to do, and by golly I shall do so.
<P>
This mater is central to our debate on the amendment and to all of the subjects that we have discussed recently as well as to those to which we shall come during the next few days. Annex B to "The Background to Whole of Government Accounts"
contains a list of statements of standard accounting practice. The second page of that annex refers to SSAP24, which is entitled "Accounting for Pension Costs". It may help Committee members if I quote the remarkable statement that annex B makes about SSAP24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. I should reiterate the comment that I made to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. If we are to go down this route, I shall not be able to tolerate a stand part debate on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I entirely understand that, Mr. Butterfill. I seek your guidance about whether it would be best to read out that quote now or to do so during the stand part debate. It might be convenient to do so now and to abandon the stand part debate.
<P>
Annexe B states that SSAP24 "Applies." Well, that is good news. The Annexe continues somewhat elliptically, although I believe that I understand it. It refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Chapter 4.5 of the RAM"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or Resource Accounting Manual. I have that document before me, and I shall refer to it in detail in a moment. We are about to follow a remarkable daisy chain, and it would help the Economic Secretary and other Committee members if they had a copy of it before them. Annexe B continues: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"But is should be noted that the accrued occupational pension scheme liabilities are shown as part of separate scheme statements which are not part of departmental resource accounts, but published alongside them. The statements are prepared on an accruals basis."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That remarkable statement does not matter two  hoots; it is not the point. The point is that the word "applies" is directly contradicted by the next statement, which is, as I said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Chapter 4.5 of the RAM"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Chapter 4.5 of the Resource Accounting Manual is entitled, "Pension and Superannuation Liabilities". The problem is that the three pages that contain sections 4.5.1 to 4.5.19 do not contain the slightest reference to the real pension liabilities of Her Majesty's Government. There are references to pension schemes and liabilities of Departments and agencies. The document about which the Economic Secretary has been teasing me is specifically headed, "The Background to Whole of Government Accounts." The public are supposed to believe that the document and the Bill refer to a set of accounts that will present the state of public finances. There is no other way in which an ordinary human being could interpret "whole of Government accounts".
<P>
One of the most important features, by any reckoning, of the state of the nation's finances is the huge liability to existing and future basic state pensioners. It has been assessed that that liability is 300 billion, but its actual future value will exceed that many times. That liability is not mentioned in sections 4.5.1 to 4.5.19 of the Resource Accounting Manual.
<P>
When I asked the Economic Secretary whether that public sector pension liability would be included, she used a remarkable and tell-tale phrase and said that she did not think so. The Economic Secretary, who has been teasing me about failing to deal with the substance of the matter, does not think that her much-treasured accounts will include 300 billion--that is, 300,000 million--of present value liability. That is a deviation from ordinary standard accounting practice by any interpretation of the term. If a company had a moral or legal obligation to pay pensioners 300 billion and engaged in the minor discrepancy of failing to enter that in its accounts, someone would notice and complain. That is more or less the essence of our accounting system and that is the sort of thing that it should pick up. Not every company discloses its liabilities, but I shall not make a cheap party political point about companies that do not--[Hon. Members: "Go on."] No, I shall resist that temptation.
<P>
The whole of our accounting system is designed to prevent such details from being left off the balance sheet. The Economic Secretary, in resisting the amendments, is saying, however, that we should rest content with the view that SSAP24 applies, except in the minor respect that it leaves out 300 billion-worth of liability, and that we need not worry about Treasury interpretation because it will follow standard practice. If 300 billion-worth of liability can be omitted, what cannot be omitted? What deviation will not be tolerated? What is the Resource Accounting Manual? How many times during a century, a decade, a year, a week or a day can the Treasury change it? Under the clause the answer is indefinitely. The Resource Accounting Manual could be legally issued and reissued every hour of the day. It could systematically exclude one set of accounts and liabilities on Wednesdays and another on Thursday.
<P>
I parody to make my point and the Treasury would not want to conduct its affairs in that way, but we are being asked to subscribe to a clause that would, as a matter of substance and practical reality, have the effect, as the Economic Secretary thinks--for the record, I note the irony--of excluding 300 billion worth of liabilities and, as a matter of principle, enabling any liabilities to be excluded.  It allows the Resource Accounting Manual to decide what is and what is not to be excluded.
<P>
I admit that there are profound questions about whether the basic state pension is a liability of the state.  Of course I admit that.  The head of the Government accounting service, who is one of the most distinguished accounting theoreticians in this country, is one of the people qualified to judge that.  The point of our amendments is that he and his colleagues are therefore not without an interest.  Their constitutional duty is to serve Ministries, who might not find it convenient to admit a liability of 300 billion.  We therefore want someone else--we do not care whom, as we have tirelessly explained--to make the judgment.  Our modest amendments propose the Comptroller and Auditor General, for want of another body, because the other body, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton pointed out, has been comprehensively removed from the scene by the devastating interventions of the Economic Secretary and the Government Whip.

<P>
I hope, if nothing else, that I have persuaded the Economic Secretary not to continue to tease me about this remarkable document.  If she continues to do so, I warn her that I shall go through each and every one of the SSAPs listed.  I shall show her that the basic principles that I am annunciating are repeated over and over again.
<P>
The document is a masterpiece of the mandarin at work.  It appears to be a complete explanation, if one does not read the source document.  In fact, it is an explanation that the Treasury will have the discretion to make such deviations as and when it chooses, which is not satisfactory.  I cannot believe that the Economic Secretary would want to defend that, although her record so far suggests that she will not obey her instincts.  I hope that she will defend it a little more powerfully than she has so far defended such absurdities.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have little to add.  I probably did the hon. Member for West Dorset an injustice by saying that he had failed to engage with any of the accounting policies under consideration.  He mentioned the same one before, and I do not have anything more to say about it.  Most of his argument relates to the whole of Government accounts, which is not the subject of this clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I shall intervene briefly.  I was out of the Room, paddling in the usual channels, while my hon. Friend made his usual erudite comments.  I shall abstain on the amendment, because it is not the appropriate route for the achievement of the aim that my hon. Friend supports.  There was more merit in the original national accounts commission argument; indeed, I wait in hope, for the Economic Secretary's response.  She has not promised to change her mind, but she promised to think about how we can ensure a degree of independence and impartiality on the part of the FRAB, or whatever body it shall be.  All Opposition Members, and one or two Labour Members, agree that the Treasury should not decide on this matter.  I sympathise with the intent of the amendment, but it is the wrong instrument to achieve it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As we intend merely to highlight the need for independence, and not to press the specific point of the proposal, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 35, in page 4, line 16, after "Comptroller', insert "and Auditor General'.--[Miss Melanie Johnson.]
<P>
Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Treatment of value added tax</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
The Chairman: With this it will be convenient to take the following: 
<P>
New clause 4--Value added tax.
<P>
Government amendment No. 87.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Since the Bill was published, the Government have further considered what legislation is needed to implement our policy for dealing with VAT on business activities under resource accounting and budgeting. We have concluded that clause 8 as it stands is inadequate, and therefore propose to replace it with new clause 4.
<P>
Under resource accounting and budgeting, the Government intend to follow generally accepted accounting principles in relation to the treatment of VAT on business activities. That will require Departments to comply with the relevant accounting standard--statement of standard accounting practice 5. That treatment is set out in the Resource Accounting Manual and had been endorsed by the FRAB.
<P>
As it stands, clause 8 deals only with the accounting arrangements. However, in order fully to implement our policy, the treatment of the VAT elements of receipts will also need to be changed. Subsection (2)(b) of new clause 4 will enable the Treasury to make the necessary arrangements. Those new arrangements will be necessary because the VAT elements of departmental receipts would otherwise have to be dealt with like any other receipt.
<P>
Members of the Committee will recall that departmental receipts must by law be paid into the consolidated fund unless they are appropriations in aid. In practice, the VAT element of departmental income would be appropriated in aid, but doing so would require it to be accounted for gross, thereby making compliance with SSAP 5, which requires the netting off of VAT, impossible. The Treasury therefore intends to allow the VAT element of the receipts arising from such income to be exempt from the requirement that they be paid into the consolidated fund. That approach would build on the treatment formalised by section 21 of the Finance Act 1999, which allows a partial netting off. Incidentally, section 21 will be replaced by the new clause and will therefore be repealed by Government amendment No. 87.
<P>
All transactions between Departments and Customs will, of course, be fully recorded in each Department's accounting systems and will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<P>
The important points about our policy for the treatment of VAT are that the change will enable the Government to bring their accounts more into line with those of other bodies and that Parliament will continue to exercise control over departmental activities. I commend the new clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> In my view, and that of my colleagues on the PAC, the new clause is an improvement, and we have no objection to it.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 8 disagreed to.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Allen.]
