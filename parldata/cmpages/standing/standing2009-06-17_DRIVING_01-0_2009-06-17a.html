Chairman:</b> Before we start discussing of the Bill, may I
make a few comments? First, as Mr. Donohoe was anxious to
know, of course everybody may take their jackets off if they feel the
need to do so. Secondly, will those with a mobile phone either turn it
off or put it on silent?</div>
<a name="09061781000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">If anybody is
tempted to try to table amendments at this stage, I must make it clear
that I do not like late amendments, so I am unlikely to consider them.
I remind you that there are money and ways and means resolutions on the
table. Finally, having consulted with the interested parties on the
Bill, I think that one way of dealing with it expeditiously would be to
discuss the substance of the clauses when debating amendments to them.
That way, I will not have to call stand part debates, unless anybody
objects. I see no objections.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000170"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> It is an honour to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Wilshire, in debating this important Bill, which we are
pleased to support. The amendments are necessary to enable the
suspension power to operate effectively. The Bill as published makes
changes to the regulatory scheme for driving instructors set out in the
Road Traffic Act 1988. At present, there are two main categories of
regulated driving instructors who are entitled to give paid driving
tuition: fully qualified, approved driving instructors, who are
registered; and partially qualified trainee driving instructors, who
are licensed. Trainee instructors can give paid driving instruction in
order to gain practical experience in giving instruction, with a view
to taking the final examination to become a fully approved driving
instructor.</div><a name="09061781000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
registrations and licences are administered by the registrar of
approved driving instructors, an employee of the Driving Standards
Agency. At present, if it becomes necessary to revoke an
instructor&#146;s permission to give paid instruction, either by
removing their name from the register or by revoking their licence, the
registrar must follow the statutory processes set out in the 1988 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>Act. Those processes take 45 days or more to complete, during which time
the instructor may continue to give paid instruction. In certain
circumstances, that is inappropriate and dangerous, so the Bill will
give the registrar the power to suspend a driving instructor, with
immediate effect, while he completes the statutory process revoking
their permission to give paid driving instruction. The hon. Member for
Dunfermline and West Fife highlighted the issue when the Bill was
introduced.</div>
<a name="09061781000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061781000171"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): Following on from what
the Minister just said, will he confirm that he envisages that the
Bill&#146;s powers of suspension will be used only in the most
serious
cases?</div><a name="09061781000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000172"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> Absolutely. That is certainly the intention. The
Bill states that the registrar should use the powers only accordingly
and where he or she believes that it is a danger to the public for the
person to be allowed to continue giving tuition while a case is
investigated.</div>
<a name="09061781000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061781000173"></a><b class="B">Michael
Connarty</b> (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (Lab): The
amendments are useful. Having come from the teaching profession, and
having held the elected position of president of a region in Scotland,
it is clear that, in that profession, there are such things as
malicious accusations that can run for a considerable time and disrupt
a teacher&#146;s career. What safeguards are there to ensure that the
suspension process will not lead to such malicious accusations being
made and the disruption of someone&#146;s career by unfounded
allegations?</div><a name="09061781000037"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000174"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> In terms of the provisions, it is for the registrar
to use his or her judgment on the revocations made. We are talking
about the most serious cases. The overriding need is to protect the
general public from individuals who may be a danger, as has been
highlighted by the case of the constituent of the hon. Member for
Dunfermline and West Fife, but there is a provision within the
arrangements to make compensation available for loss of earnings and
for damage to
reputation.</div><a name="09061781000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061781000175"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Goodwill</b> (Scarborough and Whitby) (Con): The case
that brought the issue to the public&#146;s attention involved a
conviction that did not result in a custodial sentence, which is a
loophole that has been identified by the Bill. Does the Minister
envisage that there will be cases where people will have to be
suspended when charged or arrested, rather than waiting for a
conviction?</div><a name="09061781000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000176"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We have
been talking about the use of the supervision power when a conviction
is already in place. I do not envisage that the provision will be used
in the way that he describes.</div>
<a name="09061781000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the amendments, as I have already indicated in response to my hon.
Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, the Bill provides
for a compensation scheme, providing payments to suspended instructors
where the registrar does not subsequently remove their permission to
give paid instruction, or where they have successfully appealed against
the
revocation.</div><a name="09061781000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Road Safety Act 2006 makes some significant changes to the regulatory
scheme for driving instructors, which have not yet been commenced. In
particular, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>Act will abolish the licensing system for trainee instructors and will
introduce a new system of exemptions from regulation. The Bill
therefore makes changes to the system as it stands and to the way in
which it will have effect once the 2006 Act is fully commenced. The
Bill ensures that the new suspension power remains available under the
new regulatory scheme, as well as the existing
one.</div><a name="09061781000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will enable the registrar to suspend instructors not only
where he or she intends to revoke their registration or licence, but
where an instructor has applied for renewal of their authorisation to
instruct. Suspension will be possible only where the registrar
considers the application for renewal; where the registrar is minded to
refuse their application; and where he or she believes that the
instructor poses a significant threat to public safety that merits
suspension. The amendments apply both to the current regulatory regime
as set out in the Road Traffic Act 1988, and to the new regulatory
regime to be introduced by the 2006 Act, once it is fully
commenced.</div><a name="09061781000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also alter the compensation scheme in paragraph 5 of
schedule 1 for the existing regulatory scheme, and in clause 3 for the
new regulatory scheme to be introduced under the 2006 Act. The
amendments provide for instructors who are suspended pending the
registrar&#146;s decision on their renewal or extension application
to be compensated, and provide for the circumstances where the
application is subsequently granted, or where instructors have
successfully appealed against a refusal to
grant.</div><a name="09061781000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments clarify how the removal, revocation, renewal and extension
procedures work together. In the Bill as drafted, there may be
uncertainty about how an instructor&#146;s application to extend
their registration may affect an ongoing procedure to remove their name
from the register, or how an application to renew a licence affects a
revocation process. The amendments make it clear that suspension is
available in all cases, and that it is safeguarded by compensation
where
appropriate.</div><a name="09061781000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000177"></a>Mr.
Goodwill:</b> It is a great pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship today, Mr. Wilshire. I also congratulate the
Minister on his survival following the reshuffle.</div>
<a name="09061781000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Credit is due
to the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife, for his tenacity in
promoting the Bill. It is an example of how parliamentary democracy
should work when a case brought to the attention of a constituency
Member by a constituent results in a private Member&#146;s Bill
getting to this stage of the process. I am pleased that Her
Majesty&#146;s official Opposition support the Bill, and I hope that
it quickly gets on to the statute book.</div>
<a name="09061781000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should be
clear from the start that the legislation will apply to only a small
number of approved driving instructors. The vast majority of the 40,000
driving instructors who teach our young people and others to drive are
fit and proper people to carry out that role. The legislation might be
needed in a very small number of cases.</div>
<a name="09061781000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
responsibility to protect learner drivers, especially as many of them
are young. The fact that we use the word &#147;approved&#148;
driving instructor, means that we can expect the person in question to
meet certain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>standards. As the Minister has said, we have an obligation to driving
instructors to consider their appeals as quickly as possible. If those
appeals are successful, compensation will be paid.</div>
<a name="09061781000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk raised the issue of vexatious or
malicious claims, but I think that we have got the balance right. In
other cases, such as those of teachers or people who drive school
buses, if a malicious allegation is made, the person often finds that
they are suspended for a considerable period. There was a case in my
constituency of a school bus driver who, it was alleged, had paedophile
information on his computer. It turned out that that was a malicious
allegation and that there was nothing on the computer. However, because
of the backlog in police computer forensics, it was more than six
months before that person could commence work again.</div>
<a name="09061781000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
present case we have got the balance right, and I say that for two
reasons. First, we are generally dealing with young adults. The
youngest person involved would be 16&#151;a moped rider,
perhaps&#151;but the majority will not be as vulnerable as school
children or those adults who suffer from mental health conditions that
might make them vulnerable. Secondly, if we were to embark on an
arrangement in which a person would be suspended when an allegation or
an arrest was made, we might be looking at paying compensation for far
more than  45 days, which is the duration of the average
case.</div>
<a name="09061781000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
pondered on the matter at length, and I think that we have got the
balance right. The justice that we need to deliver for accused driving
instructors and the protection that we must give to young people have
both been covered. I am pleased that we can support the amendments, and
I hope that the Bill reaches the statute book as quickly as
possible.</div>
<a name="09061781000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000178"></a>Michael
Connarty:</b> We are all gathered here today to support and
pay tribute to the work of the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West
Fife in promoting the Bill. I agree with the hon. Member for
Scarborough and Whitby that this is an excellent example of a case that
was raised at a local level turning into legislation in Parliament that
Members on all sides can support.</div>
<a name="09061781000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">A instructor
or teacher&#151;I spent 14 years of my life as a teacher&#151;has a
duty of care to the person whom they are instructing or teaching. If
they breach that duty, they cause a great problem not only for
themselves but for those who wish to use and deliver the services. As
has been said, the horrendous case that was explained to me by the hon.
Member for Dunfermline and West Fife is a terrible example of what can
happen when someone takes advantage of that position of trust, and it
exposed a loophole that we are now going to close.</div>
<a name="09061781000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend my
hon. Friend the Minister for the way that he has phrased the
amendments. Unfortunately, from serial cases of vexatious complaints
against teachers, it is clear that often people never recover from such
accusations, despite getting a clear judgment in their favour, due to
the stigma and, in effect, being put out of the profession for some
time. It is important that we protect the people affected by such
complaints, but the balance must obviously be in favour of the
person  who puts their trust in the individual who offers
to  instruct them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div><a name="09061781000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there are
any predatory people in the profession, hopefully the Bill will send a
clear signal that they will be dealt with severely. If, however, at any
time the legislation is used wrongly, the individual can be assured
that they will be recompensed properly. I am therefore very happy to
support the Bill, and I commend the efforts of the hon. Member for
Dunfermline and West
Fife.</div><a name="09061781000147"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000179"></a>Mr.
Knight:</b> It is good to see you in the Chair, Mr.
Wilshire. It seems that I usually find you in the chair in the Smoking
Room, so it is good to see you in harness in a different

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000180"></a>The

straight at this time in the morning. If I could ask the right hon.
Gentleman to withdraw that, I would, but it is now on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000181"></a>Mr.
Knight:</b> I was not in any way implying that you were
inebriated, Mr. Wilshire, but just that you are generous
about buying your round when you are in the Smoking
Room.</div><a name="09061781000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000182"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. This is getting worse&#151;I do not

Bill, it will save me some
blushes.</div><a name="09061781000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000183"></a>Mr.
Knight:</b> I will get a move
on.</div><a name="09061781000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
rise not to oppose the Bill or the amendments, but to ask the Minister
a number of questions. My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and
Whitby referred to the scenario of paedophiles being employed as
driving instructors. They should be immediately suspended either when
an offence is committed or when certain circumstances are discovered,
but surely the power of suspension goes wider than such cases. For
example, will it include someone who was training to be a driving
instructor and all the evidence revealed that they were basically an
incompetent tutor and a bad driver? Will the Minister issue any
guidance to the registrar about the sort of cases in which he should
consider using the power, or will the power be at the total unfettered
discretion of the registrar? Some members of the Committee would feel
happier knowing that there was some sort of guidance for the registrar
in respect the cases for which he ought to consider suspension and
those for which he should
not.</div><a name="09061781000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061781000184"></a><b class="B">Willie
Rennie</b> (Dunfermline and West Fife) (LD): I thank you,
Mr. Wilshire, for the supportive way in which you have
chaired this morning&#146;s proceedings. I hope that the rest of the
sitting will proceed
efficiently.</div><a name="09061781000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept the Minister&#146;s amendments. Basically, they are about
ensuring that no one can avoid suspension by seeking an extension to
their registration, which is logical. They will bring clarity to the
process of removal from the register.</div>
<a name="09061781000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been
explained, the Bill is about the 45-day period from when somebody has
been convicted to when they can be at least removed from the register.
The natural justice process means that one would have to write to the
instructor to say that one is intending to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>remove them. They then have the right to write back and give their
opinion, and then the judgment is made and they have a right to appeal.
There is therefore at least 45 days from the point of conviction to
when they will at least be removed. That was where Lesley Anne Steele
got caught, as the very next day after James McNair Bennett was
convicted of the sexual offence on her, he was out teaching a young
girl to drive in the very same
community.</div><a name="09061781000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000185"></a>Mr.
Goodwill:</b> Of course, the key point is that the person
concerned was put on the sex offenders register, even though he was not
given a custodial sentence. That is one of the key elements that the
registrar would bear in mind when seeking to suspend
someone.</div><a name="09061781000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000186"></a>Willie
Rennie:</b> The hon. Gentleman is spot on. The seriousness of
the offence has to be taken into consideration, and that is why we need
to give the registrar discretion in how he judges whether somebody
should be
suspended.</div><a name="09061781000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
crucial thing, to which the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk
and the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire referred, is the
seriousness of the case. The registrar will suspend only when the
person is on the road to removal anyway, so the decision will already
have been made that they should be removed at some point. We are not
setting up a different set of standards; we would be using the ones
that already exist and under which the process towards removal would be
under way. The proposal would ensure that no one in that sphere could
operate as a paid driving instructor during the relevant period. The
period of time would be closed down so that the person could not
operate and pose any threat to the public. Young people tend to be the
ones learning to drive and they are most vulnerable, which is why we
need to provide extra protection.</div>
<a name="09061781000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will enable the suspension of the instructor&#146;s registration
where the registrar is considering termination of that
instructor&#146;s registration, or when the instructor had applied
for an extension to an existing registration. There might have been a
loophole by which an instructor would seek an extension to their
registration as a means to avoid suspension. That would be a travesty,
were it allowed to happen, which is why the Government&#146;s
amendments are appropriate. A suspended instructor will be prevented
from giving paid driving instruction while the registrar considers
whether to terminate the registration. There will be a time limit. If
the DSA does not get its act together and move
speedily&#151;within  75 days&#151;there will be a time out
and the instructor will be allowed to continue. That is appropriate, as
there have to be some safeguards for instructors so that they are not
penalised by the pace of the administrative process. I agree with the
Minister&#146;s amendments and am glad there have been supportive
comments from both sides of the
Committee.</div><a name="09061781000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000187"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> I will be brief, bearing in mind that there is
clearly strong support across the House for the Bill and the amendments
in this group. Regarding the comments from the right hon. Member for
East Yorkshire, it is clear that the registrar will issue guidance for
all to see. That comes back to getting the balance right, which was a
point picked up by the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby and my
hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="09061781000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are dealing
with the few, as I said when moving the money and Ways and Means
resolutions in the Chamber on Monday. The vast majority of driving
instructors&#151;whether fully qualified or in training&#151;are
fine and fit for purpose. They have an important vocation that they
undertake with due seriousness. However, we know there are others,
which is why the Bill recognises what Lesley Anne Steele&#151;the
constituent of the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West
Fife&#151;went through. We hope that there will be no need to use the
provisions of the Bill&#151;soon to be an Act&#151;but we owe
people such as Lesley Anne Steele protection, when necessary. I will
only add that, on conclusion of this Committee stage, we look forward
to joining you in the Smoking Room for a drink, Mr.
Wilshire.</div><a name="09061781000071"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000191"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> I have the pleasure of speaking to all those
amendments in the name of the Government. The Bill provides for
compensation to be paid to suspended driving instructors in certain
circumstances. Where an affected instructor disputes the Secretary of
State&#146;s decision on whether they are entitled to compensation,
or what the level of compensation should be, the Bill permits an appeal
to the transport tribunal. The amendments are necessary to change the
body that will decide appeals regarding compensation under the Bill
from the transport tribunal to the first-tier tribunal created under
the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. That is in consequence
of the intended transfer of the transport tribunal&#146;s functions
to the new tribunal in the near
future.</div><a name="09061781000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000192"></a>Mr.
Goodwill:</b> I have one brief question on which the Minister
might want to comment. When we dealt with the money resolution, we
talked about a figure of five or six cases a year in which compensation
might be payable and around &#163;60,000 in total to include both the
administration and the compensation. While it is fairly easy to
identify a figure for loss of income, does he have any concerns that a
reputation figure might well be inflated? Is he content that the
figures we are talking about are likely to be the sort of figures
settled upon in such
cases?</div><a name="09061781000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000193"></a>Willie
Rennie:</b> I accept the amendments. It is really about a name
change. The tribunals Act has changed the name of the tribunal from the
transport tribunal to the first-tier tribunal, so it is a logical
update. The compensation is necessary, but it only covers the period
when the person has been suspended, not the period after the
termination or any other effects, apart from reputation. The number of
cases has been estimated at five or six, but I think that that is at
the upper level, because we are not dealing with a lot of people who
have been convicted and go on to be removed as a result.</div>
<a name="09061781000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I leave the
Minister to respond on what he thinks is an appropriate level of
compensation. That is difficult to judge, because it depends on what
the reputation of the person concerned was before, which will have to
be considered. It is appropriate to have a compensation scheme because
Governments, although it is difficult to believe, sometimes get it
wrong and we do not appropriately suspend people all the
time.</div><a name="09061781000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000194"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> First, in response to the question from the hon.
Member for Scarborough and Whitby, I think that the figure of five or
six cases a year that has been indicated is at the upper end of the
scale. Indeed, members of the Committee have indicated that that would
act as a deterrent to anyone who might be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>marginally in that position. Secondly, the estimates we have made give a
figure in the region of those figures we have been talking
about.</div><a name="09061781000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000195"></a>Mr.
Knight:</b> My reading of subsection (4) is that the Minister
may, in due course, specify a scheme whereby certain areas of
compensation are excluded. In other words, it may well be that the
Minister&#146;s ultimate scheme does not allow for compensation for
loss of reputation. Can he confirm that? Furthermore, as the scheme is
not actually set out in the Bill, can he give an undertaking that, when
he is putting it in place, he will write to every member of the
Committee to give us details about its precise
terms?</div>
<a name="09061781000148"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09061781000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000196"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> On that point, the scheme makes provision for
potential loss of earnings and an effect on reputation. The right hon.
Gentleman is right that the Bill allows the details of the scheme to be
drawn up subsequently. Certainly, I will give the undertaking to write
to members of the Committee with details of the scheme.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000199"></a>Paul
Clark:</b> As I indicated earlier, schedule 6 to the Road
Safety Act 2006 will make significant changes to the way in which
trainee driving instructors are regulated. In particular, the current
licensing system will be abolished and a new system of exemptions from
regulation will be introduced. That is intended to provide for a more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>flexible system of qualification to be prescribed by the Driving
Standards Agency. However, one effect is that it may reduce the
registrar&#146;s ability to regulate trainee instructors, as it does
not explicitly envisage exemptions being granted on an individual basis
so that the registrar may grant, suspend or remove exemptions from
individual applicants wishing to become driving instructors.</div>
<a name="09061781000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
exemptions from registration are to be introduced by regulation. Clause
3 elaborates on the circumstances where such exemptions might apply. It
envisages that the registrar might exercise his discretion over who can
and who cannot take the benefit of an exemption and that the
regulations may include a system for withdrawal of exemptions as well
as a system of appeals and compensation in connection with such
withdrawals.</div>
<a name="09061781000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group of
amendments enables the registrar to exercise his discretion regarding
exemptions from registration in respect of individual and other cases,
when provisions in schedule 6 to the 2006 Act are commenced. In
particular, they permit the registrar to consider not only class
exemptions from the requirement to be registered before giving paid
driving instruction but individual applications for exemption, so that
the registrar retains complete control over who can give paid
instruction once the new regime is commenced. They also enable the
registrar to charge a fee in connection with the exemptions, reflecting
the extra administrative overhead that will be involved. That permits a
fee to be charged in much the same way that there is currently a charge
for granting training licences.</div>
<a name="09061781000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061781000200"></a>Willie
Rennie:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for introducing the
group of amendments. He has identified a potential weakness in the
Bill, because my original Bill did not include trainees. That is a
large number of people who could, potentially, teach for
ever&#151;they do not have to become fully fledged approved driving
instructors and can remain trainees for a very long time, until they
take that final test. Therefore, there was a potentially large loophole
for people who might want to subvert the system. I am grateful to the
Minister for tabling the
amendments.</div><a name="09061781000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are caught between the old system of training registration and the new
one, which is more of a block exemption. The clause will eventually
straddle both systems and allow a proper supervisory arrangement to
cover trainees. It also introduces a charge, which was already there
under the old system, so there is no change. The Bill allows a charge
to be introduced so that we can fund the supervision of the trainees,
so that they cannot subvert the system. I am grateful to the Minister
for tabling the amendments. I shall close my remarks
there.</div><a name="09061781000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

am well aware that the General Teaching Council for Scotland strikes
people off and then allows them to reapply. The hon. Member for

struck off have been put back on the register of the GTC. There seems
to be no method of alerting the people who were offended
against&#151;who made the original complaint&#151;of that
happening. I know, and I have heard statements from people in the
teaching profession at a very high level, that such people are back on
that GTC register&#151;they do not know where they are teaching, and
they do not know anything about
them.</div><a name="09061781000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case of a new application being made under schedule 1, when people
are given a new licence, what safeguards are there? Someone might get a

licence would end up practising in a new jurisdiction&#151;in terms

people who were appropriate to be driving instructors or not. I would
have to ask the Minister whether there is a notification scheme that
entitles victims of an offence to be notified. If the approved driving
instructor registrar believes that such a person is an appropriate
instructor, perhaps that is the judgment required and, therefore,
requires no subsequent notification. I shall leave the Minister to

country. I congratulate the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife
on his hard work and persistence in pursuing the issue on his
constituents&#146; behalf. I would like to put on record our thanks
to Lesley Anne Steele for coming forward and taking the steps that she
has, which could not have been easy. The experience and the work of the
hon. Gentleman has provided a Bill that will become an Act important
for the protection of our constituents. I also thank my predecessor, my
hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town, who worked on the
issue. As he handed over the baton he said that it was a worthwhile
Bill and he had enjoyed working on it. I know that he will be pleased
that it has gone through Committee. Finally, I thank the officials who
have worked closely with the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife
to make the legislation possible.</div>

Chairman:</b> I thank hon. Members for the comments made. I
thank our Clerk, who ensured that we did this properly. It was probably
appropriate that I chair a Committee dealing with learner drivers
because I am a learner Chairman, as you have noticed, and I am grateful
to you all for accepting my shortcomings with good humour. I am sure
that it is not only Mr. Knight I will see in the Smoking
Room later.</div>
