Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 40, in page 6, line 3, leave out from `(5)' to `for' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`The Treasury and a body which is designated for the purpose of section 10 and a person who acts as auditor of such a body'.—[Mr. David Davis.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Davis </B>(Haltemprice and Howden): Before we adjourned for lunch, I was halfway through a speech on amendment No. 40, during which the Government Whip, who is a former member of the Public Accounts Committee, became so excited that I am tempted to give the entire speech again. [Interruption.] He was almost falling off his chaisé-longué with excitement. However, I shall merely summarise my speech.
<P>
The White Paper, the Companies Act and generally accepted accounting practice argue for greater powers for the principal auditor than the Bill will give to the Comptroller and Auditor General. The national health service consolidated account is the only consolidated account with which the Comptroller and Auditor General deals. In effect, the Audit Commission handles most of the subsidiary work. It has the power to inspect, to intervene and to demand papers from subsidiary organisations on the Comptroller and Auditor General's behalf. The Audit Commission, national health service trusts and other bodies work on the basis that the existence of those powers is sufficient, and exercising them is virtually unnecessary. A habit of co-operation allows the Comptroller and Auditor General to produce summarised accounts.
<P>
Government accounts are a far more complex consolidation than NHS accounts. They include bodies that are audited by private firms and public corporations, with which, at present, the National Audit Office has no direct contact. Unlike the Audit Commission, the auditors of such bodies do not work closely with the National Audit Office. Without the leverage that the reserve power gives the Comptroller and Auditor General elsewhere, it is highly unlikely that he will be able to persuade auditors to do the additional work that is sometimes necessary to provide evidence on the consolidation to Parliament.
<P>
A potential consequence of the uncertainty of audit evidence is that the Comptroller and Auditor General will have to give a qualified opinion of Government accounts. Such an occurrence would not be in the interests of the Treasury, Parliament or the country. National Audit Office officials advised the Treasury several months before the Bill was introduced that, to avoid a qualified opinion, the Comptroller and Auditor General must be granted those rights. However, the Treasury simply ignored the Comptroller and Auditor General's view of his own needs. The Treasury feels that it knows best, and its approach is to disregard his independent view and substitute its own.
<P>
Perhaps the Treasury does not trust the Comptroller and Auditor General to use the reserve power sensibly in accordance with professional auditing practice, although such a power would not lead to a massive programme of visits to bodies whose affairs are reflected in the account. The power would be a reserve power, and that is what the amendment would provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I ask my right hon. Friend to put on record the point that emerged from a previous debate. In granting this power—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am finding it very difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am so sorry, Mr. Butterfill. Were this power to be granted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, would not he be able to direct that auditors below the consolidated level consider regularity and not merely propriety? Conversely, by eliminating this power, do not we risk consolidating a mish-mash of what is regular and what is merely proper?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> My hon. Friend's interpretation is entirely correct. Indeed, one might go further. The reserve power means that the CAG must so direct, because the auditors already understand the requirement—it is part of the requirement that they are working to.
<P>
The strangest omission from the clause is the failure to provide the CAG with statutory access to documents and information in the Treasury for the purpose of auditing the account. The Treasury has the major role in consolidating accounts received from various sectors of the Government, and it is where much of the CAG's work in certifying the account will need to take place. His only statutory access to the Treasury under clause 9 will be for the purpose of auditing the Treasury's own account.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will be happy to provide an assurance that the CAG will not be removed from the Treasury when he looks at other paperwork, although the omission appears to take the reliance that the Government like to place on administrative rather than statutory arrangements for the CAG's access to almost absurd lengths.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> There is a risk of double auditing in what is proposed, which would probably also have significant cost implications. Instead, we should make the best possible use of the present extensive framework, which is already being enhanced through the work of the Public Audit Forum and the Auditing Practices Board.
<P>
I cannot agree with the right hon. Gentleman's implication that the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot rely on the work of other auditors in order to form his overall opinion of the whole of Government accounts. That would be unreasonable. There are already strong controls in the public sector over the appointment and responsibility of auditors, and a number of current developments will further strengthen the audit regime. In particular, the Auditing Practices Board is developing a practice note to ensure consistent application of auditing standards across the public sector. I am sure that the right hon. Gentlemen is aware of that. The Public Audit Forum is starting to play an increasingly important role in co-ordinating the work of the various public audit bodies and their sub-contractors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The hon. Lady may argue this point at great length, but she will accept, as she has throughout, that the man—it is a man in this case; it will not always be—who will sign off the audit of the whole of Government accounts will be the Comptroller and Auditor General. He is independent—the only independent man whom we have talked about in this whole episode—and he is of the view that this provision is not adequate. That is why I made my speech.
<P>
The amendment was drafted not by me but by the National Audit Office, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and it reflects his view. Is it not his view that matters?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Of course the Comptroller and Auditor General's view matters. None the less, the right hon. Gentlemen's undue anxiety is not borne out by the way in which matters are conducted now and by what we believe will happen in future. I believe that the Comptroller and Auditor General is also chairman of the Public Audit Forum, so he clearly plays a key role in this context on that other important body.
<P>
The audit forum is playing an increasingly important role. In practice, the Comptroller and Auditor General should not need any additional access rights. Any questions that he might raise should be capable of resolution through discussion with and, if necessary, further work by the appointed auditor.
<P>
Perhaps I could reassure the right hon. Gentleman on the point about access to the Treasury. I met the Comptroller and Auditor General before the start of our Committee proceedings and one point that he was keen to emphasise was his increased access in work with the Treasury since this Government have been in office, particularly in auditing the Budget assumptions. He has found it productive to be involved with that, and we have found it productive to have him doing it. I should like to conclude my remarks on that positive note.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not want to say a great deal other than that we support the Public Accounts Committee. I want to add, however, that the Economic Secretary would make a better argument—perhaps she will do so later—if she adduced a single case of a reputable big six firm, for example, willingly auditing the consolidated accounts of a commercial group without having access to each of the subsidiaries, even if those subsidiaries, as frequently happens in multinational companies, are audited by other companies in the first instance. I do not know whether there is such a case, although I suspect that none exists. If the Economic Secretary cannot adduce such a case, she might reflect that there is something odd about asking the nation's auditor to perform something that ordinary auditors are not willing to do. I beg her to imagine that if the result of rejecting the amendment were that the first set of national accounts were qualified, the egg would not be on the face of Liberal Democrat Members, Conservative Members or the Public Accounts Committee. She and the Government would look incredibly silly for no reason. The Comptroller, who is independent, has told us, through the Chairman of the PAC, that he might feel that he has to qualify, as the Bill empowers him to do. Were the result to cause wholly unnecessary embarrassment to the Government, it would be a most extraordinary act of political self-immolation.
<P>
I beg the Economic Secretary to consider whether the Treasury mandarin versus Parliament issue is not being raised to the level of self-parody. The Treasury is wheeling out Ministers, which is maximising chances of embarrassment without any gains. The matter is trivial compared with many others that we have discussed, but it is extraordinary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I do not want to add anything further. As my hon. Friend was saying, the resistance to the amendment is incredible. If there is a qualification, I want the reason why to be clear to Parliament. I shall therefore press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made:—

The Committee proceeded to a Division.

<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 20.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. There is no need to discuss that probing amendment. We have probed extensively and discovered every cavity in this jawful of cavities. We should move on to clauses 15 and 16, which are of greater concern to us. We do not want to delay the Bill unnecessarily. I shall not move the amendment.

<P>
Government amendment No. 80.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Davis:</B> Amendment No. 79 suggests that the Government agree with the principle that is raised in amendments Nos. 41 and 44, which would, in essence, remove the Treasury's ability to specify the time in which the Comptroller and Auditor General must conduct his work. A matter of principle is involved—is the Comptroller and Auditor General responsible to Parliament or to the Treasury? I shall give an example without, I hope, appearing to be paranoid. In other countries in Europe—most recently in Denmark—Governments have put pressure on the NAO, or its equivalent, by, for example, squeezing funding, and those Governments have suffered crises.
<P>
The Government have taken our proposal on board, so we shall not press amendment No. 41.

Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clauses 15, 16 and 17 deal with different territory from the rest of the Bill: the establishment of Partnerships UK. Most of our amendments are drafted in an attempt to match the legal definitions of the scope of Partnerships UK and its activities to the Government's final statement on the matter in July. There has been some lack of clarity as to what Partnerships UK is supposed to be doing, and it may help the Committee if I try to clarify that.
<P>
The Government have made it clear that, in line with the Bates report, Partnerships UK is intended to provide a permanent base for the Treasury taskforce. Problems have apparently been perceived, in respect of so-called City levels of remuneration, in retaining the team in the Treasury. One might say that the objective has been to privatise—or PFI-ise—the Treasury taskforce. Partnerships UK is to continue the taskforce's roles of negotiating private finance initiatives with the Treasury and related Departments. Speeding up and increasing the volume of such projects has been one of the taskforces' key successes. Perhaps surprisingly, I have come to the view that that role would be much better performed if the permit stayed in the Treasury.
<P>
The taskforce's stated objectives and purposes include putting PFls into better shape more quickly, pump priming for feasibility studies for local authority projects, expanding the range of projects that can be undertaken, and seeking to make good the Public Sector skills deficit on putting PFI deals together.
<P>
The Government have indicated that they intend that only a minority of PFI deals should be handled by Partnerships UK. Figures of a maximum of a third have been leaked to the press, rather than overtly stated. That raises the issue of who will handle Treasury and Departmental negotiations for the other two thirds. Will that be an unpaid role of Partnerships UK?
<P>
It has been made clear that there are some matters that Partnerships UK will not deal with.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is going extremely wide of the amendment, and indeed of what might normally be interpreted as a clause stand part debate. As we are not to have a stand part debate, is he happy to deal with these primary matters in the course of debating the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My answer is yes, Mr. Butterfill. Our amendments that we have tabled are designed to narrow the legal arrangements in the Bill relating to Partnerships UK, to accord with the Government's publicly stated intent. I shall be grateful if you will indulge me, Mr. Butterfill, because hon. Members may not have followed all the statements that have been made, and in order to make sense of the amendments I shall endeavour to ensure that there is a full understanding of what has been said.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am happy to allow the hon. Gentleman to range widely in that context, but it is only fair that all members of the Committee understand the basis on which we are discussing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank you, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
The Government and the head of the taskforce do not propose that Partnerships UK should be involved as leaders and organisers of the syndicates bidding for PFI deals, or of the syndicates providing finance for such deals. There would be enormous impropriety if a 51 per cent. private sector organisation were writing business on the back of privileged access to public sector business.
<P>
The problem of the second, simpler, conflict of interest has been widely acknowledged, Partnerships UK might advise a local authority or other public sector body on how to get things right. If it were then to take an equity stake, how would it marry acting in the best interests of its public sector client with its own best interests as a private sector body to make a profit? The Confederation of British Industry and the TUC have unanimously advised against Partnerships UK taking equity stakes.
<P>
The Government and the taskforce have responded by suggesting four ways round the problem. Partnerships UK could be paid for a feasibility study that it had financed either by the Treasury, by the local authority or other public sector body, or out of the total PFI deal, if the gross value included that amount. It has also been suggested that a public authority buying PFI deals should not decide how it would pay Partnerships UK for its advice until it has negotiated the deal, and that Partnerships UK could hold equity if it held it on exactly the same terms as the public sector body. That last suggestion has been viewed as unsatisfactory, and the other possible ways of disposing of the short-term interim equity stake acquired have been viewed as the only ones that would fully avoid conflict of interest problems.
<P>
In addition to that straightforward conflict of interest problem, another that is potentially as important—and that could damage the long-term reputation of Partnerships UK just as much—is that it could not be seen, as a private sector body, to have privileged access and to make money as a result. That would be seen as a considerable impropriety. Therefore, a slight conflict lies at the heart of the matter of what Partnerships UK should be legally empowered to do. It would exist to obtain the best deal for the public sector body that it is advising, while also endeavouring, as a majority private sector body, to get the best deal for itself and to make profits.
<P>
The clauses fail to define the scope and activities of Partnerships UK as announced by the Government. Clause 15, and especially subsection (3), to which our amendment relates, provide an open-ended commitment of Treasury funding, not only to establishing Partnerships UK and setting up operations, but subsequently. The amendment would cap the total amount that the Government could invest in Partnerships UK and any subsidiaries thereof at £500 million, without inflation escalation. I sounded out the taskforce to discover whether that figure was reasonable and it said that it was sufficient.
<P>
The key point is that, without a cap, Partnerships UK can do whatever it wants. It could become a major participant, lender or syndicate organiser, and could slip into the problems faced by similar vehicles that were set up by a Labour Government in the 1960s with—dare I say it?—the risk of ministerial intervention leading to unsuitable investments.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 90 is straightforward. It suggests a maximum amount that is enormously higher than should be necessary. The Government said that they envisage a maximum balance sheet of £1 billion, but they have not made clear the extent to which that would be debt as opposed to equity. At one stage they said that that figure should not be taken seriously. A maximum of £500 million should be more than sufficient to finance whatever substantial portfolio of start-up feasibility studies may be necessary in the public and local authority sectors.
<P>
Subsequent amendments would define the activities of Partnerships UK in line with those that I have described.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Several hon. Members rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I allowed the hon. Gentleman to stray beyond clause 15 and to range over clause 16. That is a little unusual and I shall give equal tolerance to hon. Members who may wish to contribute to our debate on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I shall bear in mind your verbal warning when I speak to amendment No. 90. I shall not stray, but speak about ``Expenditure and assistance'', which is the heading of clause 15. It will be useful to draw attention to the potentially unlimited expenditure in which the new body could engage.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) drew attention to the importance of the amendment, which would put a cap on the expenditure that may be incurred. I am eager to draw attention to an authoritative report in the Financial Times on 19 November 1999, which suggested that the Government may provide up to £170 million in capital guarantees, which is a staggering figure and £100 million more than previously estimated—[Interruption.] The Economic Secretary is indicating dissent from a sedentary position and perhaps she will comment on that authoritative report.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to intervene briefly. I tried to speak earlier in the hope of making good progress on this. We quoted a figure of £170 million or thereabouts and figures were certainly quoted on Second Reading. I shall recommend that the Committee rejects the amendment, but I do not object in principle to the introduction of a statutory limit. I am happy to consider the matter further and return to it later. That may help us to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am most grateful to the Economic Secretary. Opposition Members will listen carefully to the detail of what she says and may even welcome it.
<P>
The core of amendment No. 90 is that unlimited expenditure by the new body is not acceptable. As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, it is not sensible or wise to put unlimited sums at its disposal, directly or indirectly.
<P>
I remind the Committee of our anxiety about the character of the new body. Mr Adrian Montague of the taskforce, which has done a reasonable job according to its own lights, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Departments will not, of course, be required to use PUK It will not have a monopoly, and as James Vaux, Rothschild's adviser to the Treasury on PUK has said, others could enter the same market.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that is true, part of the problem about the sums that the new body could sponsor, directly or indirectly, would go away because Partnerships UK's position would not be monopolistic. However, I am worried about Mr. Montague's subsequent words. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Indeed, in the Treasury, where some opposition to the whole idea of PUK lingers on, there are worries that departments may not use PUK.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fine, because it suggests that PUK will not have a monopolistic position, but he then said, revealingly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``However, the fact that it comes with cash to help get projects off the ground may provide the right incentive or even, it could be said, a bit of bribe to make sure they do.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that Mr. Montague does envisage Partnerships UK being in a monopolistic position in so far as it provides advice and guidance to Whitehall Departments, in which case a cap on its activities is all the more pressing, urgent, necessary and desirable.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee by rehearsing the arguments succinctly made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs on potential conflicts of interest if PUK chooses to take its remuneration in an equity stake in the project rather than charging the purchaser, albeit that it would be paid by a successful bidder in a PFI deal, which are the two alternatives to an equity stake. Following the comments made by my hon. Friend and me, especially on Mr. Montague's description of a potentially monopolistic PUK, I shall not urge that the amendment be pressed. I suspect that the Economic Secretary has something further to say; I shall listen to her response with great interest.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not have a great deal to add to my intervention. We do not object to the principle of a statutory limit, and we are happy to return to the matter, which gives rise to a number of issues, at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> If the Economic Secretary undertakes that the Treasury will consult the National Audit Office, I shall withdraw amendment No. 43, although it may be brought back on Report.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall deal with that point in a moment, but first I should point out that we want to ensure that commitments are kept to the minimum necessary to enable the successful launch and development of PUK. We would prefer to consider the level of Government investment in the light of the final business case, rather than impose an arbitrary limit at this stage. We must also consider how the financial provision, particularly guarantees, should be valued for the purpose of the limit. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) suggested that there is a monopoly, but I see no justification for that view. PUK will operate on commercial terms in the open market.
<P>
I turn to a point that was made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. If PUK is to be successful, it must maintain the trust of the public sector. A balance must be struck between its role as a private sector entity that provides returns for its investors, and its wider purpose in the public interest. The business plan will aim to strike that balance. We hope that, initially, PUK staff will be drawn from the taskforce, which, during the past two years, has built up effective relationships with Departments. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman acknowledged that fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No, I will not.
<P>
I am happy to accept the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis) that the NAO participates in this discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Having heard the Economic Secretary's undertakings, for which we are grateful, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 8, leave out line 12.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 43, in page 8, line 13, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The aggregate amount guaranteed under subsection (4)(b) shall not exceed 500 per cent. of all financial assistance provided under subsection (1)(b) or (3).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point behind amendment No. 91 is simple. Given the range of activities proposed for Partnerships UK, which I described at length, we see no need for the use of guarantees. Guarantees—particularly from the Government to a majority private sector-owned body—allow a great deal of muddy water to flow. Questions arise about whether certain matters should be included in the public sector borrowing requirement, and about the terms of the guarantee. Guarantees are appropriate in certain circumstances for major PFI projects. However, it does not make sense simply to provide guarantees to Partnerships UK or other companies within its remit, as the clause provides. It would be much wiser for the Government to determine that finance should be provided by methods other than guarantees.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The Government expect that the establishment of Partnerships UK will build on the PFI reforms that we have put in place over the past couple of years, and combat some of the remaining problems in developing PFI projects. It will provide public sector procurers with the key commercial skills that they require to obtain the best deal for the projects that they commission.
<P>
As a brand new entity, PUK will require capitalisation, and we have no objection in principle to the statutory limit. However, the limit proposed in amendment No. 43 would not work in practice. Amendment No. 91 would be more restrictive, in that it would entirely remove the option of a guarantee from the forms of financial assistance that are available. It is important not to remove or restrict that option.
<P>
Two key factors should determine the nature of the Treasury's financial provision to PUK: the capital structure of the business and the value for money of the Treasury's investment. We should not impose statutory restrictions that might drive the capital structure in a certain direction. If, at a later stage, we were to judge that the guarantee offered the most appropriate and cost-effective way forward, we would not want that option to be closed off or inhibited. For those reasons, I advise the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Methinks me smells a rat. If Partnerships UK's activities are to be as the Government have presented them, it makes no sense, given the range of possible finance, to use the implement of a guarantee. Partnerships UK's investments are apparently to be confined essentially to the short-term financing of feasibility studies for predominantly local authority PFIs. Such situations would not be appropriate for finance by guarantee, even if some investments were to be maintained in the longer term. Guarantee finance would be suitable if Partnerships UK had a major investment in a large PFI project. However, that is not the intention, and if it went down that road, problems of conflicts of interest and lack of private and public sector confidence would arise. It is right in principle to try to restrain the activities of Partnerships UK to those which were intended, and we shall therefore press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> Given the Economic Secretary's undertaking, I shall not be pressing amendment No. 43.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should like to raise a point in connection with amendment No. 90, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. As I understand it, a guarantee of the kind that we are discussing would be a contingent liability under the definitions of the Resource Accounting Manual, and as such would not appear in the accounts, although it could be disposed of as a note. In the view of the Resource Accounting Manual, disclosure in such a note is very slight. It suggests that it should be in the form that companies sometimes use when they are trying to do what is legally necessary, while being as uninformative as possible.
<P>
The argument made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs would be stronger were he to add that the effect of allowing guarantees would be, at the very least, to move something from the Treasury accounts, and, hence, the Government's accounts, to the notes—and perhaps one that is difficult to disentangle.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Davis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 8, line 13, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The accounts of a body to which financial assistance is provided under subsection (1)(b) or (3) shall be open to the inspection of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and section 9 shall apply to such body.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I rise with some hesitation, as my previous speech was so persuasive that I made my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs vote the wrong way. Before I move on to the substance of the amendment, I want to touch on the delicious paradox of this and the subsequent clause.
<P>
We have heard from Ministers, time and again, that the point of principle—if I may grace it with that phrase—against introducing anything related to audit or accountability is that it has nothing to do with resource accounting. Partnerships UK, of course, also has nothing to do with resource accounting. The double irony is that the reason for putting time pressure on the Committee is Partnerships UK, not resource accounting. Resource accounting will carry on as it would if the Bill took years to be passed, but Partnerships UK is the necessity that drives us. Although I agree with the timetable, that is an interesting irony.
<P>
Partnerships UK will be an important body, which will exercise a key role in the development of the private finance initiative. That is an admirable aim. It will receive substantial assistance from funds voted by Parliament. The Treasury has spoken of £6 million for the cost of formation, including the cost of advisers—as always—and £20 million working capital. In addition to that seed capital, we have already heard, in part, that the Treasury plans to provide financial assistance to Partnerships UK, and/or any subsidiaries or joint venture companies, in a variety of ways, including guarantees, loans, subscription of share capital, and acquisition of debt instruments, which is made clear in subsection (4). Those provisions could be worth hundreds of millions of pounds—£170 million has already been mentioned.
<P>
The new body will also take decisions that will impact to a much wider and larger extent on the use of public money. It will derive revenue from public and private sectors, receive fees from public sector procurers in arranging PFI deals, and charge interest on lending to private sector contractors. It may also take equity stakes in the private sector. I remind the Committee that, under the private finance initiative, contracts worth £13 billion have already been signed, with commitments from public bodies to pay £75 billion over the next 25 years. The new body is designed to ensure that such sums increase. Parliament must have some assurance in relation to such large amounts of public money.
<P>
The Committee might be interested to learn that a principle was agreed between the PAC of 1932 and the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald—the last time that the Labour party went in for big tent politics—[Laughter.] Government Members did not even notice that remark, but, clearly, it was exactly on target. Under that principle, when Governments want to continue functions beyond a single financial year, especially functions involving financial liabilities, they should obtain specific authority in statute rather than relying on two or more annual Appropriation Acts. That agreement covers Partnerships UK.
<P>
Since the Government's equity share in the seed capital for Partnerships UK will extend beyond two financial years, the Bill needs to provide additional statutory cover, since the funds would not be covered by each year's Appropriation Acts. That is covered by clause 15(1). The Government also intend to provide additional funding in support of schemes negotiated by Partnerships UK. Again, there needs to be separate statutory authority in the Bill, because under the agreement with the PAC, that would not be covered by annual appropriation accounts. That is set out in clause 15(3). The Treasury has accepted its need to obtain statutory powers to provide funding to Partnerships UK on the basis of a principle that it agreed with the PAC in 1932, yet it has failed to consult the current PAC on the Bill. An interesting, if not remarkable, inconsistency.
<P>
The proposed arrangements to cover this body are a tangled web in terms of statutory authority, wider regularity and accountability. If one examines the complex clauses, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the Treasury must have designed the arrangements deliberately to exclude a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>
Proposals include the Government's plan for the body to be established as a company. Ministers can, of course, establish companies without the statutory authority of Parliament, and the lack of parliamentary accountability of such bodies is an issue on which the PAC recently pressed the Chief Secretary. Furthermore, I understand that the Government have decided that they will need to establish equity holding of between 26 and 49 per cent. in Partnerships UK. If the percentage were any higher, the body would qualify, for Government classification purposes, as part of the public rather than the private sector, and the arguments for public audit might have been even more difficult to resist. However, the Government will have a substantial holding, will indemnify the body against the security of hundreds of millions of pounds of public money, and will, no doubt, appoint directors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As my right hon. Friend has just mentioned the question of guarantees, will he help the Committee by taking a view on whether guarantees to this body would even appear as a note? I discover to my amazement that 12.1.23 of the Resource Accounting Manual—relating back to 4.3.16—states that, if the guarantee in question has a protective marking, it does not even need to be disclosed in a note. Are we dealing with the wonderful ``not for NAO eyes'' marking?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> My hon. Friend may be right. This may be the most sophisticated piece of ``not for NAO eyes'' that we have seen. However, I shall continue.
<P>
There is no provision for separate reports or accounts of transactions and payments between Government and Partnerships UK, as that would raise the question of the audit of its accounts and, potentially, the rights of access that the NAO would need for that purpose.
<P>
Under the proposed accounting and accountability arrangements, the success of the new company will be measured only through its profit and loss accounts and its balance sheet. That information does not, by itself, provide the information needed by Parliament to consider the value for money of the approach adopted by the Treasury. The company members, rather than the Government, will determine the terms of the audit of the body. The auditors of the body will not provide any assurance to Parliament that public money has been spent properly or with regard to value for money.
<P>
To undertake such an examination, the NAO would need access to information and explanations from the management of the body. As public funds will be at stake, Parliament will be concerned that the arrangements provide for the protection of those funds and that accountability for their use is clear. However, there are no provisions to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to take on that role. Parliament has the right to know that such funds have been used regularly and properly, regardless of whether the funds are managed in the public or the private sector. Only through NAO access to management of the body will the Comptroller and Auditor General be in a position to provide assurance to Parliament over such funds.
<P>
The Chief Secretary to the Treasury gave an undertaking to the PAC that the Comptroller and Auditor General would have access through administrative means. The Chief Secretary also argued that the Bill has no relationship with the changes in the machinery of government that have led to the gaps in statutory accountability that we want to address. However, the Bill will do exactly that. Much of PUK's role is currently undertaken by the Treasury taskforce, which can be scrutinised by the PAC if the Comptroller and Auditor General's access rights to Departments are used. When we hear that that has been done, we might think, ``Good job.'' The statutory powers that the Comptroller and Auditor General enjoys in relation to the Treasury taskforce will be replaced by non-statutory powers relating to Partnerships UK.
<P>
My amendment would ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General will continue to have statutory powers of scrutiny on behalf of Parliament over the important functions that will be carried out by PUK on the Government's behalf. That will lead, in effect, to the use of billions of pounds of taxpayers' money over many years and to the delivery of public services worth billions of pounds.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> PUK will be a risk-taking private sector body. A majority of its members will be private sector investors who will expect to see a return on their investment. It will of necessity need to act commercially to raise finance and to make a success of its business. Those are not normal conditions under which a body would be inspected by a public sector audit body. Accountability for the private finance initiative and for public-private partnership projects will remain with Departments and other public bodies that commission them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Economic Secretary suggested that such auditing would not be appropriate. Will the guarantees that will be given to that body appear in the Government's accounts or in a note, or will they not appear anywhere?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> There is no intention to hide guarantees, which will be given on commercial terms if they are given at all. I am puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's contributions. He seems to be puzzled by the Bill, but I am equally puzzled by his remarks. Perhaps it would help if I wrote to him.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I shall try to put our concern into ordinary commercial language. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and I felt that the amendment was necessary because we are concerned about the fact that a majority of the body will, as the Economic Secretary rightly said, come from the private sector. Under current accounting rules and the Bills present drafting, the Government can provide unlimited guarantees for the body for the purpose of raising funds, but they will not have to disclose them in the new Government accounts. Surely that is wrong. The body will have members from the private sector but public money will be at risk. The Comptroller and Auditor General should be able to audit and account for the flow of that money.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It would be simplest if I wrote to Conservative Members about this matter. If they subsequently want to raise further issues, they will be able to do so on Report.
<P>
I know that some Committee members are keen to give the NAO access to the books and records of PPP and PFI contractors and to similar information relating to relevant projects, including those with which PUK will be involved. The NAO has already reported on several private finance initiative schemes.
<P>
Last July, the Treasury issued guidance on the standardisation of private finance contracts, which makes it clear that PFI contracts should include appropriate clauses that will ensure appropriate NAO access. The key steps have already been taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Will the NAO have access to the accounts that have been set up for the PPP schemes for London transport?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> NAO currently can, and will continue to be able to, audit particular PFI or PPP projects, including those with which PUK will be involved. We do not expect our proposals to involve any significant differences. However, PUK is a private company and it will be audited under the Companies Acts.
<P>
Finally, on the general point about NAO access, I repeat the Chief Secretary's comments to the PAC. He said that arrangements for NAO access were a bit of a hotch-potch. We should have a constructive dialogue about how to deal with genuine deficiencies. He also pointed out that changes could be introduced by administrative means. The key point is that adding a few amendments to the Bill will not necessarily deal with the matter satisfactorily. A wide agenda is involved that concerns much more than PUK, although I appreciate that this part of the Bill concerns only PUK. I shall write to Opposition Members about these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The Economic Secretary does not appear to have answered one of my questions. We shall press the amendment to a vote.

<H4><center>Section 15:</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 92, in page 8, leave out lines 14 to 16 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) In section 15 ``public private partnership business'' means the provision of advice, the organisation and interim financing of feasibility studies, organising the tendering of bids by sub-contract consortia facilitators and the invitation of competitive financing tenders for public-private partnership projects and negotiating the necessary arrangements for particular public-private partnership projects with the relevant Government departments and the Treasury.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder whether Committee members found the clause as obscure as I did. As I shall explain later, it also contains several errors. The amendment goes to the heart of the matter.
<P>
Subsections (1) and (2) will permit PUK to do whatever it wants in relation to the PFI. Subsection (2) refers to ``advisory or financial services'', but what does that mean? Does it imply the provision of finance?
<P>
The amendment would provide precise definitions that are in accordance with the relevant Government announcements and it would clarify the intended range of PUK's activities. As things stand, the Government are—dare I use this well known phrase?—saying one thing and doing another. They say that PUK's role will be such and such, but the Bill will give it a much wider role. It may face the pitfalls that similar organisations faced during the Wilson era in the 1970s.
<P>
Our definition, which contains much breadth, would permit a degree of investment to be held. However, an interesting suggestion was made on an interim basis about start-up costs. The Government will know that, in the opinion of the CBI and the TUC, Partnerships UK should not in principle be permitted to be an investor. There may be other ways in which the arrangements could be tightened, and a subsequent amendment deals with the change of definition. I regret to say that, if the current definition is retained, there would appear to be a degree of bad faith in the Government's stated intentions for Partnerships UK. If its functions are to remain the same, why do the Government want to widen its cope greatly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I have just one factual question for the Economic Secretary. Under existing and prospective financial services legislation, what authorisation will PUK need, given that, according to the current definition, PUK will be a provider of financial services?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Given the points raised by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs in particular, perhaps I should begin by outlining the role of PUK. PUK will not be an adviser—the market already has plenty of those. Its primary aim will be to address the skills deficit in the public sector element of the PFI-PPP procurement process It will build on the work of the Treasury taskforce, and work with Departments and other public sector bodies in a unique way. As a co-developer of projects, it will sit alongside public sector project teams and take decisions with them.
<P>
PUK and public sector procurers will act as joint venture partners. The object of the joint venture will be the punctual delivery of value-for-money procurement. PUK will not operate as a bank; nor will it provide long-term debt for PFI projects. Instead, in supporting its core co-developer role, it will, where appropriate, and where existing forms of private finance are not available, provide development funding to get PFI deals off the ground. In doing so, PUK will enhance existing flows of private finance. For example, it may help to bundle together projects that, taken individually, are too small to be economically viable for private sector bidders. It may also provide support for contractors' bidding costs in respect of large or novel projects.
<P>
The scope of public-private partnerships is continually widening, and new forms of partnership such as wider markets are being developed. In this context, PUK will remain at the cutting edge during the medium and long term only by developing its business.
<P>
The amendment would take away PUK's flexibility to adapt and evolve over time. Were the amendment to be accepted, PUK would be left behind as public-private partnerships develop. The amendment is wholly inconsistent with PUK's on-going success, and I ask Committee members to reject it.
<P>
The question was asked whether PUK will be a state investment bank. As I have said, and as we have continually maintained, Partnerships UK will not operate as a bank. It must retain the flexibility to generate new business. PUK will not provide long-term debt to PFI projects. Unlike the National Enterprise Board, it will not invest or pick winners and losers. Its core business will be to make the public sector a better procurer and to make PFI work better. PUK may, in the early stages of the procurement process, provide financial products that are tailored to the needs of public sector bodies, but those products will enhance, rather than undermine or replace, the much larger existing flows of private finance.
<P>
With regard to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, PUK will not focus on business regulated under financial services legislation. I have already explained the various roles that it will have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Economic Secretary says that PUK will not be focusing on providing financial services, but subsection (2) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `public-private partnership business' includes the provision of advisory or financial services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to that, we are talking about a provider of financial services. Is the Economic Secretary suggesting that that will not necessitate authorisation under any financial services legislation, either current or prospective?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am saying that I do not believe that PUK will fall under current financial services legislation. I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman about the matter if he wishes.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I was pleased to hear the definition that the Economic Secretary gave, because it appeared to echo the rather longer version that I had extracted from Government announcements. She appears to be saying that, due to uncertainty over how matters will evolve, the Bill contains a very broad definition of the activities in which Partnerships UK could engage. That could include activities in which the Government have said they do not intend it to engage, and which, if it did so, would cause havoc in the private sector and problems in the public sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that it is odd that the Bill contains the provision that a body should engage in financial services, given that the Economic Secretary has told us that the definition of financial services for that purpose will differ from the definition in the ur-text—the Financial Services Act 1986? Is that not likely to cause a significant legal problem?

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Another major issue is involved. It is apparently intended that PUK will sit down with local authorities to discuss with them how they might structure or restructure certain of their activities so that they could be packaged as PFI projects, and then put up money to commission a feasibility study. That necessarily involves the giving of corporate finance advice. The Economic Secretary said that PUK will not give advice, yet subsection (2) states that its activities shall include the provision of financial advice services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> If I could assist my hon. Friend in his interpretation of the Economic Secretary's words, she said in her initial reply to me that PUK would not focus on the provision of financial services. She did not completely rule it out, but merely said that it would not be the main focus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his interruption. I may be wrong, but I thought that the Economic Secretary said in response to me that PUK was not intended to be an advisory body because there is already substantial private sector provision in that respect. Obviously, there are many different forms of financial advice.
<P>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will accept that subsections (1) and (2) are unsatisfactory. They are enormously wide and, as my hon. Friends have explained, unclear in their intent. The amendment provides room for evolution and is close to the Economic Secretary's summary of PUK's intended activities. If she does not like our version, will the Government redraft subsections (1) and (2) to define more closely the intended role? If not, we shall press the amendment to a vote, because, without it, the clause enables Partnerships UK to get into all sorts of problems and to do things that it is not intended that it does.

</FONT>Amendment accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 93.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I wish that amendment No. 93 had been grouped with the previous amendment, because it is a tidying-up amendment consequent on amendment No. 92. It has substance as it stands, because it would improve subsection (2), but it is not appropriate to move it in view of the result of the vote on amendment No. 92.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In that case, we shall move to amendment No. 94.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 8, line 29, leave out `body'' means' and insert '`bodies'' mean'.
<P>
This is a drafting amendment. Subsection (5) defines public body, but that phrase is not used and reference is made only to ``public bodies''. The amendment would put that right.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Although ``public body'' is referred to in the plural elsewhere in the Bill, I have been reliably informed that the definition applies to a word whether it is used in the singular or plural.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset told me quietly that the Interpretation Acts do that, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 8, line 31, leave out `and section 15'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 96, in page 8, line 33, leave out from `Kingdom' to end of line 36.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Subsection (6) refers to definitions as also applying to clause 15. I have re-read clause 15 several times, and I could not find those terms. Therefore, this is essentially a drafting amendment, as the terms defined are used only in clause 16.
<P>
However, clause 16 raises a point of importance, which we shall discuss in relation to amendment No. 96. Reference is made to PFI projects and undertakings by PUK, within and without the United Kingdom. The Treasury taskforce made it clear to me that PUK is intended to provide the same services for PFI projects overseas, to smooth the passage for the UK private sector and help to win PFI work on the back of ministerial introductions. Have Committee members realised that? PUK will have a special role in business introductions that Ministers might encounter, and will do the same work overseas as it does for local authorities here, in order to do PFI deals in other countries. I welcome the opening up of opportunities for British businesses, although I suspect that many people did not realise the extent of PUK's intended activities.
<P>
Amendment No. 96 would delete subsection (6)(b), because, as it stands, it would have no meaning. It refers to section 15(3)(b), which does not exist. The amendment is probing, as I suspect that the Government's intention is that, where PUK is engaged in work overseas, the Treasury will not commit to provide further funding beyond the initial launch funding provided under clause 15(1)(a) and (b). If that is the intention, we would agree with it. However, the clause requires clarification and rewording.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I apologise to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs for not managing to communicate with him, as he arrived late to the Committee. I did speak to his hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, who did not manage to communicate with him either. Sadly, it seems as if he has been sent to Coventry for voting the wrong way earlier. The message that I gave to the hon. Member for West Dorset was that we are happy to accept amendment No. 95. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs for tabling it.
<P>
The UK is acknowledged as an innovator in PFI and PPPs, and our expertise is often sought by other countries. Officials in the Treasury private finance unit have advised colleagues from countries as diverse as South Korea and South Africa on the merits of PFI, and how to make the most of them. In the EU, the Dutch, the Italians and the Irish have adopted the Treasury taskforce model.
<P>
The Government have often emphasised that one of our goals is to be outward-looking as well as forward-looking. That is at the heart of our modernisation programme. If amendment No. 96 were accepted, it would send out a negative message by barring PUK from doing business outside the UK. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I certainly have no desire to bar PUK from doing business outside the UK. As I said, I welcome the opportunities that that will provide. I shall not press amendment No. 96 to a vote if the Economic Secretary will confirm that the Government will correct the drafting error in subsection (6)(b). As I said, the purpose of subsection (6)(b) appears to be to establish that, where Partnerships UK is active overseas, the Treasury will not provide further money, but it does not make that clear. We are happy to withdraw the amendment if the Government will clarify the meaning of the subsection.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We will, with amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill,
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill, for allowing what I hope will be a brief stand part debate. Many of the matters that we have discussed are of a constitutional character, and that is particularly true of clause 16, so I hope that you will allow me to remark on that issue as well.
<P>
The gist of the Economic Secretary's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs was that the action that the Treasury intends to take is perfectly sensible. All of us hope that that is so, and subscribe to the Treasury's aims in respect of Partnerships UK. The Economic Secretary's argument is that we should fly with them, and be happy that the Bill will empower the Treasury to do many things that it does not intend to do, and which none of us wants it to do.
<P>
At the risk of sounding pompous, such a constitutional doctrine undermines the foundations of democracy. One could legislate to enable the Government to do anything that they like. Other than a Theft Act, one would need only a single Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Simpson </B>(Mid-Norfolk): An enabling Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As my hon. Friend says, the Government could be given a universal enabling right to do anything that they choose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not give them ideas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that my comments were perhaps inapposite. However, the point is that that is not the way in which we legislate in the United Kingdom. We never have, and I hope that we never will, but such an attitude is not unique for this Government. Again, we return to the issue of the mandarin versus Parliament. I regret to say that, from time to time, the previous Administration were guilty of producing legislation that was excessively widely drawn. We introduced ghastly Henry VIII clauses, to which I have made a habit of objecting at every opportunity since becoming a Member of Parliament. We also produced orders that granted wide discretionary powers.
<P>
The clause is not a Henry VIII clause, but it is widely drawn and the Economic Secretary has admitted that she neither wants nor needs such width. The principle that the Committee should approve a clause that will grant wider powers than are necessary is a bad principle. That is not a partisan point. I ask the Economic Secretary to look again at the clause—while she is at it, she should look at the whole Bill—and ask herself not whether it will grant her officials every power that they might conceivably need in circumstances that we cannot even imagine, but whether the clause will make it clear and justiciable that a body is acting properly and in accordance with the policy enunciated by Ministers. In my view, the clause fails that test.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> There is a further matter that I should like the Economic Secretary to clarify. The clause defines Partnerships UK as not necessarily one body but, potentially, a group of bodies. As I understand it, the purpose of that definition is to allow it to bulk up certain smaller PFI deals. It is important that it should not permit a body to do certain things that the Government do not want it to do, such as act as a PFI facilitator, set up company umbrellas or bid for PFI contracts. The concept of bulking up smaller deals has some merit, but subsection (7) gives enormous scope for permitting activities not intended by the Government, as do other subsections of clause 16.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am enormously grateful to the hon. Member for West Dorset for his further exposé of the work of the previous Government. I am considering collecting the ones that he has revealed to the Committee. He is clearly not on-message on the actions of the previous Administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope that the Minister will desist from making party political points, especially as I am trying not to engage in such things. All Members of Parliament have an interest in trying to correct constitutional deficiencies. The hon. Lady will eventually learn that Governments, under any party, have a tendency to be overweening and to pay insufficient attention to Parliament. We are on-„message, because we have adopted the principle of admitting that things have gone wrong, and of trying to correct them. It would be much better if she joined that endeavour.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We are not trying to outrank the parliamentary process in some way. All hon. Members in Committee are parliamentarians, among other things. The Government are doing something innovative and unique. We are not seeking to give excessive power to anyone, but simply allowing PFI and PPP to develop. The previous Government introduced PFI and we are improving it and allowing it to develop, to get the best possible value for the public sector. We do not want to incorporate in the clause a provision that would make that development impossible.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
This speech may not be as popular as my previous one, but I shall try to be brief.
<P>
Nowhere in the Bill is it stated that the Comptroller and Auditor General conducts his examinations on behalf of the House of Commons. Section 22 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 and sections 1, 4 and 5 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921, which the Bill will replace, make it clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General performs his duties on behalf of the House of Commons. The National Audit Act 1983 states that the Comptroller and Auditor General is an Officer of the House, but it does not state that his financial audit work is conducted on the House's behalf.
<P>
The Government have already had to amend a subsection in clause 5 because it would have given the Treasury powers to direct the Comptroller and Auditor General. He is concerned that failure to replicate the provisions of the 1866 Act and the 1921 Act might further diminish his independence. I hope that the Economic Secretary will give an assurance that the Government have no such intention and that appropriate amendments will be introduced on Report to correct the matter.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I hope that I can satisfy the right hon. Gentleman without having to propose further amendments. I entirely accept that the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out his audit examinations on behalf of the House of Commons; he also reports to the House. His role has not changed since 1921, but his statutory position has changed. The National Audit Act made him an Officer of the House. That makes it clear that his work is conducted on the House's behalf and that he reports to it. We are advised that no further statutory provisions are necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The NAO considered this matter. The legislation to which the Economic Secretary referred makes it clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General is an Officer of the House, but it does not contain provisions about his financial audit work.
<P>
I should be happy to withdraw the amendment if the Economic Secretary and I could discuss the matter further, perhaps before the Bill's Report stage. I should prefer it if the Government introduced the relevant amendment but, if necessary, I shall do so. I hope that that is okay with the Economic Secretary.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> That is entirely all right. I should be happy to have a further conversation, or an exchange in writing, about the matter. We believe that appropriate provisions are in place. If uncertainty remains, the matter may need to be resolved legally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The Committee may be relieved to hear that I intend to withdraw new clause 5 and new clause 7, although we may return to them on Report. That will depend on the Economic Secretary's response to the hon. Member for Swansea, West when he speaks to some of the later new clauses. I shall now focus primarily on new clause 2.
<P>
The audit arrangements for arms length public bodies are currently arbitrary and illogical. Consequently, there is a lack of consistency in the information that is provided to Parliament and an unnecessary waste and duplication of audit effort. It is important to be clear about which bodies we are talking about, as there is significant scope for confusion. Indeed, confusion has even been expressed by experts among members of the Committee. For the purposes of the new clause, the generic term is public service agencies, which are defined as bodies that exercise
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``public functions of a governmental nature which might otherwise fall to be exercised by central government''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in other words, executive non-departmental public bodies. Those are bodies directly funded by Departments to carry out public functions such as the administration of legal aid or the funding of higher education or student loans.
<P>
There are some 300 such bodies in the United Kingdom, and they are an increasingly important part of national government. Between 1979 and 1999, public funds spent by the bodies more than doubled from £8.5 billion to more than £18 billion at today's prices. About 100 now fall within the jurisdiction of the devolved assemblies, leaving just over 200 that should fall within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The bodies vary in terms of status. I have grouped them into four sets, which I shall outline.
<P>
Some bodies are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and thereby subject to full parliamentary accountability. Some are established as companies—I shall return to those in a moment. Some are established by statute and audited by the private sector on behalf of the relevant Secretary of State. Many of those are small, but the Housing Corporation, spending £1 billion, also falls within that group. Finally, some are established by administrative means and audited by the private sector on behalf of the relevant Secretary of State.
<P>
I know that the Treasury has had some difficulty in recent days trying to work out which bodies fit into which category, and I was reassured to discover that the National Audit Office has been almost as perplexed. The Economic Secretary will no doubt say that the annual Cabinet Office publication, Public Bodies, is the comprehensive authority. However, that is compiled only after a lengthy process during which Departments scratch around trying desperately to decide which bodies they monitor. The NAO is often asked to assist in that process. That is not a recipe for clear-cut accountability.
<P>
The complexity and evident confusion go to the heart of the problem. We are talking about a single category of bodies, the executive non-departmental public bodies, being subject to a multiplicity of accountability arrangements. Leaving aside the matter of bodies established as companies, the new clause would provide a single accountability structure. The Comptroller and Auditor General would be appointed as auditor of all such bodies already in existence, and of any new bodies that are created in future.
<P>
I hope that in the course of her reply, the Economic Secretary will answer directly the following question. By what logic is the Comptroller and Auditor General appointed as the auditor of the Countryside Agency and English Nature, but not of the Environment Agency? To cite a further example, why does the Comptroller and Auditor General audit the British Council and the Arts councils, but not English Heritage?
<P>
That is the heart of the issue. We are talking about essentially similar, sometimes almost identical bodies, which have no distinguishing characteristics but are subject to different audit regimes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorely tempted to engage in a tease. Does my right hon. Friend really imagine that he will receive an explanation from the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I carefully used the word hope, rather than expect.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> As Conservative Members are in a teasing mood, why is the right hon. Gentleman asking my hon. Friend such questions? As he was a Minister in the Government who made these arrangements, should he not provide an explanation himself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to draw me into a political argument, from which I am constitutionally disqualified. Although I did not disapprove of the creation of agencies, I disapproved of the different audit arrangements for them. I have said that dozens of time. He will have heard me say that in the Public Accounts Committee. If he had attended or read the Hansard report of the previous two sittings, he would know that I said the same thing on those occasions. I do not have to justify myself I look forward, however, to receiving the answer, which, clearly, is in the Minister's mind.
<P>
I shall return briefly to the issue of bodies incorporated as companies. Under the Companies Act 1989, only a registered auditor can audit a body with limited company status, even where that body has been established by central Government and is responsible for the stewardship of public funds. The legislation does not permit the Comptroller and Auditor General to become registered. Although many of his staff are registered, and therefore are qualified to undertake an audit of limited companies in a personal capacity, the National Audit Office cannot undertake an audit of a limited company under the Comptroller and Auditor General's authority. That is not satisfactory.
<P>
My argument for consistency in all such arrangements applies to all executive non-departmental public bodies, including those established as companies. The National Audit Office's lawyers have advised me that amendment of the Companies Act would be outside the scope of this Bill. I will not let the matter rest, however. Company status must not be used as a way of avoiding public scrutiny or as a voluntary loophole built in to accountability arrangements. I shall pursue that matter with the Treasury in the context of its review of companies.
<P>
The new clause provides a straightforward way of putting all executive bodies that are not companies on the same footing. Hon. Members will have noticed that new clauses 9 to 25 provide a piecemeal approach, and the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) will no doubt go into greater detail shortly. The current arrangements are a hotch-potch, as I said earlier, and the price paid is reduced accountability. Where the Comptroller and Auditor General is not the auditor, the appointment rests with a Department. The auditor's report is to the sponsoring Department rather than Parliament, and the auditor works on contract terms decided by the Department, not Parliament. In the case of bodies established by central Government as limited companies, auditors are appointed by the company, and report to the members of the company. Parliament is denied the opportunity to consider a report from its own auditors.
<P>
The problems with some executive NDPBs are real—for example, the malpractice of the chief executive of the Student Loans Company, who was cleared by an internal departmental investigation but sacked following a subsequent NAO investigation. Another example is provided by the events leading up to the resignation of the chief executive of English Heritage, following conflicts of interest that were brought to Parliament's attention by the NAO. The then National Rivers Authority committed serious management failures, including a badly managed relocation project that cost the taxpayer £1 million. Alternatively, I could cite the loss of £700,000 by the Merseyside development corporation on the grand regatta Columbus and the fanfare for a new world concert.
<P>
The Government might argue that the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on such cases illustrates the fact that the current arrangements work. That is not the case. The Comptroller and Auditor General has, of course, been able to pick up leads from whistleblowers and others, and has produced useful reports as a consequence. That is not a substitute for a systematic annual audit of all control procedures, and a regular audit process. Indeed, the Welsh Development Agency, to which the right hon. Member for Swansea, West referred this morning, is a classic case of a public body audited by the NAO, as a result of which it became apparent that there were systemic problems.
<P>
The Government might argue that, where he is not the auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General is provided with inspection rights. Such rights are no substitute. Where the Comptroller and Auditor General audits the annual accounts, Parliament has an annual assurance that systematic scrutiny of propriety within the organisation has been carried out. The NAO is able to draw on the results of its financial audit, to consider whether a more in-depth investigation of the body's affairs is necessary. A requirement for constant monitoring by the NAO is unsatisfactory.
<P>
The Minister has referred several times to duplication of audit effort. The current arrangements acknowledge the importance of the Comptroller and Auditor General having the right to inspect all public bodies, but that is in addition to existing audit arrangements when the auditors are from the private sector. That is not needed when the CAG is the auditor, so the obvious way to eliminate duplication is to appoint the CAG as auditor.
<P>
The new clause would bring an end to the inconsistencies in the current arrangements, ensure uniformly independent and effective scrutiny for all executive non-departmental public bodies established by central Government and remove many of the inefficiencies in the current arrangements.
<P>
As we are trying to make progress, I shall not delay the Committee further. The case is absolute and clear cut, and I look forward to the Minister's response to my questions.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall first respond to the question of why the Comptroller and Auditor General does not audit the Environment Agency or English Heritage, but I shall not be able to go through the right hon. Gentleman's examples one by one.
<P>
I cannot say why the CAG does not audit those NDPBs. As my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said, we are prepared to discuss such apparent anomalies as part of a continuing dialogue. We accept that there is no apparent rationale to some of the anomalies, but, as my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said, if anyone is in a position to explain the anomalies it is the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends. Since 1997, the Government have been able to signal our concern by making the Comptroller and Auditor General the auditor of all NDPBs created since the election. Our record on that is good.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): The Economic Secretary is saying that the Government have decided that, in general, all NDPBs should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, but that she is not aware of a particular reason why any body that is not currently audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be audited by him. When the Chief Secretary to the Treasury appeared before the Public Accounts Committee, he said in reply to a question from me that in principle it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would be a fair conclusion to draw that we see a presumption in favour of the CÿAG as the auditor except when there might be particular circumstances in relation to particular bodies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Economic Secretary is saying that she does not know of any particular circumstances in relation to any of those bodies, would it not be simple for her to accept the amendment?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman not only falsely put words into my mouth, but then invited me to repeat them. I have not, during the past few minutes or earlier, said that we do not see any reason why some NDPBs are not audited. I said that I could not explain why those mentioned in the opening moments of the speech of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden were not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. There may be other, similar examples. That is not to say that all such examples fit into that category—merely that there are other such examples. Perhaps I could explain briefly why that is not appropriate in some circumstances.
<P>
We have examined the situation as new NDPBs have been created since the Government came to power, and in all cases it has been appropriate. We do not have a one-size-fits-all policy, but in some circumstances it is inappropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be appointed. For example, the amount of central Government funding that is given to some NDPBs is very small. The new clause, which we shall debate shortly, shows that a number of such bodies are largely funded by levies. For example, the Meat and Livestock Commission, which promotes increased efficiency in the livestock products industry, is mainly funded by levies on producers; the amounts funded by central Government are tiny or nil. We can debate whether it would be right to appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General as auditor of such bodies, but the case for doing so is considerably weaker where almost no central Government funding is provided.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not follow the Minister's logic. Is not a statutory levy a hypothecated tax? If she is arguing that where a levy applies there is no need for the CAG, because all the expenditure that we are debating is taxable. What is the distinction?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> In some cases, the levy is on the industry concerned, which pays moneys to bodies from private funds.
<P>
We have appointed the CAG auditor of the Legal Services Commission, despite the fact that the auditor of its predecessor, the Legal Aid Board, was a private firm. The Public Accounts Committee was keen that the CAG should be auditor of the Legal Services Commission because of the amount of expenditure for which it is responsible. That is entirely reasonable, but we must fit circumstances to the body concerned and to the amount of expenditure involved. We must decide whether, in some circumstances, it would be better to involve a private sector auditor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> Given my role in this Committee, I will not respond to the Economic Secretary's political remarks. We are trying to make a constructive proposal. If she were prepared to accept the new clause, I should be happy to propose on her behalf on Report a procedure whereby if the Government think it inappropriate to give audit rights to a body, they can put that matter to the House in an affirmative resolution. Thus far she has not made a persuasive case, but, if she is sure of her case, she should put it to the House and allow hon. Members to deal, case by case, with the few cases that will arise.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not prepared to accept the new clause. I am happy to ensure, however, that these matters form part of the on-going discussions that we have promised the right hon. Gentleman. The Government have long conceded that the CAG should have a right of access to all executive NDPBs for which he is not the auditor. If the CAG is concerned about what is happening in an NDPB, he can investigate and make a report. He has produced many reports on executive NDPBs for which he is not the auditor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> It seems that the Economic Secretary is now saying that it would be inappropriate for the CAG to audit a small number of NDPBs with low central Government funding. It would be interesting to read a list of them. The hon. Lady cannot supply that list today, but will she do so soon in writing?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have given a couple of categories and I am happy to give a further category with a couple of examples attached to it if that would help the hon. Gentleman. Non-executive NDPBs operate in a commercial environment—particularly, but not exclusively, those that are limited companies—so it may be sensible for them to be audited by private sector firms. I accept that the CAG is capable of conducting such audits, but may not do so as well as auditors who deal regularly with commercial organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked me to give a couple of examples, so perhaps he will allow me to do so.
<P>
Remploy and the Student Loans Company are executive NDPBs, both of which operate in a competitive environment. Remploy provides jobs in its factories for more than 6,000 severely disabled people and seeks to assist more than 3,000 people through its into work programme. The Student Loans Company administers the student loans scheme, which involves managing the loan portfolio on behalf of its private sector owners. Given the environment in which both bodies work, there is a case for appointing private sector auditors who are used to auditing private sector firms that operate competitively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Is the Economic Secretary aware that the CAG sometimes uses private firms to conduct audits on his behalf? Could not that principle be applied in these cases? If the CAG felt that his own people did not have the right experience—the hon. Lady has indicated that she thinks that that is a problem—he could use a private firm with such experience.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> That argument cuts both ways—it supports my concern about whether it is appropriate to appoint the CAG as auditor in all cases and shows that the CAG understands that sometimes others can effectively perform his role. I suggest that that adds to my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> The Economic Secretary has made a couple of incorrect statements. One of the problems with which the PAC has dealt systemically in the past couple of years is that of corruption—there is no other word for it—in further education colleges. Private sector auditors did not discover the problem, which highlights a quality problem. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset questioned whether they test for regularity: the answer, typically, is that they do not. All these issues are handled in the way in which the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), my colleague on the PAC, suggested. The CAG contracting a private sector auditor is not the same as a company doing so, because he sets the standards, guidelines and requirements that Parliament requires in the use of public money. Companies rarely set such requirements.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The Auditing Practices Board has done much in recent years to ensure that auditors are alert to the key issues by publishing practice note 10 and guidance on the audit of regularity. I am aware that some hon. Members are concerned that private sector auditors may not be able to audit for regularity and proper conduct, but the Government do not believe that their concern is valid. Private sector auditors are quite capable of providing assurances on such matters. Indeed, there is no guarantee that any auditor will pick up problems in an organisation. If there had been, fraud, inaccuracy and malpractice in many firms would have been rumbled long before they were.
<P>
Levies do not go to the Consolidated Fund, as I suggested earlier. I was not sure what point was being made about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I had harboured the hope that we might conclude the Committee's proceedings today, but we may be forced to go through 88 or so amendments before we finish.
<P>
I have begun to wonder whether the Economic Secretary has been in the Committee during your previous discussions. I am at a loss to know where to begin. The structure of her argument was superbly unconvincing. She began by arguing that one reason why NDPBs should not be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General is that they deal with small amounts of money. I have been scratching my head ever since, asking why that is an important consideration.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Public money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Indeed; the Minister corrects me.
<P>
Who on earth cares? The small amounts of money will go into the whole of Government accounts and be consolidated. Count the millions and, sooner or later, that is a serious amount of money. There is no reason on earth why Parliament should be unconcerned about small amounts. In addition, it is not expensive to have the Comptroller and Auditor General responsible for the audits. We have pointed out continually, and I think the Economic Secretary accepted, that, in many cases, it will be appropriate to let him decide to employ a private sector auditor.
<P>
The Economic Secretary came back to the point made by the hon. Member for Newbury that, as we have repeatedly said, it is appropriate for private sector auditors to be employed by the CAG. She thought that that argument cut both ways, but it does not. I wonder whether the hon. Lady has had someone explain to her what auditing in a commercial company is like. When an auditor is employed, there is an intrinsic conflict, with which we have been wrestling for 600 or 700 years. That is why there are repeated scandals. The conflict is simple: auditors are human beings and audit firms are commercial firms, among the richest such firms in the world. They like to be reappointed, so one half of them says, ``Don't cause too much trouble.'' On the whole, auditors are well trained, highly skilled professionals of the highest integrity, so the other half says, ``Let us protect the shareholders. Let us protect the creditors. Let us ensure that we do our job properly, even if it means that we are never appointed again.'' Remember that auditors have to be appointed at an annual general meeting, every year. In major cases, audit firms are desperately anxious to retain their client. That tension is the fundamental to an auditing practice. When it goes wrong, it goes wrong for that reason.
<P>
There is an intrinsic problem in respect of NDPBs. Typically, there are no shareholders in evidence. One or two may be companies with shareholders, but the shareholder turns out to be a Secretary of State. There is no one out there to protect. They effectively do not have creditors, although some may, for all I know, be borrowers, but they will be borrowers against either a de facto or de jure guarantee from the state, and the private sector auditors know that there is no question of the creditors being allowed to sink.
<P>
The things that make auditors worry most with the better half of their minds are typically absent with NDPBs. That is not anyone's fault; it is just how the structure is. There is a problem: the auditor appointed by the NDPB wants, like every other auditor, to be reappointed, but he does not have quite the same concerns that he would have in the case of a commercial organisation.
<P>
The Economic Secretary was saying that the hon. Member for Newbury had played into her hands when he suggested that the CAG might want to appoint a private sector auditor. My point is that, when the CAG, as opposed to the NDPB, appoints a private sector auditor, the situation changes dramatically, because the client is no longer the body being investigated. Both halves of the auditor's mind are now directed on the right target: to satisfy his client, he has to do the same things that he has to do to satisfy his integrity. He has to work for the CAG to try to ensure that the body in question is properly investigated.
<P>
If we knew how to replicate that joyous situation in the private sector, if there were a kind of god sitting around whom we could approach to employ the auditors, instead of having them employed by the company, its shareholders, members and creditors, we would do so. Alas, in the private sector that is not available; but a body exists in the public sector that can employ auditors—Parliament and, through Parliament, the CAG. It is obviously preferable that, if there is a reason to have a private sector auditor—I do not see that scale is a reason—that auditor should be employed by the CAG. The hon. Member for Newbury did not play into the Economic Secretary's hands; the hon. Lady did not understand the force of his argument.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I remind my hon. Friend of one powerful point in favour of his argument. I think I am right in saying that when, as a result of our systematic study of the further education college problem, the Further Education Funding Council reviewed the audit arrangements, it found that 11 out of 26 were inadequate. That arose directly from a lack of separation of power—a single group making a judgment, in its own interests, in the appointment or non-reappointment of an auditor.
<P>
I would not want anyone to think I was saying that there is systemic problem with private sector auditors—beyond the point that my hon. Friend made, there is not. But there is a systemic problem with the way in which public sector bodies employ private sector auditors. That 11 out of 26 failure rate clearly shows that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is right. There is another point, on which I did not dwell, which his example puts in my mind.
<P>
There are two other particular reasons for worrying in the case of an NDPB or other public body that employs a private sector auditor. First, there is a mythology, sometimes justified, that, when a body is not a fly-by-night private sector operation, one can relax. It is the easy bit of the audit practice. There is no need to worry; there will not be a great scandal, the company will not go under or bankrupt and, anyway, these are harmless, decent civil servants or public officials who will not engage in the malpractice that goes on in the nasty underworld of the little private firms. I exaggerate for effect, but that is the widespread mythology.
<P>
That feeling is, I fear, allied to a second point, and there is a sterling example of it opposite the House of Commons. When the private sector is working for the public sector, a ``Good enough for the Government'' work mentality sets in. I take it that that is why we have spent £270 million on the monstrosity opposite the Palace, which presumably has a resource cost of a quarter of that. Somebody has ripped off somebody, and no doubt in due course the Public Accounts Committee will inspect Parliament. Parliament is not a good contractor either, it turns out. I feel confident that some contractor somewhere—I have no idea—felt that he could act in ways that would not be entertained by an ordinary commercial company. No ordinary commercial company could sustain that activity.
<P>
There is a generalised phenomenon, I fear—that when auditors are employed by an NDPB, the companies will tend to relax and not put the best people on. They will not worry quite so much. Such a phenomenon can be cured to a great extent by having the CAG employ the auditors—the body most capable of judging auditors, the most demanding employer and the one whose conflict of interest is nil.
<P>
I turn to levies, on which my feet did leave the bottom when I heard the Economic Secretary. She is certainly right in saying that an hypothecated levy does not enter the Consolidated Fund. I think that is why it is called a levy. It is a statutory tax. As hon. Members know, farmers resent having to pay unless it does good for them. They do not always believe that the Meat and Livestock Commission quota does them much good, as you may be painfully aware, Mr. Butterfill. They have to pay the levy. It may not go into the Consolidated Fund, but it is a tax. It has been passed by Parliament via the indirect means of granting the right to exact a levy. We therefore have a democratic reason for being concerned about how the money is spent.
<P>
I cannot quite believe that the Economic Secretary was arguing that, because the money has not entered the Consolidated Fund, it matters less whether it is properly audited. She cannot really be arguing that—no one could conceivably make such an argument. She must be arguing that, if the money does not enter the Consolidated Fund, there is some technical reason why it is inappropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be involved. However, I do not understand what that technical reason is and the hon. Lady has not explained it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> My hon. Friend's case is reinforced by some of the Government's recent actions. Perhaps I may widen the discussion for a moment to take in inspection or access rather than just audit. The Economic Secretary took credit—quite properly—for the fact that the Government had legislated to give the National Audit Office access to Camelot. Of course, Camelot is associated with even less of a taxation regime than the levy arrangement that she talked about. Moreover, the Gavyn Davies report on the BBC—the licence fee being another levy—recommended that the NAO should examine the use of taxpayers' money in the BBC and was supported in that assertion by another Select Committee. In both cases, the movement, apparently on the part of the Government's advisers as well as the Government, was towards giving access and eventually audit rights over just such bodies with these levy capabilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend completes the intellectual demolition of a set of arguments that I do not believe were advanced seriously. It must have been a 30-second jeu d'esprit on the part of whoever suggested to the Economic Secretary that she should argue that, because levies were involved, the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be involved. My right hon. Friend shot the last bolt, so to speak, by making it clear that, in other contexts, the Government have accepted that levy-bound bodies should be so audited by the CAG.
<P>
We come to the specific examples. This is why I fear that we are in for an awfully long sitting, although I had hoped that we could get over this issue relatively quickly. My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden, who has alas momentarily departed from the Room, clearly offered to allow the examination of particular cases. I accept that there may be cases in which, for some technical reason, it is inappropriate for the CAG either directly to audit or to be the employer of the auditor; I do not think that anyone argues that there could not be such a case. It would be foolhardy to do so, and I cannot imagine what the argument would be.
<P>
I think that we all accept—my right hon. Friend has certainly accepted on behalf of the Public Accounts Committee—that it would be perfectly reasonable for there to be an affirmative procedure so that Ministers could come to the House and say, ``This particular body just isn't suitable.'' However, the Economic Secretary will have to do better than the two examples that she gave, of Remploy and the Student Loans Company. In particular, she will need to construct a better argument.
<P>
The hon. Lady told the Committee—I gasp as I say this—that the reason why it was inappropriate for the Student Loans Company to be audited by the CAG was because it existed in a competitive environment. I think that I correctly noted her phrase. If that is the Economic Secretary's concept of a competitive environment, I am very worried about a much wider range of economic affairs. The Student Loans Company seems to have almost the exact characteristics of a monopoly. It is organised in such a way that it is the only body in England—there is another such body in Scotland—that is in a position to offer subsidised loans to students. For all I know, a student somewhere may be so foolhardy that when he wants to borrow money to pursue his studies, he prefers to do so at a higher, rather than lower, rate of interest and with fewer rather than more protections for repayment. I suppose that he might go to Barclays for the money.
<P>
If the Economic Secretary's view of a competitive environment is one in which only one competitor can offer subsidised rates and all the rest do not, she misunderstands the nature of competition. The Student Loans Company is in a prodigiously strong position, effectively having a monopoly in its own domain. It therefore cannot be because it operates in a competitive environment that it is inappropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit it.
<P>
Does another reason explain why it would be inappropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit this particular body? It was not me who introduced this example, but the Economic Secretary. Why should the Comptroller and Auditor General not investigate the Student Loans Company? I cannot think of a single body the length and breadth of the United Kingdom for which it is more appropriate that the Comptroller and Auditor General should audit than the Student Loans Company.
<P>
I used to be a pariah, before the Labour party changed its mind about life, because I advised the former Secretary of State for Education and Science, Sir Keith Joseph, to introduce student loans. Some of my present colleagues, and the entire massed ranks of the Labour party, thought it the most disastrous and catastrophic suggestion. I remember them saying, among other things, that it would entail corruption and disaster of all kinds. Nowadays, I am on the mainstream of the subject, and we agree. We have a consensus that student loans should be administered and that an independent body should administer them. I regard that as entirely enlightened.
<P>
If the Economic Secretary and her colleagues in the Department for Education and Employment want to preserve the system as much as I do, she must consider whether the administration of a colossal amount of public money in circumstances in which the recipients of the money are most vulnerable and least able to inspect proper administration of that money constitutes circumstances in which Parliament should have the greatest possible scrutiny. The body does nothing but take money from one set of people and give it to another. Goodness knows how many opportunities may be found on the way for ensuring that a little of it disappears in ways that are less than efficient, disastrous or corrupt. If the Economic Secretary had chosen an example to make our case, it would be not her scale of case but that of a body with a de facto monopoly administering huge sums on behalf of the public to many people who are not intrinsically likely to be whistleblowers.
<P>
I do not hold a brief for Remploy, unlike the Student Loans Company, as being the item that stands out as crying to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, it is difficult to imagine that Remploy, which operates in a competitive environment in a sense, but occupies a special niche in the market, can have been created by the state and sustained by the present Government for any reason other than almost no one else competes with it. If there were many companies like Remploy, and its market niche was well occupied by competitors, Remploy would not be sustained. It must, therefore, have something close to a monopoly. If it does, and if, for reasons that I cannot discern, it is genuinely its competitive position that makes it inappropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be employed, the opposite must also be true—that when not much competition exists it is appropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be employed. This must be such a case, because otherwise the company would not be sustained. Therefore, on the Economic Secretary's logic, Remploy is another good case of where the Comptroller and Auditor General should be the auditor.
<P>
I have far too high an estimation of the Economic Secretary's intellect to imagine that those arguments have been advanced as anything other than a way of avoiding admitting that the case made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden and the PAC is iron-clad, I ask again for reasons, rather than arguments. What motivates the Government to avoid accepting the general principle, along with the let-out clause that my right hon. Friend suggested, that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have the right of audit and the right to employ private sector auditors when it is proper to do so?
<P>
To return to our old friend risk, I have still not discerned another argument. I beg the Economic Secretary to note that the examples that she introduced fit like a glove the principle that my right hon. Friend, in contrast to myself, advanced. He was right, and I was wrong. If ever there was a company that we do not want to take risks, the Student Loans Company is it. It was not set up to take risks and there are no risks that it is empowered to take or that are appropriate for it to take. Its duty is to administer loans to those who qualify—
