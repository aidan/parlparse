certainly unusual to have three Ministers giving evidence and a
Minister on the Committee available to ask questions. Because we need
to finish at 10.25 am, we need to get on with the business. I will ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><a name="09021270000202"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): I would like to start
with the right to control area of the Bill. This question is probably
best directed at Mr. Shaw and then perhaps Ms
Helson.</div>
<a name="09021270000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 29(2)
starts well by being drawn widely across a range of areas affecting
somebody&#146;s whole life. Unfortunately, it gets rather narrower in
subsection (5) where it excludes social care services and a number of
other things. I have read the reasons for that&#151;that those areas
are already controlled under other legislation&#151;but it seems to
me that we run the danger, with a number of Government Departments
moving in this direction, of ending up with individuals having a number
of individual budgets and a number of different funding streams and not
being able to draw all those things together. Why not be braver and
encompass a range of funding streams across Government Departments to
give individuals a genuine right to control, so that they do not have
to fit their lives round departmental boundaries but Departments try to
fit their service delivery around individual
lives?</div><a name="09021270000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Shaw</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">:</b></i> Good morning. One could say that
if we were very prescriptive we would be in danger of constraining the
possibilities under right to control. That is why we have said that we
want to have the trailblazers, which I know you asked the chief
executive of RADAR about. We want to have them so that we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>can look at all the possibilities. If we are too prescriptive at this
stage, we might need to come back and have further legislation. In
addition social care is there, so there will be a danger of duplicating
that legislation. I believe there is sufficient legislation; we should
not create confusion by being prescriptive in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09021270000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
provided the Committee with a helpful paper which includes all the
various parts of the legislation. It is right to have as wide a scope
as possible. We have set out our stall to ensure that local authorities
can act in partnership with ourselves and other public bodies. Most
importantly, that has to be underpinned by working with disabled people
and their organisations to find out what
works.</div><a name="09021270000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000203"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> May I hear from Ms Helson and then come back to
the
Minister?</div><a name="09021270000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mary
Helson:</b></i> The intention is that it should be as
seamless as possible for an individual disabled person. There is an
absolute desire to avoid confusion and duplication of the primary
powers. The alignment at local authority level will ensure that it is
possible to join all those different pots of money together. We are
starting that through the project steering group. It will involve the
Department of Health and the Department for Communities and Local
Government. That will ensure that we join up at all the different
levels where necessary. In the pilots we will need to ensure that the
transformation of adult social care, which is already very advanced, is
integrated sensibly with the personalisation on the disability
employment programmes, where we need to make further
progress.</div><a name="09021270000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000204"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am still not entirely convinced, and we will
have more debate on this when we get to the detailed consideration of
the Bill. First, the legislative framework for adult social care is in
place, but it is not very advanced in the sense of the number of people
in the country who have an individual budget. One of the witnesses on
Tuesday was Paul Davies, the director of adult social care at Oldham.
His authority has a fifth of the national total of people on adult
social care who have an individual budget. The number of people with an
individual budget in adult social care is very disappointing. Picking
up the point that you both made about pilots or trailblazers, he said
in his evidence that he understood why people wanted a pilot but,
having rolled this out to everybody in his authority, he was convinced
that there was sufficient evidence about what works and how to proceed,
and he said unequivocally that he would like the Government to press
forward with this. That is broadly my view.</div>
<a name="09021270000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Have you
considered the alternative to a piloting system, which is putting the
legislation in place and being very clear with authorities about the
direction that you want to go? Obviously some local authorities, and
possibly even some parts of the DWP and its delivery organisations such
as Jobcentre Plus, would move faster. You could then use those leading
organisations to learn the lessons&#151;to see what worked&#151;and
then roll out to those that were slower. That would set a clearer
direction and would be more likely to lead to this concept taking hold
than running pilots for three years, during which a lot of authorities
will be tempted to sit back and wait and not engage with the process
because they are not sure that it is inevitable.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div><a name="09021270000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Shaw:</b></i> It is not just social care that we are talking
about in terms of the possibilities. We have also referred to disabled
facilities grants. One can envisage a number of education grants. There
is also Supporting People. We can also see this in the context of care
and support. We will be producing a Green Paper on what, one could
argue, will be one of the most important pieces of social policy and
change that we need, in terms of delivery and affordability. It would
be wrong to constrain ourselves at this stage and cut off
possibilities.</div><a name="09021270000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, local authorities are at different stages. I think there is
generally a consensus belief in the devolution of power and in local
authorities making those decisions for themselves. Your prescription
would fly in the face of that. We need to strike that balance. We have
set out our stall and have been clear that that is the direction of
travel that we want, but we cannot see this in the context of social
care alone. We need to pull together other aspects and other funding
streams. We know where we want to be and we need to provide the
flexibility to bring people with us, and, importantly, involve disabled
people.</div>
<a name="09021270000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Disabled
people say to me&#151;and I am sure that they say it to you,
Mark&#151;&#147;Nothing about us without us.&#148; That is
absolutely right, hence the need for the trailblazing and piloting. In
the previous evidence session rural matters were discussed, so we need
to pilot in different areas to find out what works. We cannot limit
this to social care. If we did, we could find ourselves having to come
back for further legislation. The flexibility is built in and we need
to establish what works in conjunction with disabled people and bring
people with
us.</div><a name="09021270000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021270000205"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I have a final two-part question on this clause.
First, I am saying the opposite about constraining. When I read through
the Bill I was encouraged that clause 29(2) was all-encompassing,
covering a range of areas. It is later narrowed by excluding some other
funding areas. If you left those bits out, you would enable individuals
to start from looking at how their life works, pulling in the funding
streams from across Government. You would be able to give yourselves
the powers to do
that.</div><a name="09021270000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second concern about the piloting is the opportunity cost of not doing
this fast enough. You will know from your visits that when you talk to
people who have managed to get an individual budget for social care,
they say that their lives have been transformed and enhanced and that a
huge difference has been made. There may be snags along the way that
need to be sorted out, but I would like to be able to bring help faster
to all those people who will not get the opportunity to get control of
their lives in the next three years or more. In the legislation, you
have powers to run a further set of pilots after that; it seems that we
are in danger of not making this happen fast enough for all those
people for whom it would be a life-enhancing
experience.</div><a name="09021270000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Shaw:</b></i> The legislation exists for local authorities to
provide individual budgets to social care. If you say that we should
put that in legislation and make them do it, I would say that that
flies in the face of working in partnership and the devolution agenda.
That legislation already exists. To repeat my previous point, this is
not only about social care. At the moment the legislation allows social
care as the gateway to individualised budgets. I have referred to
disabled facilities grants and education 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>grants, and we are also looking at making supported employment
available. We need to understand how that will work. Of course, there
are implications for services of devolving to the individual the
allowance of money for their supported employment and there may be
implications for the ability of wider parts of the service to
continue.</div><a name="09021270000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are clear that the need to pilot is not born out of a desire to hold up
people&#146;s ability to have individual budgets to live their life;
rather, having read the transcript endorsed by RADAR and other leading
organisations that I have spoken to, it is more about finding out what
works and involving disabled people
themselves.</div><a name="09021270000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000206"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Does Ms Helson have anything to add to the
Minister&#146;s
comments?</div><a name="09021270000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mary
Helson:</b></i> I wish to raise one point of clarification
about the low number of people who have individual budgets. Part of the
Bill is setting out a framework for people who do not want to control
the cash themselves. So although it may not appear like an individual
budget, people will have choice and control over the services that they
are
using.</div><a name="09021270000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
strong messages came through in our discussions on the Green Paper. One
was from the local authorities involved in the individual budgets
pilots, which provided a contrast with that of Paul Davies, who was
very enthusiastic and clearly at the cutting edge of what can be
achieved. Local authorities that had had experience of the individual
budgets pilots advised us to test this process
further.</div><a name="09021270000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other message came through in our discussions with disabled people and
with the advisory groups, which are as keen as anybody to see this
transformation applied more widely; they emphasised how important it
was to get this right. Those people are conscious that the structure of
user-led organisations and the availability of advocacy throughout the
country&#151;Liz Sayce touched on this in her evidence on
Tuesday&#151;is simply not embedded enough to deliver a sustained
programme of personalisation. Although the Government are completely
committed, disabled people want us to move as swiftly as possible and
public authorities are lined up to move in this direction, we want to
make this a sustainable change that really makes an improvement to
people&#146;s
lives.</div><a name="09021270000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><a name="09021270000207"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Plaskitt</b> (Warwick and Leamington) (Lab): Could the
Minister explain the thinking behind the proposal in the clauses
dealing with the social fund to bring in external providers to assist
with the
process?</div><a name="09021270000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">:</b></i> Certainly. We want to move
towards a type of social fund&#151;this is really only the beginning
of the journey&#151;that does not simply ask people precisely what
they want to spend the money on, but instead puts the resources into
supporting people to manage all their budgets more effectively.
However, by saying that I am not implying in any way that when people
get themselves into real difficulty that is always their own fault: all
sorts of things happen that might cause them to need a loan. However,
let us face it: some organisations have as their core function the type
of budgeting and debt advice that the DWP does not routinely
provide.</div><a name="09021270000178"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">We
wanted to be able to have the legal ability to work with outside
organisations if&#151;it is a big &#147;if&#148;&#151;we
thought that might help us, in the future, achieve our vision of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>reformed social fund that provides financial advice as well as finance.
We wanted to take the opportunity in this Bill to take that power to
give us a broader spectrum of policy options in
future.</div><a name="09021270000034"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000208"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> Who are the external providers you have in
mind?</div><a name="09021270000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> We have discussed credit unions. It is
certainly not an attempt to contract out the social fund to a
bog-standard private sector provider, or anything like that. You cannot
legislate for credit unions themselves, so it looks rather broad on
paper. The idea was always that it would be the type of organisation
that is good at not only providing finance, but providing financial
advice, so a credit
union&#151;</div><a name="09021270000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000209"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> What about those parts of the country where
there are no credit
unions?</div><a name="09021270000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> It is important to say that there is no
intention&#151;in fact, there are no plans in place&#151;to
externalise, at the moment, any social fund provision. We want simply
to take the power to do so in some parts of the country, but I have
made it entirely clear that we would not charge interest in some parts
of the country and not others. In fact, the Bill does not give us the
power to do so, and we would never charge interest on a social fund
loan.</div>
<a name="09021270000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be clear,
it could work in this way: if there were an excellent third-sector
organisation in one part of the country that had the core function of
providing budgeting advice to people on low incomes who seek emergency
credit, we would be able, in some parts of the country&#151;or
nationally, theoretically&#151;to explore whether we could provide a
far more effective service by working with that external provider in
that area. That would be the
idea.</div><a name="09021270000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000210"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> The problem is that there is already a postcode
lottery with the budgeting loan part of the social fund, as you know,
and this sounds like a double postcode lottery, because there might be
a better service in some parts of the country and a bog-standard
service in other parts. Is that
fair?</div><a name="09021270000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> I do not think there is a postcode lottery at
the moment, because what we do, as I am sure you are aware, is
reallocate budgets, during the year, where demand is greater. All this
is for the future, in a sense, to achieve our longer-term vision of a
social fund. There are some new primary legislative powers that we need
to take, and this is one of them. The way it would work, if we decided
to use the power, would be specified in contract with the external
organisation.</div>
<a name="09021270000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
probably worth saying, because I have not had an opportunity yet to say
this publicly, that we will not only be publishing the responses to the
consultation that we did at the end of last year shortly, but will also
be launching a separate, broad consultation on all aspects of crisis
loans and budgeting loans&#151;by the summer, I hope. In a sense,
what we are doing now is taking the opportunity that the Bill presents
to ensure that we have a full set of tools at our disposal to reach our
longer-term vision.</div>
<a name="09021270000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000211"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> That will be very welcome. Will the reform do
anything to expand provision within the budgeting loan system, such as
to bring in any additional resources?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="09021270000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> There are two ways in which the provisions
will do that. First, we propose to take out of the crisis loan system
advance payments of benefit. Currently, about half of people who apply
for crisis loans are waiting for us to determine whether they are
eligible for some form of benefit or other. So, they have put in an
application for income support or jobseeker&#146;s allowance, but we
are still processing that and they have no money in the meantime, so
they apply for a crisis loan. It is in our power to fix that, and we
propose to do that in this legislation. We are going to take all of
that out of the crisis loan budget, and deal with it through the normal
annually managed expenditure benefits-expenditure side of things. We
will be able to give people who are destitute advance payments of
benefit, so that will leave resources in the social fund that we can
target more
effectively.</div><a name="09021270000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other measure that will improve the amount of resources available is to
do with the fact that we typically spend &#163;60 million to
&#163;80 million a year in community care grants for white goods. We
currently do that by providing a giro for the amount that it costs to
buy a fridge or other appliance on the high street, but we are taking
the power, in the Bill, to enter procurement arrangements with white
goods suppliers, so that people get a chit rather than a cheque. We
will then be able to negotiate, on behalf of the taxpayer, some bulk
discounts, which should put more money into the overall social fund, so
we are trying to bring resources
in.</div><a name="09021270000045"></a>

borrow six times as much money from loan sharks as they get from the

imbalance?</div><a name="09021270000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> There are two things that we would like to be
able to do through the reformed social fund at the end of this process,
the first of which, as I have said, is to provide greater financial
advice. That will free up resources, if people do not find themselves
in such situations again because they have taken out insurance, for
example, thus leaving more resources for other people. Secondly, we
want to make it simpler to apply for free loans through the social fund
so that people are not forced into the arms of loan sharks, who are
illegal. We want to ensure that credit is more available, and we will
be putting forward various ideas on that later this year, which will
not require
legislation.</div><a name="09021270000047"></a>

James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): I have questions on
another matter, but may I ask you about what you said on social funds?
Is it part of your plans under clauses 13 to 15, or of any other plans,
to charge interest on any of the loans that are made from social funds,
either by you or by external
providers?</div><a name="09021270000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty

would need to take a legal power to do it. It is impossible, and we do
not want to do

wanted to do. You said that interest would be charged in return for
services, but that it would be at affordable rates. Then you set out
how somebody with a loan would end up paying more because they would
have to pay interest on top of the capital. Will there not be any
interest
paid?</div><a name="09021270000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty

129</b><a name="09021270000217"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I have a couple of questions that
relate to delivery of what the Bill seeks to achieve. You will have
heard that on Tuesday afternoon Professor Gregg threw down a challenge
to DWP officials and Ministers about the culture change that would need
to take place if you are going to be able to deliver the kind of black
box arrangement that he envisaged in his report. How would you reassure
those sceptics who are concerned that it will be very difficult for the
DWP not to allow a legitimate concern and a wish to be involved in the
contract to spill over into the operation of the
contract?</div><a name="09021270000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> That question goes to the broad direction of
travel that the DWP is going in anyway. The black box model that Gregg,
Freud and others have suggested is the natural destination for policy
in this area. Ironically, to achieve properly a black box model, you
need to be very clear at the centre what the strategic parameters are,
pass that on and then leave people to get on with it. There are two
ways of exerting control: first, through the establishment of strategic
parameters, and secondly, through far more broadly drawn contracts in
which the concern is more about outputs and outcomes rather than the
process. That is broadly the direction in which we are travelling
anyway.</div><a name="09021270000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to meet Professor Gregg&#146;s challenge. I read underneath what
he said that politicians and senior civil servants need to keep their
grubby little hands off if the contracts are to work successfully. That
is quite exciting and the way we should
go.</div><a name="09021270000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000218"></a>John
Howell:</b> I think that is exactly what he said, and I am
reassured that you followed
it.</div><a name="09021270000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> The key bit is that we need to define at the
centre exactly what we are devolving and the parameters within which
the programme will operate&#151;that is the only role&#151;and then
leave people to
it.</div><a name="09021270000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000219"></a>John
Howell:</b> Do you think that is being sufficiently done in
the contracts that are being drawn up at
present?</div><a name="09021270000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> I think it is. The focus will be far more on
outcomes that are focused on jobs, or on activities towards jobs and so
on. That goes with the grain of what the DWP has been doing in recent
years.</div><a name="09021270000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
132</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000220"></a>John
Howell:</b> My next question relates to the impact on
resources, particularly of Jobcentre Plus but also more generally. The
last time we were in this kind of position, just before Christmas, I
understood you to say that you did not believe that the number of
long-term unemployed would grow in parallel and at the same rate as the
general pool of unemployment. Is that still your belief, and
why?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div><a name="09021270000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> As we saw yesterday, the unemployment trends
change with every series of monthly statistics. We are starting to know
and understand more about exactly what is happening because of the
recession. In that context, you may know that we have asked, as a
matter of course in preparation rather than as a matter of fact,
potential providers of the future flexible new deal contract
to look at parameters of up to 300,000 long-term unemployed rather than
100,000&#151;not because that will happen but because it is a matter
of proper business sense to get them to look at those wider parameters,
given that the ground has shifted since the contracts were first
thought
of.</div><a name="09021270000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
133</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000221"></a>John

question?</div><a name="09021270000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> It was a maybe, but a genuine maybe. As I
said yesterday, what the Government are doing nationally on the
economy&#151;fiscal stimulus and everything else&#151;and what our
international partners do will determine how deep or otherwise the
recession will be, and as a consequence, what the pool of longer-term
unemployed will
be.</div><a name="09021270000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
134</b><b class="B"></b><a name="09021270000222"></a><b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I would like to ask a few questions
about clause 9 and schedule 3 regarding drugs. Was there any evaluation
of existing voluntary schemes before the decision was made to move to
compulsion with regard to drug
users?</div><a name="09021270000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> Interestingly, not least in the context of
the evidence-taking session on Tuesday, we are very aware of the
success of the voluntary processes in place and we want to move in that
direction. But you cannot emphasise the voluntary and personalised
nature of help and support for problematic drug users&#151;in the
first instance for crack and heroin users&#151;unless you define the
sanctions and put them into
legislation.</div><a name="09021270000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Naturally,
people will dwell on the sanctions, but much of what we want to do with
problematic drug users is not in the Bill. The Bill covers only the
areas where we need to use legislative power. The implication of your
question&#151;that there have been some real successes through the
voluntary route&#151;is absolutely fair and that is where we want to
dwell in terms of broader policy, but you do need to define the stick
if you are going to have what I have described before as a
&#147;carrot carrot stick&#148;
system.</div><a name="09021270000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
135</b><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000223"></a>Paul

already successful, why do you need this
step?</div><a name="09021270000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> Because, for all its success, the number of
people it deals with is limited. In order to build on the success of
the voluntary approach, and to make it as universal as possible for
defined problematic drug user groups in particular, we do need to have
the sanction as well. I would like it&#151;I have said this to
DrugScope and others&#151;if the sanction is never used for the
reason that people are aware that the personal treatment plan that we
will draw up with them is also in their interests on the journey back
to work-readiness and eventually to
work.</div><a name="09021270000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
136</b><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000224"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Some 140,000 people, which is not an insignificant
number, are already getting treatment and are on benefits. If that
figure increases to 240,000, what additional resources will be made
available?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div><a name="09021270000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> The difficulty we have is similar to the
difficulty we have with right to control&#151;necessary elements of
the package are devolved. I certainly cannot speak for the Welsh
Assembly Government or the Scottish Executive in terms of their
resources, but we are working very closely with them both. In England,
working with the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse and
others, there is already a relatively good picture in terms of
treatment and we need to work closely with colleagues across Government
to maintain, if not improve, those
numbers.</div><a name="09021270000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
137</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000225"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> But we heard on Tuesday that the net result of that
would be, without additional resources, that other people, who perhaps
needed drug treatment, would be bumped off those programmes to make
room
available.</div><a name="09021270000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> Only if, in the rather disingenuous and
churlish fashion put on Tuesday by DrugScope, we go from where we are
now to every single problematic drug user&#151;not just in the crack
and heroin categories but in all categories&#151;needing or requiring
treatment instantly, the day the power comes in. That is clearly not
going to happen. We are seeking to build up referrals over time as
people are identified, sometimes through the route of going on to
employment and support allowance, sometimes through voluntary
self-referrals. So, I understand why they say it, but to go from where
we are now to some huge big bang where every single problematic drug
user is in the frame for further treatment, voluntary or otherwise, is
simply not the way it is going to work.</div>

you are going to cope without the additional staff necessary for the
training you are going to deliver over the next few
years?</div><a name="09021270000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> In the first instance, what we have said and
what we would like to do is, again, pilot. I do not say that in any
apologetic way; these are very sensitive areas and we need to make sure
that it works, and works well. Clearly, we can control pilots in
England and we are working and talking with the Scottish and Welsh
Governments to take pilots forward too. Although determined nationally,
resources used at the localised level in terms of treatment and
priorities are very important, which is why we need to work with
people.</div>
<a name="09021270000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have spoken
to the Scottish Minister and there is a drug strategy unfolding in
Scotland, but there are concerns that the treatment provision is so
inadequate, which is not enough, but it just is. There is up to an
almost 52-week referral in some cases, so Scotland needs time for the
provision to improve before it starts the pilot. I am happy to work
within those timelines and we are having similar discussions with the
Welsh
Government.</div><a name="09021270000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
an English context, the provisions, at their very best&#151;this is
not true of everywhere&#151;allow for almost same-day referral, and
in average terms it takes three or four weeks. I therefore think that
the treatment architecture exists for the numbers, in the first
instance, of crack and heroin users for the matter to be taken
forward.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
139</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000227"></a>Paul

the additional training they will need to deal with that? What are your

White:</b></i> There are already a number of people who come
to Jobcentre Plus who indicate that they have some drug issue, so we
have confidence in our personal advisers. The key thing is that the
Jobcentre Plus adviser will not be the expert referring such people to
the treatment programme; where there is a suspicion that drug use is
the main barrier to work, the adviser will refer that person to a
specialised medical officer. As the Minister said, that is taking place
on a pilot basis, and in the areas where it is being taken forward, we
will, absolutely, give extra training and support to Jobcentre Plus
staff.</div><a name="09021270000080"></a>

saying that a medical officer will make the
recommendation?</div><a name="09021270000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sharon
White:</b></i> The Jobcentre Plus adviser&#146;s role will
be to indicate the biggest barrier stopping a person from working, and
the legislation allows the adviser to do so, as part of the
jobseeker&#146;s agreement, if there is a strong suspicion that
somebody is a problematic drug user. That adviser will not then be the
person who says whether a particular treatment is appropriate or not;
that will be done by a specialist. But there will definitely be a
programme of learning, development and training for Jobcentre Plus
advisers.</div><a name="09021270000084"></a>

it?</div><a name="09021270000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sharon

between this and some of the employment and support allowance
provisions, which we will be looking at. They look at what we can
mandate in terms of work-related activity where there are issues

whether we can actually mandate something that is a health intervention
for
people.</div><a name="09021270000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000233"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> May I ask, in respect of the social fund, the
extent to which outside providers will have discretion as to whom they
make loans, as well as the amount of those loans, and whether the total
amount that each provider will be able to allocate will be a
ring-fenced annual amount?</div>
<a name="09021270000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason I
ask is that there is a familiar ring to all this; I remember officials
proposing to me that I should establish a people&#146;s bank with an
automatic right to personal loans. I resisted that, partly because I
did not think that we should be in the business of facilitating the
indebtedness of people who were not well off&#151;I was ahead of my
time. More importantly, it seemed to be motivated by the fact that it
is a rules-based Department, as I am sure Ministers have observed in
their own Departments. Officials hate discretion and do not like to be
given those powers, so they wanted to get rid of it. I wanted to retain
it because I thought that at the end of a rules-based system, you
needed some discretion in case something went wrong with all the rules,
because however wonderful the rules are, you cannot cover all
complexities. Are we retaining that discretion, and if so, are we
privatising it? That is a rather bold step&#151;even for
me.</div>
<a name="09021270000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> Thank you for the useful history lesson about
the origins of the people&#146;s bank idea, which I shall mull
over.</div>
<a name="09021270000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a sense,
we are simply taking a primary power, and all this will be discussed
and consulted upon later, but the general view is not to have a
different system by virtue of it operating through a different body, so
the &#147;rules,&#148; if you want to call them that, or the
conditions would be the same. In a sense, there is discretion at the
moment in that an adviser decides whether the current criteria for
granting a budgeting or a crisis loan are met. We may want to change
the criteria across the
board.</div><a name="09021270000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not need primary legislation to do this but, for example, we are
being slightly too subjective by spending a lot of time questioning
people about precisely how their cooker has broken down and why.
Perhaps it is all right to accept that for people who are not well off,
just as for middle-class people, there are spikes in expenditure. While
it is always better to save in advance, sometimes you have to borrow
and smooth the payments over time. It is irrelevant to that whether the
reformed fund is administered by an external provider in some parts of
the country or, theoretically, across the whole country, although we
are nowhere near that. The advantage of taking the power to work with
an external provider is that they may be quite good at another thing
that we want to do, which is offering better financial advice so that
people do not have to borrow in the first place. As you say,
encouraging indebtedness is not a good thing in itself, but sometimes
people need to borrow.</div>
<a name="09021270000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> But the broader point about the availability
of controlled and regulated credit for poorer communities, so that they
do not go to illegal loan sharks, takes us back to Mr.
Plaskitt&#146;s point about trying to make credit unions and other
microcredit facilities more available throughout the country rather
than their current patchy existence.</div>
<a name="09021270000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> There is not even a draft contract at this
stage. It is about taking a power to keep options open later, but our
vision is that we would only work with an external provider if it could
add something rather than take something
away.</div>

Lilley:</b> And then you have the problem that there is a
maximum number of deductions that can be made. What happens if, for
some reason, those were used up and a crisis emerged? Does this go to
the crisis fund, and will it in the future?</div>
<a name="09021270000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> In a sense, we have that problem already,
because there is a maximum lending amount, which is sometimes quite
high. If somebody comes back with a genuine emergency after that, we
have a duty to ensure that their basic health and safety needs are met.
That will always be the case, and of course it is right and proper, not
only under law but morally. Any system that we come up with will have
to have a mechanism for someone who desperately needs their basic
health and safety requirements to be met.</div>

147</b><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000236"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> What about the ring-fenced budget? Will each
external provider be told, &#147;This the amount of money that you
have to allocate,&#148; or, &#147;This is the maximum you can
allocate during the year,&#148; and the devil take the
hindmost?</div><a name="09021270000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> That is the type of thing that we need to
specify in a contract, but the general point that I want to make
absolutely clear is that, by working with an external provider, we
would not want to provide a lesser service in any way. We would want to
add on something because a provider was better at doing things, such as
providing financial advice. At present, crisis loans are arranged over
the telephone, and that makes them very accessible. Demand has gone up
hugely as a result, and that, in a sense, is a good thing, because more
people can apply. However, we then lose the face-to-face support that
some organisations in the community might be better placed to provide
for certain categories of people.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
148</b><a name="09021270000237"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): Professor Gregg talked about
different sanctions&#151;monetary and non-monetary&#151;and seemed
to be leaning towards non-monetary sanctions, especially for vulnerable
people, because, if they are already on a fairly minimal income,
monetary sanctions could push them over the edge. How do you see the
balance between the two in the Bill?</div>
<a name="09021270000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> Not within the Bill because, as I said
earlier, if you come up with a conditionality regime that relies on a
relationship between an individual, their adviser and whatever plan
they come up with, the absolute end game is the sanction, and the final
sanction is monetary sanction. However, I agree with Professor Gregg
that there are any number of stops on the way to that end game, and we
envisage much greater personalisation with individuals, and the
identification of their specific barriers to getting back into work and
how the adviser and the individual collectively decide to work to
overcome them. At some stage, it might well mean non-monetary
sanctions, and I envisage them being used quite
significantly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div><a name="09021270000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">In absolute
terms, the financial sanction is the last resort so that we do not go
from one perfunctory work-focused interview, through a plan dictated by
the adviser, and straight to financial sanctions. Professor Gregg is
right to say that this is graded, but it is rooted in the relationship
between the individual and the adviser and their plan for getting back
to work or to work-readiness. We do not need any of that in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09021270000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
149</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000238"></a>John
Mason:</b> If we eventually reach financial sanctions, what
will happen in practical terms to a family on a fairly minimal
income&#151;especially if there are children&#151;whose benefits
are reduced? What do that family do?</div>
<a name="09021270000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> It will depend on each individual&#146;s
circumstances, what their partners do and the family&#146;s overall
circumstances. I hope that people would get back on to their
programme&#151;their journey&#151;towards work-readiness as quickly
as possible. Again, that is because we envisage, I think, a gradation
of financial sanction, rather than going straight from no sanction to
lopping up to 20 per cent. off someone&#146;s benefit over a short
time frame.</div>
<a name="09021270000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
broader context, there are still duties under a range of legislation,
including Children Acts, that will interact with the Bill, and it is
important that the welfare of any young children is taken into account.
I hope that that will happen in the context of the range of
sanctions&#151;non-monetary and monetary&#151;that, on the
non-monetary side, will be agreed between the individual and the
adviser. The sanctions that an individual might face prior to the
ultimate financial sanction are rooted in the relationship and
circumstances that have developed between<b class="B"> </b>the adviser and the
individual. We really want the measure to be that personalised and for
it to take account of the impact of any financial sanctions on an
individual&#146;s specific circumstances.</div>
<a name="09021270000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
150</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000239"></a>John
Mason:</b> At this level, that is quite reassuring, but many
people&#146;s fear is that once it gets down to an individual level,
there might be a clash with child poverty. How will this work in
practice?</div>
<a name="09021270000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i><i class="I"> </i>I would hope not, given that we are
about to bring in a child poverty Bill to address all that we want to
do in that regard. I take the point about getting the people at the top
signed up to this cultural change and focus, and like in any
organisation, the difficulty is how much that permeates down. This will
be nothing short of a personalisation revolution&#151;that trips off
the tongue very lightly&#151;focused on the individual. It is not
just about tinkering with the culture at ground level; it is about
fundamentally transforming the relationship between the individual, the
adviser and the system. The fact the measures are so root and branch
means that they will permeate down because they have to for the thing
to work. However, I accept your concerns.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><a name="09021270000240"></a><b class="B">Meg
Munn</b> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op): I want to follow up
a little on that. The Minister helpfully confirmed that the way in
which Professor Gregg described the sanctions regime operating on
Tuesday is how he envisages it will work. I want to mention the
particular issue of people with a learning disability because obviously
this process provides an opportunity for many such people who have
never worked to do so. However, clearly, when we start talking about
sanctions, people become concerned about what that might mean. When 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>considering personal advisers&#146; understanding of whether somebody
has a learning difficulty, the situation is perhaps analogous to that
of drug users. Someone who has a relatively mild learning difficulty
might not have a great deal of support from services and they might
just not understand what is being asked of them. How are you going to
ensure that personal advisers have the training and support to find
that out, and that they make sure that people are getting chances,
rather than being sanctioned when they are not clear about what is
happening?</div><a name="09021270000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sharon
White:</b></i> For many people with learning disabilities,
the route will be the employment and support allowance, with which I
hope a few people are familiar. The first person who they see will be a
specialised disability employment adviser. Those advisers are among the
most well-trained and experienced providers in Jobcentre Plus. However,
there is a whole programme behind that&#151;particularly through
pathways to work, which has been our most successful employment
programme since 1997. At least in theory, there is the gateway into
Jobcentre Plus and the initial interview and discussion, but there
would then be a whole series of routes into specialist
support.</div>
<a name="09021270000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you say,
for people with learning disabilities, there is a particularly complex
and wide spectrum of needs. The condition management
programme&#151;another acronym&#151;is one of the core elements of
pathways and deals with the issue of confidence building. For many
people, the real barrier is not their disability&#151;their medical
condition; it might be their skills, or the fact they have never worked
or have been out of work for a long time. The pathways programme, in
particular, ought to be a critical part of the process for
them.</div>
<a name="09021270000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
sanctions alongside that and the Bill&#146;s powers will mean that
the individual will need to agree a job plan with their adviser. They
will need to agree specific activities that are part of that action
plan and potentially sanctionable. However, there needs to be
personalisation. Mr. Mason&#146;s comment about
non-monetary sanctions touched on something that is potentially
powerful for not just single parents, but some disabled people, because
you are not talking about a financial sanction, but perhaps talking
about spending a week or a period of time doing an activity that might
be quite helpful for assisting such people to get back to work. The
poverty angle and the worry about people not necessarily understanding
the discussion with their adviser has led us to look at a wider range
of sanctions that are less punitive and potentially quite helpful for
people&#146;s job destinations.</div>
<a name="09021270000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000241"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> Where might advocacy fit into that? I am not
decrying the skills of personal advisers who have had training, but
there is a difference between a personal adviser and an advocate whose
role is to help the person with a learning disability to put across
their views and concerns. What will happen in parts of the country
where advocacy services are thin, or people have just not had access to
them?</div><a name="09021270000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Shaw:</b></i> I will develop the picture of how a number of
policy areas are developing. You are right to highlight people with
learning disabilities, because the majority of them want to find a job,
but that group of people is the furthest from the labour market. We
have not seen the progress that we would like on securing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>employment. That is why we are transforming the way in which we contract
our supported employment scheme, which will be outcome-focused and use
some primary providers. Specialist sub-contractors will be involved,
and there will be measures to address a concern expressed by several
people by ensuring that the larger primary contractor is not able to
cherry-pick.</div>
<a name="09021270000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
about advocacy brings us back to the right to control and people being
able to make informed decisions with support. You are right to say the
situation is patchy across the country, and we are changing the way in
which we provide support and use our budgets to ensure that there is a
more strategic approach. We want to see the centres for independent
living developing more uniformly so that there is far more capacity in
the community and people can rely on that. That is one of the themes of
the reform and part of our wider programme. Kitty was talking about how
the situation with credit unions is patchy, and the powers will provide
an opportunity to build up capacity. I think that there is a consensus
that we cannot do everything from the top down. How do you develop what
is best? We all see examples of best practice, either in our
constituencies or up and down the country, and we very much want that
to be spread across the country, so we can use the procurement process
and the levers of Government and local government to ensure that the
level of service is far more complete across the
picture.</div><a name="09021270000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000242"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> I want to ask a question about joint birth
registration. I think that all children have a fundamental right to
know who their birth parents are, provided that someone actually knows
who they are. Are the measures in the Bill robust enough to deliver
that?</div><a name="09021270000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> I think so, as far as is possible. As you
said, there will always be circumstances in which that will not be
possible, and there will also be rather extreme circumstances when that
will not be in the interests of the mother or the child for specific
safety reasons. However, we envisage that the number of such cases will
be very small, and a father could override that if he wanted
to.</div><a name="09021270000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
balance will shift away from the child&#146;s right being intertwined
with the parents&#146; relationship and its complications, and
towards the rights of the father and the rights of the child. At
present, unmarried parents who wish to register as birth parents must
either attend a registry office together, which can be practically very
difficult, even if they are functioning as a normal couple, or there
must be a kind of court order whereby the father is able to make a
declaration of paternity. We will get rid of that bureaucratic hurdle
to the child and father having all the information on the birth
certificate.</div><a name="09021270000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
direct answer to your question, I do not think that the measure will
lead to 100 per cent. joint registration, but I hope that there will be
a very significant reduction in the number of children&#151;45,000
every year&#151;who have only one parent on their birth certificate.
I am happy to go into the
details.</div><a name="09021270000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000243"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> I am as concerned as the next person about the
safety of children, but it is really important to divorce the issue of
the name of the father and who he is from the issue of protecting
children from a father with whom they should not have contact. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>Dealing with the issues for a child who has not had contact with their
father, when that father is somebody who should not have contact with
children, is entirely separate from the right to have that person named
on the birth certificate. I am a little worried that some of the
dialogue and discussion on this seems to focus on saying, &#147;You
can&#146;t possibly have the name of the father on the certificate
because that will pose a risk to the child.&#148; That should not be
the case. Adopted children can, at a certain stage, see their original
birth certificate and find out who their birth parents were, even
though, for whatever reason, they no longer live with them. Can you
respond to that and put my concerns to bed, as it
were?</div><a name="09021270000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher:</b></i> That is a really important point. Let us take
the hypothetical situation of a very dangerous father. If both parents
register the birth together, both names will be on the birth
certificate, even if the legal process then prevents the father from
seeing the child or the mother. If the father decides, even though he
is not in contact with the mother, that he wants to be on the birth
certificate, he can make a declaration to the registry so that when the
mother turns up, both names will have to go on the certificate, as long
as she confirms that he is the father and he is able to prove
it.</div><a name="09021270000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
provision may come into force only in the following situation. The
mother will go in to register and be told that she has a duty to
provide the name of the father, and she will do so. The registrar would
then normally contact the father independently to say, &#147;You are
the alleged father. Is that true?&#148; By law, he then has to
confirm or deny that. However, if professional opinion was that the
very act of the registrar contacting the father could lead
to violence against the mother or the child, the process would be
stopped, but even then the father could still proactively put his name
on the certificate. Obviously, however, if it is reasonably thought
that the father is of such character that the very act of contacting
him would lead to aggression towards the mother or the child, it is
right that the state should not do something that would probably have
such an unfortunate outcome. However, the father will still have the
right to go on the birth certificate, and can achieve that
proactively.</div><a name="09021270000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000244"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I want to go back to the drugs treatment
provisions. I think that Mr. McNulty was present for most of
the questioning of DrugScope in our session on Tuesday, so he should
now be clear, even if he was not before, that we are certainly very
supportive of the direction of travel of this aspect of the Bill, as we
always have been. However, I have specific questions on the
detail.</div><a name="09021270000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
what exactly do the Government mean by treatment? Is the objective of
the treatment to get someone off their drug habit, or is it to manage
that habit? From looking at the treatments already provided, it seems
that around half of people on drug treatment programmes receive a
replacement drug. That solves the criminal justice part of the problem,
but does not get them off an addictive substance. From the point of
view of work, we want to aim at fixing the addiction
problem.</div><a name="09021270000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question is about capacity. Will the Minister give us an idea of
the modelling that the Department has done? How many people does it
think will be picked up with the carrot-and-stick approach, and does
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>required capacity exist? Will he give us more detail about this in the
devolved parts of the country? I know from a visit to Wales that there
is a problem there because the Welsh Assembly Government and the Welsh
health service do not give the same priority to drug treatment services
as happens in England. There is a problem with getting drug treatment
in parts of Wales. We are running the programmes with a DWP remit that
covers the UK, and that remit needs to be sensitive to the availability
of treatment in all parts of the UK. Clearly, it would help if the
Welsh Assembly Government and the Scottish Government were absolutely
aligned with what was happening England, but if that is not the case,
the DWP needs to take into account what is deliverable in those parts
of the
UK.</div><a name="09021270000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> In terms of the first part&#151;or the
first parts&#151;of the questions, it is both. Clearly, the agreement
between the adviser and the problematic drug user is about getting them
to a stage of work-readiness or back into work. In the first instance,
one of the key barriers will be chemical dependency and addiction, so
this is about treating that&#151;not simply managing it, but
eventually getting rid of it&#151;so that people can get back into
work, on the starting premise, at least in this instance, that a crack
or heroin dependency is probably not a good feature of work-readiness.
I am not getting into whether people can maintain such a dependency and
work at the same time&#151;I have no doubt some can&#151;because I
simply do not know. For these individuals it is about management and
control in the first instance, but the end journey is to be off
problematic drug use and into work. Both elements will be part of the
treatment plan agreed between the individual and the adviser. That
means, as Sharon was saying, much more work with the national treatment
agency and others to get the proper medical assessment of individuals,
not instilling such expertise in personal advisers, who have an
entirely different role.
</div><a name="09021270000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
England, all those things come under one heading, whereas in Scotland
and Wales they are devolved. As I have already said, there has been
discussion with both Scotland and Wales. We think that it is right to
pilot throughout the UK, rather than just in England, where all those
levers are to hand. There are ongoing discussions with our colleagues.
It is not for me to say for whatever reason the availability of
treatment in Scotland and Wales is less developed, but clearly we do
not want to pilot in a situation where there are substantial waiting
lists for treatment. We need to work with colleagues over the next
couple of years to get to a stage at which a pilot in a Welsh or
Scottish context will have some meaning and the provision of treatment
will be there. We do not want to build an entire system and treatment
plan around an individual knowing that there is one key
barrier: treatment not being readily available. I hope that we will get
to the stage with Welsh and Scottish colleagues where there will be
pilots, but that might be some way down the line, when other strategies
to develop and enhance their treatment provision come to
fruition.</div><a name="09021270000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
156</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000245"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> What work has the Department done to model how
many people it foresees being covered? The question from Mr.
Rowen was about the fact that we clearly were not going to leap from
current treatment capacity to addressing everybody who has a drug
problem. What kind of modelling have you done on expectations, and how
do you see this rolling forward?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div><a name="09021270000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> The key reason behind piloting is to look at
the sort of throughput you can achieve with such a model in particular
areas. Some of that needs more work. The latest information for
Scotland, for example, goes back to about 2003. We are working with
colleagues in Scotland&#151;sometimes with civility and sometimes
with handbags through the press or whatever&#151;and we will get
there. You need to know in each context&#151;English regions,
Scotland and Wales&#151;the potential pool for problematic crack and
heroin users before deciding where it would be most appropriate to
pilot, while also taking into account dimensions such as treatment
provision.</div><a name="09021270000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
157</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000246"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Would be fair to say that the piloting is going to
be partly a process of data gathering to assess the success of the
measures in the Bill at effectively helping problem drug users on
out-of-work benefits to turn their lives
around?</div><a name="09021270000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> Partly, but only partly. If I pursue the
Scottish example, given that those data are relatively old, we want to
work with academics and the Scottish Government to establish what the
potential pool in Scotland is, and then pilot within that. It is not
necessarily that the pilot is part of the data gathering, but almost
the other way round. We need to establish the parameters more clearly,
as you imply, such as what is the extent of treatment provision now,
and what is the potential pool of crack and heroin users. As I am sure
you know, the Bill draws very wide powers. Essentially, it covers
everything classified under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.</div>
<a name="09021270000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Tuesday,
Mr. Rowen, I think, referred to prescription addiction and
tranquilizers, benzos, and all that sort of thing. Those prescription
drugs are defined, but we have made it clear that we want to focus on
the problematic drugs in the first instance. Not only are they
problematic for the individual, but there is the slight difficulty that
they are illegal, so there is a nexus between crime and
worklessness.</div>
<a name="09021270000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the very
broadest sense, we take a power around alcohol, too. Everyone will know
that alcohol dependency is a significant feature of worklessness in
some instances. Sometimes there can be a cocktail of all three:
prescription drugs, illegal drugs and alcohol. We draw the power
widely, but we have made it very clear&#151;again, this relates to
Mr. Rowen&#146;s point about numbers&#151;that we will
limit it to crack and heroin users in the first instance.</div>
<a name="09021270000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
your point about the interface with colleagues in devolved
Administrations, anything will be overcome. After three and a half
years in the Home Office, I am a perennial
optimist.</div>

Bill is, in many ways, a framework Bill that gives Ministers the power
to draw up regulations, can you say whether or not the Committee will
be seeing draft regulations for any or all of the areas across the Bill
prior to our deliberations after the recess?</div>
<a name="09021270000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

available as many of the regulations as possible during our
deliberations. I hope that I can at least provide the Committee with a
road map saying where in the Bill regulatory powers are taken.
Furthermore, as much as I can, I want to provide either a framework and
headline document of the regulations, or indeed the full regulations.
That is a much more efficient way of working than just saying,
&#147;Here&#146;s the Christmas tree. There are loads of regulatory

complex area, so I wanted to give out a short document that essentially
tries to set out what was in the Green Paper, what was in the White
Paper, what was in Gregg, what needs legislation, and what is being
taken forward in other ways. Rather confusingly, we are already taking
forward some measures, such as the conversion from incapacity benefit
to employment and support allowance, which is central to much of what
is in the Bill. Some measures will be achieved through regulatory
powers based on previous legislation, and others will involve brand new
powers in primary legislation, with subsequent regulations.</div>
<a name="09021270000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
Committee that, as far as I possibly can, I will provide at least an
indication of what is going to be in the subsequent regulations, if not
the draft regulations themselves.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021270000248"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> We await them with
interest.</div>
<a name="09021270000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000249"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I want to ask a few questions about transition
and the provisions of clause 8. First, can I ask you very briefly about
something that you said to my colleague, Mr. Howell? I think
that the phrase that you used was that you were exploring the
parameters of contracting out for the flexible new deal and the
contracts that companies are bidding for at the moment. Contracting
lies at the background of much of what is in the Bill and we wait to
see how it turns out.</div>
<a name="09021270000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Things have
turned out to be worse than originally foreseen, have they not? There
are going to be many more long-term unemployed than were originally
envisaged. You announced a short pause in the programme of bidding for
contractors who want to take on the task of finding work for those
long-term unemployed. How long do you think that short pause will
be?</div>
<a name="09021270000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> I will answer the direct question and then
provide the context. At this stage, we are still wedded to those
contracts being let, awarded and under way by September. The short
pause might throw up any number of issues that mean that that date
needs to move. From this perspective, at this very moment, we are still
wedded to&#151;I hope&#151;starting the flexible new deal in
September.</div>
<a name="09021270000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021270000250"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> You
said&#151;</div><a name="09021270000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> October, I am
told.</div>
<a name="09021270000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021270000251"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Yes, 1 October.</div>
<a name="09021270000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>The very end of September,
then.</div>
<a name="09021270000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021270000252"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> You are even keener than we
are.</div><a name="09021270000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>It is not long, and I take the
point.</div>
<a name="09021270000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
160</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000253"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> There is a bidding process at the moment for
the contract to go into operation at the beginning of
October.</div>
<a name="09021270000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> No, with respect, this is the tail end of
the bidding process. Interests were established as long ago as last
October and November. We are down to a shortlist, and there is a
process of working up the substance of the contracts and how they will
work. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>right at the tail end of the process that the quantums are being looked
at. My only problem with the premise of your question is that I cannot
say as a matter of absolute fact that, over the course of the
contracts, there will be 300,000 long-term unemployed rather than
100,000. Given how we have rapidly moved since as recently as last
November, it is only fair that we reflect with the contractors on what
looks like shifting ground, in terms of a larger pool of longer term
unemployed than there might otherwise have been. That is why we have
moved from an original parameter of, say, 100,000 to 300,000. I am not
saying that there will be 300,000, but, given the shifting sands and
the way the economy has gone, it is more appropriate to look in that
regard.</div>
<a name="09021270000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000254"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> That is fair enough. We may be at the tail end
of the bidding process, but the discovery that something is going to be
300 per cent. higher, which is what you said in the
letter&#151;300,000 is the figure that you have
given&#151;represents quite a development. Are you confident that you
will meet the deadline of 1 October? You said that you were
wedded to it, but do you expect to meet it?</div>
<a name="09021270000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> I am confident that we will have a
sufficiently robust pause and reflection period to stay with the
October deadline, if the reflection period shows that that is what we
can do&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> I know that that is
terribly Sir Humphrey and all that, but that is about the best I can
say, because we are in the middle of the reflection period. I do take
the point, but it would be wrong, given the circumstances that have
prevailed since November and December and the labour market statistics
that we saw yesterday, simply to stay on one horse because we
established it last year, and to say to the providers,
&#147;There&#146;s no opportunity at all to reflect on shifting
sands and different
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="09021270000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000255"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> In that case we will wait and see, but we want
to know what is going to happen and when.</div>
<a name="09021270000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8, in
which you take the power to direct claimants to undertake specific
work-related activity, will apply to employment and support allowance
claimants as they are moved from incapacity benefit over time. In light
of that, what will happen to the very large, existing stock of
incapacity claimants&#151;not the new people coming on to it, but the
stock that runs to some 2.6 million, 1.5 million of whom
have been on incapacity benefit for more than five years? We do not yet
know the details but, when you take those powers, what is going to
happen to somebody who is part of that stock of long-term incapacity
benefit claimants?</div>
<a name="09021270000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>There are two points. When we
looked at the introduction of employment and support allowance, we
thought that it would be 2010 or 2011 before we started going into the
IB stock, as you call it, but, we have always had the caveat that the
implementation of the new ESA, and its successor or otherwise, would
determine how soon we got into the stock. There is, as you
imply&#151;certainly from my perspective&#151;an eagerness to start
shifting people from IB to ESA at the earliest opportunity, but we will
learn from the embedding of ESA. You will appreciate that there is a
lag, given the assessment process and all that, but we are about to get
the first indications of how the ESA implementation has gone since it
was introduced in October. The process usually takes two or three
months to bed in, and that, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>hope, will inform how quickly we can start getting into the IB
stock&#151;for want of a better phrase&#151;because I take on board
the points that you make.</div>
<a name="09021270000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000256"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> What specifically do you envisage happening to
somebody among the existing stock of incapacity benefit claimants who
is aged over 50, of whom I imagine there are a
number?</div><a name="09021270000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B"></b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> As we move from IB to ESA, those people,
rather like a new claimant, will be assessed and interviewed
appropriately. They will then be put into either the support group, if
there are sufficient disabilities for them not to be put on any
conditional basis, or the work-related group, meaning they will be
given appropriate help and support. Crucially, we are not telling those
in the support group that they should stay on ESA, if they want to
volunteer to join the work-related group without the degree of
compulsion.</div>
<a name="09021270000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021270000257"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I understand that. Everybody is agreed about
the support group&#151;there is no conditionality on that because of
the nature of people&#146;s
conditions.</div><a name="09021270000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B"></b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

aspect.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000258"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I think your estimate is that the majority of
people will actually be in the other group, to which conditionality
should apply. That is the non-support group and there will be many
people involved, including many existing claimants over
50.</div><a name="09021270000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
White Paper
says:</div><a name="09021270000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;most
existing claimants over the age of 50 will be offered a single Work
Focused Interview, with the opportunity to take up further support on a
voluntary
basis.&#148;</div><a name="09021270000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
that what it all amounts to under the provisions that you were telling
us about under clause 8 and the extra help and support? Is that the sum
total?</div>
<a name="09021270000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> It is a starting premise, although it will
be informed by what we learn from the ESA implementation. It may be
that, in terms of the Bill, the broader conditionality powers prevail.
That was what we said in the White Paper. I suspect that the truth,
once informed by the implementation by ESA, will sit between the
two.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Clappison:</b> As things stand, under existing
legislation&#151;before the Bill comes into effect&#151;somebody
who is over 50 years of age and on either employment support allowance
or incapacity benefit can take the support that they want on a
voluntary basis.</div>
<a name="09021270000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

166</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000260"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> For those people, the direction that will come
about as a result of the Bill will be a single work-focused
interview.</div>
<a name="09021270000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div><a name="09021270000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sharon
White:</b></i> As you said, we are currently talking about
2.6 million people. This is an enormous practical undertaking. Part of
the support will be about getting people properly identified as
rightful claimants of an incapacity and disability benefit, as opposed
to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. We expect that there will be a number
of people who do not get through the gateway on to the new ESA, but who
will get the support and the conditionality around jobseeker&#146;s
allowance. How quickly we are able to bring in the full panoply of
support that we currently have in pathways to work for those who are on
employment and support allowance will be a resource
question.</div>
<a name="09021270000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000261"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I accept that point, but this has been the
problem all along. We have had this stock of claimants throughout the
whole history of welfare reform over the last 10 years. There is a bit
of tinkering around the edges and things happening for new people, but
the stock goes on growing, but people are on the benefit for longer and
longer, and in large numbers.</div>
<a name="09021270000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Shaw:</b></i> First of all, the ESA has gone well to date. As
Sharon said, this is an enormous undertaking. You would be the first to
criticise us if we had not put in place the necessary infrastructure
and staff to ensure the smooth transition to which we are committed.
There is also the investment that we are putting into pathways to work,
which will be available for many people together with more tailored
provisions. It is a case of putting your question into the context of
other areas of investment that we provide to assist people to get off
benefit and into work.</div>

168</b><b class="B"><a name="09021270000262"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I do not want to take all the time remaining,
Mr. Hood, but my point is about what extra provisions the
Bill will give us. We already have pathways to work.</div>
<a name="09021270000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
McNulty:</b></i> We have said clearly that the assessment
process will be entirely different and focused on what people can do,
rather than what they cannot do. Your premise that every 50-year-old
who has been on IB for more than five years will get through the
gateway on to ESA is moot in the first place. If they do not, they will
go to the conditionality regime of JSA. If they do get on, the numbers
involved will be informed by the first round of the ESA, as
implemented. As you implied, we have had a guess at the
numbers&#151;we think it will be a 20:80 split between support and
work-related claimants. However, we do not know how many people will
get in initially through the gateway that Sharon focused on from the
new cohorts of IB claimants. We will get more data on that as the ESA
beds in,</div>
