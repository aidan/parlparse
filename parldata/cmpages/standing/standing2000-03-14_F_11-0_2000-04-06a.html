<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Heald:</B> The substance of this group of amendments is in new clause 6 and new schedule 1. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) pointed out that the Bill is over-bureaucratic. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Part IV, which deals with scrutiny, proposes that the Prime Minister should be able to appoint two new commissioners to review the performance of the Home Secretary in exercising his functions. That would involve a new interception of communications commissioner and a new covert investigations commissioner. We already have a Security Service Act commissioner, an Intelligence Services Act commissioner, a chief surveillance commissioner and ordinary surveillance commissioners. None of those appears to have an independent investigatory team available to them. It seems that the Government believe that commissioning should be a growth industry.—[Official Report, 6 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 782.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 6 would tackle the issue by retaining the existing commissioners within a unified commission, the latter having the commissioning role envisaged in the Bill. That would provide new flexibility, enabling the Secretary of State to order that one commissioner may discharge the functions of another. There would be a chairman. The new commission would be called the investigatory powers commission and the commissioners would be called investigatory powers commissioners.
<P>
The Secretary of State would be able to change the number of commissioners; I would expect him to reduce it. The schedule would provide for the Commission to have its own secretariat and investigating officers. The new functions of the commission could be performed by any commissioner. The role of appointing replacements would fall to the Prime Minister and the qualification would be high judicial office.
<P>
Essentially, the functions would remain the same, but within the streamlined structure of a single secretariat with investigating officers. That would make reviewing the exercise of powers and the performance of the Secretary of State and the authorities in parts I to III of the Bill a real function. Commissioning would not be a growth industry as extra commissioners would not be created.
<P>
This part of the Bill has invited some encouraging noises, and I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Jane Kennedy):</B> It may benefit of the Committee if I explain our thinking on the amendments. As the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, much comment was made on Second Reading about what he describes as the plethora of commissioners in the Bill. We said then that we take such comments seriously, and we continue to do so. We are sympathetic to the need to rationalise an oversight on what he describes as an industry of commissioners.
<P>
In considering that, we have identified two areas of possible rationalisation. However, the issues are complex and, at this stage, I have not been able to table amendments to put our thoughts into effect. I shall address those two areas shortly.
<P>
First, however, let me say that, although we are considering some rationalisation of the number of commissioners, we are not considering going as far as the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues suggest and establishing a single unified commission. I hope that the main benefits of unification can be achieved by unifying the secretariat alone. There are benefits in retaining the identity of some commissioners separately in statute because the existing commissioners are heavyweight judicial figures. They acquire considerable expertise over time, not least as a result of regular visits to those agencies whose activities they oversee. Therefore, they are a more effective check than would be a body of commissioners whose responsibilities ranged widely across the spectrum of investigatory powers. For example, Lord Nolan, the interception of communications commissioner, focuses exclusively on the interception of communications and provides a useful check on what agencies are doing in highly technical areas and source advice when knotty legal issues arise.
<P>
Questions of accountability and security also arise. An amalgamation of their functions would risk obscuring lines of accountability as well as compromising the expertise that they currently maintain. On security, I simply note that the system proposed by the Bill is designed to ensure that the need-to-know principle is strictly observed. Details about particular individuals are shared to the minimum extent possible. Within a unified secretariat, members of staff would work for particular commissioners, so the need-to-know principle could be maintained. Amalgamating the functions of different commissioners would make that considerably more difficult.
<P>
I shall explain to Committee members two areas that we have been considering. The first is the suggestion that the commissioners should belong to a unified secretariat. Earlier, my hon. Friend the Minister of State mentioned an audit team being sent out under the auspices of the interception commissioner to examine communications data requests. That demonstrates that we are considering a unified and investigative secretariat along the lines suggested in the new schedule.
<P>
Those staff would act entirely in accordance with a plan established by the commissioners. The commissioners themselves must be satisfied that the arrangements for oversight are such that they can genuinely report to the Prime Minister at the end of every year on the operation of the powers. Having said that, I see no reason why they need pay personal visits to police stations throughout Britain to check, for example, the process for recording authorisations for directed surveillance and whether particular directed surveillance is properly authorised.
<P>
The surveillance officers established under the Police Act 1997 already have a secretariat. My hon. Friend the Minister of State and I are considering whether that secretariat, which is geographically split between London, Edinburgh and Belfast, could be augmented to provide support for the interception commissioner, the intelligence services commissioner, the security services commissioner and the covert investigations commissioner, as necessary.
<P>
Two questions are at stake. The first is the desirability of that arrangement. There are security issues, for example, about whether it would be sensible to house the intelligence services commissioner, who examines the activities of the Secret Intelligence Service and Government communication headquarters, with people supporting the covert investigations commissioners, who may support those who check the activities of the sandwich police in the Department of Health so beloved of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean).
<P>
In addition to the policy aspect, there are the questions of how far the arrangement for such a secretariat would need to be specified in the Bill or whether the secretariats could be set up with administrative arrangements. There are therefore several reasons why I cannot report any progress on the question of a unified secretariat, on which, however, we continue to work hard. We certainly intend to provide reassurance and table amendments while the Bill is still in Parliament.
<P>
On the second area for rationalisation, we believe that there may be scope for amalgamating the role of the new covert investigations commissioner—the only new commissioner created by the Bill—with that of the Surveillance Commission. We are also considering the roles of the intelligence services commissioner and the security service commissioner, which are currently filled by the same person, and have been for some time. We may reflect that reality in the Bill by amalgamating the roles. Many interests are at stake, but I can report some positive thoughts in that direction, and I hope that we will be able to table an amendment on Report.
<P>
Let me spell out what that would mean. At the moment, we have five commissioners, and I recently outlined possible plans to rationalise the situation. We would amalgamate the roles of the security service commissioner, and those of the surveillance commissioner and the covert intelligence commissioner, but we would keep the interceptions commissioner separate. That does not go as far as establishing the unified commission set out in the amendments. None the less, I hope that hon. Members will feel reassured by our thinking and withdraw the amendment. Our intention is not to go quite as far as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire suggests, but the proposals for a unified secretariat will, I hope, go most of the way towards introducing the consistency that he seeks.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am pleased by that response, which goes a long way towards meeting our concerns. I shall want to reflect a bit on the detail and to see the amendments on Report, but otherwise I am happy. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

Clause 53 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 54</center></H4>
<H4><center>Co-operation with and reports by new Commissioner</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 225, in page 56, line 9, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) If it at any time appears to the Interception of Communications Commissioner, the Covert Investigations Commissioner, the Security Service Act Commissioner, the Intelligence Services Act Commissioner or the Chief Surveillance Commissioner—
<P>
(a) that there has been a contravention of the provisions of this Act in relation to the obtaining, granting, exercise or performance of an authorisation for surveillance conduct under this Act, and
<P>
(b) that the contravention has resulted in unlawful surveillance of a person,
<P>
he shall notify that person with respect to the contravention, except that such notification may be delayed if to do so would be likely to prejudice the detection and prevention of crime'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would ensure that mistakes can be rectified. In particular, it deals with what happens if the Act is contravened and unlawful surveillance takes place. Under those circumstances, an individual should have the right to be notified, unless that will result in criminal action or prevent the police or other agencies from dealing with such action. By including that condition, we have dealt with the issue of whether the provisions would prejudice further investigations. People make complaints about unlawful surveillance from time to time.
<P>
We understand why lawful surveillance and interceptions should not be revealed to the individual. However, if an interception is unlawful, it is logical that he should be told. Such provisions exist in other countries. Canada has a system under which individuals can be notified that electronic surveillance has taken place. Many other European countries, including Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, have some form of notification. Therefore, even if the amendment is not accepted, we hope that the Minister will tell us that notification is expected to take place where the Act is breached and the surveillance is clearly unlawful. I look forward to a positive response.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I understand the intention behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment. I am not sure whether I will be entirely able to satisfy him, but I will do my best.
<P>
The intentions behind the amendment are admirable, but, for several reasons, we will resist it. First, I should say what will happen under the provisions as they stand if a commissioner finds that there has been a contravention of the Act. This is dealt with in subsection (3). In the event that the commissioners find a contravention, they are required to make a report on it to the Prime Minister, unless the tribunal has already done so. I do not know whether hon. Members have seen the annual reports that the commissioners send to the Prime Minister and which he publishes, but practice is for them to include any instances of procedures that were not correctly applied in the previous year. Those instances are suitably anonymised, for reasons that I shall describe. However, they are made available to the public where security considerations permit. That will be a matter for the commissioners, and I expect that they will continue that practice under the new regime.
<P>
Therefore, from the point of view of reassuring the public at large and Parliament in particular on the use of the powers in question, the existing regime has a good story to tell and bears comparison with other regimes. Contraventions are already published in the reports that I have described.
<P>
The amendment is about informing the individual that he or she has been the subject of unlawful surveillance. The first and obvious point that I should make is that individuals have recourse to the tribunal. If they made an application to the tribunal and it found that the provisions of the Act had not been followed correctly, they would be informed of its findings by virtue of clause 59 and the rules made under clause 60(1).
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tribunal will have the power to provide a variety of remedies, as set out in clause 58. Those include an order quashing or cancelling any warrant or authorisation, and an order requiring the destruction of any records of information in relation to the person concerned. Those remedies come on top of powers to award compensation or make another order, as the tribunal thinks fit. Without question, therefore, there is an avenue that the individual can take to seek redress, and the Bill will make it simpler and more accessible.
<P>
That explanation narrows down the area dealt with by the amendment to those individuals who are unaware of the fact that they have been the subject of surveillance and who are not, therefore, in a position to make a complaint to the tribunal. Although I do not expect this to offer the hon. Gentleman much reassurance, the first point is that people can make a complaint even if they do not know about, but merely suspect surveillance. Unless the complaint is frivolous, it will be investigated. Secondly, if any products of surveillance were used against people in criminal proceedings, defendants would have ample chance to challenge the evidence through the legal process. That might well include arguing that the surveillance was not carried out in accordance with the law.
<P>
I appreciate that that consideration will offer no comfort to those whose telephone calls might have been intercepted erroneously, and there are such examples in the recent reports. The material involved in such cases will not be used in evidence and cannot, therefore, be challenged. Again, however, any individual who believes that his calls have been intercepted, whether or not he was the target of an interception warrant, will be able to apply to the tribunal under the Bill. That development is significant; it is an improvement that explicitly recognises the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the case of Lambert v. France. Where people are unaware that their calls have been intercepted, and the procedures have not been applied properly, the interception commissioners will report the case to the Prime Minister and discuss it in their published report.
<P>
Those are the reasons why the amendment is not required. There is a further reason why, even if we were convinced of the need for the amendment, we would not want to accept it: the question of subject notification, which we discussed in relation to the tipping off of offences in clause 50. The nature of investigations is such that we simply cannot be sure that it will be safe at any time, even significantly after the event, to inform people that they have been the subject of surveillance. I appreciate that the amendment makes an exception for prejudicing the prevention and detection of crime. However, I note that it lacks any such qualification for the purposes of national security and economic well-being. I accept that we contemplate telling someone that he has been the subject of surveillance only when the surveillance was unlawfully authorised. But the Bill's requirements are particular, for a good reason. It describes a fastidious regime, which, although it rightly ensures that the relevant safeguards are in place, leaves open the possibility that some practitioners may, for technical reasons, not comply absolutely in each instance. I hope that there are sufficient safeguards to prevent that. If something goes wrong, the commissioner will in any event pick up the technical difficulties. It will be undesirable to have to inform someone that he has been the subject of surveillance, even if it might have been authorised properly and in accordance with the law if the correct procedures had been followed. In other words, the facts would be such that the surveillance was most definitely proportionate but the correct procedures would have gone missing at some stage. I should not like to contemplate people being notified in those circumstances. I believe that there is adequate recourse to the tribunal, which the Bill has improved considerably. For those reasons I have to resist the amendment. I hope that I have assured the hon. Gentleman on at least some of the points that he raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister uses a diplomatic turn of phrase by saying that matters may not always be totally in accordance with the Bill because it is so fastidious. That is an interesting way of putting it. Her reassurances about the commissioner's report are helpful. Whether the commissioner's reports indicate that there are large-scale problems where fastidiousness is too exacting for some practitioners will interest many people. The idea that surveillance can spread causes general concern, even though I accept that, as the Minister said, there may have been good grounds for carrying out surveillance, but the letter of the law had not been observed.
<P>
That throws up many other question, but the Minister's comments about the tribunal and the Commissioner's report were helpful at this stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 224, in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clause 54, page 56, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
`(5A) The report shall, in particular, cover the following matters—
<P>
(a) the number of applications made for authorisations (including renewals) that were granted;
<P>
(b) the number of applications (including renewals) that were refused;
<P>
(c) the average period granted for authorisations (including renewals):
<P>
(d) the offences in respect of which authorisations were given;
<P>
(e) a general description of the methods of surveillance involved in each authorisation;
<P>
(f) the number of persons arrested whose identity became known as a result of a surveillance operation under an authorisation;
<P>
(g) the number of criminal proceedings commenced in which evidence obtained by the authorised surveillance operation was adduced and the number of those proceedings that resulted in a conviction;
<P>
(h) a general assessment of the importance of surveillance operations for the investigation, detection, prevention and prosecution of offences.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to the commissioner's report. We think it important to get a feel from the Minister of the kind of issues that it will contain. In our view the report should cover a broad range of items. We have discussed at various stages of the Bill the amount of information that should be put out about the extent of surveillance that is taking place. Knowing how much, surveillance there has been, and how effective it was is not a security problem although knowledge of specific cases would, of course, cause security problems.
<P>
We have suggested a sort of muddle of a specified range of statistics that should be published. We want the Bill to mandate the commissioner to publish them every year. This is based on published information from Australia, New Zealand and the United States. I have in mind the United States' wonderfully titled wire tap report—the title does not try to hide anything; there is no beating about the bush. The wire tap report contains figures to which United States citizens and others around the world can have access to discover what the American Government have been doing.
<P>
It is important to have a comprehensive report in which the public can be informed about what is being done by their agents in their name for their security, the extent to which it decreases or grows over the years and whether it is effective. We need a provision that would enable us to examine any action taken subsequent to the surveillance to determine how good it was. If we are to understand proportionality, we need to know whether we are trawling or targeting. The figures would establish that and inform the public which of the two was taking place. I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendment, but I hope that she can say whether the commissioner's report will record statistics fastidiously to satisfy us that the report will cover all those issues.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The amendment is not unexpected. It represents an extension of some of the points made previously by the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). At the time, they were offered reassurance that, for example, the number of interception warrants signed on the basis of a mutual legal assistance agreement ought to feature in the annual report submitted by the interception of communications commissioner.
<P>
Under the Bill the content of the report that will be put to the Prime Minister is a matter for the commissioners, although it is subject to the requirement that they inform the Prime Minister of contraventions as set out in clauses 54(3) and (4). Those considerations apart, it is entirely appropriate that the commissioners should decide how to put their findings to the Prime Minister. Obviously, this will determine the nature of the report subsequently published for Parliament. The commissioners, of whom Lord Nolan is one, are senior judicial figures. It is right that they be left some latitude in the way in which they carry out their work and report on it. That deals with the matter of whether we can require the commissioners to approach the reports in certain ways.
<P>
The next issue is whether the matters that the amendment identifies should, or could, be included in the annual report. I have some difficulty in this respect also. I understand the intention behind the amendment because these matters have been raised before, but it presents significant practical difficulties. Under proposed new section (5A)(a) and (b) in amendment No. 224, the commissioner would make publicly available the number of authorisations that were refused. The existing system and safeguards are such that it is hard to define precisely what that would mean. For example, would the commissioner inform the Prime Minister of the number of applications that the Secretary of State refused? If so, should it include the number of applications rejected earlier by officials? When we discussed interception warranty procedures, there were many references to the early technical feasibility studies made by agencies and communications service providers that often involved officials of the Secretary of State on whether a given interception was feasible. Applications might be knocked out at that stage if they included the details that the hon. Gentleman wants. In fact, I would expect them to be. There are many stages in the process of requiring authorisation from a Secretary of State, and applications may get knocked out at any of them. The important aspects are the number of warrants signed and the fact that they were lawfully authorised. The commissioners report on these important matters, subject to security requirements.
<P>
Proposed new section (5A)(d) to (h) in amendment No. 224 is altogether more ambitious, reflecting, I believe, a desire for some general research on the use and effectiveness of surveillance throughout the land. I take it that these concerns are addressed to the authorisation of directed surveillance also. Certainly that is what the proposals, as drafted, would achieve. There was an earlier reference in Committee to a possible 60,000 authorisations for directed surveillance from the police alone. While I understand the motives behind the research that the amendment identifies, that is precisely what it is—research. We may decide to commission such research at some future date, but it is not a matter for the commissioners' annual report. As I said, the commissioners do not need to be pointed in a particular direction in writing their reports. They are senior judicial figures, who are well aware of the balances that are needed in reporting to the Prime Minister and Parliament on the operation of such regimes. I have pointed out some concerns about the categories of information identified in the amendment. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for dealing with the amendment in such detail, but I remain concerned. The Bill could give the commissioners a degree of direction about what their reports should cover. I fully accept that they are senior figures and that there is a duty of respect to them. However, it is quite normal in other areas to give some idea of what a report should contain, when it is a matter of public interest.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned research. That is a fair point in some ways. We are talking about research, but that is slightly demeaning to what we are trying to do. Research is required, but it is not a voluntary option. It is not a case of, ``Do we choose to do this research project or not?'' Our position is that the public have a right to know what is happening. It is essential research, rather than something of only academic interest. There is a human rights interest in the public knowing what is going on. If large-scale surveillance is being undertaken, that does not lessen the need for information to be published—it increases that need. We may want to return to the issue later, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendments are designed to remove some restrictions on the role of the tribunal. The Bill seems to limit the way in which the tribunal will work, in that it will be required to apply judicial review principles. Amendments Nos. 226 and 227 would remedy that. We are concerned, because we believe that European court judgments have made it clear when dealing with tribunals in other instances that applying judicial review principles alone is inadequate. In the case of Chahal v. the UK, I think that the tribunal considered the case only according to judicial review principles, whereas it was held that some of the facts of the case should have been queried as well.
<P>
With amendments Nos. 215 and 216, we ask that the tribunal be able to consider cases according to their merits. That would broaden the tribunal's role and allow it to consider some of the factual evidence about the authorisation of a warrant, in addition to dealing with judicial review principles and legal arguments. We understand the tribunal's role, and the Minister kindly pointed out previously that members of the public will be able to go to the tribunal to see whether something has gone wrong. That broadening of the tribunal's ability to consider matters would be helpful.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I appreciate the intention behind the amendments, and I am keen to address the concerns of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) that by removing Human Rights Act 1998 cases to the tribunal we are offering a weaker kind of review than is available in the ordinary courts.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 215 and 226 are about cases that come under the 1998 Act. The first would require the tribunal to apply a merits test, and the second proposes the test that would apply to complaints under the Act in the ordinary courts. I will explain why we think that the judicial review test in the Bill is right, and meets the hon. Gentleman's concerns.
<P>
First, judicial review and the tests that the courts apply on judicial review are the products of the courts themselves, have developed over 30 years, and will no doubt continue to develop. By referring to judicial review principles, we are not limiting the tribunal's jurisdiction; on the contrary, we are leaving it open.
<P>
Secondly, if the claims under the Act were to come before the ordinary courts, we would expect judicial review to be the mechanism by which that would happen. Section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 allows proceedings to be brought by a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way that is incompatible with convention rights. Judicial review is the obvious way in which to bring those proceedings, We are not, therefore, providing a lower level of review in the tribunal than would be available outside it.
<P>
Thirdly, and most importantly, there is no reason why the merits of a decision cannot be examined by the tribunal. That may sound a bit unorthodox, but I will explain what I mean. One of the tests applied in a judicial review is whether a decision is lawful. Under the Act, that is no longer simply a question of black-letter law, but includes the far broader question of whether the public authority has acted compatibly with the convention. Questions such as, ``Was the conduct proportionate?'' and ``Was the conduct necessary in a democratic society?'' will come within judicial review principles. That will not put the tribunal in the shoes of the decision maker or substitute the tribunal's judgment for that of the public authority being challenged. It does mean, however, that the merits of a decision will come under much closer scrutiny than would be the case in a traditional judicial review.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 216 and 227 tackle the complaints jurisdiction of the tribunal, which is the function that the tribunal will inherit from the existing tribunals and is an important part of the safeguards provided by the Bill against the abuse of power. Amendment No. 216 offers a merits test, and amendment No. 227 ties the tribunal to the test applied by the High Court. There is, in fact, no single High Court test.
<P>
Let me briefly explain why we consider the amendments unnecessary. For the complaints function/we have again referred to judicial review principles, and much of what I have said about those principles applies here, too. The cases under discussion will not, strictly speaking, come under the Human Rights Act 1998; where a convention right is being interfered with, however, I see no reason why the tribunal should not ask itself the same questions about proportionality and necessity. Indeed, the tribunal is a public authority and must also act compatibly with the convention, so it will not be allowed to ignore the convention in carrying out its work. Hon Members can be assured, therefore, that complaints will be considered fully and rigorously.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman and answered his concerns, which I recognise are about serious matters.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It was useful to get those points on the record; it clarified the issues in my brain, which sometimes has difficulty grasping some judicial review concepts. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 218, in page 61, line 46, leave out subsection (7) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) Where the Tribunal have made a final determination of any proceedings (including proceedings on a complaint or reference), any party to the proceedings may bring an appeal to the appropriate appeal court on any question of law material to that determination.
<P>
(7A) An appeal under subsection (7) shall not be brought except with the leave of the Tribunal or, after such leave has been refused, with the leave of the appropriate appeal court.
<P>
(7B) In this section ``appropriate appeal court'' means the Court of Appeal, the Court of Session or the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland, according to the part of the United Kingdom to which the complaint is allocated in accordance with rules under this Part.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 229, in page 61, line 46, leave out `may' and insert `must'.
<P>
No. 219, in page 62, line 3, leave out subsections (8) and (9).
<P>
No. 230, in page 62, line 3, leave out `may' and insert `must'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> With these amendments, we would ensure that a proper appeals process exists at the tribunal stage. I understand that has been a muddle with provisions in schedule 2 of the draft Electronic Communications Bill, the vehicle originally intended to carry some of the provisions in this Bill. By negotiation, that Bill was not proceeded with, and similar provisions were included in a Bill introduced by the Home Office. We want the appeal mechanisms contained in that Bill to be included in this Bill.
<P>
Under amendments Nos. 229 and 230, the word ``may'' in subsections (7) and (8) would be replaced by ``must'', so that the Secretary of State would have to ensure that further recourse to appeals exists, which would strengthen the powers in the clause. Although I am sure that the Minister will say that the Government intend to use those powers, we are concerned that their use will be left to the discretion of the Secretary of State. We do not know whether a wider ability to appeal will exist. Therefore, amendments Nos. 218 and 219 would replace subsections (8) and (9) with a provision that would allow cases to go before the Court of Appeal.
<P>
We want the appeals mechanism to be clarified. I hope that the Minister will tell us the Government's views on that mechanism. I hope that she will express a preference either for including mandatory provisions in the Bill or for ensuring that it states that appeals will go before the appropriate body, rather than for retaining the rather vague drafting under which such matters will be dealt with by order or on a voluntary basis because of the use of the word ``may''.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I hope that my comments will not raise the temperature of what has been a pleasant, almost sleepy, sitting. However, I shall refer often to ordermaking powers, although I know that that occasionally agitates Opposition Members.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's intention, which is that the Bill should state precisely the rights of appeal against the tribunal. Under amendment No. 218, the Court of Appeal, or its equivalent, would be specified as the appropriate avenue of appeal. That definition of the avenue for appeals should be contrasted with the provisions currently in the Bill. Under subsection (7), the tribunal's decisions shall not be questioned or subject to appeal, except as may be stated by order. That order will be subject to the affirmative procedure under subsection (9). Under subsection (8), the different approaches that could be taken in any such order are identified. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that, under subsection (8)(c), the order can contain precisely the arrangements suggested in amendment No. 218.
<P>
The tribunal is new and it will be complex, but it is of considerable advantage that the existing avenues of appeal will be rationalised in that tribunal. However, it must be accepted that, as a result of that rationalisation, several different types of proceedings will be brought before the tribunal. Those proceedings are set out in clause 56(2). They range widely from proceedings under the Human Rights Act 1998, ordinary complaints that the existing tribunals can deal with and references made by those who think that they have suffered loss under clause 16 and proceedings yet unspecified that will be set out by order under clause 56(2)(d). Under the rules in the Bill, the proceedings before the tribunal may differ according to each type of reference.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It will be appropriate to specify a right of appeal, possibly to the Court of Appeal, for some references to the tribunal. The order-making power, and specifically subsection (8)(c), provide for that possibility. Sometimes, however, it will not be appropriate for individuals to have recourse to the Court of Appeal after the tribunal has made a determination. For example, such recourse does not exist for complaints brought to the Interception of Communications Tribunal, the Security Service Tribunal or the Intelligence Services Tribunal, or for complaints brought before the Surveillance Commissioners under the Police Act 1997. Those limitations are justified both by consideration of what is necessary in law, and by the security requirement that we make available only the minimum number of avenues of appeal, to limit the scope for mischief by those who try to use legal processes to uncover valuable operational information.
<P>
The Bill leaves open the possibility of creating a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. Any order made under clause 58 will have to comply with the European convention on human rights, and where that requires recourse from the tribunal, it will be provided and specified. No such recourse for complaints currently exists, and we do not believe that that is merited. A wide variety of references to the tribunal are possible, and the rules that may specify avenues of appeal will be subject to affirmative resolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think that it is a bit poor not to know what the rights of appeal and appeal routes are?
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I was trying to explain that a range of references may be made to the tribunal, so we want to leave decisions on the rights of appeal until we introduce the order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I do not understand. The Bill has been introduced, and various access routes to the tribunal and grounds for access have been set out, so why can we not know the routes of appeal?
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I knew that this would raise the temperature of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Why can the Minister not be specific?
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The genuine answer is that we are preparing the rules, which will be contained in the orders. There is a wide range of potential procedures, and some types of proceedings have not yet been specified. Clause 60 will incorporate all those considerations.
<P>
The drafting of the rules is complicated and involves consulting many interested parties. I cannot guarantee that the rules will be available while the Bill is being considered, but I hope to reassure hon. Members by saying that they will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure that I mentioned. I know that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire will not be satisfied, but I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> For fear of embarrassing the Government with a resounding defeat in Committee, I think that it is sensible to withdraw the amendment. I was interested to hear the Minister say that the Court of Appeal route is open. It is important for us to have more information about that.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire was right to say that when an appeal mechanism is mentioned, the Bill normally gives some idea of how it will work. However, I have noted that an affirmative resolution will be required, so we will be able to debate the appeal mechanism later, and that is helpful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 59</center></H4>
<H4><center>Tribunal procedure</center></H4>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 228, in page 62, line 39, leave out from `complainant' to end of line 43 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of their determination and the reasons for it, subject to excluding any matters that would be contrary to the public interest'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the tribunal provided reasoned decisions. Clause 59(4) makes it clear that the central intention is to provide a statement on whether a determination has been made, subject to rules in clause 60(2)(i) under which information about a determination can be required to be provided to the person who made the complaint or his representative. Rules will be made under clause 60 in relation to the provision of other information, but it would be better to state the reasons clearly in the relevant clause instead of making it subject to rules tucked away in a subsequent clause. That would be more in line with the intentions of the Human Rights Act 1998. A tribunal is likely to rule on potential infringement of privacy under article 8. If an individual's human rights have been infringed, the courts generally prefer reasons to be given in relation to whether a determination has been made. Failure to provide an individual with such information would be incompatible with the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
We hope that the Minister will indicate that the Government intend to provide as much information as possible under clause 60(2)(i). Without a clearer indication of what information is expected to be provided, however, individuals who believe that their fundamental human rights have been infringed under article 8—the right to privacy—will not be satisfied with the result of the determination. They will want further explanation, to which we believe they are entitled. We hope that the Government intend more information to be provided, even if the Minister cannot accept the overwhelming case that the Bill should be amended to ensure that, under clause 59, reasoned judgments are always given.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made a thoughtful and probing contribution to the Committee. I am not surprised that the amendment has been tabled, as it raises important issues.
<P>
The limitation on the nature of the tribunal's determinations in clause 59(4) seems severe. However, the hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention to clause 60, with which clause 59 must be considered. If a tribunal finds that there has been a breach of procedures, the complainant should be offered full redress in terms of financial compensation, destruction of records or otherwise and reasons for the determination. Clause 59(5) requires the tribunal to make a report to the Prime Minister in such circumstances. I hope that that covers a person in whose favour the tribunal made a determination. The rules of the tribunal will provide details of what information will be given. Those rules will be debated in Parliament—again, we return to the ordermaking power.
<P>
We expect to provide for successful complainants to be given details of the findings in question. However, there is no such elaboration for those individuals in whose favour the tribunal has not found. That is a difficult issue, which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary discussed on Second Reading, although in a slightly different context. Were reasons to be given, or confirmation that a person had been the subject of interception or other surveillance techniques, a person could apply to the tribunal merely to discover whether he had been under surveillance.
<P>
That is not a trivial matter, but a real concern. We do not wish to provide a legal mechanism that is needed for excellent reasons but could also be used for those purposes. Individuals may not believe that they have been followed unlawfully; their motive may be purely to establish whether they have been followed. That applies to all the techniques that may be used in connection with cases leading to hearings before the tribunal. It lies behind the reason for a limited response when the tribunal does not find in favour of the complainant. Contemplating more open determinations from the tribunal poses the same problem as deciding whether, after an operation has finished, a person whose communication was intercepted should be informed of that fact.
<P>
On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is logically a difficult position to explain to individuals, and it is difficult for people to understand that they may make a complaint to the tribunal . . . that they may be being intercepted even though it is not possible to tell them whether they are being intercepted. Because it is secret, people are bound to be suspicious, but . . . the powers are operated in a strong ethical and legal framework. That is as it should be.—[Official Report, 6 March 2000 ; Vol. 345, c. 774.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The proposition is simple. We can never deny that someone has been the subject of surveillance. If we are drawn into circumstances in which we deny that fact, people may make inferences when we do not deny it. The ``neither confirm nor deny'' principle has been the policy of successive Governments for some time. The need for it is well understood by the Intelligence and Security Committee, of which the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed is a member.
<P>
This requirement also extends to proceedings before the tribunal. We must prevent individuals from using tribunal proceedings to circumvent our ``neither confirm nor deny'' policy. That is why there is a restriction on what the tribunal can say when it does not find in favour of the complainant. When it does find in favour of the complainant, it will be entitled to give reasons and to award damages.
<P>
I have tried to explain the reasons behind the provisions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist it, but I hope that we can come to an amicable agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was helpful in clarifying the intentions when complaints to the tribunal are successful. I understand the Minister's explanation of the circumstances when people's complaints are unsuccessful. As she rightly pointed out, questions are raised about how difficult it should be to use that route. Let me put down a marker, though, that problems remain in the context of an appeal. Individuals who wish to appeal may challenge the system, but it is difficult to appeal without knowing the grounds on which one is appealing. Some people may wish to challenge the legal principles.
<P>
The amendment has achieved its purpose of clarifying that the rules will contain reasons when individuals' complaints are successful and determination is made in their favour. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have another query about subsection (4), which my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed asked me to clear up. It relates to the circumstances that obtain when no determination in favour of the complainant has been made. If there has been a breach of procedures, but it is not too serious, will a subsection (4) determination always be made in favour of the complainant or will proportionality considerations be taken into account? How wide is the category of cases covered by this provision? My right hon. Friend asked me to raise that question to establish the circumstances in which a subsection (4)(b) determination will be invoked to deny giving individual complainants any further information.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> We have no intention of limiting the determination when a tribunal makes a finding, however technical, in a complainant's favour. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We are looking at the issue of legal representation before the tribunal. We do not exist to provide work for lawyers.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I thought that we did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We exist to provide law, but not necessarily work for lawyers. However, we feel that they can facilitate matters in a wide variety of circumstances, particularly in connection with technical issues involved in the state being challenged over whether human rights have been infringed. We seek to tighten the provisions for legal representation at the tribunal. In particular, amendment No. 220 seeks to change subsection (3) to say that the rules ``shall'' rather than ``may'' provide the right to be legally represented. In other words, we seek to make the rules mandatory rather than voluntary, as we frequently do on these occasions.
<P>
Amendment No. 221 seeks to change what in the Bill is simply the right to be legally represented to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the right to be represented by a legal representative of his choice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, we are trying to clarify whether it is the intention that individuals should be able to use their own lawyer and legal team—subject to the normal restrictions over what fee levels can be paid—or whether there will be a legal representative associated in some way with the tribunal who will simply be provided. If that is deemed to be sufficient legal representation, we disagree. The general principle that, as far as possible, individuals should choose their own legal representative, who should not be associated with the body hearing the case, is an important one. We want to be clear whether that is the intention in these circumstances.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify for the Committee her intentions on legal representation and what the rules should contain? It is important at this stage that we put something on record about the issue of legal representation before the tribunal.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I fully understand and support the purpose behind the amendments, but by abolishing subsection (3)(b) and (c), the amendment would in fact be detrimental to the applicant's interest.
<P>
The starting position is that wherever the applicant has a right to make representations, either written or oral, he or she will be able to be legally represented by a lawyer of his or her choice, but because of the sensitive nature of the cases that the tribunal will hear, it is inevitable that open hearings will not always be available. That is reflected in subsection (6)(b), which contains the principle that information must not be disclosed where that might be contrary to the public interest or might prejudice national security, the prevention or detection of serious crime, and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Is it the Government's intention that in incompatibility proceedings, where there is quite a lot of law involved, the person who is bringing the matter before the tribunal would be legally represented?
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I would expect so. Because individuals could raise such issues with the tribunal, they would be entitled to representation.
<P>
At present, tribunals may conduct oral hearings at their discretion, on whatever issue, although it is not generally the practice. We expect that to continue for their complaints function and Human Rights Act cases. The compatibility cases that the hon. Gentleman was talking about are not normally oral hearings at present. We would expect that to continue.
<P>
In other case, oral hearings may be the norm. However, the need to protect sensitive information will remain the top priority. Subsection 4(b) recognises that and provides the power to make rules enabling or requiring the tribunal to take any step in the exercise of its jurisdiction, in the absence of any person, including the applicant, and in the absence of any legal representative, but subsection (4) provides an important mitigation by allowing a person to be appointed to represent the applicant's interest. Such a person, sometimes known as the special advocate, enables the interest of the applicant and the protection of sensitive information to be reconciled.
<P>
How a special advocate procedure would work in the context of the tribunal and the kind of cases where one might be appointed will be for the rules of procedure However, it is likely that he or she would have experience in such cases and would have security clearance. More importantly, there would not be an ordinary lawyer-client relationship with the applicant, so the special advocate could be privy to security information and could fearlessly put forward arguments on behalf of the applicant without being under a professional duty to report back to the applicant. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman and that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We will wish to consider the issue again although I recognise that the Minister has made some reasonable points about the nature of the advocate in these circumstances. We are concerned that tribunals should allow the individual to have proper representation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 222, in, page 65, line 41, leave out `; and (b)' and insert `, bearing in mind'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 223, in page 65, line 45, leave out from `kingdom' to end of line 46.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendment seeks to alter what the Secretary of State has regard to when he makes the rules for the tribunal procedures. As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State has regard to two issues: one is ensuring that the tribunal functions properly and the other is ensuring that the public interest, national security, prevention and detection of serious crime and so on are not jeopardised. We are concerned that the two tests seem to be being applied equally and that when the Secretary of State creates his rules he must give equal consideration to those two issues.
<P>
Our understanding of European convention on human rights is that the individual's right to fair legal proceedings would supersede some of the other interests. The Secretary of State can bear in mind the other issues subsequently and erode that right when that is necessary to comply with the requirements of national security, prevention and detection of serious crime and so on. We believe that it is much better to say that the paramount issue of concern to the Secretary of State when drafting the rules for the tribunal must be to ensure that the complaints are properly heard and considered and that that is subject to a restriction based on the other considerations, rather than saying that the two are equal in the Secretary of State's mind.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 seeks to limit further the considerations that the Secretary of State can have in mind to those that are the grounds for the issuing of the warrants that provoked the complaint. The criterion that we seek to remove relates to

</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is quite a catch-all. A wide category of information could be deemed sufficiently important to the continued work of the intelligence services that the rules might prevent material from being introduced because it would prejudice those continuing interests. We are concerned about that. The provision relating to information that is prejudicial to national security is sufficient.
<P>
Over recent months and years, a succession of cases has dealt with how long one should keep material secret and how significant that is to the country's future well-being. Some individuals and the intelligence services seem to have reached different judgments on that. We are concerned about the introduction of a catch-all phrase at this stage in the Bill, when there is a perfectly adequate set of tests. The national security test, in particular, can cover sensitive intelligence services materials, without an additional category being included in paragraph (b).
<P>
I hope that that makes the intention clear to the Minister. As I said, this is about article 6 compliance. Changing the wording as we have suggested would not diminish the Secretary of State's ability, within the rules, to restrict the way in which the tribunal works to protect the UK's interests. However, the Minister could signal that the right to a fair hearing is paramount and that the other provisions are restrictions that have had to be applied and do not have the same merit as the right to a fair hearing.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The purpose of subsection (6) is to ensure that a balance is kept in any case considered by the tribunal between the two competing priorities that the hon. Gentleman described. The first is to ensure a fair trial; the second is the need to avoid doing harm—for example, to the public interest—by disclosing information that could lead to the loss of life. Obviously, both factors are highly important. The Bill therefore requires the Secretary of State to have regard to both in making any rules with regard to the tribunal. I do not see that requiring the consideration of one to require consideration of the other adds anything to the balance that the subsection already strikes.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 would delete the requirement to avoid disclosing information that might be contrary to the continued discharge of the functions of any of the intelligence services. That fifth limb is designed to safeguard GCHQ's function under section 3(1)(b) of the Intelligence Services Act 1994. Section 3(1 )(b)(ii) states that one function of GCHQ is to provide advice and assistance about cryptography and other matters relating to the protection of information and other material. It is important that the tribunal should not be used as a vehicle by people who seek to compromise the security of the Government's communications by acquiring details of the cryptographic systems used to protect them. That is why the Bill covers both the points in the amendments. I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will feel able to withdraw the amendment in the light of what I have said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying those points. We remain of the view that our wording is preferable to that in the Bill, but the Minister has taken the view that there is little difference in practice. However, the signal that our wording would send is important.
<P>
On the Minister's response to amendment No. 223 and the issue of cryptography, one feature of the tribunal system will be the greater involvement of GCHQ. There are likely to be many complaints about section 46 notices in particular, given the hostile feeling there has been towards them. GCHQ's role in providing information on cryptography might therefore be enhanced. We will want to see how that works; with regard to proportionality, we will question whether the keys that are demanded are right for the job and whether the information in question is essential protected information. Some of the advice provided by GCHQ may be of interest, and we may wish some of it to be made more public, although I will not seek to press that at this stage, however. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Harry Cohen </B>(Leyton and Wanstead): I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 66, line 16, after `(1)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subject to subsection (3A),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 96, in page 66, line 35, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) Where parts of a code of practice or draft code of practice relate to the processing of personal data, the code shall not be issued the Secretary of State unless those parts of the code have been reviewed by the Data Protection Commissioner.
<P>
(3B) The Data Protection Commissioner may require the Secretary of State to include in any code of practice issued by him a statement concerning the processing of personal data.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> At an earlier sitting, the Minister said that the code of practice would be an important safeguard. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We will consider whether we can find a better, more holistic approach in the code of practice, although I am not sure how to achieve that.—[Official Report, Standing Committee F, 28 March 2000; c. 259.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have some good news—or perhaps not such good news—for the Minister. It appears that the data protection commissioner has had some ideas on that subject.
<P>
My amendment would ensure the involvement of the commissioner in the production of the code of practice. As I said on Second Reading, it is surprising that the Bill keeps the official most responsible for the protection of individual privacy out of the picture. My argument was simple: she should be able to review the code of practice before it is published, and make a statement, saying, we hope, how wonderful it all is.
<P>
Since I tabled my amendments, the data protection commissioner has published her response to the Bill in the form of a briefing for parliamentarians. She has sent that document to the Library, the Government and Front-Bench spokespersons. It makes interesting reading for those of us concerned with privacy. In 30-„odd short paragraphs, it is difficult to find one that is not critical of the Bill. She questions the Bill's main approach, stating in paragraph 4 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>she believes that there are strong arguments in favour of ensuring that warrants for interception are subject to judicial scrutiny at the point of issue, but notes that the Government has not made provision for this in the Bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 5 she accepts that warrants might be justified for national security, but adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the same complications do not arise in relation to the interception of communications for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In summary, the commissioner would prefer warrants to be obtained under a judicial warrant, especially where the interception was related to the prevention and detection of crime and other non-national security matters. That is partly to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>allow for judicial scrutiny of the procedure at a later date and would provide an alternative to the Tribunal as a forum for dispute resolution.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With respect to communications data—a subject on which I have tabled amendments—the commissioner
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>questions the distinction made in the Bill between the requirements for gaining access to data contained within an intercepted communication and those for gaining access to other communications data such as traffic and billing information. Both sets of data provide insight into the private lives of individuals and should therefore be subject to equivalent controls and safeguards.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 9, the commissioner says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is the Commissioner's view that access to traffic and billing data should also be made subject to prior judicial scrutiny, so that consideration could be given to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, authorising officials should seek the authority of the courts and not be self-authorised.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, when the Freedom of Information Bill is enacted, the data protection commissioner will be renamed the information commissioner? Does he see anything sinister in that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> I will not be drawn on that. The Minister may respond if he wishes—that matter is not as significant as the other one.
<P>
In paragraph 11, the commissioner rejects the idea that the surveillance may not be defined as intrusive unless the device provides information of the same quality and detail as may be expected to be obtained from a device on the premises or in the vehicle. She adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is the view of the Commissioner that external surveillance devices, for example long lens photographic equipment, can be used in an intrusive manner, providing sufficient detail to infringe the privacy of the individual, even when the information is not of the same quality or detail as may be obtained by a device located on the premises in the vehicle. The fact that a picture from a long lens camera might not be quite as clear as form a camera placed in the room does not necessarily make the infringement of privacy any less.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 12, the commissioner begins to throw caution to the wind and says that the Bill's approach to covert surveillance is wrong. She states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is the view of the Commissioner that the surveillance should be regarded as covert if the effect is that persons are unaware that it is being carried out. It should not be defined on the basis of whether it is the intention of those carrying out the surveillance to ensure that the persons are unaware.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 13, the commissioner states that there is no appropriate counter-balance to the misuse of powers. She notes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Further, criminal sanctions should be applied where appropriate authorisation has not been sought.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The commissioner laments the fact that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no provision for any criminal sanction m the Bill in relation to unauthorised intrusive surveillance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 16, which relates to access to electronic data protected by encryption, the commissioner says that she is concerned that the Bill has implications for encrypted data and the wider categories of electronic data.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mr. Cohen, I should be grateful if you confined yourself to discussing draft codes of practice and the data protection commissioner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Michie. I am arguing that the commissioner should be involved in the code of practice. As I said, she is the principal officer responsible for privacy, and the codes of practice are important.
<P>
If you will allow me, Mrs. Michie, I shall continue with the commissioner's criticisms. In paragraph 16, the commissioner states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the original consultation document it was made clear that the aim of the Government was to address the problem of lawful access to encrypted information and the Commissioner is unclear why the scope of the legislation has been extended to cover a wider range of protected data.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 18, the commissioner laments the fact that those who are subject to surveillance that turns out to be misplaced. She states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Bill, as currently drafted, makes it unlikely that individuals will be informed where the integrity of their private keys has been jeopardised and they may continue to use these keys without being aware that their security has been compromised. Third parties whose personal data forms part of any protected electronic information may also be unaware of the risks posed to their data.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 21, the commissioner discusses clause 46 and the lack of a requirement for a clause 46 notice to be given in writing. She states that she
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>frequently deals with complaints where an unauthorised person has, by deception, attempted to gain access—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mr. Cohen, you have given enough examples. Instead of reading out the whole document, perhaps you would come to the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> Yes, indeed, Mrs. Michie. The data protection commissioner's statement has not been widely distributed and is relevant to our deliberations. However, I shall heed your advice, Mrs. Michie, and not go through the commissioner's remaining points, important as they are.
<P>
I tabled amendments suggesting that the commissioner should be involved in the code of practice before she made her statement. Having read her criticisms, my view that she should be brought on board in relation to the code is strengthened. The Minister of State himself acknowledged that that would be most important. The commissioner's involvement in setting up the code of practice can only be of benefit in reassuring those people who have privacy concerns about the Bill.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Any doubt about the independence and forthright views of the commissioners has been dispelled by my hon. Friend. Many of the specific issues that have been raised about the data protection commissioner have been dealt with during previous debates, so I shall not cover the grounds for judicial warranting, the regime for communications data and so on. I understand the point that my hon. Friend makes, but the assurances that he seeks need not be specified in the Bill.
<P>
We must consider the relationship between the Bill and the data protection commissioner's role, and the desirability of the amendment. The interests of the data protection commissioner clearly relate most closely to chapter II of part I on the acquisition and disclosure of communications data. I do not say that there are no other references to the data protection commissioner in the Bill, but the relationship in chapter II is the closest. I am sure that that is my hon. Friend's view, given the amendments that he tabled to that chapter.
<P>
We have already discussed the close and tricky relationship that sometimes exists between the content of communications and communications data. That important distinction is sometimes hard to define. Indeed, as technologies change, special attention will need to be focused on that issue, and the hon. Member for Hallam has made that point more than once. Therefore, one marked change under the Bill is in the extension of the interception of communications commissioner's role to cover the use made by law enforcement and other agencies of the explicit power in chapter II.
<P>
The interception of communications commissioner already oversees the interception regime under the Interception of Communications Act 1985. He has agreed that a natural extension of that role would be to oversee the regime in chapter II, which closely relates to the regime in chapter I.
<P>
The code of practice covering access to communications data may be included in the code that deals with the interception of communications. Even if it is not, the commissioner who oversees communications should clearly be the appropriate commissioner to pay most regard to the code before it is issued. The codes will be subject to public consultation. Any individual can comment on drafts. The Bill does not state that the interception commissioner should consider the interception code or that the surveillance commissioner should consider the surveillance code because it is axiomatic that they will want to consider the codes and that any comment they make will be taken extremely seriously.
<P>
For those reasons and because the data protection commissioner is probably not the commissioner with the most interest in the communications code, I ask the Committee to resist the amendment. However, I assure my hon. Friend that the data protection commissioner will be shown the codes, and that her views will be carefully considered. That will not only be the case where her views affect the processing of personal data, as suggested in the amendment; any other view that she has to offer will be welcomed and seriously considered, including those that my hon. Friend described. I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> The key point is my hon. Friend's assurance that the Data Protection Registrar will be shown the draft codes of practice and that her views will be carefully considered. Until now, the Bill has not given proper weight to her position. I hope that that will be rectified under the codes of practice. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that assurance and, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The clause raises concerns that need airing, particularly in the context of the powers in clause 46. Throughout the debate, concern has been expressed about key escrow, which involves bodies feeling required to place their keys with a third party, and the fact that business does not want it. We are concerned that clause 69, because it places a burden on businesses, will make them feel that they have to engage in key escrow against their wishes. That could have a damaging impact on the business community, particularly IT-based businesses.
<P>
Subsection (1) is of particular concern and I hope that the Minister will explain the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of
<P>
(a) a director, manager<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on
<P>
I think that we would all agree that if someone commits an offence with the consent or connivance of the people who run the business, we can clearly establish mens rea: the managers are part of the operation of causing an offence to take place, which would allow the security services to take out a warrant against them. That is not a problem. However, offences
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>attributable to any neglect on the part of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could catch a broad range of people, so it is important to flesh out what that means. It may apply to a senior manager or director who had allowed employees to download their own encryption software and encrypted data, and send it backwards and forwards. There may have been no reason for that senior manager to intervene in normal circumstances. We are saying to businesses whose employees use encryption that senior management staff will have to take control of that throughout the company. That might not suit managers; they might never have felt that they had to do that before. They may be happy to delegate to individuals that they provide their own encryption software. That is not an unrealistic situation.
<P>
If the clause covers such a situation and places a mandatory duty on managers and directors of companies to control things that they would not otherwise have controlled—I am thinking particularly of encryption—that causes me concern. Managers or directors of a company may have no mischievous intent and may be operating in a way that is normal in their sector of business. I hope that the Minister will tell us what is covered by neglect in this context, so that we can decide whether we need to return to the issue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause provides for personal criminal liability on the part of certain individuals in companies and other corporate bodies. That is necessary so that such bodies can be held properly to account—for example, when they are served with a notice requiring them to maintain an interception capability, or to make some protected information intelligible,
<P>
The concept is common; it exists in many other pieces of legislation. I have two examples: section 171 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and section 32 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. However, I understand the points that the hon. Gentleman made about partnership with industry. In fact, industry suggested strongly to us that part III should be exempted from the clause. We are giving careful consideration to that point. We would need to be satisfied that the offences in clauses 49 and 50, in part III, are adequate on their own. We do not want the Bill to cause anxiety in relation to the partnership with industry that we are trying to develop. I therefore cannot give the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance that we will deal with the matter as he suggested. However, we are taking seriously the points made by industry. We have not closed our minds, and we are engaged in discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for informing us that discussions with industry are taking place, which is crucial. An apparently innocent piece of legislation could cause major problems for the IT business and e-commerce once company lawyers become involved. The Prime Minister would be upset if that were to happen, as he clearly regards it as an important sector, as do l and, I am sure, the whole Committee. Can the Minister inform us at a later stage about any proposed charges? Negotiation with industry on the part III exemption would be the best way forward. Otherwise, the House will have to return to the issue at a later stage. It is excellent that the Government are listening to industry's views on this occasion.

This is a short technical amendment to ensure that proceedings before the tribunal are excepted from the rules restricting disclosure of information obtained under part I of the Electronic Communications Bill.

</UL></FONT>.'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 190.
<P>
Mr. Clarke: The amendments will ensure that the regulation of surveillance and covert human intelligence sources by Customs and Excise and British Transport police in Scotland is covered in the Bill. The amendments provide that officers can apply for authorisations under part II, in relation to their activities in Scotland. In that respect, the agencies are put on the same footing as those identified in clause 73(4)—the intelligence services, Her Majesty's forces, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Defence police. The amendment also slightly changes the wording of clause 73(4)(e) and (f) to make it clear that when a body is designated under an order-making power in part II, the order should specify whether the part II regime extends to the body's activities in Scotland.
<P>
Flexibility is maintained for bodies designated in future. That is necessary to ensure that the arrangements under part II can dovetail with those under a Bill shortly to be introduced in the Scottish Parliament. That Bill will regulate the activities identified in part II of this Bill and carried out by the police in Scotland. It will, separately, leave open the possibility of the designation of other bodies in Scotland that may use surveillance or covert human intelligence sources.
<P>
We have discussed at length with the Scottish Executive how the separate regimes are to dovetail. The Scottish Parliament is today discussing the relationship between the two Bills. All are agreed that the priority is to provide for seamless operations on both sides of the border and to ensure that relevant activities are regulated as soon as possible with regard to the impact of the Human Rights Act. Some of the provisions in this Bill might be dealt with in the Scottish legislation, depending on precisely how that legislation is drafted, but there is no reason here to debate the detail of what may be devolved or reserved matters, as it is with the agreement of Scottish Ministers and, I expect, the Scottish Parliament that we are enacting this Bill. The priority here, for all, is to legislate for the impact of the Human Rights Act and to leave operational agencies with the minimum regulation necessary for that purpose.
<P>
The amendment provides for flexibility, allowing bodies designated in future to be designated under the Scottish Bill, where appropriate. It is possible that further consideration of the relationship between the two Bills will lead to the need for further amendment of this Bill. I am thinking particularly of the need to provide for surveillance by public authorities that may cross the border between England and Scotland. That is a matter to which I shall return later. ln the meantime, we are amending today what we already know should be changed.
<P>
I hope that that clarifies why we tabled the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> As you will recall, Mrs. Michie, the Law Society of Scotland was anxious to know what consultations had taken place about part II with the First Minister in the Scottish Parliament and the powers that be in the Scottish domestic field. The Minister said that there had been some discussions. Could he amplify that a little, as the Law Society asked about it in particular? It would be helpful to know that people in Scotland are completely signed up to the proposal.
<P>
What will happen with bodies such as the egg marketing inspectorate and the sea fisheries inspectorate, which are cross-border bodies? Those matters are devolved in Scotland, so they would be entitled to make their own decisions there. In England and Wales, a different regime will apply. How will operations be conducted against that background when the criminals might not conveniently decide to stay within one jurisdiction or the other?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> These are serious matters, Mrs. Michie, which I am hesitant to discuss in front of you, as you have much more experience of the ideology of the Scottish debate. The Scottish Executive have been discussing things very closely with us. We agree on two fundamental points. The first is the need to introduce the legislation to ensure ECHR compatibility and the second is the need to ensure that any regulation dovetails as closely as possible to minimise any impact on the enforcement and any other operations. As the hon. Gentleman said, criminals will not confine their activities to national or subregional boundaries.
<P>
Ministers in Scotland have already announced their intention to legislate for surveillance in Scotland. The Bill will be published shortly and the Scottish Parliament is today debating the Sewel motion, which ensures that it can be debated properly. We have a good, close working relationship on these matters. I said that there was flexibility to enable bodies designated in future to be designated under the Scottish Bill where appropriate. I hope that we can solve these matters directly. The Scottish Executive and the Government are working closely together on this. I hope that the Committee can support the amendment.

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> May I take this opportunity, Mrs. Michie, to express my thanks to everyone who has worked so hard to make the Committee stage of the Bill a success? I pay particular tribute to you and to Mr. O'Hara for the manner in which you have chaired our proceedings, and to my ministerial colleague and my right hon. and hon. Friends who have worked so well together. I must express my appreciation to the hon. Members for North-East Hertfordshire and for Hallam, who led for the Opposition, for their constructive and positive contribution. We have tried to work as co-operatively as possible, and, judging from the way in which they have worked with us, that has clearly engendered respect among Opposition colleagues. I pay public tribute to them for their positive contribution.
<P>
I thank the wide range of organisations outside the House that have spent a great deal of time and energy contributing thoughtful ideas for us to consider as we addressed this difficult subject. They have organised conferences, events and sites for the exchange of views. That has been generally constructive and has ensured that what we are doing is better understood in the wider community. I appreciate the efforts that they have made.
<P>
I should also like to offer my thanks to our departmental Bill team, who worked extremely effectively and efficiently and made my and my colleagues' jobs a great deal easier. I know that it would have been apparent had our speeches been made straight off the top of our heads with no preparation whatever, but I can reveal the covert activity that took place to ensure that that did not happen—[Interruption.] I know that the Opposition Whip tried to intercept those communications at various points but was unsuccessful, thanks to the Bill's proposals. I thank the Bill team for their tremendous work. I thank also the Clerk and the Hansard reporters, as well as the stewards and police who have kept our affairs in order. I have enjoyed being a member of the Committee, Mrs. Michie, and I am grateful for the way in which you have chaired our proceedings. I am grateful to everyone for what has been a very full and satisfactory Committee stage.

I thank Labour Members, who have been extremely pleasant. Whenever they spoke, they appeared to agree with us. Sadly, that that was not reflected in Divisions. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-„Worcestershire who did some of the speaking from the Front Bench and to both Whips—my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) for the way in which they have looked after the business. They have conducted it well and when necessary, intercepted communications, as the Minister said.
<P>
I thank Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Hallam who described himself as a dyed-in-the-wool Liberal. I am not sure what that means. Perhaps, to paraphrase Bobby Robson, the Newcastle manager, it means that he bleeds orange. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and the Border who made an excellent contribution to the Committee's proceedings and winkled out some good information about the Royal Parks constabulary. I liked what my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) said about my rapier-like legal ability. I must try to serve again on a Committee with him and my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor), who knows so much about the subject.
<P>
I also join in the thanks to Hansard, the police, the Clerks, the Officers of the House and all the outside organisations that have provided so much support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee, so I will just issue a small Liberal echo to all the thanks given by other hon. Members, who have said all that needs to be said.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the Minister and hon. Members for their kind words, which I will pass on to Mr. O'Hara, who is in Strasbourg on business this week. I, too, add my thanks to the staff of the House, Hansard, the messengers, the police and the officials. I say a special personal thank you to the Clerk for his expert advice. He is a mine of essential information, and we could not do without him.
<P>
I have enjoyed chairing the Committee, not least because its members have been affable and co-„operative, and have retained a sense of humour. They have also not raised too many weird points of order. I am sure that we will come across one another again in similar circumstances, and I look forward to that. I seem to have put endless questions to the Committee during the past few weeks, but now we have reached the last.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
