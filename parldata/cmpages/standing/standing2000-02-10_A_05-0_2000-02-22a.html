<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Jimmy Hood in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/049/2000049.htm">Utilities Bill</a></center></H3>
<b>10 am</b>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): On a point of order, Mr. Hood. According to the amendment paper, we are to discuss clauses 3 and 86, which appear to make ordinary technical changes transferring undertakings and property from the existing regulators to the new regulators. Having checked all my paperwork, I have realised that the Committee has not been given any listing of the properties and kinds of undertakings that are being transferred. Normally I would not think that that was a matter of great concern, but I read in a newspaper over the weekend that Ofgem has just taken over a massive new office block. If we are to discuss clauses 3 and 86 in a sensible way, we need to know, for the public good, exactly what is being transferred, and why that organisation should be taking over such a massive office block.
<P>
If the Government cannot provide us with that list, clauses 3 and 86 should be debated at a later stage of the Committee's proceedings. Otherwise, it will be as if we are discussing a merger without knowing what its effects will be, or what calls on the public purse will be involved. We will be able to do our job better if discussion of the clauses is postponed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for the Chair. The hon. Gentleman may wish to explore it with the Minister in the stand part debate.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<P>
Transfer to Authority and Council of functions, property etc
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> Clause 3 provides for the transfer of the functions of the Director General of Gas Supply and the Director General of Electricity Supply either to the new Gas and Electricity Markets Authority—GEMA—or the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council. Broadly speaking, functions associated with the regulation of the gas and electricity markets will transfer to GEMA, while functions associated with information about consumer matters and about complaints handling will pass to the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council.
<P>
The functions of GEMA will include: licensing of gas and electricity companies; modification of licence conditions; where companies are price regulated, setting price caps in accordance with the licence conditions; setting overall and individual standards of performance; ensuring compliance with licence conditions and standards of practice; dispute resolution and enforcement action; and concurrent powers under the Competition Act 1998 and the Fair Trading Act 1973. The functions of the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council will include publication of information in the interests of consumers and complaints handling. It will also have a new role as a consumer advocate.
<P>
I shall deal in due course with the question that the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) asked. It was a proper subject to raise.
<P>
After Royal Assent, transfers of property, rights or liabilities of the directors will need to take place, as appropriate, to reflect the transfer of functions. For example, databases containing information about consumer complaints should pass from the regulators to the new consumer council. Therefore, under clause 3 the Secretary of State has the power to make transfer schemes to achieve that. The clause allows for the transfer of the property, rights and liabilities of the gas consumers council to the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council.

<P>
The clause brings into effect schedule 3 with regard to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council. That schedule contains more detail relating to the transfer of functions, property, rights and liabilities, including continuity of employment of transferred employees. As schedule 3 also deals with water, it will be dealt with following consideration of the clauses on the regulation of water.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I am grateful to the Minister for that description of the clause. I commiserate with him on having to stand in for the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, although I am grateful to him for doing so. We send her our sympathy and hope that she makes a speedy recovery.

<P>
Will the Minister spell out the mechanics of the clause in more detail and, in particular, set out the appointed days of the various transfer schemes required by subsection (5)? That subsection states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``On the day appointed by a transfer scheme, the property, rights and liabilities which are the subject of the scheme shall, by virtue of this subsection, be transferred in accordance with the provisions of the scheme.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
When will Offer's property, rights and liabilities be transferred to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and when will the property, rights and liabilities of the gas consumers council and the electricity consumer committees be transferred to the Gas and Electricity Consumers Council?

<P>
Will the Minister set out the powers behind Ofgem, which appears to be in operation, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset said, even though the Bill does not yet have Royal Assent? Can he confirm that its powers are based on the powers in the Gas Act 1986 or the Electricity Act 1989 and, in particular, say how an authority that is not yet in being appears to be entering into a contract to acquire rights and property?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am surprised that the Minister said that he would tell us during the debate what we were discussing in terms of the transfer, because I wanted him to set out at the beginning what we were discussing.

<P>
I had little time at the weekend, and particularly yesterday, to address those concerns. I am sure that members of the Committee will be delighted to hear that my association yesterday decided to readopt me as the prospective parliamentary candidate for South Dorset, so I had to keep my mind on other, baser matters than the high art of dealing with the Utilities Bill. However, one of the staff of The Daily Telegraph was able to flesh out the story that she had written announcing that Ofgem had taken over the lease of the Millbank building.

<P>
It is difficult to describe it as a building, because it is not just an office building but a city block. Those who have made use of ICI's facilities will know that there are squash courts in the building for hon. Members who wish to use them early in the morning. When I was younger and fitter, I made use of that facility. Depending on which door one went through, getting down to the squash courts in the basement was an interesting exploration and one got an idea of the size of the building. It is an eight-storey building. Ofgem will occupy half of it. What is extraordinary is that it will put 450 people into it.

<P>
That immediately rang alarm bells in my mind. We all thought that three, four or five people would be on a committee that would oversee what was happening in the regulatory authority. I suspected that it would have a private office of half a dozen people to look after all the information coming in. I thought that it would have a complaints department, which would certainly not be in central London. Why would any organisation locate its complaints department on a prime site next to the Thames? We were talking about marble earlier. Why bother with marble when one has an eight-storey city block that is too large for ICI, with its hundreds of thousands of employees, and too large for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has now moved into a smaller building?

<P>
We are discussing the transfer of powers. I discover from a press release that Ofgem already has offices in Glasgow and Leicestershire that will not be affected by its taking over this operation. Ofgem has 14 regional offices, which it will transfer over to the consumer council. We, as Back-Bench Members of Parliament, are told that this is a technical clause, without amendments, and that, as technical clauses go, it is perfectly okay. We are being asked to put a big tick in the box that will enable the Minister to allow Ofgem, which is already signing contracts for buildings, to embark on this extraordinary empire building.

<P>
I have not yet found out what Ofgem is to pay for the block, but when ICI took over the lease many years ago, it paid £3.5 million a year. I understand that Ofgem is to sublet half the building, but it is massive. It is extraordinary that any organisation should go against the Government policy of removing congestion in central London by moving into that office block. I hope that the Minister has some information on these questions.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Whatever happens in this project, I assure the hon. Gentleman, who is very assiduous in these matters, that it will not result in the shambles presided over by the previous Government during the construction of the building opposite the former ICI headquarters. I sat through many hearings of the Public Accounts Committee, at which we were told of the cost of the present MI5 headquarters rising from £140 million to £400 million. This project will bear no resemblance to that total shambles. We know how to manage these matters.

<P>
In answer to the question put by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), no decisions have yet been made in relation to the timetable. The most likely possibility is 1 April 2001. That is the Government's target, but we shall not make a final decision until the Bill has received Royal Assent. We shall also bear in mind the progress being made in preparing for the transfer.

<P>
I turn to the questions raised by the hon. Member for South Dorset. Ofgem is the name given to the office of the regulator. It has no status in statute. The regulator is, at present, the Director General of Gas Supply and the Director General of Electricity Supply. The regulator will enter into the contracts in their names. When the Bill receives Royal Assent, the regulator will be the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. Ofgem will provide GEMA's office facilities, just as it provided such facilities for the directors general.

<P>
On the question of going to 11 Millbank, Opposition Members will be aware that call or complaints centres can be located anywhere in the world. The new authority's efficiency will depend on astuteness of management and on good organisation. Wherever it is located—either just down the road from here or elsewhere in the country—I am confident that it will be managed astutely and that it will run a good complaints section.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The decision about whether to site such an important office near to Parliament—the hon. Member for South Dorset referred to a city block in the centre of London—properly lies with the director general. The major difference between the Government and the Opposition is that I have faith in the people who are appointed to do the job. Unlike the Conservative party, we are not control freaks and we are prepared to allow the directors general to take such decisions. I am sure that they will make good decisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Seldom has a more naked Minister been sent to the Front Bench to answer my questions.

<P>
Before we can agree to the clause, we need to know more about the current staffing arrangements for the bodies that regulate the gas and electricity industries, what buildings those bodies currently occupy and why those buildings are being transferred to the new authority, which has clearly already decided that it will create enormous new blocks.

<P>
The Minister rightly pointed out that complaints and call centres can be located anywhere in the country. If one dials any Government switchboard other than that for 10 Downing street, which has a different system, one might think that one was talking to someone in Whitehall—that used to be the case; there used to be a centralised switchboard—but in fact one talks to someone in Glasgow or the north-east. That switchboard connects people all over Whitehall.

<P>
Bills that are designed for environmental reasons to cut down on pollution should not include from the outset powers that will allow the transfer of undertakings to town centre blocks containing 450 people. Such powers should not be transferred on a nod and a wink or for the reasons that the Minister gave.

<P>
Perhaps I can press the Minister further in this regard. Does he have a list of the assets that the clause will transfer to the new authority? When the two authorities become the new authority, will the number of people and buildings go down? Will there be fewer people and less property? Will the Bill authorise the transfer of additional assets to an organistion that will not require them, and what is the value of those assets? What is the staff's status? Will they change their contracts of employment? Will they stop being civil servants and become non-civil servants, or vice versa? If they have pension schemes, how will they be transferred? Whenever any Government operation is privatise or reorganised, such matters are crucial. Members of Parliament are approached by constituents who want to know the answers to those questions.

<P>
My job this morning is to scrutinise the Bill, not to stop the Government from doing what they want to do or to alter what has already been done—they have already established Ofgem and are establishing its empire. I suspect that the Government's majority means that it is a done deal. The minister wants to know that his career is secure. He does not want to have to face the Public Accounts Committee to tell it that, on a nod and a wink, he has decided to go ahead with this office block. As he rightly pointed out—he started to make my speech for me—there are two office blocks on two of the other three corners of the link. One is Thames house, which was rebuilt by MI5 or MI6—I am never sure which, so perhaps I am not allowed to know. Anyway, it was one of them. They are terribly secret buildings, although they were in the new James Bond film, which lets people know exactly where they are. They were built at enormous public expense, and are now a public scandal. The Minister appears to have arrived at the Committee this morning without a list of all the assets that we are about to transfer. He is looking terribly relaxed, but when the Public Accounts Committee asks, ``Why were these billions of pounds put in to this office block?''—

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Billions?

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister is surprised, but the Committee does not know the figures. Have you, Mr. Hood, heard the Minister tell us the cost? Have we heard how many people will be employed? We have not even been told whether it will be more people or fewer. We have been asked to transfer assets, but the Minister now tells us that the two separate regulators are acquiring extra assets in advance of the introduction of the new authority. The new authority does not have to delay the creation of its empire; it is being created for it.

<P>
I am unhappy that the Minister seems so relaxed about his future career, the future costs for the Government and the future costs for a Conservative Government. We have pledged to reduce taxes when we come to power in a year or two years' time; we must do a better job. If the organisation can be so profligate and wasteful of assets that it can buy up massive city blocks in order to perform a simple regulatory function, we should ask ourselves, if two regulators can currently manage in two separate London offices, why we should not transfer one of the offices in London back into the Treasury. That would do the Minister's career no end of good. The new regulator could be told to go to the smaller office block. The Committee should not allow such profligate behaviour.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am disappointed that the Minister has not responded to the serious points raised by my hon. Friend. The Committee would especially benefit from the information requested in relation to the numbers of staff employed by Offer and Ofgas as of today, and a list of the buildings used by the two organisations. I would normally table a written question on the matter, but as the Table Office does not accept questions that relate to a Bill after Second Reading, will the Minister confirm that he will write to Committee members, especially my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset and me, to list the number of staff in each of the institutions and the buildings used? To save me having to raise the matter when we discuss the next clause, would he also make such a list available in relation to Oftel?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I will certainly undertake to do that. It is an important matter. The hon. Member for South Dorset raised valid issues, and I shall give some details to the Committee now.

<P>
Ofgem announced on 18 February that it had signed an agreement to lease 11 Millbank from ICI. Ofgem believes that efficiency savings will result from bringing all headquarters staff into a single building. The space occupied will be 15 per cent. less—80,900 sq ft, compared with 94,000 sq ft in the existing building. Taking into account rent, service charges and revenue from subletting four floors that Ofgem will not occupy, the total annual cost will be £2.9 million—much less than the billions of pounds mentioned by the hon. Member for South Dorset. Refurbishment costs will be £450,000, compared with the £4.2 million that would have been necessary if Ofgem had stayed in its current building. That represents a good saving.

<P>
On 31 December 1998, Offer had 252 staff in Birmingham and regional offices and Ofgas had 150. Few staff transferred to London from Birmingham, but vacancies are now being filled following a recruitment drive. The working figure that Ofgem can use for its expectation of staff numbers after its regional offices have gone to the proposed new Gas and Electricity Consumer Council is 400.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for providing a certain amount of information. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for intervening on my behalf because I do not think that the Minister would have given us the information unless we had prised it out of him. However, the figures do not add up. We have been told in a press release from Ofgem that it will put 450 people into its London offices. We know that many of the staff included in the figures—252 and 150—currently work at the regional offices and that they will go to the consumer councils. We have a little information, but I hope that the Minister will go further and start to decide what will happen.

<P>
A Birmingham office has been mentioned, but the press release mentions a Glasgow office, a Leicester office for the technical section and two London offices. We want the Minister to tell us precisely what is the current position and what are the plans. If the total number of people will be 402, including those who will be transferred to the consumer councils, why will keeping the Glasgow office, the four regional offices and the Leicester office require 450 people in a single regulator, when two regulators have managed with fewer people in the past? The Minister must get to grips with his civil servants because an empire is being built under his feet and he will be responsible for what is being created. I hope that he will flesh out some of the figures so that the Committee can make progress.

<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): The hon. Member for South Dorset has done the Committee a service this morning by asking several important questions, to which, with due respect to the Minister, we have not had clear answers. What is the rationale behind Ofgem needing an office building at Millbank, which must be one of the most expensive parts of the country? Ofgem's functions will not require it to be situated close to the Houses of Parliament, or even in London. London is not the centre of the country. Birmingham or Manchester would be a better geographical location than London. We have been told that a call centre can be built anywhere in the country or, indeed, the world, so why will it be located in one of the most expensive parts of London? Frankly, it seems as though someone wants an attractive address for his or her headed notepaper.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister is still sitting in his place, saying nothing, which is not good enough. I do not know whether other colleagues have been in my position. The Ministry of Defence has been shrinking its facilities around the country. A large facility in my constituency used to be an office block for the sea systems controllerate. I think that we could fit all 450 staff within that office block. If the Minister thinks that spending £2.9 million a year on an office block for 450 people represents a good deal and is the right thing to do, especially after supposedly spending £450,000 on refurbishment, I assure him that I can offer him a much better deal. However many times he says that the directors general designate will eventually have repeatedly renewable five-year contracts, he is still in charge of the Bill. The Committee is not minded to accept these provisions and to allow his career to be
completely ruined when he gets the blame for them. That is not good sense.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I know that the Electricity Association's offices are just a few buildings beyond, at Millbank tower. Perhaps one of those floors in Millbank could be made available to the Minister. I suspect that the Labour party is not paying £2.9 million for the office space for its Millbank tower headquarters.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest. There is considerable empty office space in my constituency and I would be happy to help the Minister by finding him empty office space at a considerably cheaper rate than £2.9 million if he would like me to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. The Minister has yet to have any piece of paper passed to him. He is sitting, naked, on the Front Bench. As hon. Members are in the Committee on a Tuesday, on a one-line Whip, when they would probably prefer to be in their constituencies, this would be a great opportunity for each of them to tell us what office space is available in their constituencies, and whether they have large numbers of unemployed constituents who would like to take up the vacancies that we have been told are now available [Hon. Members: ``No''] I hope that it will be recorded in Hansard that a sea of Labour Members say that there are no unemployed people in their constitutencies who would like those jobs. That is wonderful news for the Government and good news for their constitutencies. I hope that it will make the headlines in their local newspapers.

<P>
I notice that the Minister is still seated, so I shall sit down and hope that he will respond. However, other Committee members might want to take up the issue, because if anyone can offer him office space, that can accommodate 450 people—it propably needs to have room to expand to 1,000 because we all know how empires are created—at a rate of anything below £2.9 million per annum, he is very likely to be interested.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am very concerned about the figures quoted by the Minister. It seems odd that Ofgem expects to employ 400 people, yet the press release that my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset has in front of him says that it is moving into an office that will accommodate 450 people and still keeping its offices in Leicester and Glasgow. That demonstrates how those authorities will expand and will employ more and more staff, at higher and higher costs. In due course, I shall table an amendment that would cap the number of employees of Ofgem at 400, but even with the numbers capped, there will be some escalation in cost because of salary rises. If the figure were to rise above 400, it would lead to a serious escalation in costs that the consumer would have to bear. Will the Minister also confirm that he will send a list of Offer and Ofgas buildings to hon. Members?

Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 86 </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Transfer to Authority and Council of functions, property etc</B><P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The clause provides for the transfer of the functions of the Director General of Telecommunications to either the new Telecommunications Authority or the Telecommunications Consumer Council. Broadly speaking, functions associated with the regulation of the market will transfer to the Telecommunications Authority, and functions associated with information about consumer matters and about the handling of complaints will pass to the Telecommunications Consumer Council.

<P>
When the Bill has received Royal Assent, the transfer of property, rights and liabilities of the directors will need to take place as appropriate to reflect the transfer of functions. For example, databases containing information about consumer complaints should pass from the regulators to the new consumer council. The Secretary of State has the power to make transfer schemes for that purpose.

<P>
The clause brings into effect schedule 3 as it applies to the Telecommunications Authority and the Telecommunications Consumer Council. The Schedule contains further provision for the transfer of functions, property, rights and liabilities, including continuity of employment for transferred employees. The schedule also deals with water and we will consider it when we examine the regulation of water services.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee unduly. Most of the relevant points were made in the the discussion on clause 3. Could the Minister confirm that the earliest date for the transfer schemes for the telecommunications industry is likely to be 1 April 2001, as for the energy sector? Could he also say how many people Oftel employs and how many the new Telecommunications Authority is likely to employ? Will he give the Committee a list of the buildings currently owned or rented by Oftel?

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> We would not normally have discussed the earlier clause at any length and I do not want to delay the Committee's work on such important matters.

<P>
I emphasise what my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said about the buildings. Oftel recently moved out of its office building into temporary accommodation—to allow for refurbishment— and has now moved back into a bigger and better headquarters. I never thought that Oftel had offices out of proportion to what it does, but I do not have detailed knowledge of how many people are involved and how many buildings they occupy.

<P>
I hope that transferring the director general's functions to a more collegiate structure involving three, four or five people will not make a great difference. The consumer council is, in many ways performing a new function, and we want to know what its expectations are as regards office buildings and whether Oftel will transfer anything to it. I hope that the Minister can give us a better answer and again confirm that he will write to us with full details, if those have not been provided by his officials this morning. It is important that we are given chapter and verse on what is happening and that the Minister stamps on empire building.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I pledge to the hon. Gentleman that empire building will be stamped on. Given the revolution in communications technology, there is no excuse for empire building. The new bodies will answer to the House, and I hope that Select Committee procedures and every other means of audit will be used to ensure that there is no empire building.

<P>
As I said, the main transfer will be that of consumer complaints databases, which will go to the council from the existing telecoms regulator. There will not be a large increase in the number of people employed by the telecoms regulator, but as the hon. Member for South Dorset helpfully said last week, an extensive review of communications regulations is under way. However, clause 86 makes clear which functions will be transferred.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am sorry that the Minister was not as helpful on the previous clause as he could have been. Apparently he gave us the only information that he had. He started to tell us about the square footage and the number of staff currently employed. That information should be in Hansard. I have notice that several pieces of paper have made their way to the Minister, and I hope that he will now add to the information that he gave the Committee.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As ever, the hon. Genleman is extremely observant, although the Room is not big.

<P>
Obviously, the present position is the starting point from thich to estimate the number of staff. About 25 staff currently handle complaints and provide advice to consumers from the Oftel call centre. Ten additional staff work for the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish advisory committees, which makes 35 staff in total. That must be the benchmark. We intend the new council to be a more effective voice for consumers and to undertake a wider range of functions. The best estimate, in advance of detailed work on resourcing and work programmes, is that a staff of 50 will be required.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister confirm that those staff numbers related only to the consumer aspect of Oftel's work? If so, could he tell us the number of staff employed in Oftel's regulatory work in addition to the staff dealing with consumer complaints?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I apologise to the Committee for not have the complete figures on Oftel. I will ensure that all Committee members receive them.

No. 221, in clause 87, page 92, line 41, leave out `other than those comprising' and inset `and'.

<P>
No. 222, in clause 87, page 93, line 2, leave out the `the project' and insert `any such projects'.

<P>
No. 223, in clause 87, page 93, line 3, leave out `overall'.

<P>
No. 224, in clause 87, page 93, line 4, leave out from `year' to end of line 5 and insert `including an estimate of the costs of each project it plans to undertake.'

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Government and Opposition amendments are similar, except in one detailed and important respect. Both sets of amendments alter clause 4 and clause 87 to ensure that the estimate of the cost of forward work programmes includes the cost not only of special projects to be undertaken during the year, but of routine work. Those clauses as drafted require only the special projects to be costed.

<P>
It is clear that the Government share our anxiety about the escalating costs incurred by the authorities and councils, because they have tabled similar amendments. Those costs come not only from the plethora of new projets but are part of a gradual incremental increase in the routine investigation work carried out by the two bodies, evidence of which was discussed during earlier debate on the building of staff numbers.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government have pointed out in a number of documents, including the regulatory impact assessment, that those costs will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. It is therefore vital that every possible step is taken to minimise the cost and any increase in it. A requirement for the regulatory authorities and consumer council to publish an estimate of expendisture on their forward work programmes will provide a small but potentially effective brake on large increases. Unfortunately, however, that requirement will not completely provent expansion, so our overall concern about escalating costs remains, although at least the amendments would go some way towards dealing with the problem.

<P>
The Opposition amendments are different from those of the Government because they would require a further breakdown of the estimates. They would require estimates to be made of the cost of each specific project to be carried out rather than just of the overall cost of the authority and/or council. Such provision would enable scrutiny of whether individual projects are achieving value for money for the authority or council and would allow clear assessment of whether costs are proportionate to the specific objectives of particular projects. it would therefore prevent non-cost-effective projects from being lost in the aggregate of overall figures.

<P>
Clauses 4 and 87 require an estimate to be made of the costs of special projects taken as a whole, but they do not split that estimate to cover each project. The Government amendments rectify that problem merely by requiring an estimate of total cost, but they remove any requirement for a separate estimate of the projects as a whole and so take the Bill one stage away from where it was before. The Opposition amendments are far more comprehensive and are likely to concentrate the minds of authority and council members on the efficacy of each of their numerous activities. Such a requirement is far better than that inserted into the Bill by the Government amendments. I hope that the Minister will take on board our amendments and include them within his own proposals, which we support.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall resist the amendments, which would increase both the scope and the required level of detail of the forward work programmes. First, they would require the programmes to contain a description of the routine activities of regulatory authories and consumer councils. That information is intended to supplement that which is already required by clause 4 in relation to non-routine projects. Secondly the amendments would add a requirement to provide an estimate of the costs of each project that the bodies plan to undertake.

<P>
In respect of the requirement for the forward work programmes to contain a description of routine activities, I have a degree of sympathy with what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is trying to achieve. After all, Ofgem's recently published plan and budget for 2000–01 refers to a particular amount of routine activity. I confirm that we consider the Ofgem plan and budget to be a good example of the sort of forward work programme that we expect to be produced under the clause 4 obligation.

<P>
Let us consider that routine activity is included in that document. Ofgem has chosen to set up its work programme in terms of themes and priorities, which is a good method. For example, the document deals with themes of social and environmental action, competition in wholesale markets and so on. Ofgem has included in the document only those aspects of its routine activities that fit in with and contribute to those themes. For exmaple, in relation to the theme of social and environmental action, it refers to the dedication of significant resources to the investigation of customer complaints that will flow from increased competition in the gas and electricity markets.

<P>
It is easy to see why Ofgem has decided to include information about routine activities at that point. It will add colour and context, and will help explain how Ofgem plans to pursue its broader objectives through its day-to-day activities. We welcome the inclusion of such information and we intend nothing that would prohibit its inclusion in the forward work programmes produced to comply with clause 4.

<P>
That is a different matter from requiring that forward work programmes should contain a description of all routine activities planned for the year ahead, which is what the amendments would require. Such an obligation would result in forward work programmes being choked with extraneous material relating to routine activities, and it would add nothing of real value.

<P>
Ofgem has expressed concern that a requirement to estimate the future costs of its work as a series of discrete projects would be unduly onerous and unworkable. It says that it would constitute a significant impediment to effective regulation, and that it would tend to reduce its flexibility in managing its finances.

<P>
We listened to those arguments, and I tabled Government amendments Nos. 3 and 7 as a result. We want to encourage financial transparency on the part of the regulatory authorities and consumers councils. However, the Opposition amendments would require that the breakdown of estimated should be done in such detail as to impose an unacceptable administrative burden on those bodies. If a project is of such a size that it becomes feasible to provide an estimate of costs, the information is likely to be provided. For example, Ofgem's plan and budget contains financial information about the costs of new electricity trading arrangements. It would be wrong to require a detailed breakdown of costs for much smaller projects or initiatives, many of which are often bound up with other activities. The burden of doing that would outweigh the potential benefit. For those reasons, we shall resist the Opposition amendments.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 3 and 7 deal with the amount of financial information that should be included in forward work programmes. Clauses 4 and 87 require the regulatory authorities and consumer councils to provide an estimate of the overall expenditure that such bodies will incur in carrying out the non-routine projects that they plan to undertake. That will require those bodies to estimate the costs of their non-routine projects independently of their routine activities.

<P>
As I said, Ofgem has said that requiring it to estimate the future costs of its work as a series of discrete projects would be onerous and unworkable. When speaking about amendment No. 215, moved by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I mentioned that we are sympathetic of Ofgem's concerns. Clauses 4 and 87 will require the costs of non-routine projects to be estimated independently of routine activities, but we do not wish to make that task unduly difficult.

<P>
Ofgem's plan and budget for next year sets out the overall expenditure forecasts for that office. We consider that that information, which covers routine and non-routine activities, is all that is necessary to encourage financial transparency. Government amendments Nos. 3 and 7 will result in the publication of exactly that sort of information. We believe that our
{**JU**}
amendments to clauses 3 and 87 will be welcomed by regulators and consumers alike. They will achieve the goal of increased financial accountability on the part of regulators without overburdening them or tying their hands.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am sure that we are all grateful to the Minister for seeking greater transparency through the amendments. However, I wonder whether regulators ought to be allowed to investigate matters in secret. For instance, if the regulator thought that something untoward was going on, but did not want to make the sort of comments and rebukes that the Chancellor made the other day—comments that caused problems for industry, and cut share prices—secrecy might sometimes be necessary. I know that that issue does not directly relate to the amendments, but perhaps the Minister will think about it, because from time to time regulators need to investigate. It is better for matters to be kept confidential until the regulator is ready to explain what has happened.

<P>
Another, frequently-raised issue concerning telecommunications that I want to deal with under this clause—and clause 86, to which the amendments are also relevant—is the internet. It is one of the few matters that people want regulated. Will the forward look programme in Oftel and the regulations under the Utilities Bill make it possible to investigate whether there should be regulation, and whether to that end funding should go to the Internet Watch Foundation or another independent organisation? We often seem to regulate for the sake of regulating when there is no demand. Yet there is a demand to deal with people's concerns about what might be happening on the internet.

<P>
I am a free marketeer and I do not have a fixed view of the right approach. I am not keen, either, on a lot of additional levying or taxation. However, currently an independent body called the Internet Watch Foundation tries to levy money from internet companies so that a body exists to whom consumers can make such complaints as ``When my kid looks for Teletubbies on the internet pictures of naked women come up.'' If the internet is to continue and thrive mechanisms will be needed in the regulations to deal with that. Is that already covered further on in the Bill—in which case I am out of order—or will the telecommunications body's future programme be able to study the issues and develop policies? Does the Bill already contain powers for the Secretary of State or the regulator to take the view that it is in the general interest, by consent, to set up more formal regulation of material on the internet, to catch those rogues who ignore everyone and think that no one can stop them doing what is good business? Might that be part of the regulation in the forward look programme and the Utilities Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am concerned about the Minister's initial response to the amendments. The organisations concerned are not insubstantial. They will be spending a large sum of public money every year—£10 million to £50 million, depending which figures one believes. To say that it would be unduly onerous to estimate the cost of specific projects over the year is unacceptable. In the private sector an estimate is made of the cost of any project, to work out whether it would be profitable. It is a bother, but it is a fact of life. As a chartered accountant of 13 years standing before entering the House of Commons, I am astonished to hear the Minister say that Ofgem reacted to the amendments in that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Some of the practices to which the hon. Gentleman refers prevent several companies in this country from innovating. It is precisely that bureaucratic accounting mentality that stops innovation and damages entrepreneurship throughout the country.
11 am

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Absolutely not. Those practices prevent companies from going bankrupt. What stops innovation in this country is unduly burdensome regulations and bureaucracy. That problem will be exacerbated by the Bill, which will impose huge regulatory interventionist burdens and increase costs. We have tabled amendments to keep such bureaucratic organisations under control, but our amendments are always resisted by the Government. We hear dreadful figures about increasing numbers of staff and about property deals and we are told that it would be unduly burdensome to estimate costs.

<P>
The more I listen to our debates in Committee—we are now on our fifth sitting—the more concerned I become, because all the evidence increasingly confirms the real anxieties that the Opposition have expressed. I am flabbergasted by Ofgem's response, so we will have to monitor the Bill ever more closely and, in particular, alert the National Audit Office to our concerns. We cannot allow state-run organisations to say that they find it burdensome or unduly onerous to estimate their costs for the specific tasks that they will undertake in the coming year. It is totally unacceptable for any public body to brief Ministers in that way. I am, frankly, outraged, by the Minister's response and I hope that he will reflect further on the Opposition's view and take them back to Ofgem. It cannot be acceptable for it to conduct its affairs in that way. Any director of a private company who responded in the same way would be sacked immediately—and the Minister should respond to those authorities in the same way. Tabling Government amendments to deal with these concerns is also unacceptable.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member wish to put the amendment to a vote?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am waiting to hear the Government's response. I hope that the Minister will rise.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister remains seated. Does the hon. Member wish to put the amendment to a vote?

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The issues are so serious that I wish to return to them on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 2, line 43, after `shall', insert—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`consult with bodies they consider appropriate and'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 104, in page 3, line 4, at end insert—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and give reasons for their decision for accepting or rejecting these representations or objections'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Amendment No. 103 would require the specified bodies to consult regarding their forward work programmes and memorandum of understanding. The Liberal Democrats welcome the idea of a forward work programme: it is a useful innovation, which is good for accountability and also helps avoid duplication. The amendment builds on that useful innovation by requiring consultation in advance in order to ensure the best possible forward work programme. The fount of all knowledge is not embodied in one or two persons, but is more widely available. The work programmes should make use of all relevant expertise and information.

<P>
Transparency is the key to amendment No. 104. Clause 4 states that the authority and the council.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall consider any representations or objections which are duly made and not withdrawn.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
That is entirely right. However, we need a clear understanding of why the authority and the council may not give credence to or act on certain suggestions or representations. Without that, in the wrong hands, the clause may become worthless. The Government's intention is clear, but is not given due force in the Bill. A good parallel is Select Committee representations to Government, to which Government are required to publish their response. Members of Parliament and, indeed, people outside, can then judge whether the Government's reponse is fair.

<P>
The amendment would make provision for similar arrangements in relation to the council and the authority. If they reject representations, they should be required to say why so that everyone is well informed and assured that proper consideration has been afforded to those representations. I trust that the Government see the sense of that. They intend to improve transparency—a concept that we support—so I am confident that they will accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with the motives of the hon. Member for Lews (Mr. Baker). However, the clause already provides for open and transparent consulting.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman paid tribute to the Government for seeking to put in place an open regulatory process encouraging greater public participation. That process will result in regulatory decisions being better informed, thereby increasing public confidence in those decisions. However, the balance of benefit and cost must be right and the emphasis properly targeted, as amendment No. 104 acknowledges.

<P>
The Government's proposals on forward work programmes achieve those aims. They require the regulator and the council to consult on draft forward work programmes and to consider any comments before publishing final versions, thus realising the twin goals of opening up proceedings and making regulators more accountable for their actions.

<P>
The amendments would upset that balance, as they would burden consultation on forward work programmes without clear added benefit. Amendment No. 103 would result in a duplicate consultation process, with the authority or the council consulting appropriate bodies before putting the draft programme out for public comment. A second tier of consultation would be time-consuming for the regulator and have little or no value added.

<P>
Amendment No. 104 would require the authority and the council to explain individual decisions to accept or reject comments received during consultation on the draft forward work programme. The Government have been accused of being over-prescriptive. However, on this occasion, the hon. Gentleman is going further than necessary, as his amendment would tie up resources which might be better employed elsewhere. Accordingly, we shall resist his amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Having listened carefully to the Minister, I accept his points. I shall not press the amendment to a vote. However, amendment No. 104—which means more to me than amendment No. 103—would not require a detailed response to individual representations. The parallel of Select Committee representations would apply, in which the Government are required to give a general response to main points only. I hope that the Minister will consider the suggestion that decisions should be explained and judge whether it can be worked into the Bill. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 4 and 8 are technical amendments that seek to confirm that clause 4(5) and clause 87(5) refer only to those notices containing a draft work programme and timetable for representations given by the consumer council and not to any similar notices given by the authority.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Opposition amendments all aim to involve the Trade and Industry Select Committee more in the work of the authority and the consumer council, in particular by scrutinising their published documents. Amendments Nos. 121 and 122 would ensure that the notices issued by the authority and the consumer council were sent to the Select Committee to make it aware that those two bodies were consulting on their forward work programmes and to prompt it to take evidence on what it felt that they should be doing in future.

<P>
Amendment No. 125 would ensure that the annual report of the regulatory authorities was also sent to the Trade and Industry Select Committee, which would again prompt it to consider whether it wished to take evidence on the report or to scrutinise the work of the authority more thoroughly. Amendments Nos. 126, 127 and 132 would make the same provisions for the telecom sector.

<P>
We have already stressed the importance of adequate parliamentary scrutiny of the work of the regulatory authorities and consumer councils. The argument is best summarised by the Government in paragraph 7.43 of the Green Paper, which says:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A Select Committee would provide a formal, high-profile platform for the regulators to explain their decisions to Parliament and to the public, and would thereby improve the accountability of the regulators and assist public understanding of what the regulators are doing.''
The advantage of having the work of the regulatory authorities examined by the Select Committee is that it can take a serious and thorough look at the objectives of regulations to see how far they have been met and to decide whether, in the light of the level of competition and other matters, the regulator should withdraw from certain sectors. Those are the details of policy, which Ministers, with their busy schedules and workloads, often may not have the time to monitor.

<P>
One of the great advantages of Select Committees is that they produce thorough, well-informed reports that can provide a valuable service to the House in developing Government policy. It is a rare regulator who will call for his or her powers to be reduced, although both David Edmonds and Ian Byatt seem to understand that the time to withdraw from regulation is when competition is fully working. One of Parliament's prime roles is to ensure that public money is wisely spent. Although the costs of the authority and the consumer council are met by the licence holder, given the compulsory nature of those licence conditions, it is, in effect, a form of taxation. The spending by the authority and the consumer council is really public spending which is voted on by the House.

<P>
I believe that scrutiny is best achieved by the Select Committee and the amendments would help to ensure that. I know that the Government and the Secretary of State have been particularly badly damaged by such scrutiny, particularly over the presentation of policy. The Secretary of State was reprimanded by the Trade and Industry Select Committee over his attempts to manipulate news announcements and restate policy. None the less, the Government should accept the amendments to ensure a high level of parliamentary scrutiny of the regulators long after a particular Minister has moved on to another post. In view of the fact that the Green Paper called for those bodies to be scrutinised by a Select Committee, I hope that the Minister will accept our amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister was caught out by the Committee's procedure, but he did not respond to some points that were made earlier. We are now discussing a different group of amendments. Would he like to say something about the notices given to the Secretary of State and comment on whether any items should be kept secret? Are there any proposals in the Bill for secrecy? Does the Minister think that it would be an appropriate route to undertake a forward programme in some form of secrecy? In relation to telecommunications, what does he think should be included in the notices for the Internet Watch Foundation and so on?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I an unable to accept the Opposition's amendments. The points made by the hon. Member for South Dorset are more relevant to this group of amendments.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 121, 122, 126 and 127 would impose a requirement for the authorities' and councils' draft forward work programmes to be copied to the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. They would also ensure that notices relating to the authority's draft forward work programme were sent to the council and to the Secretary of State.

<P>
We believe that those requirements are superfluous. The regulatory authority, the council and the Secretary of State—whose departmental vote covers the council's expenses—can be called to account before parliamentary Committees. It is not only the Trade and Industry Committee which has an interest in utilities regulation. The Environmental Audit Committee, the Social Security Committee and the Public Accounts Committee, among others, have a legitimate interest. On the point that the hon. Member for South Dorset properly made, the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport might also have something to say about the prospect of censorship-stroke-regulation of internet communications and communications via digital technologies and so on. The hon. Gentleman's comment was valid. I do think that any subject that is in the public interest should be precluded from scrutiny by the regulator or the council. I am sure that they will address such issues. It is hard to imagine it being any other way.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of secrecy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Before the Minister leaves the issue of what can be regulated, may I say that I am especially concerned about cases that have come to my notice of ICSTIS—the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services—deciding that something coming over the telephone was improper and trying to get a telephone operator to cease using telephone lines for such purposes, and being told that company could not cut off the consumer because the consumer effectively had a right under the access to communications agreement, which enables access to BT lines via another company. That cut across what ICSTIS was attempting to do. Can the Minister comment on that? Content regulation is sometimes required to cross over into technical regulation and the two contradict each other.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the review that he told the Committee about last week. Clearly there are many grey areas and crossover area in terms of responsibilities. The hon. Gentleman raised the ICSTIS issue. It has the most difficult-to-pronounce acronym of any body that I know, but it does have a valuable function. Currently, one of the most prevalent scams is exhorting people to ring a particular number, behind which loot is being made for all sorts of gangsters and shysters. The division of responsibility must be clear. When the regulator examines difficult crossover areas, there must be a presumption of responsibility so that existing laws can be enforced. The hon. Gentleman probably knows better than anyone in the Committee that the internet is anarchic and difficult to regulate. We could discuss until the end of the next century whether the internet should be regulated.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> Will my hon. Friend be careful when listening to comments about the internet from the hon. Member for South Dorset, who did not give the whole story of what it can do? I urge my hon. Friend to treat the hon. Gentleman's words with caution.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I was brought up in a village called Pen-y-Wann in a south Wales mining valley and I received in my mother's milk the instinct to treat with caution everything that Tories say. I take my hon. Friend's point.

<P>
The council is required to copy its forward work programme to the authority and to the Secretary of State, whose departmental vote covers the council's expenses. Liekwise, under clause 16(5) the authority is required to send a copy of its notice on the forward work programme, including the programme itself, to the council. It would not be desirable to impose a requirement on the authority to copy its draft forward work programme to the Secretary of State. The authority needs to be, and to be seen to be, independent of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State should not be seen to have undue influence over the future work priorities of the authority in relation to economic regulation.

<P>
The Government believe that the arrangements in the Bill ensure fully adequate public and parliamentary scrutiny of forward work programmes. There is no compelling reason to increase the bureaucratic burden by including a special requirement to copy the forward work programme to the Trade and Industry Committee.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 125 and 132 would impose a requirement on the authority to send a copy of its annual report to the Secretary of State, as well as to the council. Clause 5 requires the Secretary of State to lay the authority's report before Parliament. The report will be freely available to all interested parties in Parliament, including the Trade and Industry Committee and other interested groups such as the Committees to which I referred a moment ago. There is no compelling reason to single out the Trade and Industry Committee for special treatment and I urge the Committee to resist the Opposition's amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> There is compelling reason, if the Government are serious about wanting full  parliamentary scrutiny, because Committees need to be prompted. The Minister said that many Committees would be interested in discussing and scrutinising such issues, including the Culture, Media and Sport Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. Clause 5 specifically provides for the serving of notices and the publishing of documents, but that is no reason to exclude from the Bill references to the documents being sent to the Trade and Industry Committee, which is the Committee most likely to want to scrutinise the authority and the council. With the volume of paper available from the Vote Office, it would be helpful if notices were automatically sent to the Trade and Industry Committee to act as a prompt to scrutinise forward work programmes and annual reports.

<P>
The Government's determination to resist the amendments shows that they are not keen for the authority and consumer councils to be scrutinised in detail by the Trade and Industry Committee. The amendments would send a firm signal in the Bill to that Committee and to outside bodies that the Government wanted the authority to be scrutinised by the Trade and Industry Committee. The Government's resistance reveals their reluctance that such matters should be scrutinised.

<P>
I was hoping for a further response from the Minister, but as he is not rising to respond and in view of our full debate on the subject and the Opposition's keenness to make progress, I shall not press the amendments.

<P>
It being twenty-five past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
