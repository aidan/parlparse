Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): May I start by
welcoming you back to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I also
welcome the new Exchequer Secretary because this is the first
opportunity I have had to do so. It seems like only
yesterday&#151;perhaps it was yesterday&#151;that we welcomed her
predecessor. In fact, it was only last Tuesday that I welcomed the hon.
Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) to the role, while we were debating
the MEPs&#146; pay clause. She got the chop after just nine days,
making her the Lady Jane Grey of the Treasury. However, I wish the new
Exchequer Secretary well. The Treasury desperately needs some stability
at this time of record deficits, rapidly increasing unemployment, open
warfare with the Bank of England and unhelpful directives from the
EU.</div><a name="09062546000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062546000240"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): Is it not salutary to
reflect that Government borrowing went up by more than &#163;3
billion during the tenure of the previous Exchequer
Secretary?</div><a name="09062546000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000241"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I hope that we can conduct this sitting
in a more ordered fashion. We are discussing clause 112. We have had
our fun
now.</div><a name="09062546000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000242"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> It is worth saying that since the publication of
the Finance Bill, five Ministers have had responsibility for North sea
oil, whether on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. The Exchequer
Secretary appears to be well-trained as she approaches her
portfolio.</div><a name="09062546000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000243"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have made it clear that we have gone
far enough. The hon. Gentleman is taking liberties with my
patience.</div><a name="09062546000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000244"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. Clause 112
represents the other side to the Government&#146;s measures on bingo,
although it will also have some effect on games such as poker. That
impact will become clearer when we discuss clause 113. Hon. Members
will remember the debate in the Committee of the whole House on
13 May on clause 20, which will raise bingo duty on gross
profits from 15 to 22 per cent. Clause 112 will remove the VAT on
participation fees, which are the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 608</div>up-front charges that players pay to enter the game. The Government
argue that by introducing those two measures simultaneously, they will
reduce the bingo industry&#146;s effective rate of
taxation.</div><a name="09062546000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have trumpeted the generosity of these provisions, but as I
explained to the Committee of the whole House, in practice, they are
nothing of the kind. Bingo operators have argued for years that the VAT
on participation fees was unfair and impermissible under EU law.
Following a VAT tribunal hearing last year, which was discussed in some
detail under clause 20, most bingo operators have withheld
their VAT payments, especially on interval bingo. Operators such as Top
Ten Bingo have withdrawn or withheld VAT
altogether.</div><a name="09062546000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Committee of the whole House, the then Exchequer Secretary, the
hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle)&#151;just to be quite clear,
that is going back two Exchequer Secretaries&#151;was forced to admit
that the figures in the Red Book were based on the Government&#146;s
interpretation of the law and what they thought should be paid, rather
than on actual receipts. In practice, every operator believes that they
will pay more tax as a net result of the changes in clauses 20 and 112.
However, she stuck terrier-like to the theory and shunned what was
happening with VAT in practice. She
explained:</div><a name="09062546000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
industry can have any opinion that it likes about the taxation system
that applies to it. I am not responsible for the opinions of the bingo
industry; it can welcome the measures or not. What I am talking about
is the effective tax rate.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 13
May 2009; Vol. 492, c.
978.]</div><a name="09062546000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
best of possible intentions, I advise her second successor to take a
more conciliatory line. The Treasury figures would have only begun to
make sense if the Government had won the ongoing appeal in the High
Court. We took the view that the Government were seeking to pre-empt
the Court&#146;s decision and tabled&#151;and voted on&#151;an
amendment seeking to delay the changes until the legal position became
clearer.</div>
<a name="09062546000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only a few
weeks later that argument already seems vindicated. Since we debated
clause 20, the High Court has ruled against HMRC. The Government have
lost their case. In the Court&#146;s view, the VAT that clause 112
proposes to lift from interval bingo should never have been applied in
the first place. That is the crux of the matter. Furthermore, the
ruling has also been interpreted as giving strong support to the view
that VAT on any form on bingo is impermissible under EU fiscal
neutrality rules.</div>
<a name="09062546000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
interested to read <i class="I">The Times</i>&#146; City Diary on 9
June, which
commented:</div><a name="09062546000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;With
further claims amounting to &#163;50 million in the pipeline from
Rank and as much as &#163;500 million from the wider gaming industry,
it is not hard to work out why HMRC launched a cynical pre-emptive
strike on duty in the
Budget.&#148;</div><a name="09062546000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have proven themselves to be the enemy of the bingo sector
and of hundreds of thousands of bingo players up and down the
country.</div><a name="09062546000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062546000245"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): Does my hon.
Friend agree that this is a growing tax that is hated up and down the
land? I have heard many people, many of them elderly ladies who derive
great pleasure from this hobby, who feel really hard done
by.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column609" />Column number: 609</div><a name="09062546000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000246"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I
will shortly discuss the demographics of bingo. He makes a very strong
point. I was intrigued to see the ongoing campaign on the issue. The
campaign organisation has produced a bingo board with the faces of all
of the relevant Government Ministers. It blots out the faces of all the
Ministers who have left since the Finance Bill was published. There are
a number of full houses and lines due to the incredible comings and
goings we have seen across the Government since the Budget on
22 April.</div>
<a name="09062546000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
extremely helpful, for the purposes of the debate, if the Minister
could indicate whether HMRC will be appealing the High Court&#146;s
decision. It has only a few days left in which to do so. It would be
helpful for contributors to the debate to know whether the ruling will
actually be appealed. Would she like to intervene at this
point?</div><a name="09062546000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000247"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b>
I am more than happy to intervene. There are some important legal
points to consider, and the decision to appeal has not yet been made. I
recognise that time is of the essence, and a decision will obviously be
made before the
date.</div><a name="09062546000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000248"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister for that intervention. We
would all hope that a decision would be made in the required time. It
expires in the next few days. If I remember correctly, the High Court
ruled more than two weeks, or maybe even three weeks ago. There are
only a handful of days
left.</div><a name="09062546000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000249"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We have until 30
June.</div><a name="09062546000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000250"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister for that intervention. The
clock is ticking. Today is the 27th. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;25th.&#148;] It is the 25th, I
apologise. There is less than half a business week, which is a terribly
long time in the world of the Treasury. Who knows what might happen in
those few days? I digress. I found that answer very
interesting.</div>
<a name="09062546000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09062546000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062546000251"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): Given what has just
been said, is it unfortunate that we are discussing this clause now?
Unless my hon. Friend is intending to speak until after 30 June, would
it not be better&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter</i><i class="I">.</i><i class="I">]</i> I
cannot give way. My point is that it is unfortunate that this is being
discussed
now.</div><a name="09062546000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000252"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> It would be beyond the scope of my contribution to
debate the timetable. Today is scheduled as the last day. I suspect
that bingo may come back at a later stage in the consideration of the
Bill. I hope that we will have a chance to consider the implications of
the Government&#146;s decision, assuming that they do make
one.</div>
<a name="09062546000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
debate on clause 20, I questioned the Government&#146;s figures on
the cost of removing VAT from participation fees, which is what we have
in front of us today&#151;in other words, the theoretical rather than
the actual cost of the clause. We need to look at both, bearing in mind
what has been happening in the industry in relation to paying VAT. We
need to look at the cost at the moment, assuming that VAT was being
paid in all areas. Since the debate on clause 20, we have more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 610</div>information, via answers to written questions, on how the Treasury
arrived at its figure of &#163;50 million. On 18 May, the
Financial Secretary, who is with us this morning, replied that the cost
of removing VAT on mainstage bingo, which is the standard form of the
game, was &#163;20 million. In one of the few acts during her
short-lived return to the Treasury, the Minister&#146;s immediate
predecessor, the hon. Member for Burnley, added on 10 June
that the cost of removing VAT on interval bingo, which is the newer
form that the High Court ruled on, was &#163;25 million. Both figures
account for the effect on duty revenue. That makes &#163;45 million
in total, compared with the figure of &#163;50 million in the Red
Book. I assume that the remaining &#163;5 million relates to
participation fees on so-called equal chance games other than bingo,
principally poker, which, as I mentioned at the beginning, is affected
by clause 112. Will the Minister confirm the figures? It has been
difficult for me and some of my hon. Friends, notably my hon. Friend
the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), to get to
the bottom of the figures. I would be grateful for clarification of
whether the &#163;50 million is the 25-plus-20-plus-5 that I just
outlined.</div>
<a name="09062546000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The estimates
for 2009-10 back up the argument I made during debate in the Committee
of the whole House, that the industry will in practice pay more as a
result of the Bill. We are not aware of any major operator paying VAT
on interval bingo at present. After the Court ruling, it is hard to
believe that any operators would contemplate doing so. A number of
operators are withholding VAT receipts on mainstage bingo,
feeling&#151;as may turn out to be correct&#151;that mainstage
bingo is equally affected by the ruling. That number would, I believe,
now swell. It is reasonable to conclude that actual receipts would have
been below &#163;20 million for the 2009-10 financial year before the
Court ruling and could now potentially be zero&#151;so not the
&#163;50 million that is outlined in the Red
Book.</div><a name="09062546000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
back to clause 20 for a moment, the Red Book shows that the increase in
bingo duty is expected to raise &#163;35 million. Far from reducing
the effective tax rate, as the Minister&#146;s predecessor insisted,
the Government&#146;s proposals constitute a tax hike of at least
&#163;15 million. I would be grateful for confirmation of that
figure.</div>
<a name="09062546000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
why the Financial Secretary said the following during the Budget
debate:</div><a name="09062546000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Overall,
the announcements in the Budget on the taxation of bingo are welcome to
the industry.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 April 2009;
Vol. 491, c.
434.]</div><a name="09062546000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I found
that extraordinary at the time and, in retrospect, it has become even
more so. Perhaps he can now understand why the industry reacted so
vociferously. An article in the <i class="I">The </i><i class="I">Sun </i>on 9 June was
headlined in typical fashion, &#147;Hands off our balls&#148;. That
headline was not referring to me, unlike the other headline
&#147;Hands catches Balls&#148; which related to terrorist finance
and yet another previous Treasury Minister. The headline in <i class="I">The
Sun</i> to which I referred was purely about bingo. The chief executive
of Rank said:</div>
<a name="09062546000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Bookmakers,
the football pools, provincial casinos all pay just 15 per
cent&#151;yet we are hit like this. What I find most staggering is
that bingo players are typically in Labour heartlands. Yet we have had
more support from Conservatives, the SNP and the Lib Dems than anyone
in Government.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column611" />Column number: 611</div><a name="09062546000196"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09062546000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Four
members of this Committee seem to agree with the chief executive and
have signed early-day motion 1569, which effectively calls on the
Government to rethink their position on raising bingo duty. When I
checked yesterday, some 67 Labour MPs had signed the motion. The
Government have even managed to unite all of the bingo operators. The
&#147;I&#146;m backing bingo campaign&#148; combines the Bingo
Association, Mecca, Gala, Castle, Buckingham, Club Grand, Carlton,
Opera and Cosmo, and all are opposed to the Government&#146;s plans.
Many hon. Members will already have received letters from constituents
who play bingo. As I understand it, there will even be a bingo rally in
Parliament square, which we can all look forward to.</div>
<a name="09062546000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bingo clubs
must be seen in their proper perspective. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Northampton, South said, bingo plays an important role in the lives
of the many and not the few. The Government&#146;s crass approach to
bingo in this year&#146;s Budget has upset bingo players up and down
the country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East pointed
out in the debate on Second Reading, some 8.5 million people in this
country play bingo each year. More than 200 Members of the House have a
bingo club in their constituency. Regrettably, I am no longer one of
them. Mecca Bingo on Vanston place in Fulham closed just a couple of
years ago due partly, I believe, to the pressures facing the industry,
about which I will be talking. The bingo clubs have a lot of members. I
met Rob Halfon, the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Harlow,
recently, and he told me that there were 42,000 members of the Harlow
bingo club. In a Westminster Hall debate in February, the hon. Member
for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) told the Chamber that there were
83,000 members of a club in his constituency.</div>
<a name="09062546000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to
return to Harlow for a moment, when my hon. Friend the Member for
Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) and Rob Halfon visited
the club, I am told that almost 200 players were hard at it in the
middle of the day. So, we are talking about incredibly popular
facilities. My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich
(Mr. Timpson) talked in that same debate about his Mecca
bingo hall in Crewe. He said that 33 employees deal with, on average,
2,500 visits each week, and the club has some 12,500
members.</div><a name="09062546000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09062546000045"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000253"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Does my hon. Friend also accept that there is a
very great social facet to this whole business? Many people go to the
bingo clubs and are treated to subsidised lunches, which is a great
boon because they do not have to cook for themselves. Have the
Government taken that into
account?</div><a name="09062546000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000254"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Regrettably, the Government have not taken that
into account. We can see that by their really appalling treatment of
the sector over the years, and, most notably, in the Finance Bill. My
hon. Friend is quite right to emphasise the clubs&#146; important
social role. The closure of bingo clubs has been shown to contribute to
social dislocation in communities, particularly for women and the
elderly.</div>
<a name="09062546000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
demographics of bingo are not always what one would expect. The age
profile of bingo players is becoming younger. I am told that the
mid-age for some clubs can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 612</div>be as low as 45, which, as the hon. Member for Taunton and I were saying
only the other week, is getting dangerously close to home. Some 75 per
cent. of players are women, and they are uniformly well behaved
citizens, enjoying some leisure time in a fairly harmless manner. I
know that it is gambling, and no one should underestimate the wider
impact of gambling in our society. None the less, we are discussing a
group of law-abiding, orderly citizens who have been playing the game
that they love in a socially interactive
way.</div><a name="09062546000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062546000255"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> Of course, bingo is gambling
and some people disapprove of all gambling, but most people would admit
that it is the most benign form. If the Government were to penalise any
form of gambling, one would have thought that it would be the type that
was addictive or most likely to be financially harmful to the
participants, rather than disproportionately punishing the most benign
form.</div><a name="09062546000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000256"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It seems to make
no sense to tax bingo at 22 per cent. and many other forms of gambling
at 15 per cent. He makes a fair point about the comparative nature of
forms of gambling and their addiction and social
impact.</div><a name="09062546000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000257"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend is being very generous in giving way.
I agree with his speech in general, but bingo does not prosper only in
Labour areas. There may be more Labour seats at the moment, but they
will be Conservative after the next general election. In my area, I
shall be visiting the Flutters club in the near future, because the
manager is worried about the very points that my hon. Friend is
making.</div><a name="09062546000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000258"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, and I
look forward to hearing a report from the club, and hearing at first
hand what some of the members are saying about the Government&#146;s
proposals in clauses 20 and
112.</div><a name="09062546000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000259"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am enjoying the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
setting of the scene, but given that we are discussing not clause 20,
but clause 112, will he say whether he supports its
removal?</div><a name="09062546000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000260"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Perhaps I should have made it absolutely clear. We
have been calling for removal of VAT on bingo for many years. Of course
we support clause 112, but it would not have arisen without clause 20,
so it is only fair to refer to clause 20 when considering
clause
112.</div><a name="09062546000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09062546000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062546000261"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): As the hon. Gentleman
has been allowed some breadth to consider the matter, perhaps he would
discourse on the longer term taxation of this activity. I seem to
recall a taxation level before 1997 that exceeded that which applies
now.</div><a name="09062546000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000262"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am unaware of that, but I am happy to look into
it. I was not in the House&#151;it was 12 years ago&#151;and I was
not a regular in bingo halls. I am unaware of what the tax situation
was prior to 1997, but I am happy to look into it, and I will write to
the hon. Gentleman about it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column613" />Column number: 613</div><a name="09062546000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bingo clubs
make a significant contribution to the Exchequer&#146;s coffers, and
accordingly to industry sources, every club contributes around
&#163;1 million per annum in taxation. However, the overall tax
contribution from bingo is falling, and bingo clubs are out of fashion.
In 2003, there were 699 clubs in the UK, but that number has fallen by
about 15 per cent. to around 590. Last year, more than 30 clubs had to
close.</div><a name="09062546000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
several factors are involved, and the sector has been hit hard by the
smoking ban and the restrictions on gaming machines. I appreciate that
those restrictions have been relaxed a little, but it is estimated that
they have resulted in around 3,500 job losses in the sector since the
Gambling Act 2005. Nevertheless, the bingo world&#146;s tax treatment
has been its biggest irritant. Anyone who has talked to the clubs knows
that operators have campaigned for its removal for some time.
Ordinarily, they would welcome the clause.</div>
<a name="09062546000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Culture, Media and Sport agreed with the clubs some time
ago&#151;this is one of those interesting splits in the
Government&#151;and stated in the explanatory memorandum to the
Gambling Act 2005 (Gaming Machines in Bingo Premises) Order
2008:</div><a name="09062546000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
consultation produced 12 other proposals for assisting the bingo
industry. The most popular of these was removing that on bingo
participation. This is a matter for the Treasury, but DCMS continues to
put the case for this
reform.&#148;</div><a name="09062546000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful to hear from the Minister whether she, her
predecessor or her predecessor but one have finally listened to the
DCMS view, and what finally swung it for them this year, because in
previous years it did not seem to cut much
ice.</div><a name="09062546000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury has made conflicting noises on the extent to which the decline
of bingo is due to the tax regime. We know that the last but one
Exchequer Secretary, the hon. Member for Wallasey, who debated clause
20 on the Floor of the House some five weeks ago, campaigned for many
years for a reduction in tax on football pools. I shall explain why
that is relevant. Littlewoods is, of course, in her
constituency.</div><a name="09062546000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government tax football pools at 15 per cent. of gross
profits&#151;the same rate that bingo was charged at before the
Budget, but football pools have been VAT-exempt for some time. The hon.
Member for Wallasey told her local newspaper, the <i class="I">Wirral Globe</i>,
on 26 March
1997:</div><a name="09062546000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
must fight to preserve the remaining pools jobs. We will be pressing
the new Government to achieve a level playing field in tax and
regulations between pools and lottery. We are aware that the lottery
changes the nature of the gaming industry and poses a continuing threat
to the remaining 1,400 pools jobs and those of 57,000
collectors.&#148;</div><a name="09062546000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recall that it was a long election campaign and that quote must have
been given during
it.</div><a name="09062546000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Internal
Treasury documents, which came to light after freedom of information
requests, show that the Treasury believes that bingo&#146;s plight is
at least partly due to tax. One states
that</div><a name="09062546000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is hard to believe that the problems faced by bingo clubs could be
solved purely by removing
VAT.&#148;</div><a name="09062546000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree, but the implication is that if they cannot be explained purely
by removing VAT then tax is part of the problem, in the same way that
the last but one Exchequer Secretary viewed it as being part of the
problem for the football pools industry. I note that she never
suggested raising pools duty to 22 per cent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div><a name="09062546000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Meanwhile, I
am told that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has refused to meet
representatives of the bingo industry or the Bingo
Association&#151;he may have other things on his mind at the
moment&#151;and, incredibly, even insisted that none were present
when he visited a bingo club in his constituency in October 2008. That
must be a unique occasion: the Chancellor barred the company&#146;s
management from their own premises. The reason given was that the right
hon. Gentleman was
visiting</div><a name="09062546000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
a constituency MP, rather than as
Chancellor&#148;.</div><a name="09062546000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am told that that is the only occasion in more than 60 MP
constituency visits to local Mecca Bingo clubs that anyone has refused
to meet the company&#146;s management. It is an extraordinary state
of affairs.</div>
<a name="09062546000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000263"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> In my correspondence with the local bingo
industry&#151;there is no hall in my area but my constituents visit
one nearby&#151;I have asked to look at the business&#146;s books
to understand how the tax works and the impact of the VAT reduction.
Would the hon. Gentleman be surprised to learn that, so far, that
invitation has not been taken up?</div>
<a name="09062546000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000264"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Sorry, I may have misunderstood the intervention.
The hon. Gentleman invited the business to show him its books so that
he could see the impact&#151;that is a kind offer. It is not for me
to talk about the relationship between him and his local bingo club,
but he must agree that it is bizarre for the Chancellor to refuse to
meet the management. Why would a Chancellor visit his local bingo club
and not be prepared to debate the issue?</div>

Rochford and Southend,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000268"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> Surely the issue is that the business mentioned
by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire is not in his constituency. It
would be wholly inappropriate for him to interfere with a business in a
neighbouring constituency, as he very well knows. I have met Mecca
Bingo twice in my constituency and it has been very good. I met once
with the national management, who wanted better dialogue and were very
angry that Alistair Darling had not met their management team. I am
saddened by bingo taxation legislation. It is
detrimental&#151;</div><a name="09062546000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000269"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000270"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I am
not sure that I can add anything to it, but I congratulate him on going
to see his local Mecca Bingo club. I only wish that I could have the
same pleasure. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 615</div>Unfortunately, my local club closed down, as I mentioned, because of
many of the pressures that we have been talking
about.</div><a name="09062546000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must now give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton,
South.</div>
<a name="09062546000197"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="09062546000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000271"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I thought that I was invisible, but I am most
grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Does he agree with me when I
say that, in my experience, the clubs are very open and are more than
happy to welcome Members of Parliament? That is certainly the case in
my local club in Northampton, which I have visited on two occasions and
hope to visit again shortly. The welcome that I receive there is
overwhelming, and the information given to me is as full as I needed
and had asked for. The point that we are discussing came up again and
again. We need to set the record straight about those
clubs.</div><a name="09062546000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000272"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. Earlier, I mentioned
various hon. Members from various parties who had visited their local
bingo clubs. The bingo industry is taking an intelligent approach and
is inviting parliamentary candidates in key marginal seats to visit
clubs. That approach may yield some interesting results in
constituencies such as Harlow.</div>
<a name="09062546000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me return
briefly to the social value of bingo. In August 2007, the Henley
Centre, a research group, conducted some research on bingo. I see my
hon. Friend the Member for Henley here today. I do not know much about
the Henley Centre, but I assume that it is located in his constituency.
It published &#147;Unlucky for Some&#151;the Social Impact of Bingo
Club Closures&#148;, which is the centre&#146;s impact assessment
of the closure of clubs owed in part by the tax treatment. The report
concluded:</div><a name="09062546000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
closure of bingo clubs, especially those in small rural venues and
deprived urban locations, has meant not only the loss of a pastime and
form of entertainment, but the disappearance of a unique social support
network, relied upon especially by retired
women.&#148;</div><a name="09062546000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continued:</div>
<a name="09062546000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
demise of this pastime and network can have a detrimental impact upon
the physical and mental wellbeing of patrons, especially as there are
often few other opportunities for this group to socialise. Bingo
closures also appear to be both a manifestation and a catalyst for a
wider breakdown of local communities that could have a negative impact
on
society.&#148;</div><a name="09062546000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we debate why bingo should be taxed at 22 per cent., the Henley
Centre&#146;s study puts the question in its proper context.
Although, thankfully, VAT on participation fees has been removed, the
duty on bingo is significantly higher than it is on their gambling
brethren, for want of a better term.</div>
<a name="09062546000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, bingo clubs are worthy of our support, yet the Government
have managed to enrage all of them. If Ministers believe that they are
helping bingo, why did Gala&#146;s chairman say
that</div><a name="09062546000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
industry has been quite badly
hit&#148;</div><a name="09062546000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">by
the Budget, and that</div>
<a name="09062546000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It&#146;s
nonsense to portray
this&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09062546000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is, the
Budget&#151;</div><a name="09062546000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as

<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 616</div><a name="09062546000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why do all the major
operators say that they will end up paying more as a result of the
measure, despite the fact that the Financial Secretary claimed that the
net effect would be welcomed by the
industry?</div>
<a name="09062546000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062546000273"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Jenkins</b> (Tamworth) (Lab): Although I find this to be
a long and tortuous route to the vote on the clause, when the hon.
Gentleman says that people say they are going to pay more tax, is that
in reference to the tax that they should have been paying but were
withholding, the tax they are actually paying, or the tax that will be
paid under the new arrangement, which is merely a tax on their profits?
Which of those are we talking
about?</div><a name="09062546000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000274"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> All of them, I think. I outlined some details
earlier, but I am waiting to hear back from the Minister to be
absolutely precise. We were trying to deconstruct the &#163;50
million in tax that supposedly will be saved by the bingo industry; the
Government have not been entirely straight about where that &#163;50
million saving is coming from. I speculated earlier, using three
figures: &#163;20 million on the interval bingo; &#163;25 million
on the more traditional bingo, and &#163;5 million on poker duties
and perhaps other duties. We are waiting for the Minister to answer our
question about where that estimate of a saving of &#163;50 million
comes from.</div>
<a name="09062546000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why have even
independent City analysts joined the chorus of disapproval? For
example, Investec described the measure as a &#147;Budget
nightmare&#148; and &#147;counter-intuitive&#148;. When the
Committee of the whole House debated clause 20, the erstwhile Exchequer
Secretary, the hon. Member for Wallasey, misrepresented&#151;perhaps
wilfully&#151;the Opposition&#146;s position on clause 112. As I
said then, if our amendment at that time was not carried, we would
support lifting VAT from bingo when we reached clause 112. That remains
the
case.</div><a name="09062546000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the wider matter of the rise in bingo duty, I also said that the
fairness of the Government&#146;s proposals would stand in question
until the High Court had ruled. The Court&#146;s decision clearly
reveals the proposals to be unfair, and our initial impression that
they are a pre-emptive grab for revenue has been shown to be correct.
Although taxing bingo at a higher rate than comparable forms of
gambling could be justified in the context of a cut, it is hard to
understand it over the longer term in the very different context of a
tax increase. A future Conservative Government will hope to address
that imbalance as time and the public finances
allow.</div><a name="09062546000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Government appeal the High Court&#146;s decision further? The
Minister has said that she has not yet made up her mind, and I think
that she has a few days to do so. It would be helpful if she told us
some of the considerations that will be thrown into the mix when the
Government decide whether to appeal the decision. Our debate would be
put in its proper context if we had a feel for whether the court case
will continue or
not.</div><a name="09062546000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062546000275"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I rise to highlight
some problems faced by my constituency. We have a Mecca Bingo that

one of the poor areas of Devonport, to survive and thrive. Also, a lot
of people work at the bingo hall, and I have received many letters from
employees&#151;a group who have been largely ignored during
today&#146;s debate&#151;who want to ensure that their jobs
continue. Confusion has arisen because, with a High Court judgment
pending, people will be uncertain for a little while longer about the
exact impact that the judgment will have in terms of the tax that the
company will have to pay, and therefore the company&#146;s view of
the viability of that bingo hall. We have heard of bingo halls that

the duties on bingo played in a licensed club and those on online
bingo, which are 22 and 15 per cent. respectively. Why on earth do we
have that ludicrous disparity? It is one thing to say that bingo is
such an undesirable activity that it needs to be heavily taxed, but on
what basis is online bingo worthy of the lower, standard 15
per cent. tax, while club bingo is taxed at 22 per cent? It simply
makes no
sense.</div><a name="09062546000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000279"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am sure that members of the Committee will
be pleased to know that I do not propose to rehash the debate on clause
20 that took place on the Floor of the House. I will, however, respond
to the specific points that have been raised, particularly in relation
to
VAT.</div><a name="09062546000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I shall deal with the question about appeals. The decision on whether
to appeal is not mine to make; it is for HMRC to decide whether to
appeal, and it is now looking at the legal arguments. As I said, a
decision will be made in time, as it has to
be.</div><a name="09062546000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
question was whether Red Book figures are based on the law as it stands
at the time, or whether they are based on the perceived actual amount
of VAT to come
in.</div><a name="09062546000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000280"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Minister just said that she had no ability to
influence or to seem to influence HMRC. Does that mean that HMRC can,
on its own discretion, spend taxpayers&#146; money willy-nilly on an
appeal that is so antisocial?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 618</div><a name="09062546000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000281"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point. There is a specific legal issue, and his extrapolation goes much
too
far.</div><a name="09062546000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to my point, Red Book figures must be based on the law as it stands at
the time, and the figures in it are based on
that.</div><a name="09062546000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000282"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> This will be of interest to the Minister&#146;s
hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth. Can the Minister confirm whether
my figures are correct? They are that &#163;20 million comes from VAT
on mainstage bingo, &#163;25 million from interval bingo,
and the other &#163;5 million from equal-chance games other than
bingo, principally poker. Are those figures, which I cobbled together
from a variety of parliamentary answers, correct? I believe that her
hon. Friend was asking the same
question.</div><a name="09062546000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000283"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> If the hon. Gentleman should have had a
little patience, because I was just about to come on to that point. The
&#163;50 million is made up of the cost of recovering VAT on
mainstage bingo, interval bingo and card rooms. The roundings are to
the nearest &#163;5 million, so although &#163;20 million,
&#163;25 million and &#163;5 million are not exact
figures, they show the
proportions.</div><a name="09062546000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000284"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am intrigued. Why do the figures have to be
rounded to &#163;5 million? That is an incredible divergence on a
figure of &#163;20 million or &#163;25 million. Is it to protect
the commercial confidentiality of the various bingo operators? What is
the rationale behind
it?</div><a name="09062546000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000285"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> That would certainly be a factor. I do not
know the exact details of everything, but I would be more than happy to
write to the hon. Gentleman to
explain.</div><a name="09062546000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000286"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The Minister makes an interesting point. She says
that the Government based the Red Book figures on their understanding
of the current law. I understand that, but is it not also the practice
to provide for a contingent amount where there is a court case that the
Revenue might lose? Has such provision been
made?</div><a name="09062546000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000287"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I do not know the answer to that because I
do not have the figures in front of me. Provision probably is made in
the total of contingent liabilities, but it is unlikely to be specific.
I do not want to say things that are not correct, so I will look into
that and get back to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09062546000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000288"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Lady is being generous in giving way. What
is the implication for the unpaid VAT from previous years? The
Government were clearly counting on that VAT being paid. Where does all
the VAT that the Government were expecting but that will now not be
paid appear in the Red
Book?</div><a name="09062546000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000289"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Again, I do not have the figures in front of
me. It probably depends on whether HMRC decides to go further with an
appeal. We can come back to
that.</div><a name="09062546000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause makes bingo participation fees VAT exempt, and introduces a
simplification that has long been asked for by the industry. The
principal aim of the reforms is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 619</div>to simplify the bingo tax regime. In the Red Book, we gave the average
estimated effective tax rate and set out what the effect will be. I
remind the Committee that, in the Bingo Association&#146;s own Budget
representations, it estimated its effective tax rate to be 24 to 25 per
cent. On that basis, removal of the VAT and duty would reduce its
effective tax rate. I am pleased to tell the Committee that I am
meeting representatives of the Bingo Association on Tuesday, when they
will put their arguments to me and we will discuss the
matter.</div><a name="09062546000198"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09062546000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of the clause, of course, has the effect of making the
participation fees for casino card rooms VAT exempt. In autumn 2007, we
said that we would look at that matter. The most sensible way to tax
casino card rooms is through the gaming duty regime, and the changes we
will make in that respect will ensure consistency of treatment with
other player-to-player gaming and make participation fees
exempt.</div>
<a name="09062546000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000290"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The clause relates to gaming duty, which we have,
in passing, already mentioned during the various discussions on bingo.
The clause masks what for some casinos will be a very large increase in
the tax paid on participation fees for games of poker. Player-to-player
games&#151;those games in which players bet against each other,
rather than against the house&#151;are not currently subject to
gaming duty. That was felt to be fair because a pub, for example, or,
indeed, a casino or any other premises that hosts a game of poker is
essentially providing a service and does not make a direct profit from
the gambling. In effect, such places charge a fee for the gambling to
be housed in their premises and for providing the facilities, but they
do not directly profit from the gaming that takes place. Until the Bill
was drawn up, VAT rather than gaming duty was thought to be
appropriate.</div><a name="09062546000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
player-to-player poker, I understand&#151;I have not seen it being
played and am going on what one casino has told me&#151;that a casino
hosts the event and charges a registration fee. A typical fee might be
&#163;5 for an evening, which seems incredibly low, although I am
told that the fee can rise to as much as &#163;50 to &#163;100 an
hour for large stakes games, particularly if the casino provides more
staff to ensure security and the integrity of the game. There seems to
be some sense in increasing the participation fee for a higher stakes
game compared with games in which people just sit around and play for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 620</div>lower stakes. I do not know what the lowest form might be, but in those
games, I assume that security is less of an
issue.</div><a name="09062546000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the clause, the Government propose to bring player-to-player games more
widely into the gaming duty regime. The industry has protested about
the measure, which will be a familiar theme in many clauses, not only
because the rate of taxation will rise from effectively being 15 per
cent.&#151;the rate of VAT&#151;to sometimes being as high as 50
per cent., but because there are fears that the measure will drive
business out of casinos altogether. One can understand the argument, at
least to a certain point.</div>
<a name="09062546000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000291"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The clause causes me great concern. We have a
casino in Northampton that offers the very facilities about which my
hon. Friend is talking in perfectly well run, well ordered
surroundings. I am concerned that if the measure drives the high-stakes
gambling business underground again, that will help to feed crime and
other the antisocial behaviours that casinos, in fact, attempt to
prevent.</div><a name="09062546000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000292"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. It would be good
to hear from the Minister what consultation there has been with casinos
and other parts of the industry and what assessment has been made of
the possible antisocial consequences of this
decision.</div><a name="09062546000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Poker,
as we know, can take place almost anywhere with only a few players, a
couple of packs of playing cards, some money and the will to play. I
must confess to an interest in this matter. A number of people I have
known over the past 20 years have played poker in their homes or in
pubs&#151;indeed, I used to play when I was a student. If Dave
Phillips is listening, he still owes me &#163;58.50. I do not see him
in the Gallery, but I have been chasing him for about 20 years. I
wonder if a mention of the debt in <i class="I">Hansard</i> might finally prompt
him to pay
up.</div><a name="09062546000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jesting
apart, I say that to make a similar point to that made by my hon.
Friend. If poker is driven out of casinos and regulated environments,
it will be played only in completely unregulated and unsupervised
environments. At the very least, unpaid debts and bad blood will arise
and more serious antisocial behaviour and crime could be a consequence.
We await the Minister&#146;s views on this
matter.</div><a name="09062546000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Casinos
make the point that the house does not profit from hosting poker games.
Poker is different from blackjack or roulette, from which the house
effectively takes a cut. I will not say that the house fixes the odds,
but we all understand that over time the house will accumulate a
certain percentage. Poker is different because it is a player-to-player
game. However, many people think that casinos are an appropriate
environment for such
gambling.</div><a name="09062546000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Gaming
duty is a gross profits tax that is applied on a sliding scale from 15
to 50 per cent., depending on the profits of the individual casino,
rather than the company or sector. Clause 113 follows on from the
changes in clause 19, which we have already debated. A premises with a
gross gaming yield of less than &#163;1.929 million will be subject
to a 15 per cent. rate. Smaller establishments will therefore be
subject to the same rate as they currently pay for VAT. The rate rises
in another four bands. Establishments with profits of more than
&#163;4.915 million 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 621</div>will be taxed at a rate of 50 per cent. With the abolition of VAT on
gaming duties, the net result for a larger casino could be that
player-to-player poker is taxed effectively at 50 per cent. That is the
problem. Smaller establishments are likely to be relatively unaffected
by the changes and may even benefit from them when VAT returns to the
higher rate of 17.5 per cent. in January
2010.</div><a name="09062546000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have seen no analysis of the new effective tax rate for smaller
premises. I would be grateful if the Minister supplied some Treasury
estimates. Because they will be brought into the gaming duty net, pubs
that host the occasional poker game may now face significant and
prohibitive costs. I do not pretend to be an expert on the sector, but
it appears that the costs of being brought into the gaming duty net
will be prohibitive for small, occasional operators that want to offer
such facilities, perhaps to their regular customers who do not usually
go there to participate in gambling.</div>
<a name="09062546000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
subsection (7) exempts members&#146; clubs and miners&#146; welfare
institutes from gaming duty, but not pubs and other establishments. I
would be grateful for an explanation of that from the
Minister.</div><a name="09062546000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000293"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> It is well known that I am a keen supporter of the
public house, which has been under immense pressure&#151;many public
houses are closing. As well as by entertaining customers and providing
the traditional facilities, landlords are trying hard to find
additional ways to bring in customers. Does my hon. Friend agree that
the measure will accelerate the demise of public houses and will not
allow landlords to be creative in that
way?</div><a name="09062546000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000294"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. We
discussed at some length the future of pubs and the welfare of the pub
sector when the Committee of the whole House debated a clause on
alcohol duties. We have to recognise the overall business plans of pubs
and the fact that some will need to diversify. I agree with the thrust
of my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention.</div>
<a name="09062546000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The industry
is worried by the changes. A spokesman came to see me last week and
said that the change could drive poker back underground, back to the
kitchens and dining rooms and other unregulated and unsupervised
environments across the country. It would be helpful to know whether
any organisations that represent the sector have been consulted. Has
the impact been taken into account and will warnings be issued to alert
the occasional operator of the proposed changes in the law?</div>
<a name="09062546000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a broader
note, it will be helpful to hear from the Minister what the
Government&#146;s motive is for the proposals in the Bill. I think
that she will say that throwing in the duties on person-to-person games
together with the rest of the casino&#146;s activities is a
simplification measure. I would be grateful if she explained what has
changed over the past year that has made her bring forward the proposal
now.</div>
<a name="09062546000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Red Book
estimates that &#163;5 million will be raised from incorporating
player-to-player games within the gaming duty regime. As I mentioned in
the debate on the last clause, the Government&#146;s figure on bingo
VAT receipts seemed to imply a &#163;5 million loss on removing VAT
from such an activity. If the proposals really are revenue neutral,
that would suggest that small poker rooms or casinos will be major
beneficiaries because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 622</div>larger casinos already know that they will be net losers.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.]</i> I am not sure whether something has
happened in the last minute or two. Perhaps I have said something that
my hon. Friends profoundly disagree with. I was not aware that that
particular paragraph was controversial.</div>

</b><b class="B">Hands</b>: Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I would
appreciate confirmation that it is the case that larger casinos will be
the net losers and that the smaller operators&#151;poker rooms or
casinos&#151;will be the major beneficiaries. That is, I think, the
implication of the figures in the Red Book. Moreover, I should like an
analysis of the change in the effective tax rates to which large
casinos in particular will be subject. The National Casino Industry
Forum believes that the effective tax rate on the player-to-player
games will exceed 35 per cent. At the moment, the figure stands at 15
per cent. The forum has criticised the Government for a total failure
to consult. It
said:</div><a name="09062546000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;None
of the changes announced have been discussed with the industry at the
various meetings held with ministers or officials from the Treasury (or
from DCMS), this despite previous assurances that it would do
so.&#148;</div><a name="09062546000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to fly against the Government&#146;s stated aim of promoting
softer forms of gaming within casinos to then significantly increase
the tax on some of those forms of gaming. Will the Minister clarify why
the industry was not consulted, and what discussions took place with
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with regard to the balance
of gaming within casinos and the likely effect of clause
113.</div><a name="09062546000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I should like some clarification as to the purpose of allowing
exemptions to be made by statutory order. I have already mentioned two
areas of exemption, and I am intrigued to know how the Government will
consider future exemptions or perhaps repeal some of the existing
ones.</div>

am</div><a name="09062546000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
what circumstances do the Government foresee the power being used?
Although such orders would be subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure, the possibility itself of an order coming before us that
would fundamentally change the tax status of one of these places could
create uncertainty. Old Conservative or trade union clubs offering
poker to members could be faced with a bit of a surprise. I realise
that that situation is not unique&#151;it is a fairly well-known
feature of this place&#151;but I would be interested to hear from the
Minister on what grounds she thinks that such an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 623</div>order might be introduced. The notes in the Bill, and the paragraph on
this power in the Financial Secretary&#146;s recent letter, do not
appear to explain those procedures, so I would be grateful for some
clarification.</div><a name="09062546000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000299"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I offer my condolences to the hon.
Gentleman; he appears to have been totally abandoned by every Committee
member from his party&#151;was it something he
said?</div><a name="09062546000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to pick up on some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. The
thrust and reasoning behind the clause is for consistency with other
gambling sectors. It ensures that such gaming is exempt from VAT, but
subject to the relevant gambling duty. Card room fees will therefore
come under gaming duty. I also want to make it clear that pubs are not
included, because the clause limits gaming duty to high-stake gaming,
which, under social law, is permitted only on casino premises. Poker
played in pubs and elsewhere for small stakes and prizes will not be
drawn into the gaming duty by this measure. Someone mentioned that
originally card rooms were considered as a service and not a profit for
the house. The fees received for casino card rooms are now taxed on a
consistent basis with other gambling activities. That is the thrust
behind the
clause.</div><a name="09062546000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000300"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister says that fees will be taxed on a
consistent basis, but surely she must realise the fundamental
difference between a participation fee on poker and the house taking a
cut on something such as blackjack. Was she aware of the difference
when she considered the background to the
clause?</div><a name="09062546000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000301"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am certainly aware of that difference, but
we are considering gambling and gaming as a whole. I see the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about narrowness, but we are looking for
consistency across gambling regimes.</div>
<a name="09062546000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
return to the point about consultation. In autumn 2007, we announced
that we would reconsider the taxation of casino card rooms, and in 2008
and 2009 we received representations from the industry. Those suggested
that card rooms were just a small part of the casino model and that
many casinos did not offer player-to-player gambling. We concluded,
therefore, that for consistency with other gambling regimes, fees
should be VAT exempt, but be taxed under the relevant
gambling
duty.</div><a name="09062546000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked why we had included the option for exemptions
under affirmative order. We have done so in case the social law changes
the places permitted for high-stakes poker, in which case we would need
the ability to change the legislation here. The second part of the
clause was the result of a simplification request from the Gambling
Commission and the casinos sector. Previously, individual casino games
were listed in the Finance Act and new games had to be added through
secondary legislation whenever the regulator wished to trial new games.
That was a really cumbersome process, and this clause removes the need
to list these games individually in tax legislation. It should
facilitate the industry and the regulator in trialling new games
quickly and in the certainty that the tax law captures them.</div>

at 15 per cent., but bingo played in clubs at 22 per cent. I understand
why they want to make online bingo consistent with other forms of
online gambling, but the anomaly arises in calling it a tidying-up or
simplification exercise. It will benefit the online community who sit
around at home and play online over perhaps more mature people who go
to bingo clubs and take part in a social activity. What is the sense of
that?</div><a name="09062546000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
anything, I would have thought that the bias should be away from online
and, although regulated, unsupervised gambling to gambling in the
supervised and regulated environment that bingo clubs provide. I would
be interested to know what assessment the Government have made of
people migrating from bingo clubs&#151;we all know that online
penetration in communities that might typically be found in bingo clubs
has increased enormously over the past 10 years &#151;to
playing bingo online on, for example, a home
computer?</div><a name="09062546000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Remote
gaming duty is chargeable on games when players participate using the
internet, telephone or interactive TV, but not when another gambling
duty is charged. The Government are moving bingo from another category
into the category subject to remote gaming duty. Because remote bingo
was subject to standard bingo duty, some inconsistencies arose between
online bingo and other online gambling. The issue is where to have the
consistency. Should it be with online bingo and other forms of online
gambling, which is what the Government propose, or with social club
bingo and internet bingo? I may have laboured the point too long, and
perhaps the choice is
clear.</div><a name="09062546000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
114 makes the opposite decision from the previous one. It prevents a
tax rise that would otherwise be likely to cause a loss of revenue in
practice as operators and internet users take further advantage of the
lower tax rate on internet sites hosted abroad. As I said on clause 19,
the overall revenue from remote gaming duty is so low that the
Government cannot disclose it because it would compromise its
obligations to the one significant operator left in the UK. The intent
in the clause seems to be to have a negligible effect on the present
arrangements for remote bingo, but I am wondering what effect it might
have on the arrangements for club bingo. No doubt it will
succeed in its first aim to create consistency, but we want
to hear from the Government what consideration has been given to
migration between two forms of
bingo.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000303"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> We have a remote Conservative party here to
discuss duty on remote bingo, although I must be careful how many
stones I throw as I am the only representative of Britain&#146;s
strongly growing third
party.</div><a name="09062546000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000304"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will confirm that the
only member of the Committee who has never attended it is his boss, the
hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr.
Cable).</div><a name="09062546000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000305"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for
Twickenham has attended the Committee yet. However, if you will allow
me, Mr. Atkinson, I would like to point out briefly that the
hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) and the shadow Chief
Secretary to the Treasury do not seem to regard the Committee as
sufficiently important to take an interest in its affairs. Given the
level of public debt, I regret
that.</div><a name="09062546000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to clause 114 because I want to explore briefly the point made
by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham. I do not have a
particular attachment to gambling per se. In a liberal society, I am
happy for people to choose to spend their money as they see fit,
although I realise that in some cases&#151;albeit fairly exceptional
ones&#151;doing so can have a detrimental effect on their finances,
health or social circle. However, that is a decision people make and we
should not seek to inhibit those decisions, unless there is an
overwhelmingly compelling reason for doing
so.</div><a name="09062546000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
bingo, I do not consider it to be my obligation as a politician to
promote people&#146;s participation in bingo purely as a form of
gambling&#151;they may or may not choose to play bingo, and that is
their decision. However, there is virtue in the social aspects of
bingo, and I can see merit in us trying to encourage or, at any rate,
not impede those sorts of activities. What seems so perverse about the
clause is that it does not recognise that bingo clubs provide some sort
of beneficial social service&#151;albeit on a commercial basis and if
it is in their interests to do so&#151;whereas the online version
does not provide any of those benefits at all. If the Government were
looking to discriminate in favour of one form of bingo over the other,
one would imagine that the discrimination would not be aimed at the
more social form of the game.</div>
<a name="09062546000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the MP for
Taunton, I have been to Mecca Bingo there. In discussions on previous
clauses, it has been said that many people who choose to go to bingo
have reasonably low incomes and that they do not spend a vast amount of
money there. Bingo is an opportunity for people to meet friends. Meals
are often provided at reasonably low cost and people enjoy the
atmosphere and social aspect of attending a bingo hall. All of those
advantages do not, of course, exist in the online form. Of course, the
game at a bingo hall is also supervised, so unless the establishment is
run by people with little social compassion, they would be in a
position to intervene if someone were perhaps spending more money than
they ought to given their means. Of course, that opportunity to
intervene in a compassionate way does not readily exist in relation to
the online form, which is to be given preferential tax
treatment.</div><a name="09062546000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000306"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I have a genuine query. If the hon. Gentleman does
not know the answer, perhaps the Minister will. Is there any reason why
online facilities could not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column626" />Column number: 626</div>offered within a bingo club, because that would provide access to many
of the services that he rightly mentioned? There are other aspects to
being present in the bingo hall that are not directly related to
playing the game in a particular
form.</div><a name="09062546000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000307"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I defer to the Minister or her officials on that,
but I am not aware that there is any bar to doing
so.</div><a name="09062546000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000308"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am not sure how relevant that is to the
clause.</div><a name="09062546000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000309"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> A further point is that we assume&#151;perhaps
because Committee members are all of working age, or perhaps for
another reason&#151;that internet access is universal. One could be
forgiven for thinking that. On television and radio programmes, it is
often said that more information will be made available on the website,
and using the internet has become part of our daily dialogue. Of
course, most people do have access to computers and the internet, but
we should not forget that many people do not. Millions of people in
this country neither have access to the internet nor know how to use a
computer. I am inevitably generalising when I say this, but that is
more likely to be the case if people are older and poorer. In both of
those categories, particularly in relation to those on low incomes,
there has been a big catch-up and far more people on low incomes have
access to the internet than was the case. Let us be frank about
it&#151;some of the social activity in bingo halls is targeted at the
tastes not of younger people but the more mature market. It seems
strange that those who are older or on lower incomes, who may enjoy the
social aspects of bingo, are taxed at a higher rate than those who are
younger or on higher incomes, and who may have internet access at home.
That is a perverse approach for any Government to take, but
particularly a Labour Government.</div>
<a name="09062546000200"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09062546000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Exchequer Secretary has come to the Bill quite late in our
deliberations, but I suggest that there is merit in consistency. We
should probably be trying to achieve uniformity and iron out some of
the inconsistencies. I have some sympathy with the hon. Lady, because
the Finance Bill is typically the largest and most complex piece of
legislation, and she will be immersed in detail. She is giving us the
orthodoxy that she is required to produce on behalf of the Government,
but familiarising herself with the Government&#146;s position is a
huge undertaking without looking to challenge some of those
assumptions.</div>
<a name="09062546000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Exchequer Secretary were to step back for a moment and consider the
matter as a politician rather than as someone whose job is to ensure
that the official line is communicated to Parliament&#151;for
example, if she were to listen to the representations made by the hon.
Member for Plymouth, Devonport&#151;she must surely see that the
Government are unnecessarily bringing on themselves huge grief and
unhappiness. Much of that will come from people who, in other
circumstances, might consider voting for Labour at the next general
election.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column627" />Column number: 627</div><a name="09062546000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only would
it be right to take a reasonable and consistent approach to taxation,
but it would be in the Government&#146;s interests. As the Labour
party is rightly seeking to appeal to the electorate, the Government
should look again at this area of taxation. It is shot through with
anomalies, and on the whole those anomalies are least fair to the
oldest and poorest in society.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000310"></a>Mr.
Jenkins:</b> I wish to make a few points on remote gambling.
One or two matters have been raised during the debate&#151;some might
refer to the previous clause&#151;and I should be grateful if my hon.
Friend the Exchequer Secretary were to answer them.</div>
<a name="09062546000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a small
community in the country does not have internet access, but access is
provided by a social club, one can enter that social club and for a
small charge gain access to online gambling from the monitors in
cubicles around the room. What tax or duty will the provider of that
facility have to pay? That is an interesting point, and I hope that the
Minister has an interesting answer.</div>
<a name="09062546000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible that a community 20, 30 or 40 miles down the road has access
to the internet, and individuals there can gain access to remote bingo
at home. If they cannot, and someone has made provision for it out of
the goodness of their heart, what tax would they pay for making such
provision?</div><a name="09062546000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is okay for the Government to say that they will collect tax on the
gambling duty regime, but what if the site provider does not have a
site under our tax jurisdiction? What are we going to do then? Are we
going to start chasing around the world for different sites, or for
offshore site providers who might be run by a Mickey Mouse company? The
resident of that island might be an ex-dom tax resident of Britain.
Such people may be collecting the duties from bingo but not paying them
over. Do we collect the tax in this country? Will the Minister say
whether that is possible? If it is, I would point out one of two of the
difficulties that we had clearing up problems with gambling in the
horse
industry.</div><a name="09062546000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are questions at both ends of the remote problem, and I would be
grateful to hear some comments from the
Minister.</div><a name="09062546000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062546000311"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Adrian Bailey</b> (West Bromwich, West) (Lab/Co-op): I welcome
you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. Like other Members, I visit
my local bingo halls. I have two very large Mecca Bingo halls in my
constituency&#151;in Oldbury and Wednesbury. They play a very
valuable part in the social life of the community, particularly for the
elderly. I have listened to the arguments, both in the bingo halls and
from the Minister today, and there are a number of areas I do not feel
totally comfortable with at the moment.</div>
<a name="09062546000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there
seems to be an absence of, shall we say, verifiable statistics to deal
with the revenues and incomes of the various forms of taxation.
Secondly, there is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column628" />Column number: 628</div>principled argument, elaborated on by the hon. Member for Taunton. I
compliment him on raising some very important points: the difference
and seeming inconsistency between the gaming rates on bingo, which is
in a comfortable controlled environment, and those on remote gambling,
which is not so controllable and is potentially used by far more
vulnerable people.</div>
<a name="09062546000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000312"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> On a linked point, and picking up on a comment
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth, when is online not
online? Would it be possible for a bingo hall to have a big screen,
with an online game going on from somewhere, with people participating?
How would that be taxed? Does my hon. Friend share my concern and hope
that the Minister will answer
that?</div><a name="09062546000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000313"></a>Mr.
Bailey:</b> My hon. Friends the Members for Tamworth and for
Plymouth, Devonport have raised a very important point that does not
seem to have been fully explored.</div>
<a name="09062546000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
substantive point that I want to make is that online gambling is a
private and uncontrollable activity. Given the greater predilection of
the younger generation to conduct such activity online, they are
disproportionately vulnerable to some of its social consequences.
Considerable research needs to be conducted to rationalise our taxation
policy in this area so that it is more consistent with what I think we
all agree are appropriate social aims. I conclude my
comments there. I await the Minister&#146;s response, but advocate
considerably more research, with perhaps modifications made at
subsequent Budgets to realise those social
aims.</div><a name="09062546000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062546000314"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The clause, as the hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham rightly points out, corrects a deficiency in the
original legislation for remote gaming duty. The duty on remote gaming
operators based in the UK ensures that our original policy intentions
are delivered. The policy intention has always been that remote bingo
should be part of remote gaming duty and should not come under the
bingo duty. Without the clause, there is a danger that remote bingo
will be left entirely untaxed. The clause ensures absolute
clarity.</div>
<a name="09062546000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some wider
and very interesting issues were discussed. There was a question on
what assessment the Government had made of the move from club to online
bingo. We monitor the development of online and remote forms of
gambling, and its impact on club-based gambling. Department for
Culture, Media and Sport Ministers are currently undertaking a review
of the regulation of online and remote forms of gambling. I am sure
that that will inform further thinking on the matter. I hope that my
hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West will take comfort from
that.</div>
