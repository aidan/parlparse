                           </span> When we adjourned this
morning I was making a point about the difficulty that Governments have
in reconciling the need to ensure that motorists and businesses do not
face undue costs and can continue to make profits and meet their living
costs with the concerns expressed by environmental groups in
particular, but also by people across the board about trying to use
fuel duties and this sort of taxation to change forms of behaviour and
to encourage people to use public transport. That is not new.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In December
2000 when the Conservatives pledged that a Conservative Government
would cut fuel duty by 3p a litre, a time when fuel prices were much
lower than they are today, Friends of the Earth described it as a
“cheap, political concession”, which would weaken
incentives for manufacturers to introduce more efficient cars and
weaken incentives for the motorist to buy them. Tony Bosworth,
transport campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“For a

climate change.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000252">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The pleas of
environmentalists were not listened to with any great enthusiasm by the
Conservatives. According to <em>The</em> 
                           <em>Sunday Times</em> in September
2000, a former colleague of the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State
for Justice, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr
Clarke)
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000016">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Ken

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Much
more recently, Craig Bennett, campaigns director of Friends of the
Earth, said in January 2011:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A
fuel price stabiliser could help iron out yo-yoing petrol prices, but
must also ensure the cost of fuel gradually rises - and be coupled with
efficient and affordable public transport, and moves to make it easier
for people to walk, cycle or drive cleaner cars that use less
fuel.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>So
even people from Friends of the Earth accept that rapid fluctuations or
increases in petrol prices have an impact on household finances but are
quite keen to see that there is a gradual
rise.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Returning
to the costs on businesses, the Federation of Small Businesses said
that small and medium-sized enterprises would be severely affected by
the Government’s hikes in fuel tax. In January, more than a
third of its members responding to a survey said that this was the
single biggest threat to their businesses. Nearly four in five thought
that the Government’s measures would add £2,000 to their
costs over six months. The Government blamed poor growth figures in the
last quarter of last year on the snow, but FSB members thought that the
rise in fuel taxation in January, including both fuel duty and VAT,
would have a far worse impact on their businesses than the
weather.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
know from business people in my constituency and organisations such as
the FSB that the increase in VAT will put a severe strain on all
enterprise. Fuel taxation has a huge impact on the wider economy at a
time when it is vital to encourage growth and job creation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of course the
Government are not to blame for the rising price of oil that is leading
to higher fuel and energy prices, and indirectly to higher prices for
food and other goods in the UK. Oil is traded on international markets
that set a global oil price, but the Government are able to take rising
prices into account when setting policies on taxation, which is what
they should have done. It is also what they said they would do. As has
been mentioned, the Conservative party told voters before the election
that it would consult on a fair fuel stabiliser, and it was crystal
clear about how that would work. The consultation document issued a few
years before the election
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Under
a Fair Fuel Stabiliser, when fuel prices go up, fuel duty would fall.
And when fuel prices go down, fuel duty would
rise.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>In
the run-up to the election, that was reiterated in the party’s
manifesto:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
will consult on the introduction of a ‘Fair Fuel
Stabiliser’. This would cut fuel duty when oil prices rise, and
vice versa. It would ensure families and businesses and the whole
British economy are less exposed to volatile oil markets, and that
there is a more stable environment for low carbon
investment.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Our
plan is to say when the petrol price goes up the tax should come down.

                        <p>Even
in government, the Prime Minister was still making that promise to
voters. As recently as January he told people in Leicester that he was
working with the Treasury to find a way in which,<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“when the oil
price goes up, if the Treasury is getting more revenue out of that oil,
we can find a way of sharing that risk with the consumer—ie if
the price goes up, the tax comes down, and if the price goes down, the
tax goes
up.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
have those promises translated into real-world action? The Government
increased VAT on fuel at the beginning of the year, adding nearly 3p to
the cost of a litre of petrol, according to the House of Commons
Library. In January next year, clause 20 of the Bill will raise fuel
duty by another 3p on the price of a litre of petrol. Next August, as
announced in the Budget, there will be a further increase in duty of
around 3p or 4p, depending on the price of petrol at the time. That
means that up to 10p a litre has been added to the cost of fuel as a
result of the Government’s policies, and that comes on top of a
fall in incomes, a rise in taxes and cuts to benefits and tax
credits.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One borough
council estimates that families spend more than £300 annually on
driving their kids to school, which does not include the typical taxi
service that parents find themselves providing as they drive their
children to and from other activities. Have the Government made an
estimate of the impact of the rises in fuel taxation on those
families?<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The previous
Labour Government took fuel prices into account when setting fuel duty.
The Minister has blamed rises in fuel duty on the Opposition, saying
that they were inherited from the previous Government, but in fact,
even when rises in duty were in the pipeline, our Government cancelled
or postponed them when people and businesses were facing sharp rises in
prices at the pump. In the 2010 Budget, the then Chancellor phased in
the fuel duty increase for that year in three stages. In the 2008
Budget, the Labour Government postponed the increase in fuel duty for
six months to ease pressure on businesses, support the economy and help
families.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some tax
rises are not about creating revenue but about changing behaviour; we
discussed that earlier in the context of duty on alcohol and tobacco.
When the price of fuel is already rising quickly, raising taxes for
behavioural reasons does not have the same impact because any
behavioural effects will already be delivered by the rise in prices.
The Labour party called on the Chancellor to look again at the fuel
duty escalator before making his Budget statement, and we welcome the
fact that he did that again in the Bill. Nevertheless, the 1p cut in
fuel duty offered in the Bill is small fry compared with the 9p or 10p
that will have been added to the cost of fuel by next August. In any
case, that 1p cut is already a thing of the past. As I said in the
Committee of the whole House, the saving from that cut lasted barely a
week before it was swamped by the rising cost of
fuel.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
the Budget, the Opposition asked the Chancellor to undo his hike in tax
on fuel by reducing the VAT on fuel back to 17.5%, which would have
been a real help for people and businesses, in stark contrast to the
Government’s approach of giving with one hand
and  
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>taking away with many others. Yes, that measure would require a
derogation from the European Commission, but the Government have
refused to ask for
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not intend to rehearse the arguments about VAT on fuel, because we
had a full and comprehensive debate on the Floor of the House. I simply
put it on record again that the Government should be taking the idea
far more seriously and pursuing it with the European Commission. I
suppose my starting point is that the Government should not have done
it in the first place; they should have considered the consequences of
increasing the VAT rate in January this year and, in particular, taken
into account the impact on fuel prices and on people who are struggling
to meet the cost of
motoring.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are, however, looking at a derogation in respect of fuel
duty for remote islands, which could be approved by this summer. The
Economic Secretary is aware that that in itself is controversial,
because it applies only to small, discrete areas of the United Kingdom.
Earlier this year, during the debate in the House on fuel duty called

of the factors are outwith our control, in that they are dictated by
global oil prices. But, to an extent, he made the point that we are
trying to make with the amendment. Fuel prices are predicted to go up
and to continue going up. Although we are not claiming that our
proposed measure would completely offset that rise, at least it would
make a little difference to people struggling to meet those costs. If
fuel prices were higher at the end of the year than at the time of the
Budget, we would have to re-examine whether the automatic rise ought to

                           </strong> In the Budget, the Chancellor announced a 1p cut
in fuel duty and trumpeted it as a real benefit to motorists, although
it has not had much impact because rising fuel prices have overtaken
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
explanatory notes to clause 20 link the increase in fuel duty, which is
taking effect in January 2012, to the Government’s new fair fuel
stabiliser, which was announced in the Budget. The new mechanism is not
to be confused with the mechanism that was being promoted by the by the
current Chancellor and the Prime Minister before the general election
last year. According to the new mechanism, when oil prices are low,
fuel duty will rise by inflation plus 1p and when oil prices are
high, as they are now, fuel duty will still rise, but only by
inflation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s new version of the fair fuel stabiliser will never
cut fuel duty. We were promised that when the price of petrol rose,
fuel duty would be cut to ensure a more stable price. That promise has
been broken. I said that in January the Prime Minister spoke to voters
about his Government’s plans for fuel duty. What is interesting
is that when he told people he was looking for a way to cut fuel duty
when fuel prices rose and vice versa—a promise that he has
failed to deliver, as I have already noted—he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It’s
called the Fuel Duty
Escalator.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>He
did not say that it was called the fuel duty stabiliser. The transcript
of that statement is available on the No. 10 website and
that is what he said. He referred to the mechanism as the “Fuel
Duty
Escalator”.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Was
that just a slip of the tongue? I ask because, as it turns out, despite
all the promises of a fair fuel stabiliser what the Government have
actually delivered is a fuel duty escalator. Under the
Government’s new mechanism, fuel duty will go up and up and up.
So I ask the Minister, “What happened?” In January, the
Prime Minister said that he was “working with the
Treasury” to find a way to deliver a mechanism to stabilise fuel
prices. In February, the Government told the North sea oil and gas
industry that they were still seeking stability for the North sea tax
regime, according to my discussions with industry representatives. That
is also the position the Government adopted in the June 2010 Budget.
There was no indication of any plans for a mechanism involving the
North sea tax
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the March Budget, however, we saw a sudden change. The fair fuel
stabiliser mechanism had morphed into an escalator mechanism and it now
involved an unexpected hike in the tax on North sea oil and gas. The
Government’s new mechanism also turned out to be poorly thought
through. There had been zero consultation with the North sea oil and
gas industry. The new mechanism would have the side effect of damaging
the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 206<a class="bkMark" name="Column206">&#160;</a>
                           </div>gas industry and potentially increasing the prices that consumers pay
for their gas at home, even though gas has little to do with the price
of petrol. In addition, it has led to billions of pounds of investment
in oilfields being suspended and it has put an estimated 40,000 jobs at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
short, the Government’s new fuel duty mechanism looked very much
as though it had been drawn up on the back of an envelope. Was it
perhaps a panic reaction by the Government in response to criticism of
their plans, because there had been criticism aplenty? First, the
Government had been criticised for failing to deliver. The current
Chancellor said in
opposition:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Our
policy will be set in a first Conservative Budget.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>And yet his first
Budget merely kicked the fair fuel stabiliser into the long grass, by
asking the new Office for Budget Responsibility to carry out a review
of it. Even in March, when we debated fuel duty in the House, there was
no sign of a fair fuel stabiliser, although the average petrol price
was already 14p per litre higher and the average diesel price nearly
18p per litre higher than at the time of the Chancellor’s first
Budget. That was the kind of situation that a fair fuel stabiliser was
meant to help people
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the Government were criticised because their ideas were half-baked. In
fact, rising oil prices do not lead to higher tax revenues for the
Government overall. The Conservatives had made an unfunded pledge and
they could not pay for the cuts in fuel duty that they had promised.
They could have introduced their fair fuel stabiliser, but it would
have made public borrowing unpredictable and prevented the Government
from reducing the deficit. No wonder the Secretary of State for
Business, Innovation and Skills said before the general election that
the Conservatives’ fair fuel stabiliser would be
“unbelievably complicated and unpredictable.” The chair
of the Office for Budget Responsibility told the <em>Financial Times</em>
in January:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Our
summer analysis suggested that a fair fuel stabiliser would be likely
to make the public finances less stable rather than more
stable.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
Institute for Fiscal Studies agreed with the chair of the OBR and said
before the Budget:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
claim that the Treasury receives a windfall gain when oil prices rise

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It would not
be a surprise if the Government had to scrabble around quickly for a
new policy on fuel duty after we raised all those points in the House
in March. Can the Minister tell us at what point the Government decided
to abandon their promise to cut fuel duty when prices rose? What
policy-making process did the Government go through to come up with
their new fair fuel stabiliser mechanism? If the Minister cannot answer
those questions, people are likely to assume that the new fair fuel
stabiliser was a flustered response to criticism from our side of the
House, from their own constituents, and from organisations such the
Federation of Small Businesses, which Government Members are usually
only too keen to listen to and to cite in support of their
arguments.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000049">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have spoken
about why the new fair fuel stabiliser is not a stabiliser, and I want
to speak about why it is not fair. As we discussed last year, the
Government decided that benefits, tax credits and public service
pensions would be uprated in line with the consumer prices index in
future, and that private pension schemes could also switch to CPI
indexation. The CPI is typically around 1.5 percentage points lower
than the retail prices index, and there can be no doubt that that in
itself is a huge cut in the incomes of all working people and families.
This year’s Budget report estimates that the decision will take
£10.6 billion pounds from people by 2014-15. A further
£500 million will be taken from people who receive housing
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
year, the Government announced that thresholds and allowances for
direct taxes would also be uprated in future in line with the consumer
prices index, instead of the retail prices index as currently, with
some exceptions. That will take another £1 billion from people
by 2014-15. As we noted earlier, the Government have opted to increase
excise duties in line with the RPI, not the CPI. They have attempted to
argue on most fronts that CPI is a better or more accurate measure of
inflation, yet they have applied the change only when it represents a
gain for the Exchequer, and a loss for working families.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have declined to make the switch to CPI when it would help
working families, and that will inevitably lead people to wonder
whether it is in fact not a principled change but just a cynical
long-term stealth tax. If their aim was really a fair stabiliser
mechanism and if it was really aimed at helping with the cost of
living, as the Prime Minister said, perhaps the Minister will tell us
why the fair fuel stabiliser uses the RPI, and not the supposedly more
accurate CPI to increase fuel duty. That is why we tabled the
amendment. It is our attempt to stabilise the price of fuel. If prices
continue to rise, there will not be an increase in fuel duty. It is a
moderate measure that does not go as far as the Conservative
party’s original promise to cut duty when prices rise. It would
simply cancel the planned
increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Unlike
the Government’s tax rises of 9p or 10p a litre on fuel, the
amendment could actually help working families and businesses. It would
be welcomed by working people and families who have seen their earnings
fall as they have taken pay cuts, or become unemployed and had their
benefits cut under this Government. Unlike the Government’s tax
rises on fuel, it could actually encourage growth and job creation in
the economy. It would be welcomed by businesses who have said that
rising fuel duty is the No. 1 threat to their businesses, and that they
have been put under severe strain by this Government’s rises in
VAT and fuel duty. Unlike the Government’s tax rises on fuel, it
is a mechanism that could actually help to stabilise the price of fuel,
which is what they said they wanted to do. In short, this amendment may
be only a moderate measure, but unlike the Government’s tax
rises on fuel, it could actually be called a fair fuel
stabiliser.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000053">&#160;</a>

the amendment. It is

			Column number: 208<a class="bkMark" name="Column208">&#160;</a>
                           </div>perhaps worth starting by saying that the Budget brought immediate
action to cut fuel duty, however small that cut, and not to put in
place the 5p rise. We have heard the argument that fuel prices rose by
3p because of the VAT rise, but if we bear in mind the 5p by which it
was due to rise, there is an overall reduction, and it is disingenuous
to suggest that we did not cut fuel prices. They have been cut in the
realm that we were
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
leads on to the debate about how to pay for such a cut in fuel duty,
which is not cheap. I believe—I am sure that my hon. Friend the
Minister will correct me if I am wrong—that every penny we cut
from fuel duty costs the Exchequer £500 million. We cannot
afford to cut it and worry about it
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
money has been put on to North sea oil, and I do not buy the argument
about investment being cut and jobs being put at risk. There are some
40,000 jobs relating to the increase in the taxation of oil. In 2006,
the oil companies put together their investment plans for the next
couple of decades based on an oil price of $66 a barrel; earlier today
the price was $111 a barrel. Everything above that price is
straightforward profit and does not affect investment decisions that
were made at the lower

household facts on the price of fuel. It is roughly costing an extra
£10 to fill up a small family car such as a Ford Focus. Even
with the VAT rise taken into account, there is a saving of some
£26 on filling up the car under the reduction that we have made
in fuel duty, which is some progress. I will return to that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000063">&#160;</a>

the argument—indeed, it has been made this afternoon—that
high fuel prices feed into transport on the buses, which leads to
problems. As far as I am aware, private bus companies can reclaim their
VAT, so the VAT rise, which is often put forward as the Government not
cutting fuel duty because they raised VAT at the same time, is a
nonsensical argument for the increase in the cost of travelling by bus,
because the bus companies would be able to claim that VAT
back.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000064">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention, because it leads on to a wider point about the cost of
fuel. I agree that there has been a 2.5% rise in VAT, and naturally
that works its way through. It is difficult to prove a negative, so the
fact that we did not install the 5p a litre rise that was due to take
place means that, in effect, we have cut the price of fuel even with
the rise in VAT. What is important and what is talked about by my
constituency—I have a semi-rural constituency with areas that
have poor bus services or that cannot be served—and what is also
one of the key issues is the fact that the fuel price is high. That
fuel price is high because of the oil price, which, for several
reasons, is also high.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000066">&#160;</a>

other issues that the Government and others are looking at, and
situations vary from transport authority to transport authority. The

high oil price of $111 a barrel: is that a peak, or is it where we
stay? There is a huge debate about whether we have reached peak oil. Is
the production of oil coming out of the ground as large as it will ever
get? At $111 a barrel, the exploration of other fields suddenly becomes
far more economical. Looking back to 1998, we were dealing with an oil
price of $5 a barrel, and a lot of decisions about the North
sea—when people were discussing North sea oil running
out—were made then.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000069">&#160;</a>

on a price of $66 a barrel, decisions were also made on investments. It
is estimated by geologists that there is as much oil in the North sea
now as has already been taken out—it is just that it is only now
becoming economical, after reaching $66 a barrel. I do not believe that
the oil price will fall very far below $100 a barrel.
Whether or not we believe that peak oil has been reached, oil traders
decide on the price of oil, and if they decide that the price of oil
now really is at that level, we are looking at a different framework
and a different market.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000070">&#160;</a>

detrimental effect that some doomsayers are suggesting. This is pure

no benefit at all. The duty on fuel has been cut by 6p. Having a 5p
rise this April was factored into the Budget. That was
delayed—it has not happened—and a further penny was cut.
There has been a significant cut, which outweighs the 3p rise that came
about through the VAT rise.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000073">&#160;</a>

there was a cut in the cost of fuel as a result of the
Government’s measures this year. VAT is going up 3p a litre and
there is a 1p cut in fuel duty, which, in my book, is a 2p rise. I
think that is a rise in fuel duty, not a cut. If I have missed

is exactly my point: it is difficult to prove a negative. The figures
in the Budget were based around a 5p rise in fuel duty from this April.
If one takes off the 5p and our 1p, and adds 3p on the VAT, there is
still a

negative, but these figures were in the Budget. They were there to have
and move forward. It has been a significant cut in the fuel duty to
where it was supposed to be. I agree with the point that the hon.

3p; means a net reduction of 3p. The key fact is that if 3p had not
been put on to fuel by the VAT increase, the Government might not have
needed to ask the oil and gas companies for billions of pounds, and
might not have needed to reduce the tax on fuel by
1p.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000078">&#160;</a>

misses the holistic view of the state of the national finances, and the
fact that we had to raise VAT. That was not something that we came into
government planning to do. Again, I do not want to go back down that
argument, with a to and fro across the hall. When the figures were
analysed, there was a need to raise the extra £12.5 billion a
year, which the Chancellor reluctantly did in that Budget. We have had
that debate and moved on. To cherry-pick on the point of VAT and fuel
tax, saying that we might not have had to do that, misses the overall
basis of the Budget. The economy was in dire straits—all parties
acknowledge that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000079">&#160;</a>

is a philosophical difference over whether to cut half the deficit or
all of it, and we have had that debate on the Floor of the House on
several occasions. Decisions had to be made. Indeed, the previous
Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr
Darling), had made it quite clear that he was looking to raise VAT to
19%. There is a very small difference in where this road would have
taken us. The fact is that a decision was made that cut the fuel price.
The fact that the fuel price has not gone down has everything to do
with oil prices, and leads us to look into further
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000080">&#160;</a>

Member for Bristol East made about the environmental consequences. I
want to bring in, as close as I can within the realms of the debate,
the effects of some of the options that have been looked at to try to
reduce environmental consequences. When fuel duty is cut there is the
risk of people saying it will have a devastating environmental
consequence. There will also be a push for more biofuel. That is
something we should be careful of. There is a lot of evidence coming
forward that biofuel actually produces 25% more CO<p class="Sub">2 </p>than it
takes out of the atmosphere, due to the manufacturing of the
fertilisers and so on that go into growing the corn. There is a
definite continental split on this between north and south America and
Africa. In north and south America there is huge environmental damage
due to deforestation and growing of plants for biofuel, whereas in
Africa it is causing a real problem of starvation. It is becoming a
morally corrupt fuel to push forward on to the market when we are
changing a food source into fuel. The upshot is that the more corn is
used to produce biofuel, the more expensive it becomes to produce. It
is one of the only businesses in the world where scaling up costs more
money and becomes less economic.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000081">&#160;</a>

reason I brought that into this debate is because I think it paints a
picture of where we go overall with renewables into our fuel streams,
and whether the taxation on petrol pump fuel—whether it contains
biofuel or not—is in the long term sustainable. Started by a
Conservative Government and carried through by the Labour Government,
over the past couple of decades there have been significant increases
in the taxation on pump fuel. Whether that was done to balance what was
then a £46 billion gap in the economy in the mid-1990s or, as
the former Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and
Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown), said at the time, for environmental issues,
there was a large increase in taxation on fuel, to the huge benefit of

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct.
Cellulosic ethanol fuel is starting to come online, and is used in the
part of the plant that is not actually using the food. It represents
such a tiny amount of biofuel that it does not have an impact at the
moment. It is indeed the way forward. Perhaps one of the biggest
indications of where markets will go in the future is where capital
venture firms put their money. Silicon valley is now putting more into
renewables, especially into biofuels and other such areas, than they
ever did in the dotcom boom. We are talking about trillions of pounds
being invested in that area because they see a huge mark-up return. At
the moment, the vast majority of the plant matter used for biofuels is
from food crop, but the hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. Some
plants are starting to go online with cellulosic ethanol and we hope
that that will move forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My argument,
to bring it into the bounds of the amendment, is about how much duty is
placed on fuel. We have these conversations and we move forward. I
heard on the radio this morning that it is estimated that 2 million
electrically-powered vehicles will be on the road by 2020. There will
begin to be a decline in the amount of pump petrol that needs to be
bought from the petrol station, whether that is biofuel or petrol.
Therefore, the Government—all Governments—need to start
thinking about whether high taxation on fuel will cause a big gap in
the country’s budget in the long

means that there will be fewer cars on the road using traditional
fuels. Overall, I think that the number of motorists on the road, the
number of people owning cars, and the number of households owning more
than one car, is set to increase. I do not know if the hon. Gentleman

intervention. This is a debate that we could be having right now on the
Floor of the House in the carbon budget debate. It is my
belief—a political philosophy, if you will—that the
closer electric cars become to being as good as internal combustion
engines, and the nearer they get in price, the more likely the
population will be to migrate to them rather than internal combustion
cars, not least because they are so much more efficient. Never mind the
price of electricity compared with petrol; the combustion engine is
only 25% efficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000090">&#160;</a>

time. I share his enthusiasm for electric cars. Sunderland has a Nissan
plant that is leading the way in the development of electric cars.
However, the Government must address several key issues to ensure that
they have mass-market appeal and do not necessarily lead to a
short-term knock-on reduction in the number of regular motor vehicles
on the road. Infrastructure is needed in the form of charging points.
The Government must also ensure that the electricity is sourced from
clean supplies. Numerous key issues must be addressed to ensure that
electric vehicles are taken up as I am sure he and I both wish them to
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000091">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree fully. A large infrastructure is
needed, but in a way, that makes my overall point. The Government must
consider what infrastructure is needed to make electric cars a viable
product on the road. At the same time, if they are moving towards a
mass change from petrol to electricity in powering motor vehicles, they
must recognise that the amount of petrol bought at the pump will
decrease, as will the amount of duty that they gain from the sale of
fuel. Therefore, they need to resist the temptation to carry on taxing
fuel further, because within the next couple of decades, it could
create a huge hole in Government finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000092">&#160;</a>

vehicles, though, is it not more likely that hybrid vehicles will be
much more prevalent on the roads of Britain? They will continue to
consume petrol, but at a reduced rate. I understand that a French
manufacturer proposes to introduce a car to the market next year with a
mileage of about 140 miles per gallon. It is a half-electric, half
petrol-driven vehicle. That is an interesting stepping-stone to the
all-out electric vehicle of the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000093">&#160;</a>

average mileage of 40 mpg to cars with 140 mpg. The knock-on effect is
that people will buy less petrol, so less money will come to the
Exchequer. We are starting to move in a direction that means that we do
not need to make such hikes in the price of fuel. Maybe some
inflationary hikes will occur, but we must be careful about how much we

reduce, or not carry on increasing, our reliance on fuel taxation,
because it will give a diminishing tax return in the long run.
Especially now that oil prices are so high, which feeds into a high
price at the pump, we have an opportunity to change the habits of
Government. In the past 20 years, Conservative and Labour Governments
have used fuel as a cash cow to bring in a lot of duty to the

from an engineering background; before I came here I was a mechanical
engineer with the university of Leeds and I take an interest in these
issues. As we move into perhaps the next century, nuclear fusion may be
the way forward, but we are not there yet. Indeed, if we get nuclear
fusion, we could feed all the waste products from nuclear fission into
that and we would move forward. It is quite right that we have to get
the energy from somewhere, but we move
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000102">&#160;</a>

would like to make a final point on biofuels, which involves a very
important statistic that I think Members should bear in mind. For every
10,000 square metres of soya beans grown to create biodiesel, there is
a 700,000 kg release of CO<p class="Sub">2</p>. It would take 300 years just to
cancel that out, so, from an environmental point of view, what are we
achieving? There are also all those knock-on consequences that I

to close before I get my legs chopped off by the Whip, fuel prices
obviously have a wide impact in our society—a point that is
taken seriously by Members in all parts of the House. There has been
the odd flippant comment, and I know that this has been an excitable
debate at times, this afternoon and this morning. We have gone at each
other on budgetary and philosophical points of view, but I think that
everyone in this room feels very much that it is a problem. High fuel
prices have a genuine effect on people’s lives and how they move
forward. There is the knock-on effect on the price of our food in
supermarkets. The inflationary CPI rise that came out today is a direct
consequence of the rising fuel price. There has been a 17% rise in oil
in the last quarter. That is something that no Government would have
predicted, or indeed legislated for, but it does not mean that it is
not right to make even the smallest of moves forward. That smallest
move forward was to cancel out the 5p rise and cut it by a further
penny. Those do not sound like big figures, but they make the
difference. We are trying to move forward. I do not agree with the
shadow Minister’s amendment because,

things that the hon. Gentleman said. He made the point over and over
again about the non-increase of 5p. Through the ingenious use of spin,
he is trying to claim it as a cut, but it could only be a cut if the
increase had actually happened. We can question whether there was ever
an intention to have an increase of 5p, but the reality is that it
never happened. The only cut that ever happened, therefore, was the 1p,
not the 5p he claims. The 3p increase in VAT more than offsets the 1p
cut. There was, therefore, a 2p increase in the cost of fuel. I know
from talking to many people in my constituency the impact that that
rise in the cost of fuel has had, and the impact that the overall high
price continues to have, whether for businesses, commuters or families,
in these tough
times.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000107">&#160;</a>

want to spend a little more time on the subject of VAT. I remember only
too well the incoming Conservative Government of 1979, who increased
VAT from 8% to 15% despite a promise not to do so. The economy
struggled greatly as a result of the increase in prices, and families
suffered grievously as a result. Unemployment went over 3 million for
the first
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000108">&#160;</a>

the run-up to the 1992 election, Prime Minister John Major promised not
to increase VAT, too. He promptly went back on that promise and
increased VAT. Earlier, we discussed the impact of the recession of the
early 1990s, and my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South rightly
made the point that if we compare the recent recession with that one,
whether it is measured by unemployment, business repossessions or home
repossessions, the figures for the recent recession are roughly half
those of the early 1990s. Those figures are testimony to the fact that
the outgoing Labour Government ensured that families, jobs and homes
were protected, despite a much deeper recession than the one of the
early
1990s.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000109">&#160;</a>

Gentleman has in mind when he raises the spectre of Governments past.
We can talk at length about the recessions of the ’80s and
’90s, when Tory Governments clobbered working families as they
wiped out industry—they destroyed the mining industry—and
did nothing for the communities laid waste as a result. If he wants, I
would be happy to discuss that with him long into

                        <p class="tabbed">The 2p
increase in the cost of fuel has had a dramatic effect, not least on my
constituents. Of those in work, 40% either run their own businesses or
are self-employed, and they feel the impact of fuel costs deeply. The
proposal in the amendment would be helpful, because it attempts to make
the impact of fuel price rises much fairer than what would be achieved
by the Bill’s current proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000115">&#160;</a>

stabiliser is not a stabiliser, and it goes back on the promise made by
the Prime Minister before the election, when he said that should the
petrol price go up, tax should come down. It is extremely regrettable
that that pledge, along with the VAT promise, has been broken, and that
hard-working families and businesses in my constituency are suffering
as a result. As I have said, 40% of my working constituents are
employed in small businesses or are self-employed; another 40% work in
the public sector. The economy of Sefton, and of Merseyside and the
north-west, will suffer greatly from job losses in the public sector
and from the knock-on effect on those small businesses. They need to be
the engine of growth in a recovery, but a growth strategy is missing
from the Government’s fuel proposal and from the Budget in
general.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000116">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As you are my favourite Chair, I cannot help
myself, Mr. Hood. My hon. Friend is making a very important
point, because he is highlighting an attack on consumer confidence.
Although the hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell suggests that many
companies, particularly small business, can claim VAT back on fuel, it
is the hit on consumer confidence that lowers business expectations.
That means that any VAT increase or increase in fuel price hits
consumer confidence very hard.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> That is absolutely right. It is the combination
of a lack of consumer confidence and the inability to spend money that
is the problem. For example, 1,000 jobs have gone from Sefton council;
that is equivalent to a significant number of families, and it is the
main breadwinners who have lost their jobs. That means they have lost
the ability to spend money in the local economy. Hundreds of jobs are
also under threat in the local HMRC, and those people spend money in
the local economy and local small businesses rely on their
custom.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have
mentioned the impact on businesses and families. That is an indicator
of the lack of a growth strategy. The problem with the cuts is that
impact, but also the speed at which they are being carried out. Cutting
the jobs so fast and taking that vast amount of money out of the
economy makes it very difficult for businesses to grow and to create
the jobs to replace those lost in the public sector. All the measures,
including that relating to fuel, contribute, by their effect in
reducing growth, to the economy’s inability to
grow.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, with more people out of work and more businesses struggling,
less money is being paid in tax to the Exchequer, so there is less
ability to pay down the deficit. Again, the problem is that although
Government Members say that they want to pay the deficit off, the
reality is that their approach does not even achieve that, because of
the reduction in money flowing into the Exchequer through low or slow
growth. As we have seen, during the last six months that were reported
on, the economy
flatlined.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000122">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us consider the impact on the oil industry. That industry was extremely
concerned about the Government’s decision to target oil
companies. Oil and Gas UK—the representative body—has
said that the
Budget<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000123">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
uncertainty caused by the Government is already harming a key area of
business investment. Statoil, for example, has postponed more than $10
billion of investment in the UK, according to the <em>Financial Times
</em>of 29 March. Oil and Gas UK also described the
announcement as a shock and said that it would damage investor
confidence and make many companies question whether the UK was an
appropriate destination for their
investment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000125">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman and the Opposition Front Benchers once and for all.
The logic is that they implicitly voted against the things that they do
not like, such as the VAT rise that went through and the North sea oil
tax that has funded the motoring package, because they voted against
the Budget. Does that same logic mean that they voted against the
motoring package that included a fuel duty cut, which had the support
of motorists throughout the country? Does it mean that they voted
against the rise in annual mileage allowance payments? Or is that
somehow
different?<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000131">&#160;</a>

have heard the concerns of the oil and gas industry about the Budget
and the potential damage caused to growth by Budget measures such as
the fuel duty. I regularly talk to businesses in my constituency, and I
have previously mentioned small construction firms in Committee. They
are extremely worried about the rise in fuel prices and their ability
to remain competitive, because they have to look at their costs all the
time. The rise in fuel prices has had a huge impact on profit margins
at a time when price is absolutely crucial for those who are still able
to bid for private sector contracts or for public sector contracts.
There are not as many public sector contracts as there were, with the
cut of Building Schools for the Future, to name only one massive cut,
and the impact of that on the economy. With today’s inflation
figures, such firms are under huge pressure. We need measures to help
business, such as the idea proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Bristol East in her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000135">&#160;</a>

which is about 10 miles from the centre of Liverpool, some people
commute—often by car—into Liverpool or further afield to
Manchester. They have found that the cost of motoring has gone

                           </div>through the roof. That will be familiar; I see a Government Member
agreeing. There is huge pressure on people; the cost of commuting has
made some question whether they can keep their jobs, or whether they
should look for alternative employment. There is also an impact on
families, who are asking whether they can keep the family
car.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000136">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Discussion of
the amendment helps us to understand the Government’s approach
to inflation, which has risen to 4.5% today. In his letter to the
Chancellor, the Governor of the Bank of England again cites the VAT
rise as a contributory factor to the rise, as well as fuel prices. I
have said before in the House that inflation matters, not because I am
an inflation hawk who thinks that there is a philosophical economic
injustice in the presence of inflation in our economy, but because of
the practical damage that it can do. By introducing the VAT rise
and—to refer to the amendment—by not tackling fuel price
and duty issues, the Government risk building inflationary expectations
into our economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000140">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have
learned today that people are expecting inflation to keep on rising,
which is damaging for business investment. At a whole-economy level,
inflation is rising, fuel prices are going up, and VAT is being added
to fuel. People want reassurance that the Government will tackle that
situation. They need to feel that the Government are in control and
that the economic architecture is set up to enable the Monetary Policy
Committee to deal with inflation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In the
partnership between the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of
England, the Governor must openly give reasons that we can all
understand for not meeting the Chancellor’s target, and the
Chancellor must respond to them. Does the Economic Secretary think that
we should give people more stability about what they can expect from
fuel prices, which is the aim of the amendment? I think that that is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000142">&#160;</a>

leniency and advice. I want to help the hon. Member for Elmet and
Rothwell to understand the point that I am making. The big impact that
inflation and the price of fuel are having right now, and the issue of
why stable fuel prices are so important, relate to fairness, how people
are feeling and what their lives are like right now. As much as I love
a good chat about quantitative easing and the macro-picture, what
really matters to people is their ability to have a decent quality of
life for their families. We must acknowledge that wages are being held
down in this country. Six out of 10 adults recently said that they have
not had any form of salary increase, which is what we would expect as
we come out of a
recession.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
private sector is nervous. The public sector has been told, “You
will not give anybody a wage increase, apart from the people at the
very bottom end of the public sector pay scale.” The Government
have told us that nobody is to receive a wage increase at all. That is
having a massive impact as people face price increases in shops. I am
sure members of the Committee have knocked on doors in their
constituencies in recent weeks and months and heard that
people’s biggest concern today is the prices in the
shops.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000147">&#160;</a>

would have a huge effect. Members of the Committee may remember that
shift workers at Vauxhall Motors in Ellesmere Port, near my
constituency, were one of the first groups of workers to negotiate
reduced hours to keep their workplace going. That is why our approach
to the recession was more successful than that in previous recessions,
because we encouraged collaboration. The

because of their reduced hours, but there was a sense of trying to get
through difficult circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000150">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> One of the key issues that my hon. Friend
highlights is the inflationary pressures on food and commodities, and a
major part of that is the increase in fuel. If we do not agree to the
amendment, fuel prices will increase because of Government action, and
the price of everything that is attached to the delivery of goods will
increase, so constituents will pay more in the long
run.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000151">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is right. Those things are all connected.
Unfortunately, the net result of the measures that we are discussing is
that consumer finances are really stretched. I have here a
moneysupermarket.com survey that says that 22% of Brits have already
reached their “affordability tipping point”, as my hon.
Friend just remarked, and can no longer make ends meet. We must
acknowledge what has happened in the past year. We have gone from a
situation where people could work fewer shifts because the economy was
growing; they felt that as the economy grew, they would step up more,
and the Government would do that work with them. Now the Government
have whacked more VAT on the prices in the shops and there is a
cavalier approach to cutting from local councils and other public
services, which means that people face the difficult decision of
whether to take voluntary redundancy when their chances of getting
another job are slim. They will probably never get as good a pay off
again, but how do they cope when prices in the shops are going up?
People have difficult choices. According to moneysupermarket.com,
household disposable incomes are set to fall by a further £780
in the coming
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000152">&#160;</a>

squeeze on the incomes of honest working families. Whether lower income

is absolutely right. I will come on to talk about why fuel prices are
key to my constituents’ disposable income and their general
quality of life, but I want to come back briefly to the point that we
cannot have this discussion in a vacuum, without understanding what
else is going on in people’s lives. Interest rates are low at
the moment, which has held down people’s housing costs to a
certain extent, depending on their personal circumstances. If it were
not for that, people would be finding life extremely difficult. The
vast majority of people—that vast bulk in the middle of the
income distribution range—have not seen their incomes rise over
the past year, but prices have shot up. The challenge for the
Government now is to tackle that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is an attempt to probe that question and ask what we can do for people
who face such uncertainty. What does the Minister think should be done
to assist that bulk of people, who feel that they work hard—I am
sure that they do—but who see prices going up and up and their
real quality of life falling, and who wonder when the Government will
step in and offer them some assistance? As my hon. Friend the

                           </div>Member for Sefton Central remarked, not only are the inflationary
expectations that we are building into our economy harming business
prospects, but people are finding these times very difficult. It is a
struggle, and they are wondering whether it is really fair for them to
bear so much of the burden. It feels as though a lot of the burden has
been shifted on to people on the most moderate incomes. That is not the
right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are people in my constituency who will be particularly affected by the
measure. It is not the same everywhere in the country, which is not to
say that there are not particular problems elsewhere; it is just that
they are different. I feel it is right to stand up for my constituents
and the issues that they face. In Wirral and Merseyside, we have a fair
number of shift workers, because a higher percentage of our economy is
made up of manufacturing. We also have a lot of health care workers. We
have specialist cancer services in Wirral South, and staff travel from
a fair distance, but many live locally. Working shifts means that it is
highly unlikely that people can use public transport to get to work.
Their quality of life is therefore extremely sensitive to the fuel
price. We have to be realistic here about the importance of getting the
duty on fuel right for those people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Brecon and Radnorshire mentioned, people have kept their
side of the bargain. Many have worked fewer shifts to try to help their
workplace keep going. We must try to do right by them and keep our side
of the bargain. We need to understand that if someone is a shift
worker, they almost certainly drive to work. Perhaps they share a car,
and I know of some factories that provide minibuses, but by and large
people drive to work. It is important to stand up for such people, who
are working long hours.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000157">&#160;</a>

making an extremely good point about shift workers, which is relevant
in my constituency for exactly the same reason; it is on the other side
of the river. Is she aware that the Chancellor has just admitted on
Channel 4 that growth has been flat over the past six months? That will
have an impact on workers, including the shift workers whom she has

                           </strong> That is an important point, because if growth is
flat and people wonder what the prospects are for our economy, feeling
that impact every time they go to the petrol station makes life
difficult and builds a perception of gloom about our economy. That is
why consumer confidence is down, and the net effect of that is to hurt
retail and investment. That negative spiral in our economy makes it
much harder to argue for investment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000159">&#160;</a>

wringer in the ’80s and early ’90s, but we have broken
through, and the Liverpool city region is really quite successful. We
have had a much better recession than any of the gloom and doom
merchants expected. As his constituency is across the river from mine,
my hon. Friend knows that fuel price is significant, as it plays into
consumer confidence, which leads people to think about their life and
ask, frankly, whether it is worth sticking around in Merseyside, and
whether there is anything going for them. Consumer

and to the success of our city region not only next year—though
it will be key next year—but for the next five or 10 years, so
my hon. Friend makes an important point. When people see their monthly
outgoings increasing and their income being held down, consumer
confidence is damaged. It is important, therefore, that we discuss the

place to live for anyone of any age, but we have a larger older
population than many areas, which means that we have a higher
population of carers and people with caring responsibilities. I am
constantly aware of the impact of fuel prices—and of the duty
that is or is not added—on carers. Frankly, if a person’s
mum rings up at 2 am to say that she has fallen out of bed or needs
medicine, they cannot say, “Hang on a minute, I will just check
if there is another option.” They have to have petrol in the car
to get round there. Carers do not have as many travel options as others

adult depend on them means that they need predictability. In order to

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I want to mention public transport alternatives. I am lucky in my
constituency, because there is a combination of suburban areas, on the
edges of Liverpool and Chester, with good public transport. However, as
I have mentioned, it is busy. Sometimes people feel that congestion
does not happen outside south-east England—and I know that this
is a north-south point—but anybody who has travelled between
Liverpool and Manchester, or on a peak-hour train into Liverpool, will
know that our rail network has a lot of congestion. It is not always
the best alternative for people. Not only do we need investment in
public transport, but we need to ensure that we are not loading costs
on to motorists. That is highly
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000165">&#160;</a>

motoring is incredibly important. Like my hon. Friend, my constituency
is covered by Merseytravel, and I echo her points about the rail
network not always being the best option. There are also problems
related to buses, because the bus service in parts of my constituency,
and I am sure that this is true in hers, is not always reliable.
Because of the scale of the cuts, we have lost

I was going to mention other parts of my constituency that are much
more rural, where the bus services are not fantastic, and where what
bus services they have are expensive. We need to offer people a choice
that enables them to make the decision that is best for both the
environment and their pocket, so that it feels like a win-win
situation. At the moment, we are offering people a lose-lose solution,
which will have a massive impact on consumer confidence. Unless the
Government are seen to be tackling some of the costs that people face,
not only when they fill their car up, but when they decide to travel by
bus, some people will feel that problems in the economy are being
loaded on to them, and not, by and large, on to those who are earning
average incomes in the middle—from £25,000, to when
people start to pay higher-rate tax. It will seem that there is no real
consideration about whether it is fair to constantly ask people to pay
higher prices in shops, when they have absolutely no ability to
increase their family’s real income. Nowhere does that
unfairness show itself more than with travel options, and in the prices
that people face at the pumps every day at the moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000167">&#160;</a>

disingenuous to say that the Government did not cut the fuel price.
Without re-entering the debate about whether it was 3p up, 2p down, or
1p the other way, although he might say that the Opposition are being
disingenuous, on the other hand, I invite him to go and ask people in
my constituency—in Heswall, Bebington, Bromborough or New

difficult to prove a negative, but there has been a reduction from the
Government of 6p in fuel duty. It may not seem so to the public, and
there is not a member of the public, including myself, who would not
agree that fuel prices are too high, but that is a consequence of the

chairmanship, Mr Hood. If we look at what influences inflation and the
day-to-day activities of businesses and individuals in an economy,
energy is the driving policy. The amendment, which was proposed by my
hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East, addresses that and takes the
Government’s lack of direction in energy in general head
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Yesterday,
the <em>Financial Times</em> led with an article on how Iraq’s
output goals for oil were not going to be met, which obviously bodes
badly for oil supplies in general. As we all know, however, scarcity of
oil creates inflation. The troubles in the middle east—Egypt,
Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and elsewhere—have added to the problems
with oil commodities. Also, post-Fukushima, the Japanese economy is,
for obvious reasons, moving much more towards liquefied gas and away
from nuclear. However, other policies unrelated to fuel duty are in
play here. In my area, we have the Ensus bioethanol plant, which, it
has just been announced, is going to close for approximately four
months, because of a lack of Government direction. We also have the
Teesside power station, which was recently half-mothballed. There is a
big energy problem, and Government policy seems to create more risk in
the market. Oil scarcity, as I said, increases inflation, but so does
VAT and so does fuel duty and so does a carbon floor price on
energy-intensive industry. All those factors are feeding into the
economy, creating uncertainty and adding more risk to the
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
we look at the economic effects, there are obvious public transport
issues, as has been highlighted earlier by my hon. Friends, but there
are also freight issues. If rolling stock is predominantly
diesel-powered, what effect will that have on the transportation of
goods from ports to stocking areas? That could be the supermarkets at
Teesport or the shipment of coke, iron ore or other basic commodities.
The hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell highlighted how we should see a
transition from, say, gas and oil to nuclear, and I agree. There is
broad consensus on the view that we need to move towards carbon-neutral
energy provision and to rely less upon foreign sources of fuel.
However, our food stocks are directly reliant on gas. Companies, such
as GrowHow in the Teesside area, use gas to produce agrichemicals,
which farmers buy and then use to grow our domestic crops, as well as
those abroad, so there is a direct link between gas and food. Nuclear
will not fill that gap. Gas will still be
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000173">&#160;</a>

want to ask the Ministers present what they think the effect will be on
small and medium-sized enterprises. This echoes an earlier debate on
what tax allowances and breaks SMEs will have, but if there is no basic
SME base, the big companies, which provide the amount of jobs necessary
to reduce unemployment and get an economy going, will not be attracted.
In Teesside, we have a strong oil industry presence in petrochemicals,
and those jobs will undoubtedly be affected by the Government’s
policy on the oil industry. That is coming not only from the trade
unions on site, but also from the managers, the company owners and
their shareholders. It does not just affect the oil industry
directly—whether

they have those same contracts in Corby and in Scotland. What will
happen to those contracts as this policy on the oil and gas industry
percolates through the economy? In my constituency, which is 55% rural,
from Guisborough and east Cleveland, stretching out to Boulby potash
mine, we have small businesses and a burgeoning tourism industry. What
will fuel duty do to those small start-up businesses? These are small
companies which are employing one or two people. What will fuel duty do
to those self-employed people in rural economies? Also, how does this
policy interact with the new, rural, privatised Royal Mail service? We
have a policy on the table in relation to Royal Mail, where supposedly
we will have a great share scheme for workers. How will fuel duty

However, I do believe that the fuel duty policy will have an effect on
rural economies and will undermine the viability of rural businesses
and services, such as rural post offices and the delivery of a rural
postal service. What we are looking at here is an economy in which
domestic demand is being deliberately reduced and taxes are going up,
while prices are going up and wages are going down. How would Ministers
describe that, according to their economic textbooks? Would they
describe that as an economy that has been doing well in the last six
months through policies such as this one on fuel duty, or would they
call that stagflation? I leave that open to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000179">&#160;</a>

do not own a car, so I have no personal interest in the price of fuel
duty. I do occasionally hire a car, and I have noticed how much it
costs to fill a petrol tank when I do so, but that is few and far
between, so I have only a very small personal interest in the value of
fuel and how much duty is placed upon it. I want to concentrate on the
impact on business in a region such as the north-east of England. My
hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland
talked about the impact on heavy industry in the sub-region of Teeside,
but I have had a lot of lobbying from small and medium-sized

fuel duty and how it impacts on businesses in a region such as this. I
also want to talk a little about the impact on working families and
those vulnerable people who rely on the mobility allowance to pay for

impact on their living standards and overall well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000181">&#160;</a>

particularly after he attempted to impose 14% inflation on the number
characters in a tweet. I want to concentrate on the stabilising
influence that the Government can have on the value of fuel, and how
that can then facilitate better business planning. In a European
context, as we try to grow out of recession, we have the highest fuel
duty, particularly for diesel, in the whole of the EU, significantly
higher than other countries. That has a negative impact on businesses
that we are relying on in growing our way out of the

of a stabilising influence on fuel, we cannot forget that prior to the
general election in 2010, the majority party in the current Government
said it would consult on the introduction of a fair fuel stabiliser,
which would cut fuel duty when oil prices rise and vice versa. That
would ensure that families, businesses and the whole British economy
were less exposed to volatile oil markets, and that there would be a
more stable environment for low-carbon investment. The junior partners
in the coalition in their manifesto proposed a rural fuel discount
scheme with a reduced rate of fuel duty in remote rural areas, as
allowed under EU law, and preparation for a system of road pricing to
be introduced in a second
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000183">&#160;</a>

proposals we have from the Government are a million miles away from
that. I am concerned about the prospects for growth in a region such as
the north-east of England, where there is a disproportionate impact of
fuel duty on the regional economy. In Opposition, the Prime Minister
made promises to keep down the cost of fuel duty by pledging to
introduce the fair fuel stabiliser. When his party launched the idea of
a fuel stabiliser in July 2008 it promised it would vary taxation on
fuel based on changes to petrol and diesel prices. The principle of the
plan was that when fuel prices went up, fuel duty would go down. That
commitment to the fair fuel stabiliser was expanded on and reaffirmed
by the Conservatives in their manifesto. The soon-to-be Prime Minister
went on about the fuel duty stabiliser in his speech on 28 April 2010
at the Coca-Cola plant in Morley. He

remote regions of England with regard to engagement in the main part of
the economy. That is the differential impact of fuel duty policy in the
English regions. An analysis of road freight statistics by the
North-East chamber of commerce demonstrates the extra burden that fuel
taxation places on businesses in the north-east of England. Each tonne
of freight brought into or out of the north-east delivers £4.16
in fuel taxes to the Exchequer, which is 18% higher than the average
for English regions of £3.52 and 74% higher than the average for
London. The analysis shows that there needs to be more careful
consideration of the economic impact of fuel duty rates on the regions,

                        <p>The Federation of Small
Businesses does not agree with that analysis. From its perspective a
fuel duty stabiliser is relatively simple to implement and could be
introduced within a matter of months. The concept could be
straightforward: when oil prices increase, the stabiliser would allow
Government to reduce duty to a lower limit; and when oil prices fall,
the Government would be able to raise duty to a higher
limit.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Critics
cite the difficulty of knowing whether fluctuations in oil prices are
temporary or are likely to persist beyond the near-term. It would be
difficult, therefore, for a fuel duty stabiliser to set duties
effectively. To counter volatility in the price of oil, a fuel duty
stabiliser would need to be based on official forecasts of the future
price of oil and adjusted at regular periods according to the actual
price.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a simple way of doing that. A fuel duty stabiliser should be based
on official forecasts of the oil price cycle, as advocated by the
economist Andrew Lilico. The oil price cycle is the long-term
prediction made by economists of the pattern of oil price fluctuations
over a period of time. Using the oil price cycle as a basis for a fuel
duty stabiliser, the level of fuel duty would be calculated against a
trend price for oil. It would then be adjusted following changes to the
official view of the oil price
cycle.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
have been criticisms, particularly from the Government. The Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, in responding to calls for the introduction
of a fuel duty stabiliser,
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
can’t sacrifice income willy
nilly.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>But
while we do not implement such a measure, businesses, particularly in
regions such as the north-east of England, are suffering because of the
high cost of fuel. As I have pointed out, that cost is high against
that of European competitors. When we are competing in international
markets for business, particularly in areas such as manufacturing, it
has a significant marginal impact on the cost of getting goods to
market and the prices that businesses can quote for their
goods.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If set
correctly, the fuel duty stabiliser could still be fiscally neutral for
the public finances and provide much needed economic stability for the
United Kingdom’s economy. In September 2010, the Office for
Budget Responsibility produced a report looking at the effect of oil
price increases on the economy, with a possible view to introducing a
fuel duty stabiliser. That report looked at the effect of oil price
increases over a four-year period and came to the conclusion that,
while the Government would receive extra revenue from increased oil
prices, that would be wiped out by other offsetting effects on the
economy, such as a contraction in economic output due to the high price
of oil. That analysis is correct, but it fails to take account of the
flexibility afforded by a stabiliser based on the oil price cycle,
which would make it fiscally
neutral.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Critics
fail to take account of the wider economic damage that high fuel prices
have on the economy as a whole. In spring, the International Energy
Agency warned that high oil prices are becoming a threat to the
economic recovery of OECD nations—of which the UK is
part—due to its effect on national and personal budgets. The
current high price of fuel and the lack of mid to

                           </div>long-term certainty over future prices means that our economy is being
hit hard, at a time when we can ill afford it. Recent research by the
Federation of Small Businesses shows that 62% of companies said they
will have to increase prices if fuel costs continue to rise. One in 10
small businesses said they will lay off staff, and some 26% said they
will freeze wages. That is a huge concern, because unemployment has
reached 2.5 million. We have already seen a differential impact on
unemployment, where unemployment nationally has fallen 17,000, but in
the north-east it has risen by 11,000, in a relatively small area in
terms of overall
population.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Small
businesses are not able to absorb the cost of fuel price increases like
big business and they are being badly hurt by the current prices.
Perhaps more than the high price of fuel, it is the uncertainty over
future fuel costs that stops small businesses from being able to plan
effectively and grow their business into the future. A measure to
stabilise fuel duty would give the certainty and stability the
UK’s 5 million small businesses need to factor fuel costs into
their business expansion plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A fuel duty
stabiliser or a stabilising effect could increase the stability of the
public finances. Further to that, the introduction of a stabilising
measure would also give more certainty to the state of public
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000200">&#160;</a>

rise in inflation impacts on people’s living standards and leads
to wage increase demands, turning what could be a temporary impact of
high oil prices into inflationary pressure on the economy. A
stabilising measure would iron out the knock-on effects of inflation
due to increases in the price of oil and act as a brake on inflation,
limiting the damaging effect inflation has on our economy. In December
2010, inflation rose to 3.7%, the highest increase in the cost of
living for eight months. That was largely due to the 2.8% rise in the
cost of
fuel.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000201">&#160;</a>

duty is, in theory, an environmental tax that can play a vital role in
reducing carbon emissions by encouraging a shift towards low-emission
vehicles and alternative forms of transport. The impact of fuel prices

plan ahead and factor environmental costs into medium and long-term
plans. I have taken enough of the Committee’s time, Mr Hood, but

my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East pointed out, many families

many steps taken to make our buses and trains more accessible, public
transport remains a more difficult option. As has been stated, families
are facing inflation at a rate of 4.5% on the consumer

The point made by the hon. Member for Walthamstow is very interesting;
a loss to budgets of, say, £100 would cause real hardship. That
is why the Government have brought in a whole range of measures to
ensure that we keep interest rates low. Surely the hon. Member for

rates—to what would still be an historic low—would have a
devastating effect on people’s mortgage payments and so on, and

terms of GDP percentage, is as high as some of those European countries
whose interest rates have risen far higher than ours to handle it. We
have managed to keep a sustainable low interest rate because we have a
credible plan. The VAT rise is regrettable, as is any tax rise, but it
is part of the holistic plan that has ensured that interest rates stay
low. We must not cherry-pick arguments when talking about the impact on
families, because if we moved on to some of the suggestions made then
it might just be offset by a rise in interest rates elsewhere as debt
became more

more people into taxis, which is a great cost and hardship to families

made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead about buses. We
used to have an incredibly popular bus service in south Yorkshire for
which, through the vision of the then South Yorkshire county council,
we managed to keep prices down so demand was very high, but all that
ended with the actions of the previous Conservative Government in
1986.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000223">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Anxieties
about fuel duty led the Conservative party in opposition to make
incredibly clear promises to the people of this country. The launch of
the fuel duty stabiliser as a policy back in July 2008 was absolutely
clear. The Conservative party document said that when fuel prices go
up, fuel duty would fall and when fuel prices go down, fuel duty would
rise. There were clear expectations given to people at that time with
the claim that if a fair fuel stabiliser had been introduced in the
2008 Budget, fuel would be 5p per litre cheaper. The hon. Member for
Elmet and Rothwell shared with us earlier the nuances between
Opposition promises and Opposition plans, but nevertheless, that policy
was rolled out with a clear spin that suggested to the people of this
country that there would be tough action on fuel prices. The Press
Association marked the launch of the policy with the headline,
“Tories vow to slash fuel duty.” That was the issue at
the heart of the offer made by the Opposition to the people of this
country at the general election.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000224">&#160;</a>

inflation-only increase in fuel duty if average pump prices in December
are higher than during the week of the Budget. It appears that the
Opposition, having set out their stall against it, are now calling for
the introduction of a form of fair fuel stabiliser. As we have made
clear, the Budget announced the introduction of a fair fuel stabiliser
to replace the previous Government’s fuel duty escalator, which
could have resulted in average pump prices being 6p per litre higher
than they currently
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000232">&#160;</a>

why we took the action we did to support motorists at this time of
record pump prices. There is no doubt that the cost of fuel is a real
concern to many families and businesses, as we have heard. It is
incredibly disheartening when every time people go to the pump to fill
their tank prices seem to have gone up again. As I pointed out in the
Committee of the whole House, the Government recognise that the rising
price of petrol has become an increasingly significant part of
day-to-day spending. When shocks such as the

Government listen, consider and respond. The steps we have taken have
been welcomed by business; by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, for example, and by Professor Stephen Glaister and the
Federation of Small Businesses, which said that “the stabiliser
is welcomed.” The hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East
Cleveland specifically mentioned the fact that we need to support small
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000233">&#160;</a>

above-inflation increases in 2012, 2013 and again in 2014. None of

movements. The Labour Government could have introduced the mechanism
outlined in the amendment, or a fair fuel stabiliser, as we called for

should also point out that over the last year, one big help for
families throughout the country has been that the national Government
have worked with local government to deliver a council tax freeze, at
the very time people need it most. We are therefore supporting families
across the country to tackle the cost of living.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000241">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">From the
beginning, the coalition Government have actively looked at how to ease
the burden on motorists. We have brought forward a £1.9 billion
package, cancelled the previous Government’s fuel duty escalator
and introduced a fair fuel stabiliser. We have acted to ensure that
there will be no fuel duty increases this year, and we cut fuel duty by
1p a litre from 6 pm on Budget day. The Opposition have no practical
alternatives to offer. An average haulier will benefit by approximately
£1,700 this year as a result of the measures in the Budget,
which the Opposition have said they were happy to vote against. The
Budget also raised approved mileage allowance payments rates from 40p
to 45p a mile, which is the first such increase since
2002.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the time I have left, I will turn to the substance of the amendment.
The Opposition are calling for the January inflation-only increase in
duty to be cancelled, but last week they failed to offer support for
the fuel duty cut, which is a totally inconsistent position. If the
stabiliser were based on average pump prices, as the amendment appears
to suggest, that could work against motorists, because retailers might
have an incentive to keep prices higher, even if they could afford to
reduce them, to avoid paying an increase in fuel duty. The Opposition
have again failed to say how they would pay for cancelling the
inflationary increase in fuel duty. Where would the £1 billion
come from? They failed to vote for increasing the supplementary charge,
and they want to reduce VAT on petrol, even though it is illegal. They
are making more unfunded promises, yet they still have no credible
plans to deal with the debts that they created, or to support
motorists.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
clauses 19 and 20, we have recognised the impact that record pump
prices are having on motorists and 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>businesses. We are a Government who listen and help. We have made sure
that there will be no fuel duty rise this year. We cancelled the fuel
duty escalator when the oil price was high. We acted on Budget day by
making a 1p a litre cut in fuel duty. We have rejected VAT proposals
that are illegal and could take six years to come into effect. We
introduced a fair fuel stabiliser that will support motorists when oil
prices are high. We have a real plan to support motorists while also
dealing with our debts. I recommend that the Committee reject the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000244">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have had a very thorough debate. It is a
shame that the Economic Secretary replied with such brevity, given the
contributions from both sides of the Committee. Only one Government
Back Bencher spoke, but he did so for about half an hour, while the
Economic Secretary spoke for about eight minutes, which is slightly out
of
kilter.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000245">&#160;</a>

completely reject the Economic Secretary’s interpretation of the
Labour party’s position on this issue. She has a rather strange
take on where we are coming from on many of the points discussed today.
I thought that I had made our position very clear in response to the
interventions during my speech. We may want to revisit the issue on
Report, but for the time being I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051862000246">&#160;</a>
