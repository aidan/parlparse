<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 25, in page 1, line 14, leave out `civilian' and insert `professional, technical, administrative and other'.--[Mr. Mallon.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following amendments: No. 21, in clause 3, page 2, leave out lines 23 to 35.
<P>
No. 22, in clause 3, page 2, line 38, leave out from `to' to end of line 40 and insert `the police force'.
<P>
No. 24, in clause 4, page 3, line 19, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6) No regulations under this section shall be made before the expiry of the period of three years beginning with the date on which this Act comes into force'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> When we adjourned I was dealing with points raised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis), who is not in his place. I attempted to explain that if people operate on the basis of suspicion, they will not listen to the reasoned arguments that I, as a Minister, have advanced or to the details of what we as a ministerial team with responsibilities for Northern Ireland are trying to achieve there.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said that the Secretary of State had written to the Police Authority for Northern Ireland more or less trying to stop it communicating with Members of Parliament. Perhaps it is worth while putting part of the letter, dated 4 February, on record. The concluding paragraph states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Finally, I found it reassuring to have clarified for me the Authority's welcome to much in the Police Bill. I found it somewhat disconcerting that at Second Reading various MPs had been briefed that the Authority was comprehensively opposed to its provisions, especially as I had no prior indication from you that this might be the case. It is unfortunate that such erroneous impressions appear to have been given; I noted the recent Newsletter article on the same lines with interest. I do hope that this is not to become a feature of the passage of this legislation. If this were to be the case, I am sure you will see how damaging it could be, not just to my efforts to strengthen the Police Authority and enhance its strategic and leadership roles, but also to the imaging of policing itself and to the stability of Northern Ireland society at a very testing time.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The gist of it was that the Secretary of State was clear, as I am, that we want proper discourse on the Bill, and want it to be dealt with in as open and as free a way as possible.
<P>
The Secretary of State had a meeting with the Police Authority on 20 January, and again made it clear that if its members had concerns they would be able to raise them through local Members of Parliament. There is no restriction on that. I said earlier that, as we are trying to operate openly and transparently, obvious Members of Parliament would be a conduit for complaints, but that the staff and the Police Authority for Northern Ireland have, effectively, open access when trying to get their views across.
<P>
I explained the implementation strategy that has been put in place to try to ensure the full engagement of all interested parties to handle the complexities, difficulties, uncertainties and concerns that can arise from this process of change. There is no need for unnamed sources, or for surreptitious briefing of local hon. Members, because we have a mechanism to try to ensure openness. If concerns remain despite the assurances that I am now giving and if the implementation strategy is felt inappropriate, local hon. Members will have the right to raise them with me or with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I hope that they show great willingness to do that. The process attempts to deal with the issues openly, which is why we do not feel it necessary to progress in the way that the amendments suggest.
<P>
I again assure the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) that we shall see how we can amend the Bill to take his serious point in amendment No. 25 into account, and that we hope to come back to it on Report. I hope that he will accept that assurance and will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and South Tyrone):</B> What the Minister said just before lunch and has imparted to us in the letter, part of which he has just read out, is one of the most amazing admissions that we have heard from him. An independent body such as the Police Authority does not require that sort of communication from the Minister or the Secretary of State. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether the letter came from the Secretary of State or from himself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> From the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> From the Secretary of State. It is intolerable, and it smacks of an arrogance that we have not experienced for some time, that the Secretary of State should write to an independent body, the Police Authority, setting out the basis on which it may communicate with Northern Ireland Members--and, indeed, with Members of Parliament on this side of the water. The idea that the chairman of the Police Authority should, by inference, be rapped over the knuckles by the Secretary of State bears out our suspicions, to which the Minister referred, that the Bill is an attempt to subvert the whole of the Royal Ulster Constabulary by denuding the independent cushion that is the Police Authority of its power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Ross (North-East Cambridgeshire):</B> We have heard a selective quote from the Secretary of State's letter to the Police Authority, so clearly part of that communication is in the public domain. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the Minister should publish the whole letter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It would be helpful. Indeed, it would be helpful if more and more of the Secretary of State's communications were published. I shall not go into other unfortunate expeditions that she has engaged in, such as her interference in the judicial process of the United States, but again and again we find that the Northern Ireland Office is employing little more than bullying tactics to get its own way. The Minister is no doubt surprised that some of us know what is going on. I assure him that we shall have one or two more surprises for him as the Bill progresses through the House.
<P>
This issue is, as another hon. Member would say, close to the heart of the matter that we are discussing. Will the police be able to operate with professional independence or will the Secretary of State, guided by her own advisers in the police division of the Northern Ireland Office, continue to claw unto herself control of the RUC?
<P>
It did not surprise me that the Minister took the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) to task for changing his mind. However, the hon. Gentleman was not one of the Ministers who was responsible for policing. The results of a period in opposition are wonderful. After 15 years in Parliament, I know that one gains a wider perspective from being in opposition than from sitting on the Front Bench and being totally dependent on an elite group for advice.
<P>
I admire the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire for acknowledging the folly of what the previous Government initially proposed. That proposal has been taken up by the Government, and it will undermine the confidence of Northern Ireland.
<P>
It surprised me that the Minister perceived no difference between civilians who are employed by an independent body, such as the Police Authority, and those who are employed by the Chief Constable. His failure to appreciate that difference shows that he has little understanding of the pressures that exist throughout the policing system in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh would like to remove the word ``civilian'' from subsection (2). I appreciate his point, but it is a useful word, which distinguishes those who until now have played a civil service role and, as members of the police establishment, are directly involved in policing. One has to live longer in Northern Ireland than the nine months the Minister has spent at the Northern Ireland Office to appreciate the way in which terrorists justify their activities and their offences against humanity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): My reason for tabling the amendment is not the reason that the hon. Gentleman attributes to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am not attributing anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> In a conference paper issued in September 1997, the Chief Constable described himself as ``a civilian public servant''. If that description is good enough for the Chief Constable, it is good enough for me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not disagree. Our police force is a civilian force. But no one knows better than the hon. Gentleman and I that, unfortunately, circumstances have been such that the police have had to assume a sort of paramilitary role to counter terrorism. It was not something they chose. I am not talking about members of the RUC. In so far as civil servants are no longer to be civil servants but are to be employed by the Chief Constable, the IRA and other paramilitary organisations will find some comfort and some justification for actions that they may take against those members of our society. It would be helpful if the Minister took more seriously the points that are being raised here by those on the Opposition Front Bench and by myself on behalf of the Ulster Unionist party.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We live with the reality of terrorism in Northern Ireland. People are sceptical of a police service that is not seen to be insulated from politicians and politics. To return to the matter of politicians interfacing with the Police Authority, the Police Authority has made itself available to every political party in Northern Ireland, including those to which it should not have made itself available. It has issued an invitation to Sinn Fein to come and interface. I disapprove of that; none the less it illustrates the extent to which that authority wants to maintain its independence and do the job that it was appointed to do.
<P>
One sad fact is that in her nine or 10 months in Northern Ireland the Secretary of State has had only one opportunity to spend a single hour with the Police Authority. If she had managed to spend longer she would have found, as many of us have found, that it is a body jealous of its independent role. That independent role should be protected, which it will not be if the Bill remains in its present form.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Before we adjourned this morning the Minister and his hon. Friends seemed greatly surprised that I should argue for the amendments in the way that I did. It is true that the Conservative Government put through the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994. It also put through the Police Act 1996, which incorporated many aspects of the 1994 legislation. Central to that in terms of the relationship between the Chief Constable and the police authorities were the ingredients of clause 3, especially those of subsections (5) and (6).
<P>
There are two points to be made. First, if it is argued that it is impossible to change a view that one held a year ago, much of what the Labour party is implementing at present should not be being done. It is pretty obvious that they are borrowing a foreign suit of clothes in much of the legislation that they are putting through.
<P>
The second point is more important. The very future of the Police Authority is at the heart of much of the Bill and it is concerned--I would even say disconcerted--by some of the proposals. Given that it is an independent body, as is emphasised by the Government on every conceivable occasion that they go into print or speak publicly about such matters, how else can it make its concerns and views known? We have been told that it is there to represent public opinion and to communicate the views of the community that it serves. Yet during our discussions this morning, there was a hint that the Government did not think that its members should talk to anyone.
<P>
Even when we returned this afternoon, the Minister referred to local politicians. He did not say that the Police Authority for Northern Ireland could talk to Front-Bench Opposition Members; he just said ``local politicians'', as if we did not come into that category. I hope that he will confirm that the Police Authority is free to discuss any proposal and any measure with Front-Bench Opposition Members at any time. [Interruption.] I am glad to have that confirmed by a sedentary intervention. The Minister did not make it clear earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I wish that the hon. Gentleman had listened to what was said. I said that the Secretary of State met the members of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland on 20 January and told them that they had the right to communicate with Members of Parliament. I think that I might have said ``local Members of Parliament''--I am not sure exactly what the Secretary of State said. As she was talking within a Northern Ireland context, they may have been referred to in that way. If she did not say ``local MPs'', but ``MPs'' then that would deal with the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. If I have confused the issue by saying ``local Members of Parliament'', it is an understandable confusion, given that I was referring to a local body talking to local Members of Parliament. I think that hon. Gentleman has made too much of the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am delighted to have it confirmed that PANI is free to talk to my colleagues and myself at any time, on any matter relating to this legislation. That is progress of a kind.
<P>
This morning, I quoted from a document from the Police Authority, a copy of which was sent to the Secretary of State some time ago. It does not contain all the amendments that the Police Authority wants, but it explains in detail the reasons behind the amendments that the authority wishes to see tabled. It is an explanatory document. It has been sent to the Secretary of State. I am therefore more than surprised to find that she has written to the Police Authority to express her concern and surprise that it opposes some parts of the legislation. It is all in the document. It was all sent to her weeks ago. Why did she write to PANI about the matter only a day or so ago? The Minister has not clarified that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The paragraph that I read out from the Secretary of State's letter stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I found it somewhat disconcerting that at Second Reading various MPs had been briefed that the Authority was comprehensively opposed to its provisions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, there were areas of difference between what the Government were trying to achieve and what the Police Authority wanted, but the phrase ``comprehensively opposed'' was used by hon. Members. We wanted to explain that that was not the case, based on the information given to the Secretary of State and to me. On Second Reading, hon. Members said that the Police Authority had a view different from that of the Government. That creates confusion and does not help to produce a better understanding of the legislation that we are trying to introduce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Second Reading was some time ago--well before Christmas. Why did the Secretary of State decide to write about events that at that time had taken place only a few days ago? If she was so concerned, why did she not pick up the telephone after Second Reading? Why did the Minister not do that? How many meetings has the Minister had with the Police Authority since he was appointed? There is a deafening silence. How many times has the Secretary of State met the Police Authority? The answer is once. Why did the Secretary of State write a formal letter, exploring this extensive opposition--so the Minister says, I have forgotten the words he used--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Comprehensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> ``Comprehensive'' opposition. The Secretary of State and the Minister received the document that I have here, and there have been weeks since Second Reading for sensible conversations, either face to face or over the telephone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It is no wonder that the Minister had difficulty with words such as ``adequate'' and ``impartial''. We are now arguing about the word ``comprehensive'', and where did that arise? As far as I am aware, it arose in the Secretary of State's letter. I doubt whether the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire used it to explain the Secretary of State's difficulties with the Bill, and I do not think I used it. The Secretary of State thought of the word ``comprehensive''. It can be applied to the areas where difference has arisen. There is no problem with the ombudsman or with some other matters. The Minister would do well to argue not on the basis of his own choice of words, but on the basis of points that we have put to him in all seriousness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am not sure how to respond to that intervention. [Hon. Members: ``It was a good speech.''] Yes, it was a speech. I am fully in accord with most of what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
It should come as no surprise to the Government that PANI has the concerns that were mentioned. It is a sensitive group of people, which historically has come in for much attack and criticism from all quarters in Northern Ireland. I take my hat off to the people who agree to serve on it. It is probably the worst job on any Government body or quango in Northern Ireland, or indeed in the whole United Kingdom. The PANI members do the best job they can. They have argued in the past that the structure has been wrong; hence the Bill. We all agree that the question of structure needs to be revisited. The tripartite structure needs to be reformed.
<P>
I thought I heard it said several times--certainly during the Minister's opening remarks--that an important aim was to strengthen the role and independence of the Police Authority. I concur, and I am sure that the authority would agree, but its members have been telling my colleagues and myself, and hon. Members who represent Northern Ireland constituencies, that they are still not happy. They do not think that they have had a proper chance to make representations or that their views have been listened to. Perhaps their submissions were read, digested and rejected, but the Minister should not be surprised if an independent body that takes itself very seriously keeps coming back to say, ``This will not work''.
<P>
The PANI members are entitled to their views and convictions, but the Government give the impression that those factors do not matter. Do the Government want dupes on the Police Authority, or yes men and women who will do their bidding; or do they want people who think independently, who will do the job to the best of their ability? It should come as no surprise to the Government that there is still considerable disquiet in PANI about some elements of the Bill. One of its greatest concerns arises from clause 3.
<P>
The PANI documentation also states that the status quo is not satisfactory. The need for change is recognised. The message is, ``Do not legislate in this way at the moment; let us work together within the tripartite structure to try to bring sense to the arrangements for responsibility on the personnel side for management of police and supporting civilians.'' Nothing could be more reasonable. The provision need not be included in the Bill now. It could be added through an order or in some other way later.
<P>
Given the time scale and the Government's intention under clause 4 to make significant changes to the employment arrangements for current civilian employees of the Police Authority, the contemplated measures are important. PANI cannot see how all the work can be done in the time scale suggested by the Minister. He did not say, when he had the chance, that he had listened carefully to PANI and altered his views on the time scale. However, recent conversations persuade me that the authority is still concerned that what the Government are trying to do is far-reaching and immensely significant and will in organisational and logistic terms, cause considerable problems.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): I have listened to the hon. Gentleman, who is using his words carefully. We understand the concerns of PANI about the loss of responsibility for various police services. However, I want to know whether the Opposition spokesman supports the Government move to simplify matters and give responsibility for those services to the Chief Constable as the previous Government wanted to do? Or has there been a change in Conservative policy?

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is a fatuous argument. Since the implementation of the 1994 legislation in England and Wales, research has been carried out into its effectiveness. That research has shown that some moves were sensible and are working well but that real difficulties remain. Given the unique position of Northern Ireland, it is reasonable to ask the Minister and the Government to justify what they are doing in the light of the research information now available. The report highlights personnel management as a grey area that is causing problems.
<P>
The Police Authority visited 12 authorities in England and Wales to ask them face to face how changes were developing, and it was told in every case that there were difficulties in certain areas. Are the Government saying that PANI should not have done that? I did not hear them say so. Are they saying that the views freely given by police authorities in England and Wales to PANI representatives should not have been expressed? When are the Government going to listen?
<P>
I have had no part in the gestation of the Bill--I did not contribute to the White Paper, for example. I had other things to do. In our time in Government, Ministers got together and had a chance to have their say. If Ministers were overruled, they went along with Cabinet responsibility and accepted the majority line. The Minister is accusing me of turning turtle, but I never had any say in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> What is the hon. Gentleman's position now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I never had a say, and--
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> What is the hon. Gentleman's position now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> All I am saying to the Government is that if they are going ahead with the provisions they should justify them in the light of criticism from their own Police Authority. That is all. My colleagues and I, and the people of Northern Ireland, are entitled to know what their response is. All the Minister needs to say is that he met PANI last week and the matter was thrashed out. But he has not said that. Nor has he said that he will meet PANI tomorrow to sort it out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> You missed the earlier part of our debate, Mr. Jones. Let me put on record again what was explained to the Committee. An implementation strategy is being put in place. It will involve a steering committee, PANI, the Chief Constable and myself as chair to oversee developments. Below that will be a co-ordination committee comprising officials from the Northern Ireland Office, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. Below that will be working groups dealing with each of the sectoral areas. Concerns can be understood in detail at lower levels and be put through the co-ordination committee. The Police Authority has access to me through the steering committee. That represents an effective structure, and if the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire does not believe that that is how things should be done, let him tell me how he thinks they should.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I was listening carefully to the Minister. It is all very well having logistic and organisational structures in place, but if PANI is not listening, what is the point of them? The Minister's first priority should be to talk to the Police Authority and persuade it of the merits of including clause 3 (5) and (6) in the Bill. If he persuades PANI that all will work out well in the end, I will accept his organisational, or discussion, framework. But that would follow on from PANI's acceptance in principle of what he is trying to achieve, and so far as I can tell, PANI has not accepted it. There will be a unanimous response from PANI to the Secretary of State's letter, but it will not be helpful to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Because of the importance of the issue and the amendments, I would like to withdraw amendment No. 25 on the understanding--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I help the hon. Gentleman? He might wish to make that point later in the debate. If any hon. Members were to speak after him, the amendment would automatically go to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Thank you, Mr. Jones. I think that I understand the direction that was given to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, and I thank him for trying to be helpful.
<P>
I think that the Minister intimated that he would think again about the implications of clause 3(6), which deals with the grey area of who decides how the budget is apportioned between civilian personnel who work directly for the Police Authority and those who are employed by the Police Authority but work for the Chief Constable more or less directly on police matters.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister could tell me if I am wrong, but I think that he said that he would have a look at that matter to find out whether he could more clearly define the roles of the various parties. If he said that, he is accepting that there is at least the germ of an idea in my proposal on subsection (6). In other words, the subsection is not clear, but it could be made more clear by a judicial amendment. I welcome the fact that the Minister is prepared to consider that, but it is not true to say that we oppose all of clause 3--we want it to work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman has finally got there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> If the Minister can persuade the Police Authority that the proposal is in their best interests, so be it. But if the Police Authority is diametrically opposed to the proposal--[Interruption.] You say it is incredible, but have you talked to the police authority recently? Obviously not.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I help the hon. Gentleman? If he says, ``You'', he is addressing me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I apologise for that aberration, Mr. Jones.
<P>
That is the state of play at the moment. It is important that such matters are aired in Committee. PANI thought that they should be aired. In the light of recent developments, PANI is delighted that the debate has gone the way that it has. It seemed to PANI that there was no other forum in which such matters could be addressed.
<P>
On clause 4, we are talking about the wholesale transfer--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his comments? Is he saying that the Police Authority has advised him that it has had no contact with Ministers or Northern Ireland Office officials and that no discussions have taken place? That is what he has implied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I did not say that the Police Authority said that there had been no discussions. I think that I said that there had been no meaningful discussion; the Police Authority has not been listened to, and it is still concerned about the implications of clause 3(5) and (6). The Minister has already intimated that he will look at subsection (6), so he cannot argue that we are not making some valid points. He needs to talk to PANI and get it on side before making progress on setting up the committees.
<P>
I refer to amendment No. 24 to clause 4. Again, it has been expressed to me that the Police Authority is--I should not use the word ``gobsmacked'', but I cannot think of a more appropriate one. Perhaps it will be struck from the record. The Police Authority is incredulous that a Labour Government have gone ahead with clause 4.
<P>
I was asked this morning about representations that had been received and it is no secret that many employees have made representations to PANI about the implications of clause 4. That is well documented and I am surprised that the Minister did not already know that. Where are the unions in all this? Obviously discussions are taking place, but the unions are keeping extremely quiet. I suspect that the people who feel that their union should be representing them are deeply disappointed at the staggering silence in Northern Ireland. It is time that the unions spoke up for the people in the right way.
<P>
I am delighted that the Minister has confirmed that we can talk to PANI and individuals and that legitimate fears and concerns can be raised in the Committee. The Minister quoted from the fundamental review this morning and referred to comments by the Police Authority. As far as I am aware, the results of the review that was undertaken have not been published or endorsed by the Secretary of State or by PANI. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether that fundamental review document is currently in the public domain. I hope that he will clarify that and revisit some of his comments.
<P>
We have had a long debate and I welcome the Minister's assurance that he will carefully reconsider clause 3(6). I shall not press the amendments to a Division, but we reserve the right to return to the issue on Report. It is important for the Minister and his team to talk to PANI soon to find a way forward on an agreed position. At present, there is no agreement on the way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran (Beverley and Holderness):</B> I had not intended to make a speech, but I shall be brief. I am doing so because when I left the Committee this morning, the Bill was being considered in a level-headed and fair way. I was content with that because that is the proper approach to a better Bill. I attended to other business, and when I came back I discovered that the Minister had created a stramash--a word that he will recognise because it is from the same country as we come from. It was a stramash of the Minister's own making. If he does not know what the word means--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister does know it. That is champion, so I do not need to explain it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): What does it mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The best description is an uproar. As in all words relating to Scotland and Wales--I am trying to get you on my side, Mr. Jones--it is impossible to give the exact equivalent in English. Scottish and Welsh words are always infinitely better. [Hon. Members: ``Why?''] Because they are more expressive.
<P>
The difficulties relate to several matters, one of which is that the Minister must understand that his intemperance over the amendments will not get the Bill through any faster. It will slow down its consideration, which would be a great pity. I should welcome a level-headed approach but we shall accommodate whatever approach the Minister wishes to adopt.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was out of the Room earlier and returned just as the Minister said that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire had changed his mind as had other Opposition Members between the time they were in government before 1 May and since. It seems that it will be necessary to hold a seminar on the art of government. Despite the fact that the Labour party was in opposition for 18 years, it seems to have quickly forgotten what opposition is all about. However, I should not attend such a seminar because I would be ruled out of order.
<P>
It is not a matter of changing minds. When in opposition, representations are made in an open and free manner by a range of bodies. If the Opposition think that certain questions must be answered, one of their responsibilities is to put those questions as fairly as they can. That was all that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was trying to do--as, indeed, I would have done. The Minister made a fatuous point when he accused my hon. Friend of changing his mind. As I am trying to explain, the role of the Opposition is to consider representations and to put them forward.
<P>
Occasionally, as is the case with the representations that we have recieved on the amendments, we might not be completely convined of the argument. However, we may be convinced that it needs a answer. That is why in regard the stramash that the Minister has created as needless. We could have dispensed with it all at two minutes after half-past 4, but we were unable to do so because of the reasons that I have given.
<P>
We hope that, for the sake of the Bill, such a disturbance does not occur again. We have received many representations about the amendments and, naturally, we want to raise them. Each time that I lift a piece of paper, I do not want to be worried about whether it has been through the hands of the Minister, the Secretary of State, his officials or anyone else. Although the Minister explained the matter, he left in his clarification a tinge of dubiety of what the exercise was about.
<P>
In previous incarnations, I had experience of the old tactic of a good cannon shot or grapeshot over the bows of those with whom I disagreed, on the off chance that that would get them to stop articulating their views. That happened in the case of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland in relation to these and other amendments. The Minister and the Secretary of State are fair-minded people which is why we have been far from obstructive in other matters relating to Northern Ireland. We have tried our best to get such business through, and that is what we want to do here.
<P>
I should like to see a copy of the letter. The Minister had a good old giggle when my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, I think it was, said that the letter should be published. I did not understand why the Minister was laughing. The letter should have been put on the Table after lunch in the light of what the Minister said before lunch, and we should all have had a copy of it. There would then have been less of a stramash, and we could all have seen in black and white what was said. If the Government intend to put a cannon shot over PANI's bows to tell it to shut up, that will not be acceptable, nor will it be acceptable in relation to any of the other bodies that have sent us direct representations.
<P>
I had not intended to quote from the other representations that we have received because I did not see the point. My understanding is that this set of representations--I am looking to my hon. Friend to confirm this--has already been sent to the Government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> It has been sent. That being the case, I fail to understand why the Government are so aggressive on the subject. In relation to this group of amendments the Police Authority makes it clear in the version that I have that there is much in the Bill to which it has already given a warm welcome, such as the reforms to the complaints system, the introduction of policing plans and the change to the oath of office for constables.
<P>
There is no point in the Minister or the Secretary of State getting on their high horse, and it is uncharacteristic of either of them to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr Maginnis:</B> indicated dissent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone: it is uncharacteristic.
<P>
If PANI was misrepresented on Second Reading--I shall not canter through the debate, as you would rule me out of order very quickly, Mr. Jones--there is no point in engaging in a wrist slapping exercise. The Secretary of State and the Minister should go to the hon. Members who spoke on the issue and ask for the briefing material to see whether PANI was misrepresented. I do not think that PANI has been misrepresented in any way.
<P>
If the Secretary of State felt so strongly as to write a letter in such terms, some of which was quoted in Committee, surely she or the Minister would have written to PANI to ask whether it had distributed misleading representations as to its view. Did the Secretary of State do that? If she did not, it reinforces my impression that the Minister's main aim was to gag this organisation because, prima facie, it did not agree with the Government.
<P>
Although my briefing broadly agrees with Government statements, it is at variance with them on many detailed points. I have a right to see PANI's views if they are in the public domain. Will the Minister clarify that in his winding-up speech?
<P>
I pay tribute to PANI and its board members, who seem to have been rather accommodating to the Government. For all the trouble that they have gone to, look at what the Government have done to them: they have criticised them.
<P>
The document, of which the Minister also has a copy, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Authority is not opposed to change and improvement. Indeed, the Authority has for many years called for reform of the tripartite structure and has argued that there are serious shortcomings in the present arrangements, largely as a result of a lack of clarity about the respective roles, responsibilities and powers of the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If I wanted to be destructive I could spend another half an hour or so going over all the points that my hon. Friends made, but as they have been outlined in some detail I shall not. But I shall look to the Minister to be just a wee bit more fair-minded when replying to Opposition points and to points made by PANI. In the light of his response we shall make decisions about how to treat subsequent amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh wish to make a contribution to the debate now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> It would seem so. It also seems that I may have missed a great opportunity to say nothing earlier. I shall try to remedy that.
<P>
I wish to make two points. I find the debate interesting because there is a certain contradiction in my position, which stems from my belief that we are talking about something that is based on a misnomer.
<P>
A phrase used by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was one that I have heard down the years, and I made a note of it--``undermine morale''. How often have we heard that phrase, most especially in relation to policing in the north of Ireland? I can see its rationality in terms of some of the changes that my party and I have sought in actual policing. I can understand how morale could be dented by changes that people do not like.
<P>
I recognise that, but I also recognise the theme running through the Police Authority's central position, which has been expressed in terms of undermining morale. I can understand a feeling of anger at the idea of one's employer being changed. I can understand apprehensions about terms of employment. I have sympathy with the view that not only are we giving the Chief Constable completely untrammeled operational independence, we are giving him substantial authority over administration.
<P>
One of the weasel phrases that goes to the heart of vested interests in policing and security in Northern Ireland is just that phrase--``undermining morale''. Whatever is done and whatever the condtradictions, it is difficult to understand why something administrative could undermine morale among people who, effectively, are civil servants. Education legislation turned the education system on its head, but there was no talk then of undermining morale. The Department of the Environment made changes in regulations but those did not undermine morale. Whatever else they did, the changes in the health service did not undermine morale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Oh, but they did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The phrase ``undermining morale'' touches a raw nerve in the whole concept of policing in the north of Ireland. It almost requires policing to be part of an attitude of mind--indeed, an attitude of mind with a political dimension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I would not want the hon. Gentleman to pursue his argument on the basis of a false premise. He said that the changes to the education system did not undermine morale, yet he knows that this generation and mine--the hon. Gentleman and I were both teachers--could not get out of teaching quickly enough when the changes, which we knew would undermine the ethos of our profession, were implemented. Exactly the same thing happened in the health service; the party that is now in Government complained about it again and again. Let the hon. Gentleman pursue his arguments on the basis of a more accurate premise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> That is an interesting point. Yes, I would have found it very hard to adjust to the new requirements of the Education Reform Act 1988. That may have been because of my deficiencies, not because of the regulations. Indeed, in the context of the health service, any general practitioner will say that the problems that medical staff face are in adjusting to a new era of information technology, the preservation and the gathering of which almost supersedes the need to look after patients.
<P>
The ``undermining of morale'' is a different matter; it is a weasel phrase, a code in Northern Ireland terms. In that context it is saying much more than might apply to education and the health service. In its own strange way, it could be almost be rewritten to read, ``Hands off our police. No change. That was good enough for the past 75 years; hands off.'' That is the heart of the problem. I might find myself advancing the same argument and even voting with Opposition Members if we were really talking about a police authority, but it is not a police authority because it does not and cannot exercise authority. It can fulfil functions, yes, but it is not a police authority.
<P>
There is a fantasy that somehow or other, residing in the body that is known as a police authority there is an authority that matters. I believe that it does not particularly matter. I think that somewhere down the line, in five or six years time, there will be fundamental changes and, because that is in the nature of change, they will determine that there will be a buffer between the community and the policing operation. That is what I want. With it will come the recognition that ultimately in Northern Ireland, as in Great Britain and in the Republic of Ireland, responsibility for policing resides within the political authority. Political authority means the authority which governs. If we are honest with ourselves, we must acknowledge that the Bill provides for that and that that system exists in the Republic of Ireland. I am glad that the Government have not yet appointed a ``police authority''. I hope that they will do that properly.
<P>
There is an absolute need for a body that can act as a buffer zone, and also as a conduit to the community; that can put pressure on the Chief Constable and on political authority. But if we are to create such a body, let us call it by its proper name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have two questions for the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that the Bill contains strengthening powers for the Police Authority that he can support? Does he believe that the document, ``Your Voice, Your Choice'', which follows the previous Government's aims to change the way in which the Police Authority is elected or selected, is the right way to proceed? Would it lead to the creation of the sort of police authority, which the hon. Gentleman has not specified, that would do the job that the hon. Gentleman would like it to undertake?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I shall start with the second question. I am not impressed by the glossy brochure. The colour is good, and it contains some nice pictures, but it is not a serious attempt to establish a police authority or to find a way in which the entire community can engage with a body that stands between it and policing. The glossy brochure does not approach that. Events will demand that its proposals are changed.
<P>
My next point is not partisan--some sections of my party would speak severely to me for making it. We are in the throes of this problem in negotiations. It is awesome that, out of mayhem, we have to create a lasting system of administration and justice that will sustain itself. I am one of the few people who wishes policing to be placed in the hands of a properly created and supported administrative system in the north of Ireland, which is a high-risk country for anyone who advocates that. It is easy to leave it with the Brits, to use the vernacular. It is easy not to assume responsibility, to have something that can be readily blamed. We are all guilty of that.
<P>
In 1973, I was a junior Back Bencher in the Northern Ireland Assembly when a power-sharing arrangement was created. It was taken to the ground by lack of courage within the British Government and--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying rather wide of the staff, their status and their conditions of service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Thank you again for your direction, Mr. Jones, but I hope that you will allow me to finish the point. The Administration might have sustained themselves if they had been given the requisite authority where and when it counted.
<P>
I beg the Committee's indulgence for leaving the main point, but if the Police Authority were properly renamed and the sleight of hand in the term removed, I would probably vote with Opposition Members if it came to a Division. As it stands, I have a choice between giving authority to the Chief Constable--and I am not in favour of untrammelled authority for Chief Constables--or giving it to an appointed body. Given that choice, I shall opt for what can be changed by this Parliament--the Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall be brief, perhaps briefer than in some of my interventions. I want to take up the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh's point about the Police Authority not having authority. It does have authority and that authority can be the basis of a proper police authority that meets the needs both of my and the hon. Gentleman's traditions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh let the cat out of the bag when he said that he was content with a system that parallelled that of the Republic of Ireland--
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I welcome the opportunity to clarify that matter. Rather than making that point, one of my criticisms of the Republic of Ireland is that it does not have a proper police authority. The point that I was trying to make--obviously badly--was that it is better to have none than have one that is not a proper police authority. That is a rather different point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I take the point. I recall the late Brian Lenihan, a senior Minister in the Irish Government, telling the story of himself, Charles Haughey and a couple of friends in the Irish Republic arriving in a pub late one night--well after midnight. As they sat imbibing, the local sergeant arrived and said, ``Gentlemen, you know it is past closing time''--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am tempted to tell the hon. Gentleman to address his remarks to the conditions of service of the staff. On this amendment he should not be debating the nature of the authority itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I take the point Mr. Jones. May I have your indulgence for the punchline which was, ``Sergeant, would you like a drink or a transfer?''
<P>
Unless a police authority is accepted by both traditions and unless there is a degree of confidence throughout the whole structure, including the staff, we will be in serious difficulty. Is it sensible that a police authority to whom the Chief Constable must be accountable has to go to that same Chief Constable to beg for staff and finance to maintain it? Whatever the Police Authority is at present, that would be a mockery. I leave the Minister with that point and I hope he will address it in his response.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I must respond to some of the points that have been raised and explain again the points that I explained earlier. But first, the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Cran) accused me of causing a stramash. I have been to many stramahses in my time and not all of them are uproars. There is a folk group called Stramash which is made up of friends of mine. It is inappropriate for me to advertise, but it is a very good ceilidh band and I have been to many hooleys with it. I am sure that some hon. Members will know what a hooley is. Not all stramashes are uproars. They can be many things. I suspect that in trying to accuse me of an uproar the hon. Gentleman was trying to provoke me. I would prefer to find a better description.
<P>
I pay tribute to the Police Authority. There is no question that it does a difficult job. It is a very exposed job. The contact that the Secretary of State, my officials and I have had with it has been all about building that relationship and trying to ensure that there is proper and open communication. I have had meetings with the Police Authority. The Secretary of State had meetings with it as recently as 20 January. She has met the chief executive and the chairman on a number of occasions.
<P>
I spoke to the trade unions earlier to take them through the Bill. I recognised that they were concerned primarily about the transfer of staff. We recognised that. We did not think that, simply because the Government had decided what to do, that would automatically be accepted by everyone. That is not the nature of the democracy in which we live. People should have the right to express their concerns to Members of Parliament of whichever party, and whether they are Northern Ireland Members is neither here nor there. It is important that an independent authority should have that right to communicate.
<P>
The point that was made earlier was that although we were told that many parts of the Bill were acceptable to the Police Authority, hon. Members supposedly speaking on its behalf on Second Reading effectively said that there was--I hesitate to use the phrase--comprehensive resistance to the Bill. It was to try to set that part of the record straight that the Secretary of State wrote her letter. A request has been made to make the letter available to the Committee. I am happy to do so.
<P>
I referred to that letter at the start of my remarks this afternoon because the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone had referred to it but did not have a copy. I have furnished the main part, and the letter will be made available to Committee members for clarification. It contains many important points about the strength of the legislation, and I am sure that it will help to elucidate some of our later arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> In relation to the rubbishing job that, in his eyes, went on on Second Reading, I specifically asked the Minister whether he or the Secretary of State had asked PANI whether it had provided that briefing or whether Members of Parliament had merely put their own gloss on it. Will he answer that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that assumptions were made based on our knowledge of the views of PANI members and the way in which those views were reflected by Members of Parliament. We wanted to establish an open dialogue. I know that the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness would welcome that. There is no point in making criticisms when there are open channels for consultation and discussion with the Government and with officials. We should be able to resolve the matter in the best way that we can. If members of the Police Authority are still dissatisfied, they can raise matters of concern with Members of Parliament. The Secretary of State said that at the meeting on 20 January. There is no difficulty. I hope that we can consider the Bill in a balanced and structured way that is not based on misunderstanding. That is the purpose of the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire mentioned the fundamental review. He said that, as far as he was aware, it had not been approved by the Secretary of State or endorsed by the Chief Constable and PANI. I do not know who is advising the hon. Gentleman, but a summary of the fundamental review has been published and endorsed by the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. Until now, I thought that it had also been endorsed by the Police Authority. If that is no longer the case, the authority has certainly not communicated that to me.
<P>
The full document has not been published, because it deals with some sensitive matters that should not be in the public domain. I do not wish to go into detail about those matters, but that was the judgment of those involved. The hon. Gentleman has got his facts wrong again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I made a fair point. I have not got my facts wrong. Someone who spoke to me got the facts wrong. I was reporting the fear and concern that were expressed to me. There is a key question, however. Did the Minister quote from the original document, which is not in the public domain, or did he quote from the summary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is worth drawing the Committee's attention to the fact that the hon. Gentleman was given full access to my officials to enable him to be taken through the Bill. Those discussions gave him the opportunity to clarify points that had been made to him by other people. I did not know that he planned to raise this matter. He could have telephoned me or contacted me. We see each other on many occasions in the Lobbies--although not in the same one--and in other parts of the House. He had a point of contact with my officials and he could have raised the matter. I offered the opportunity of discussion with my officials so that he could raise genuine areas of concern, not things that people have told him that are fundamentally wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> They are not fundamentally wrong. The Minister has still not told the Committee whether he quoted from the summary of the review or from the main report, which is not in the public domain. That issue needs clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I had not yet come to that point. I explained earlier that I was quoting from the views of the Police Authority, submitted to the review, not from the fundamental review itself. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
I want to turn to the relationship between the Police Authority and its staff. That is the nub of our discussions on the amendments. At present, most PANI staff are employed by the Department of Finance and Personnel. In future they will all be employed by the Police Authority and will be managed by the Chief Constable. That will clarify and strengthen management relationships. It is important that the authority take direct responsibility for its staff, and it is better than the staff come within the ambit of that independent body than remaining civil servants. That is why we are making the change.
<P>
The terms and conditions of the staff will be protected. A meeting has been arranged for Monday of next week to move forward the discussions on those detailed aspects, including terms and conditions, pension rights and all other staff-related concerns. I hope that the Police Authority will participate in that meeting because it will move the consideration of those matters forward.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have a simple question. Will the Minister say whether an assessment of the cost of the transfer of staff from the civil service to the Police Authority has been made? Can he give us some idea what the whole transaction is likely to cost?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The answers will flow in during discussions with the staff. There may be changes in the structure if we get a lasting and peaceful settlement, which I know the hon. Gentleman wants. He knows that the Chief Constable has said that the RUC will be reduced by about half, which clearly will have staffing implications as well:
<P>
There is a period of uncertainty ahead, but one to which we all want to sign up. There will be cost implications for the police and the staff, but they cannot be determined at this stage. In trying to manage the process of change, we must look at how staff will be transferred and then reach our conclusions. The Police Authority can assist us greatly in that process.
<P>
I said that we would reconsider clause 3(6) and return to the matter on Report. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh referred to the powers of the Police Authority. It has a duty to consult the community. It is responsible for appointing the Chief Constable and senior officers, and for setting priorities for the RUC; it is responsible for scrutinising and revising the Chief Constable's strategic financial allocations, and it can call for reports on his decisions. It also has the responsibility to hold him to account against a published policing plan. Clearly, those are considerable responsibilities. I do not accept the analysis of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh when we consider those powers and responsibilities.
<P>
I hope that I have addressed the points that have been raised. I have said that I shall consider the matters raised under amendment No. 25, and I ask the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire not to press for a Division on amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> On the understanding that the issues will be raised again on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 16, leave out `Service' and insert `Department'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 17, in page 1, line 18, leave out `Service' and inser `Department'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I understand that the original amendment was initially tabled in the names of three Liberal Democrats, led by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &#214;pik), who, unfortunately, is not a member of the Committee. There is a slight discrepancy. I do not want to make an issue of it, but our amendment is not quite the same as theirs, although the replacement of the word ``service'' with the word ``Department'' is the same. The original Liberal Democrat amendment dealt with the first instance of the word ``service'' in line 15, whereas amendment No. 1 would delete the word ``Service'' on the next line and replace it with the word ``Department''. A consequential amendment is necessary to subsection (3).
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Why have the Government come up with the idea in question? In a publication recently distributed by the Minister to Labour Back-Benchers--he allowed me a copy, for which I am grateful--he wrote of the Bill's introducing the concept of the Northern Ireland police service. That means incorporating the RUC, the RUC Reserve, civilian support staff and traffic wardens into a unified service. By choosing the word ``concept'' the Minister gives the game away slightly. An attempt is being made to rename the police function--or service, or force, or whatever one wants to call it--in Northern Ireland.
<P>
An idea was put forward by PANI in this context. It is part of the political talks process, and represents an attempt to bring about change that may obtain some approval from one or other section of the community--preferably both. The main thrust for fundamental change has come from the nationalist community. A change of name was seen as something that could be approached. It would not be too fundamental, although at worst it would be just a sop to one side of the community. The Police Authority recommended that the police force should be known as the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police service. That is different in meaning from what clauses 2 and 3 would bring about.
<P>
I suggest that the term ``police service'' is synonymous with the term ``police force'' and that paramilitaries would deduce that those terms meant one and the same thing. That raises the point that I raised with respect to some earlier amendments, that someone, even a civilian, who is deemed to be a member of a police service,--in other words, a police force--may, in the eyes of paramilitaries, become a more legitimate target. That raises a real question of terrorist threats and intimidation. Has the Minister received any representation through the Police Authority or from individuals about the proposal to link the component parts into a unified police service? Does the Chief Constable really want civilian staff and traffic wardens to be part of his police force?
<P>
In what sense would the service be unified? The mere fact of lumping together various functions such as traffic wardens' or civilians' work with policing will not mean that the services provided will be unified or, for that matter, strictly related. What does a traffic warden's role have to do with the duties of an RUC constable? What common ground is there between civilian staff working to assist the RUC in their policing duties and those working exclusively for PANI on Police Authority duties? There is not really any common ground. The different staff perform functions that relate primarily to policing and its associated activities, but to call them a unified service is stretching the point. I do not believe that there is any logic to the proposal, which is increasingly perceived as a rather clumsy attempt to give a sop to one side of the equation and to show that a change of name has been achieved.
<P>
It has been put to me that there is a fear that once the edict goes out--whether it has already gone out or will go out shortly--all RUC letterheads will in future carry the words ``The Northern Ireland Police Service''. It does not take much imagination to see that the font size of the Northern Ireland police service gets larger as the RUC gets smaller. In the end the RUC might drop off the end of the letterhead altogether. I am not saying that that is the Government's intention, but it is a fear that has been put to me strongly. The Minister must give adequate reasons why an edict has already gone out for this change to occur before the Bill has been passed. I am surprised that such matters are being communicated at such an early stage.
<P>
The proposal is doomed to fail, because it is an attempt to make a substantive change to the police service in Northern Ireland. I think that both sides of the community, Unionists and nationalists, find it laughable. They can see through it, so it will not achieve what the Government hope. It is seen as tinkering with the fundamental problem of identification that a section of a community has about the police force--in other words, the Royal Ulster Constabulary--which I think will be resented, if not resisted, by the civilian work force and traffic wardens, for the reasons that I outlined earlier, of intimidation and security.
<P>
There is a fundamental difference in the meaning of the word ``service'', depending on whether it is spelt with a small ``s'' or a capital ``S''. I have no problem with the word ``service'' in line 15 in relation to forming a single service, but when it is spelt with a capital ``S'', as it is in line 16, it should be taken out. The amendment suggests that the word ``Department'' be used instead. Why have I suggested ``Department''?
<P>
The governance of Northern Ireland, either under direct rule as it is at present, or possibly in a different way in the future with an elected assembly--although it will not be affected by the change--is administered through various Departments of State. There is the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Finance and Personnel, the Department of Health and Social Services--even in that title it is clear that a range of services can be provided by a single Department--the Department of Economic Development and the Department of the Environment, which I know from my time as a Minister there. The latter is particularly interesting, because the one Department handles a range of disparate services. The list is not exclusive, but it includes water services, planning services, road services, environmental services and local authority services, as well as many others. No one would define this Department as a unified service; it is not. It is a Department delivering different types of services. There are connections and some overlapping, but it would be wrong to define it as a unified, environmental service.
<P>
Similarly, it is just as flawed to lump together the different services of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Police Authority, the traffic wardens and the civilian work force in the way that the Bill proposes. They are patently not a single or unified service. The services provided, although connected, are, I believe, better labelled under a departmental heading. We could call it the Northern Ireland Police Department. By all means let the RUC put on its letter heading ``The Police Service of Northern Ireland'' or ``Northern Ireland's Police Service'', but that is fundamentally different from calling it the Northern Ireland police service, as in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I hope that we are making progress.
<P>
The effect of amendments Nos. 1 and 17 is straightforward. They would change the name of the new single service which the Bill creates from the Northern Ireland police service to the Northern Ireland police department.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire raised a number of issues relating to work done by people who would work alongside RUC officers wherever they were--technically and administratively, in RUC stations or elsewhere--and suggested that because they were deemed part of the Northern Ireland police service somehow they would come under increased threat from paramilitaries. Perhaps he can tell the Committee how that would change if they were part of a department rather than part of a process of delivering a service to the community. The threat would, I suggest, still be there for those working in RUC stations because of the way in which the paramilitaries operate in the Province. They can be both discriminate and indiscriminate in their actions.

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It was put to me recently that many people who work in a civilian capacity, either assisting the RUC's work, or assisting the Police Authority, are able to say in their communities that they work for the civil service, and are happy to do so. In their eyes, that gets them off the hook as regards being a target for paramilitaries. A police service is, as I have said, synonymous with a police force--it is active policing--whereas a police department can, as my argument showed, involve many different services, which, although loosely connected, is not quite the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We could enter into quite a discussion of how paramilitaries operate in Northern Ireland. They are, in the main, very sophisticated bodies, although not all are. If they want to target someone, they will. That is the reality. I am sure that they would not be put off by how people describe themselves if they watched and followed people going about their daily lives. I do not wish to extend this spurious argument. I have heard it, but I do not accept the full thrust of it, although I understand the anxieties that have been raised. Given the nature of the way in which paramilitaries can operate, they can be discriminate or indiscriminate in their action.
<P>
The word ``service'' has appeared in the way that it has because the Police Authority itself and police staff associations were especially keen to see the word appear in legislation. Those who worked as officers, and alongside RUC constables and officers, want to be seen to deliver a service: a service ethos is important in their job. Representations came from the Police Authority and police staff associations about the word ``service'' being in legislation. That is why we have taken it this way. Management responsibility for staff will be transferred to the Chief Constable. It is important that the Police Authority be seen as part of an overall body providing a service to the community. We must all wish that what applies in Northern Ireland will not apply in future in terms of the threat to the community. We hope to move towards a normal society. Legislation is based to last not just for a short time but for a long time. It must look into the future too.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have made this point before to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone about his wish to be seen as British. Let us look at what happens in Great Britain. For a long time in Great Britain policing has ceased to be the preserve of police officers. A wide range of skills is required to provide a modern police service. We need a new term to describe that service because of the various other people who are not sworn constables who deliver that service to the community.
<P>
It is also important to retain a term for the sworn body of constables who have the powers of constable in Northern Ireland. That is why we have not removed the name RUC. That remains, but all those other skills which work alongside the RUC in the delivery of an overall comprehensive service to the wider community of Northern Ireland have to be called something. We suggest that as it is a service that word should apply.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire suggests that it should be called a department. If I deliver a service I would want to be called a service, not just be part of some department. That view has also been expressed. There are counter-arguments on this. The hon. Gentleman who wants the word service and the ethos reflected in the measure has not told me on whose behalf he raises these concerns. I do not know whether it is one person, a representative body or whatever and whether there is any quality or strength to that argument. I respect his position and recognise his right to raise it, but let us see where it is coming from. I therefore ask that the amendments be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> As I said earlier, one needs to live in Northern Ireland for more than eight or nine months to understand the significance of certain words, terms and phrases. As someone who has lived for most of his life there and has seen the Royal Ulster Constabulary operate under the most difficult conditions, I cannot help but quote a short portion of a speech made by the Minister of Home Affairs when, almost 28 years ago to the day, he introduced the Bill which brought about the first police authority. He said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I will suggest that the presentation of this Bill and the virtually unanimous approval I believe it will receive in this House and throughout the country, represent an achievement from which we can all take not only great hope--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
hope for the future in that context--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``but some measure of pride.''--[Official Report, 18 February 1970; Vol. 796, c. 387.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
After a short sojourn in Northern Ireland the Minister tells us that the RUC, which inherited its name from the Royal Irish Constabulary in 1922, somehow wants to reflect the service it undoubtedly gives to society through the title that it will carry from henceforth. Nothing that I have heard from members of the RUC suggests that they want to be known by anything other than that title. They do not want it watered down for what will be futile political reasons.
<P>
It is complete nonsense to suggest that if we watered down the Royal Ulster Constabulary and called it the Northern Ireland Police Service, it would appeal to those who have set their faces against the very existence of Northern Ireland as a region within the United Kingdom.
<P>
We do not want NIPS, which can also stand for the Northern Ireland Prison Service, so this so-called subtitle of the RUC is not even original. NIPS will not stand up in sound or indeed in any other way as something dignified and worthy of a police force--or police service, if the Minister prefers--that has given so much over the years.
<P>
Much can be done to alleviate the concerns that permeate both traditions in Northern Ireland and my party is prepared to support efforts to build bridges. However, the idea of denigrating the history of the Royal Irish Constabulary--more recently, the Royal Ulster Constabulary--by adopting this subtitle is not one of them. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, the subtitle will soon become the major title. Nobody could work more assiduously than the present Government to ensure that the pandering that they have done to the most undesirable elements in our society will continue.
<P>
Let me assure the Minister and others in Committee today that virtually every single member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve--man and woman--will resent and be deeply hurt by the idea that to prove their bona fides and demonstrate their commitment to providing an impartial service to the entirety of Northern Ireland society, they must have the name of their service changed in this way--or, initially, augmented in this manner.
<P>
It is an insult not only to those who live and work within the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve but to the families of over 300 police men and women who have died in service in comparatively recent times--people who have often made the supreme sacrifice. Those families feel deeply about the need to maintain the integrity of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
<P>
As well as the 300 who died in these troubles and those who died in earlier troubles, there are so many others who have been grievously injured in giving service to society in Northern Ireland--people with brain damage, with missing limbs, people confined to wheelchairs and those who are mentally and physically disabled as a result of the sacrifice that they made in the service of both traditions in Northern Ireland. They will feel slighted and will see the change as the most derogatory action that any Government could take to their standing in the community. It is mischievous of the Minister to suggest that there is even marginal support of significance in the RUC for this addendum to its title.
<P>
Every policeman and policewoman to whom I have spoken--I speak to people within the Police Federation and outside it who are family members--will be resentful. More than that, they will be deeply hurt and they will wonder where the Government's recognition is of the sacrifices that have been made down the years.
<P>
I know that the Police Authority wants to acknowledge that the RUC gives a service. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made clear, he has no objection, nor do I, to ``service'' with a small ``s''. Indeed, I feel competent and proud to promote the service and the ethos of the RUC. But there is no greater indignity for any of us than to be called out of our name, as we would say colloquially, as the Government propose here. It is nothing more or less than a sop, particularly to the IRA Sinn Fein, to call the Royal Ulster Constabulary out of its name. The Minister seems resolute in his determination to deliver that insult to the RUC, so we shall press this issue to the ultimate to try to retain the integrity of the service that has sought to serve us all through the most difficult periods in the past 28 years and in many difficult periods before that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I consciously resisted the temptation to table an amendment to this part of the clause, for a number of reasons, not least because I am aware of the sensitivities about the name. I am also aware of the deep emotions in Northern Ireland about identification with policing and of the suffering that many policemen and their families--their immediate families, wider families and indeed communities--have suffered as a result of violence. Therefore, it is difficult for someone like myself to resist the temptation to try to amend the clause in a different direction. I am glad that I resisted. For many years, I have sought a name change, not for some atavistic notion, but in the hope that, because of the various connotations that exist in Northern Ireland, a change might enable us to focus support and allegiance, and resolve the policing problem.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I listened to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone with interest. He genuinely expressed his emotions on the subject. I respect them, and I shall try to respect traditions and traditional positions with which I disagree. We should try not to use anyone else's suffering in pursuit of our political views on policing, which is the most political element of Northern Ireland life. Therefore, it is wrong to talk of a sop to undesirables. According to the hon. Gentleman's definition, I would fall into the ``undesirable'' category. It is not right, to use a colloquialism, to call something out of its name. There is an underlying, almost counterproductive, emotional factor in northern Irish attitudes to policing--our policing, our tradition, our allegiance. ``Our'' is, of course, sectional. We must all try to reach a stage where ``our'' truly means our.
<P>
We must have a policing service that we can identify with support, and sustain. I shall not discuss the inaccuracies of the name; that is beside the point. It exists historically. I shall not even try to present the views of a different section of the community.
<P>
Perceptions of policing are based on one's experiences. I spend much time in police stations, and I have no hesitation in stating that the senior police officers with whom I deal are highly efficient and professional. I have enormous respect for them as individuals and police officer. That is how it should be, but that was not always my experience.
<P>
If I was a different age, wore jeans and lived in the same place, I would not be able to say that. I have seen policing from a different perspective, and it is not a pleasant sight.
<P>
Whatever our emotional attachments and environments have made us, whatever the wider political connotations--and policing is political--I do not want to work them out on the sorrows, emotions or allegiances, which I respect, of other people. I merely want to point out that it is not a general perception; there is another point of view. We deal with that other point of view, leaving aside the emotional content, by getting everything in the Bill, and the whole process of policing, right as far as possible. We must ensure that no other generation of young people in the north of Ireland will see policing as many of them see it now, and that no other generation in the north of Ireland will suffer the experience of husbands, sons and relatives in the RUC being murdered in the most ghastly way. We must not play on those fears and emotions in any way. I wanted to express my point of view without, consciously or unconsciously, offending people's susceptibilities on the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister asked what was the weight of the argument and how many people had made representations. The argument does not depend on the number of people who advance it. In defence of that line, I say that few RUC people to whom I have spoken are particularly happy with what is proposed, and the feedback that I have received confirms that view.
<P>
I asked the Minister to state the Chief Constable's view on the matter, but answer came there none. There is logic in what I propose, in so far as there is plenty of Departments of State in Northern Ireland, many of which deliver important services. There is no problem there. The Minister must be straight with the Committee. The question is whether the concept, as he calls it, is to rename the Royal Ulster Constabulary by the back door, not this week, not this year, but farther down the line. As I said on Second Reading, because of the way in which the Bill is drafted the title RUC can easily be taken out, which leaves the Police Authority being responsible for the Northern Ireland police service. It is that disquiet which has been expressed to me. People want to know the real reasons for the proposal and at this juncture the Minister has not given a plausible explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I am tempted to react to the language that he used. He referred to the Government and Ministers ``pandering'' to undesirable elements. The hon. Gentleman can border on being extremely offensive when he says that someone or other has been accused of being the mouthpiece of the IRA as well. The hon. Gentleman must be very careful as to how he approaches the debate. He must recognise the role of direct rule Ministers in trying to deal with what is undoubtedly a difficult situation. It could be historical; we could go back and look at why we have direct rule in Northern Ireland and ask who failed. It was not the United Kingdom Government who brought about the problem. It arose because of deep-rooted divisions within the community, and many of the people represented by the hon. Gentleman and his party contributed to that in historical terms. We must be clear historically why we are here. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone says that Ministers come along for nine months and try to be experts. He should reflect that there has been continuity of debate by the Governments who have had the difficult job of administering the Province. By and large, bipartisanship prevails because of the decent common-sense of the British people, who want to find a resolution to the problem. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to use phrases about pandering to undesirable elements when we are trying to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Jones. Will the Minister be specific and tell me which of the people whom I represent have--I believe that this was the implication--behaved improperly?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is self-evidently not a point of order. It is an intervention with a question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is why I spoke of being tempted into pointless debate. I do not want to become involved in historical debate, because you would rule me out of order, Mr. Jones, and such debate is not relevant to the Bill. I only ask the hon. Gentleman to be careful in his language. He should not attribute base motives to respected Members of the House who are trying to make progress on difficult matters.
<P>
The basis of the change with respect to the all-encompassing term, the Northern Ireland police service, lies in the nature of the changes concerning transfer of staff. That will involve the whole range of people who will work within the ambit of influence of the Chief Constable--from telephonists and typists through specialist technical support staff to the level of the Association of Chief Police Officers. All such staff members contribute to a policing service.
<P>
<H5>6.42 pm</H5>

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.7.4 pm
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Unfortunately the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is not in his place as I was addressing a point that he raised. I want to put on record that the name of the RUC will not be changed by the Bill. That proud title will be preserved. I pay tribute to the work and duty of RUC officers over the years--the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone referred to its history. I paid tribute to the RUC in an earlier debate, but it is worth doing so again.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to letterheads that changed the title of the RUC. My staff have checked with the RUC press office, and to our knowledge, there is no such letterhead change. That is the best information that I can provide to the hon. Gentleman. If he has a copy of the letter, he should let me see it and we shall check it. Clearly, rumours are running, but that one does not stand examination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> There may not be evidence that the edict has gone out yet, but is the Minister's Department considering it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It would be for the RUC to decide its title and letterhead and I do not think that I would give detailed consideration to it. If the matter comes before me, I would have to consider it, but I do not foresee a request of that nature. It is a matter for the RUC to decide. Questions were asked by the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone on the subject. I shall read from the RUC's official newspaper, issue No. 5 published on January 1998, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The title, Royal Ulster Constabulary and its Reserve remains unchanged. The term Northern Ireland Police Service, refers collectively to the police force (RUC and RUCR) traffic wardens and civilian staff. In relation to the oath, every member of the police force shall, on appointment, be attested as a constable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to set out what that entails. We shall come later in the Bill to the oath change.
<P>
Importantly, in another part of this information document--the official newspaper of the RUC--it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Implementation of the proposals contained within the Bill will take some time to be realised but with goodwill and full participation by all involved parties, an important first step will have been made in securing further improvements to policing in Northern Ireland and ensuring that an even higher standard of service is delivered to the people of Northern Ireland.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are not my words. They are not the justification for the Bill. They are from an official document produced by the RUC. The way in which the matter has been approached by the RUC is not as suggested by the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. There is a much more mature approach in the wider community to the RUC than has been reflected by the hon. Gentlemen.
<P>
The RUC wants to provide a service; it recognises that change is coming and that benefits will flow from that change. It also recognises that there will be difficulties and problems in moving forward. We have already discussed some of those, but the Government are closely engaged in trying to ensure that those difficulties and problems are smoothed out as far as possible in the best interests not only of RUC officers but of all who provide a service for policing in Northern Ireland. I think that my case has been substantiated. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that he did not think that the case had been made, but it has been made by the words in the document to which I have referred, and I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
