whole tone of your paper is critical of a failure to devolve power,
which you describe as a missed opportunity. You say that, in your
estimation, &#147;the powers of Whitehall are left virtually
untouched&#148;. Will you say more about your assessment of the Bill
as a devolutionary
measure?</div>

								Peter
Facey:

						</i> The Bill devolves power by giving powers to
parish councils, and in relation to byelaws, and that is to be
welcomed. However, with respect to the powers of Westminster, and in
most policy areas, it reorganises the powers of local government and
gives local government the ability to administer things better, but it
does not actually shift power significantly downwards to local
authorities or
communities.</div>

State has talked about making a judgment against assessment criteria

between the local authorities in the relevant local area, but beyond
that we would like to see the involvement of citizens in the process.
If local authorities decide to go ahead despite there being concern in
the community, there should be a process by which the community can
trigger a referendum. That would ultimately ensure a broad degree of
consensus. If things are considered only between local authorities or
between community groups, and not beyond and without the engagement of
ordinary citizens, the process will be very
difficult.</div>

White Paper referred to broad consensus and the involvement of local

to see that power either strictly curtailed or removed completely, so
that a change takes place only with the agreement of local authorities

support means. If you are talking about agreement between the actual
local authorities involved, that is one thing but, if you are talking
about a broad section of opinion, that could be anything. I would have
to see a definition. If, in effect, you are going to abolish tiers of
government, ultimately the citizens or voters in those tiers should
have a say. That does not necessarily mean that they have to be offered
a referendum at the beginning, but if there were significant concern,
they should have a way in which to challenge the decision, so that they
can force a referendum on the issue and their voice can be
heard.</div>
					<a name="0702027000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment,
the Secretary of State could decide that there was broad agreement and
a local authority district council could be abolished. The citizens in

						</i> One of our big criticisms of the whole Bill is
that the empowerment process is always one way, and this is an example
of that. We can move in one direction, but once we go in that
direction, we cannot go back. The same thing applies to elected mayors
and executives. If we are to give local communities choice, they will
have to have the ability to go backwards or change direction. In this
case, simply saying to local authorities that they can go from
elections by thirds to all-out elections but that they can never go
back because that would not work for them, seems not particularly
empowering of local communities and local
councils.</div>

								Peter

						</i> We would probably recommend all-out elections,
because they would give local people a greater opportunity to have a
complete say over their local authority. Because we support moving to a
proportional system as they have in Scotland, we recognise that that
cannot be done under the system of elections by thirds. We would argue
that all-out elections are a positive thing, but that does not
necessarily mean that local communities have to take our view. We feel
that the decision should be with local communities, not necessarily
with
ourselves.</div>

						</i> But there was also evidence that it would
become more difficult for political parties to find candidates. There
are also situations in which the turnout for annual elections could be
less than for an election that affects the whole nature of a council.
There are strong arguments in favour of all-out elections, but our view
is that that should be a choice for local people and the local
authority&#151;not for us, even though we would recommend that it was
probably a better form of
governance.</div>

your point about it being a one-way process. But there has to be
certainty in government. How do you resolve the conflict between
wanting people to be constantly involved in having a say, yet if they
take decisions to have one-structure elections or one-structure
executives and then want to change their mind, the ramifications and
costs of that are huge. Surely we cannot be that beholden on trends and
shifts in opinion if we are to give certainty in how government is
delivered.</div>

						</i> There is certainly an argument for saying
that, if you change to a new form of governance, it should have to be
in place for a set period before it can be changed again. The triggers
should be high, but if you adopt an elected mayor and have three or
four elections under that mayor and the local people within the town or
community find that that does not suit them in the end, why can they
not raise a petition to change the process? At the moment, a citizen
cannot raise a petition to get rid of an elected mayor, as is the case
in Stoke where there is an elected
mayor.</div>

Stunell</b> (Hazel Grove) (LD): I want to link my question
back to what Mr. Facey has just said about citizen
involvement. One model is the indirectly elected leader. In many cases,
there will be councils that, even under the existing voting system, do

you are going to have a cabinet, it should reflect the broad views
within the community&#151;the majority view. In my own local

local government to give people a choice on electoral system. If we are
going to give them the choice on governance structure&#151;an elected
executive, an elected mayor, or a leader and cabinet&#151;we should
at the same time offer them the opportunity to change the electoral
system. The argument that first past the post produces strong outcomes
does not necessarily apply when there is an elected mayor, because the
argument is, &#147;You already have your governance, and therefore
the councillors&#146; role is to represent the views of the local
community.&#148; The experiment in Scotland, where they will have
proportional elections for local government starting in May, show that
that is practical. Hopefully, it will give local citizens more choice.
We support the Bill introduced by David Chaytor to give local

in which referendums have been used has been that we have in some ways
had government asking people questions. That is the wrong way to use
the tool. Referendums should be there so that people can express their
views to national or local government. I do not have a problem with the
idea of local authorities being able to say that they want to move to
one of the new governance structures and not have a referendum, but
there should be a mechanism by which citizens in a community who
disagree can put a brake on the process, have time to raise a
petition&#151;perhaps to a lower threshold than the one we
have&#151;and then hold a referendum. That way, you do not force
referendums where they are not needed, because there may be community
agreement, but if a council decides to move to a new structure and
there is a significant opinion within a local community against it, the
community should have the opportunity to trigger a referendum, in the
same way that local communities have the ability to force a mayor to
trigger a referendum on the decision. That system works in places such
as Germany, where communities can delay and block things by organising
petitions. That is what we are talking
about.</div>

effect, it means that citizens can raise a petition and, if that gets

referendum. Different countries do it differently, but such a power
exists in Sweden, Holland, parts of Germany, and parts of the United

						</i> One thing you have to do with any level of
devolution is give the institution some power to effect change. The
Bill goes some way to doing that, but parish councils have been used
very differently in different areas. There are certainly models of
really excellent parish councils that involve communities and actually
provide a vision for what that community wants to achieve, to change
and to develop. However, they can also be quite small-C conservative
and be used as a tool to block change. Therefore, it is very much about
giving parish councils the level of support that they need, making sure
that it is possible for new people to come into the process, and not
being too prescriptive about exactly what form a parish council has to
take. Obviously in the Bill, there are different options; it can be
called a parish council or a village council.</div>

parish perfectly because they are a type of community where that would
work. There are also parts of London where councils have already
devolved power to neighbourhood committees and to individual
councillors. In those circumstances, I would not want to say to them,
&#147;Actually, you have to go for a parish.&#148; Therefore, it

						</i> You would certainly need safeguards. If you
are going to move to an elected council or give more power to an
elected council, to then dilute it by having a large number of people
who are appointed seems contrary to the whole philosophy. There perhaps
need to be questions about the number that you can appoint and whether
they have voting rights or simply speaking rights. We need to preserve
the democratic ethos of a parish or community council and, at the same
time, recognise that they do not always have the expertise and that
there may be arguments for bringing in expertise. I think the basic
premise should be that the democratic system should be where the
representation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div>comes through and that, yes, you can bring in expertise, but there need
to be safeguards around
that.</div>

&#147;first among equals&#148; in this model. You also say that

						</i> I would like to comment on the local area
agreements. We welcome the Government&#146;s proposals to extend and
enhance them, together with what I believe is the Government&#146;s
stated intention to enhance the budgets tenfold. The Minister has said
that whereas the LAA budgets are currently &#163;500 million, they
will increase to &#163;5 billion. That is to be welcomed, but it is
still only a small proportion of the national money spent in local
areas.</div>
					<a name="0702027000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example is
Kent, where the current LAA budget is &#163;30 million. If that was
increased by tenfold&#151;to &#163;300 million&#151;it would be a
good thing, but the total public spending in Kent from national
agencies rather 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 81</div>than from local authorities is &#163;5 billion. So even extending the
amount to &#163;300 million leaves that figure as a small proportion
of the &#163;5 billion. In our view, a better model might be to
require the Secretary of State to divide up the &#163;5 billion
between what is genuinely local and genuinely national, and to give the
bodies that administer the LAA and the local authorities the power to
spend and to re-allocate all the local money assigned to that area.
Spending in Kent might then go up from &#163;300 million towards the
&#163;5 billion. Some spending would still be national, but a large
percentage would be genuinely local and would be spent by the local
authorities. As you may know, the Sustainable Communities Bill does
just that: it allocates local spending for local authorities.</div>
					<a name="0702027000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give a silly example of
national spending. The Highways Agency is going to spend &#163;7,500
on a puffin crossing in Ashford&#151;a small amount of money, but
there are dozens if not hundreds of such instances. Our view is that it
is absurd for an unelected national body such as the Highways Agency to
take that decision. The decision should be made by Ashford borough
council and the money should be within its control.</div>
					<a name="0702027000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The better model is not just to
increase LAA spending but to say that all local spending should go
through LAAs. The local authorities who participate in an LAA should
not be just &#147;first among equals&#148;, but the driving
force&#151;because they are elected.</div>
					<a name="0702027000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">If LAAs are really going to be
strengthened so that the bodies administering them can run the show as
the locally elected bodies, those bodies should have some say on the
kind of complementary policies that the Government should be
introducing in their areas, and on the national policies that affect
their areas, so that, with some caveats, they drive the relevant
Whitehall policies. Giving LAAs and local authorities those powers
would result in genuine
devolution.</div>
					<a name="0702027000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister, Mr. Woolas, said in the House a week or so ago
that it is often money rather than legislation that drives power these
days. Giving LAAs and local authorities control of all the money for
their area and the right to influence Whitehall policy for that area
would result in genuine devolution both of central power and money. The
Sustainable Communities Bill does exactly that, and could complement
the Bill
well.</div>

more expertise in relation to

Government need effectively to give power to local communities and
local authorities and then step back. Either local authorities have the
power to give fixed penalties, and the Secretary of State agrees, or
they do not. There is an idea that the powers are given. One of my pet
hates is the phrase, &#147;Good local authorities can have extra
power.&#148; It is not for central Government to work out what a good
local authority is; it is for the voters of that community to work that
out.</div>

about having a clear separation between the powers of local authorities
and those of central Government to make it as clear as possible to

the people whom they need to hold to account on those issues and what
the responsibilities are central Government are. A situation in which
you are constantly told, &#147;You can have this bit of power here,
but only if you do it in this way&#148; or &#147;I will say whether
you can have it or not&#148; is not genuine devolution of power. It
is an improvement, but it puts us into something of an
&#147;Oliver&#148; situation, in which local authorities are always
saying, &#147;Please, sir, can I have some more?&#148; I do not

						</i> It depends very much on how they are
administered. One of the big problems with patient forums was that they
did not have much in the way of support. One of the strengths of
community health councils was that they had very dedicated staff who
had both strong local experience and experience of the NHS. However,
because the support for patient forums was outsourced, there were
examples of forums, such as that for south London, being administered
in Birmingham.</div>
