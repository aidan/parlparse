<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000607"></a>The

Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I was debating the
slightly different approach to cost in clause 299, &#147;Expenses of
circulating members&#146; statement&#148;, in the context of a
general meeting. The costs in that clause appear to be tied to the
requirement to print and distribute the relevant statement.</div>
<a name="0606305000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context of clause 277,
what protection does there need to be in respect of expenses that might
be charged to a member for the cost of circulating the relevant
statement or resolution? In simple terms, the amendment would ensure
that there are checks and balances, that members are not taken
advantage of, and that costs that are not reasonable are not required
to be paid to or by members as a precondition of the circulation of a
resolution or a statement.</div>
<a name="0606305000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 288
appears to contain the power of a member to call a meeting at the
company&#146;s expense which, although I appreciate that it is not
the same, touches on similar issues in terms of the ability to require
the convening of a general meeting which could be used for the purposes
of considering a resolution. In relation to clause 288 the reverse
appears to apply, and shareholders may convene a meeting at the
company&#146;s cost without having any expense in those
circumstances.</div>
<a name="0606305000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks clarification of the issue of expense generally. If shareholders
are obliged to meet the costs&#151;I can see that they might be, to
ensure that the company is not prejudiced or disadvantaged&#151;there
should be appropriate methods of ensuring that they can be checked,
audited or measured so that shareholders do not have to bear
inappropriate
costs.</div><a name="0606305000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000609"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b>
The purpose of amendment No. 337 is to ensure that a company does not
ask the members requesting the circulation of a written resolution to
put in a bill for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 316</div>what would be unreasonable expenses. The measure is unnecessary, and I
shall tell the hon. Gentleman why. First, as he knows, not all
companies need have auditors, and in the terms of the amendment as
drafted, such a company would have to appoint someone because its
members wanted to circulate a resolution. That would be a significant
burden on
business.</div><a name="0606305000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
if the directors asked for an unreasonable sum before circulating a
resolution, they would not be complying with the relevant provisions,
so they would be committing an offence. As that is within the framework
of the legislation, further protections and safeguards are unnecessary.
I am sure the hon. Gentleman would accept that the expenses incurred
are minimal or relatively small. They certainly do not justify the
costs of auditing, so I hope he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
299 makes provisions for how the expenses for a members&#146;
statement should be covered. Subsection (1) gives members of a company
a new right to have a statement relating to an annual general meeting
circulated at the company&#146;s expense if their request is received
in appropriate time before the end of the financial year preceding the
meeting. The provision applies only to public companies, because only
public companies are required to hold AGMs. It would not be appropriate
to apply the requirement to private companies, as amendment No. 240
would do, as we will no longer require private companies to have a
statutory AGM.</div><a name="0606305000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
299(2) sets out what should happen when the criteria for a
members&#146; statement being circulated at the company&#146;s
expense are not met. I am not sure from what the hon. Gentleman said
what costs he is seeking to prevent a company from claiming. The
expenses of complying with clause 298 are simply those of circulating
the statement. In any event, the amendment fails to take into account
electronic communications, which may mean that the company does not
incur printing costs but only relatively minor costs through e-mailing
people. An unintended consequence of the amendment could be to deter
companies from using cheaper forms of communication such as e-mail
because they want to be sure of claiming back
costs.</div><a name="0606305000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 299(2)
also contains a provision whereby if the criteria for a statement to be
circulated at a company&#146;s expense are not met, the company is
let off circulating it if members have not tendered sufficient costs to
meet the expenses. To remove that provision would simply encourage the
occasional frivolous or disruptive request for the circulation of
material. Members requesting a statement will be able to claim back
their money if the general membership resolves that the company should
pay.</div><a name="0606305000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
referred to clause 288, which provides a remedy for members when
directors fail to call a meeting at their request. In those
circumstances it is appropriate to require the company to pay expenses
for members. I hope that, with those explanations, he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000610"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister&#146;s main point was that if
companies seek to misuse the provisions on members&#146; statements
by adding costs, they will be committing an offence. That was her most
powerful argument and a valid point, and it is good that it is on
the record. The message will be sent that if
somebody 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 317</div>seeks to use the provisions to add inappropriate costs as a means of
disincentivising shareholders from exercising their rights, that will
be an offence and will carry commensurate sanctions. In the light of
that powerful argument, it would be wrong for me to detain the
Committee
further.</div><a name="0606305000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a company has a large shareholder base the cost of sending of hard
copies might not be huge but could be significant. I hear what the
Minister says about that and on sanctions. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000611"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have just one small point on the clause. We
touched this morning on a company&#146;s right to apply for relief in
the event that clause 275, on members requiring the circulation of a
written resolution, is abused. Such an application can be made by a
company or</div><a name="0606305000532"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;another person
who claims to be
aggrieved&#148;.</div><a name="0606305000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">How wide is
that intended to extend? Will anyone who feels aggrieved have locus
standi? What is the ambit of that
provision?</div><a name="0606305000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000612"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That reference in clause 278 mirrors the general
meetings provisions in clause 300, which is entitled
&#147;Application not to circulate members&#146; statement&#148;.
So those words are just a restatement of the provisions in clause 300.
But the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific question is
yes.</div><a name="0606305000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I take a slight liberty? This morning, I made an error, which I would
like to correct, if I can. During the exchange on clause 271, there was
a slight confusion. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the Bill would
allow a company to use its articles to override the written resolution
procedures for statutory resolutions. I think that I answered yes, but
apparently the answeris no.</div>
<a name="0606305000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606305000613"></a><b class="B">Mark
Hunter</b> (Cheadle) (LD): It was
close.</div><a name="0606305000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000614"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> There were two possible answers, so I had a 50 per
cent. chance of getting it right, but I got it
wrong.</div><a name="0606305000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important for the decision-making procedures of a company that the
articles cannot create alternative written resolution procedures or
require meetings. That is the effect of clause 283. That is quite
different from the ability of companies to entrench provisions in their
articles, as we discussed earlier. For example, if a company wishes, on
the agreement of all its members, to entrench higher than the 75 per
cent. majority, it may do so. However, it is important for the
protection of minority shareholders that the articles cannot require
statutory resolutions to be taken in a meeting. Otherwise, it would
limit the rights of members to require the circulation of written
resolutions and accompanying statements on a number of key matters, and
remove a particularly important new right for a member of the
scheme.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000615"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the clarification on clause
271. Outsiders watching these proceedings can be sure that we are clear
about the ambit and operation of that clause in the context of clause
283&#151;the clause to which I was referring in our earlier
debate.</div> <a name="0606305000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I heard what
the Minister said about the ambit of clause 278. In essence, it covers
anybody who might be interested, and therefore is fairly wide-ranging.
I do not know whether further clarification is on offer, but it does
not sound like it. On that basis, I am content with what she said, and
shall not press the
matter.</div><a name="0606305000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000616"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 228, in
clause 279, page 128, line 4, leave out &#145;acting&#146; and
insert &#145;duly authorised to
act&#146;.</div><a name="0606305000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 279
deals with the procedure for signifying agreement to a written
resolution. Again, this is a probing amendment seeking clarification on
how that would take effect. Under the provisions, a member is deemed to
be bound</div> <a name="0606305000533"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when the
company receives from him (or from someone acting on his behalf) an
authenticated document...identifying the
resolution...and...indicating his
agreement&#148;.</div>
<a name="0606305000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Authentication appears to relate to the
document, rather than to its execution. I therefore want to probe in
relation to the protections that might be afforded to ensure the
avoidance of any potential for fraud or for a person to intercept and
return an authenticated document&#151;purportedly on the
shareholder&#146;s behalf&#151;on which, it appears, the company
could be automatically reliant.</div>
<a name="0606305000565"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="0606305000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, we
are entering a new and different world, with e-commerce and the use of
electronic signatures. Subsection (4)
says:</div><a name="0606305000534"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A written
resolution is passed when the required majority...have signified
their agreement&#148;,</div> <a name="0606305000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
subsection (3) says that once something is signified it &#147;may not
be revoked.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
slightly technical, but the purpose of the amendment is to say that the
person is duly authorised to act on the member&#146;s behalf, so as
to make it clear that there must be some formal
authorisation.</div>
<a name="0606305000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Traditionally,
that has been done through such means as power of attorney or other
appropriate legal methods. However, the company should not be able
merely to accept the receipt of a document on behalf of another person
without a requirement to check that that person has been duly
authorised to execute the document on the other person&#146;s behalf.
We need to ensure that there is proper execution and that such
provisions are not capable of being misused. I hope that the Minister
can clarify the manner in which authorisation is to be provided and
give some reassurance that the system cannot be misused in some
way.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000618"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am probing on that issue more than anything
else, in trying to ensure that we are clear on whether a company can
rely on the power of authority or whether it should have to rely on
actual authority and be under a duty to check. Having received a
document that is purported to carry the authority of the member, can
the company rely on that automatically? That is intent of the existing
drafting of the Bill, but the purpose of the amendment is to probe that
and ensure that we are striking the right
balance.</div>
<a name="0606305000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000619"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am reflecting on what on earth apparent as
opposed to actual means&#151;no doubt I am going to get a lesson in
law, as I presumably have less than a 50 per cent. chance of getting
that one
right.</div><a name="0606305000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
amendment on evidence was raised in another place, albeit in relation
to companies&#146; communication, so I shall respond in a similar
way. The clause sets out the procedures for signifying agreement to a
written resolution. The provision allows for either the member or
someone acting on their behalf to signify that agreement. The problem
that the amendment tries to address is that people could try to signify
agreement on someone else&#146;s behalf without having the proper
authority.</div> <a name="0606305000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, we
have dealt with the issue elsewhere in the Bill. We considered those
points when the Opposition raised a similar theme in another place and
as a result we clarified the requirements for authentication. Clause
798(4) allows companies to make provisions in their articles for
requiring reasonable evidence of the authority of someone acting on
behalf of a member. Given that position, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000620"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I thank the Minister for her response. In
essence, companies are to deal with the matter case by case, as they
decide whether to put relevant provisions into their articles under
clause 798(4), which states
that</div><a name="0606305000535"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;nothing in this
section affects any provision of the company&#146;s articles under
which the company may require reasonable evidence of the authority of
the former to act on behalf of the
latter.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that I could make on that is that there has to have been
entrenchment in the articles. A different approach would have been
codification, whereby companies would automatically have that right.
Nevertheless, I understand where the Minister is coming from, and if
there is the flexibility to ensure that companies can take such steps,
that is helpful in answering the point that I flagged up. On the basis
of her response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 231, in
clause 286, page 129, line 30, leave out from &#145;10%' to end of
line 37.</div><a name="0606305000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 286(3)
states that 10 per cent. of members are needed to require directors to
call a general meeting. The clause then states a number of exemptions
that appear to apply to private companies, which are not currently
reflected in section 368 of the Companies Act 1985. Essentially those
exemptions seem to allow the lower percentage of 5 per cent. in the
event that someone has already used the right in clause 286(4) in the
12 months since the end of the previous general meeting. I am trying to
understand the thought processes behind those provisions and to
ascertain whether there is a risk that the additional provisions in
subsections (3)(a) and (b) may in any way encourage continual
requisition by
shareholders.</div><a name="0606305000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
there are provisions relating to relief, but the question is whether
the additional language could in any way be misused to encourage
continual requisition. I should also appreciate clarification on what
paragraph (b) is actually driving at, and on the problems, errors or
risks that it seeks to address. It was the absence of such
clarification that led us to table the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000622"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I was hoping to cover these issues this morning in
relation to an earlier amendment, but that was withdrawn. This is a
flip-floppy bit of amending by the Opposition. I say that particularly
because their representative in the House of Lords, Lord Hodgson of
Astley Abbotts, moved amendments at every stage to reduce the
thresholds from 10 to 5 per cent. To pick just one quote, he
said:</div> <a name="0606305000536"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government are wrong not to accept a 5 per cent. threshold because, if
a company has nothing to hide, there is nothing to fear. In the
circumstances, 5 per cent. is still a pretty high
barrier.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 27
February 2006; Vol. 679, c.
59.]</div><a name="0606305000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could give other quotes,
but in the interests of speed and getting through the business before
us, let us leave it at that.</div>
<a name="0606305000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would reverse the
one that was pressed for in another place. The rationale behind that
amendment was that, in the absence of a statutory annual general
meeting, we needed to make it easier for members of a private company
to call a general meeting to hold their directors to account.
Opposition Members in the House of Lords attached great importance to
that on the grounds of</div>
<a name="0606305000537"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shareholder rights, shareholder
democracy and protection of minority
shareholders.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 27 February 2006; Vol. 679, c.
59.]</div><a name="0606305000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We understood
those concerns and felt that members should have a voice in the
company&#146;s decision making, but we saw no justification for
imposing potentially significant administrative and cost burdens on
public companies, given that it will be a statutory requirement for
them to continue to have a voice at the AGM. That is why we introduced
the alternative threshold for private companies and reduced it from 10
to 5 per cent. of voting rights. In that context, members will have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 321</div>that right only once a year&#151;it is not a continuing
right&#151;and 12 months must elapse before they can reconvene on the
5 per cent. basis.</div> <a name="0606305000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not quite sure where Conservative Members are coming from, but I
hope that they will continue to champion for shareholder rights,
shareholder democracy and the protection of minorities, which we shall
be discussing later, and that they will not pursue the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000623"></a>James

<a name="0606305000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, the purpose behind
the amendment is to obtain clarification of the intent behind the
wording of clause 286(3) to ensure that it cannot be open to abuse and
that it strikes the right balance, ensuring that the interests of
shareholders and members are properly protected, while not
inappropriately disadvantaging the company. The Minister&#146;s
comments are helpful in assuring us that the provisions are not open to
abuse, that they will provide private limited companies and their
shareholders with flexibility, and that minority shareholders&#146;
interests will be protected. In the light of that clarification, I am
pleased to say that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000624"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause relates to the power of members to
call a meeting at the company&#146;s expense, thus enabling
shareholders to requisition a general meeting. My question is about
subsection (7), which deals with the provision under which reasonable
expenses must be reimbursed by the company. The subsection refers to
&#147;fees or other remumeration&#148; and
states:</div><a name="0606305000538"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any sum
so reimbursed shall be retained by the company out of any sums due or
to become due from the company by way of fees or other remuneration in
respect of their services to such of the directors as were in
default.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, if the company has to pay money to shareholders, it can
then deduct such sums from the defaulting directors who did not comply
with the clause. Again, reference is made to fees or other
remuneration, so the provision appears to relate to sums that may be
payable directly to individual directors.</div>
<a name="0606305000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question is what happens in
the circumstances of a contract for services, such as when the services
of a director are provided through a service company, and therefore
payment is directed to that company rather than directly to the
individual. Are such circumstances covered, so that the company could
deduct the relevant sums from any charges that might be payable by the
service company, as contrasted with any &#147;fees or other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 322</div>remuneration&#148;, a term that relates to an
employment-type arrangement? Really my question is about whether the
clause is wide enough to cover such
eventualities.</div><a name="0606305000116"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000628"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We now move on to the notice periods required
for general meetings. Under clause 290, general meetings can be
convened on 14 days&#146; notice, or, in the case of an annual
general meeting, at least 21 days&#146; notice. The amendments raise
the exciting point, which is often debated in relation to time periods
for general meetings, of what we mean by days. I know that it sounds
all very arcane, but corporate lawyers have such esoteric debates about
meanings in the articles. I can see that hon. Members are rapt by the
potential of the debate.</div>
<a name="0606305000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000629"></a>David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000630"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. The not
necessarily happy hours spent on having these sometimes awkward debates
are, thankfully, nearly expunged from my memory.</div>
<a name="0606305000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Normally a
company&#151;particularly a plc, for which the issue is
significant&#151;must provide in its articles that in calculating x
days&#146; notice, no account will be taken of the day of the sending
out of the notice, or the following day, which relates to receipt of
the notice, or the date of the meeting itself. I recognise that there
appears to be nothing in the Bill to deny a company the great pleasure
of having a lawyer draft such provisions into its articles. Indeed,
clause 290(3) specifically contemplates that possibility.</div>
<a name="0606305000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to know whether we can
save companies the cost and expense of the extremely exciting process
of encapsulating such provisions in their articles by being very
specific and clear about setting out the notice period of 14 or 21
days, although I recognise that my amendment may not be perfect. This
obviously becomes more germane in as much as the normal notice period
of full resolutions is now being reduced to 14 days in almost all
circumstances. Therefore the time periods may become more
critical.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 323</div><a name="0606305000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606305000631"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): My hon. Friend makes
a good and practical point. Clause 292 refers to 21 and 14 days. In
practice, it is 24 days and 17 days, and so it is unclear without the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000632"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. It is
these detailed and practical issues that practitioners on the ground
have to get to terms with. Therefore, the amendment aims to give some
clarity and to ensure that these rather detailed provisions are
simplified in some way. We are codifying the provision on the face of
the Bill. It is entirely possible that there is a subsection buried in
its remaining parts which I have yet not discovered during my bedtime
reading. I am sure that the Minister will point it out to me with great
alacrity if there is. Indeed, I hope that that is the case. Amendment
No. 340 makes the same point in the context of clause 295 in respect of
special notices. I look forward with excitement to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="0606305000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000633"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I know that the issue is dear to the hearts of many
lawyers, some of whom are members of the Committee. Table A mentions
notices of meetings and refers to clear days. That means that its
wording is certainly in line with what the amendment suggests. The
Companies Acts, by contrast, have never referred to clear days. I am
told that this has been settled law in England and Wales since a case
in 1935. In that very leading case, the judge said that he did not
think there was any doubt about the position. Consequently, we did not
think that the amendments were necessary. However, just to make the
hon. Gentleman feel really good, if he feels strongly and thinks that
they substantially clarify the point, I do not have a problem with
taking them away and seeing whether we can put them in the
Bill.</div><a name="0606305000130"></a>

the back of my head that if one follows the clear days&#146; path in
the articles, it is three extra days, and if one follows the path
through the statutory route, it is two extra days. I see nods from
civil servants. I think my hon. Friend is saying that it would be
easier if we simply said what it was and then everybody would be
clearer.</div><a name="0606305000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000636"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
timely, learned and detailed intervention. While it may seem a trivial
point, quite a lot of time can be taken up during a flotation, or
something like that, finding out what the admission date is likely to
be to ensure that things have been properly adhered to. There may be
some merit in trying to put something in the table A articles. That
might be the most appropriate way to clarify what is meant by clear
days.</div><a name="0606305000133"></a>

clause provides flexibility for a notice of a meeting of shareholders
to be provided in a different way from the common method of sending out
a hard copy notice through the post to members of a company. I welcome
the flexibility that is now embodied in the Bill. Its recognition that
practice has moved on and that the way business is undertaken more
generally has changed with the use of e-commerce to facilitate
notifications, trade and so on is to be
applauded.</div><a name="0606305000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to gain some clarification on the concept
of publication of notice of a meeting on a website. There is some
residual concern&#151;I know that this issue was touched on in the
other place&#151;about members needing to receive a physical
notification that something has gone up on a website. An additional
step has to be undertaken so that shareholders are not expected to have
to go to a company&#146;s website on a daily basis to see whether
something has been put
there.</div><a name="0606305000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Investment
Management Association states that clause
292(2)</div><a name="0606305000539"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;indicates that the
company has a duty to notify its members of the existence of the notice
on its web site but it is not clear how such a notification is to take
place. We believe it is important that companies notify their members
directly that they have published the notice and that it should be
clarified how this should be effected. We would be concerned if it was
merely sufficient to put the notice of the meeting on the
web.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
amendment No. 238 is to probe and seek some further clarification for
all interested parties of what is envisaged in practice here.
Notification is understood, but some clarity is needed to ensure that
members are properly notified and that there is no lacuna. I do not
think there is, but some clarification is
needed.</div><a name="0606305000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000640"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> As the amendment stands, there would be an
unintended consequence, which is that members could not be notified by
telephone. The amendment would limit the flexibility. I agree entirely
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentiment that members should be
notified by a company when a resolution or a notice of a meeting is put
on a website. Members cannot be expected to check the website just in
case the company has suddenly called a meeting or if information has
suddenly been posted. That is why we have imposed a requirement in the
communications provisions.</div>

and paragraph 13 of schedule 6, or paragraph 16 of schedule 7, place a
requirement for companies to notify intended recipients directly of the

language, by means of a website. That includes all written resolutions,
notices and meetings, so we think that there is no need to double bank
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000641"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for placing on
the record the direct cross-references to which the point relates,
because with a Bill of this length I wonder whether the reader, who
might already be nodding on reaching the clause, would make it through
the schedules&#151;he might be struggling somewhat. Therefore, a
direct cross-reference to those provisions is
helpful.</div><a name="0606305000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
I know that in other parts of the Bill provisions state, &#147;See
section x,&#148; so in that context might it be considered
appropriate to carry out cross-referencing of some sort to the schedule
so that it is absolutely clear for the reader that those more detailed
provisions are in the schedule to give some
assurance?</div><a name="0606305000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that the Minister referred to notification by telephone in
relation to posting a notice on the website, which is an interesting
development that needs some consideration. It is a different approach
from the manner in which business has been undertaken in that regard. I
see the arguments in terms of flexibility. The only cautionary note
that I would sound is as to whether, evidentially, there may be issues
such as someone saying, &#147;Well, we telephoned you,&#148;
whereas no record may have been left of whether such a notice or a
telephone call had been
made.</div><a name="0606305000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that
the need for flexibility is laudable in terms of providing that basis
and background, because we clearly want to ensure that businesses are
not unnecessarily prescribed in how they conduct their business while
at the same time ensuring that appropriate protections are put in place
to ensure that provisions cannot be misused.</div>
<a name="0606305000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know whether the
Minister, who is clutching a piece of paper, wants to say anything
further in that
regard.</div><a name="0606305000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000642"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> If it helps the hon. Gentleman, a telephone could
be used with the member&#146;s consent, but I was using that
illustration to show the flexibility that we want to retain rather than
prescribe. While I can look at cross-referencing, it has rightly been
drawn to my attention that the Bill has already grown in length beyond
anything we all envisaged when we embarked on the review eight years
ago. We can provide cross-referencing. The problem is that there would
probably be cross-referencing right across the Bill, which would add
hugely to the number of
pages.</div><a name="0606305000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can look at
the issue, but reflecting even on our discussion this morning, there
are probably instances where we have already missed the potential for
cross-referencing. There will always be that difficulty in a Bill of
this size.</div>
<a name="0606305000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000643"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
reply. Yes, the Bill has grown, but we had hoped that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 326</div>would be the appropriate length when we began, rather than growing
through the process. However, I shall put that issue to one
side.</div><a name="0606305000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s comments on shareholders consenting to receive
notification by telephone is the key issue: if consent has been
provided, the important thing is that there is an understanding almost
by contract between the company and its shareholders as to how,
individually, notification should be received to cover such
issues.</div><a name="0606305000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that clarification and debate are helpful to people outside
the room who have expressed concerns as to what this will mean in
practice for the notification provisions. In the context of the
Minister&#146;s comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

is another probing amendment. Section 381 of the 1985 Act contemplates
auditors being notified of a written resolution. There was thought to
be merit in the auditors being involved in the process, given that they
will want to be actively engaged with the company in the context of
their audit. They should know when resolutions are sought to be passed,
particularly when we are talking about issues such as share capital
reorganisations. From an audit perspective, there is a need to know
that a meeting has been properly held or convened and that a resolution
has been properly passed. The amendment probes why it was felt that
such a notification requirement might not be
appropriate.</div><a name="0606305000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
acknowledge that auditors are not required to receive formal
notification of meetings, although in practice I think that they
probably would, but they are under the written resolution approach in
the section that I mentioned. This is a general point about continuing
engagement by the auditors to ensure good standards of corporate
governance. I shall not press the amendment to the vote, as it is
probing and intended to find out why the auditor&#146;s requirement
to be notified has been relaxed in certain provisions. I look forward
to the Minister&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000647"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause deals with what needs to be
included in the notice of meeting. Obviously, that is the time, place
and date and so on. The issue that I raise concerns proxies. Other
provisions deal with the requirement to give notification of proxies
and of the right to appoint one to attend the meeting in one&#146;s
stead, which is an appropriate thing to be pointed out to shareholders.
I therefore want to be clear that the clause and the provisions
relating to proxies are to be read together, rather than in isolation,
and that stating that the contents of a notice of meeting are as set
out in the clause in no way overrides or undermines the following-on
provisions that relate to the appointment of proxies, the requirement
for companies to specify that right and the last time for appointment
of that right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000649"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> One small point: subsection (1) refers to
&#147;the Companies Acts&#148;. There was a small debate in the
other place about that reference, in which Lord Sainsbury
said:</div><a name="0606305000541"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This is
referring not to any previous Companies Act, but to the Companies Act

slightly lost when I read that reference. My reading is that
&#147;Companies Acts&#148;, the plural, would under normal
circumstances suggest previous legislation. If what Lord Sainsbury said
is correct&#151;it is possible that this was picked up on later in
the Lords debate, but unfortunately I have obviously not picked up on
it&#151;the reference should be to the Bill. If it means previous
Acts, it should be somewhat clearer. I would be grateful for
clarification.</div>

consolidation. I would hope that the phrase is a reference to
&#147;the Act&#148;&#151;as it will grow and be
consolidated&#151;so that there is no need to cross-refer back. I
would therefore appreciate some clarification from the Minister on
whether we are talking about Acts in the plural or an Act,
singular.</div><a name="0606305000176"></a>

must demand a poll when he considers that the outcome would be

<a name="0606305000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would insert
additional wording into the clause so that the chairman must demand a
poll when he is aware that the outcome of the decision or vote will be
different from that reached on a show of hands. Its purpose is to
clarify that the chairman&#146;s duty is always to demand a poll when
he or she is aware that the outcome would be different from that
reached on a show of
hands.</div><a name="0606305000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We touched on
that briefly en passant this morning in relation to other clauses.
Under regulation 46 in table A of the Companies (Tables A to F)
Regulations 1985, a resolution voted at a company meeting is decided on
a show of hands&#151;one vote per member for each shareholder present
or, in the case of a corporate shareholder, represented, but not
proxies, unless the articles provide for that&#151;unless a poll,
which is a ballot of members on the basis of one vote per share, is
called. Common law has clarified that the chairman&#146;s duty is to
ascertain the true sense of the meeting. When the chairman&#146;s
proxy is aware that if a poll were called 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 329</div>the outcome would be different from that reached on a show of hands, he
has a duty to demand a poll if he can do so under the company&#146;s
articles of association. Guidance from the Institute of Chartered
Secretaries and Administrators emphasises that
duty.</div><a name="0606305000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Investment Management Association highlighted a case when that approach
was not followed. It cited the annual general meeting of GoshawK
Insurance Holdings, a re-insurer, when an advisory resolution on the
remuneration of the chairman was decided on a show of hands and a poll
would have defeated it. The Investment Management Association suggests
that in such circumstances the chairman would have been more
appropriately advised to call a poll. I cannot comment on that in
detail, nor can I say whether that was appropriate, but I am sure that
the company sought appropriate legal advice and that it acted in a way
that it thought was
appropriate.</div><a name="0606305000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
raises an issue of when claims or counter-claims might be made in that
context, and whether something was done appropriately or whether a poll
should have been called. The amendment seeks to clarify and codify. It
is interesting that the Investment Management Association stated in its
briefing
note:</div><a name="0606305000542"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
consider it important that the law in this area is clarified and that
the current Company Law Reform Bill is an opportunity to address this.
As proposed...it should be clarified that the chairman&#146;s
duty is always to demand a poll when he is aware that the outcome would
be different from that reached on a show of hands, regardless of
whether the vote is binding on the
company.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against
that backdrop, I commend the amendment to the
Committee.</div><a name="0606305000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000654"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> There is a common law duty on the chairman to
demand a poll on a vote if he considers that the outcome would be
different from that reached on a show of hands. We do not see any
justification or advantage in attempting to codify that in the way
suggested. Let me explain why. The Bill sets out the rules for how
companies take decisions, but it does not claim to be a comprehensive
code. Some things are still dealt with under the general common law of
meetings, which applies to all sorts of meetings, not only company
ones.</div><a name="0606305000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
13 also leaves a lot of flexibility for companies to deal with such
matters in their articles. I am sure members of the Committee accept
that that flexibility is an important feature of the United Kingdom
corporate governance structure&#151;all the more so for the large
majority of small private companies to which the provisions also apply.
The whole issue of voting at general meetings was subject to extensive
consultation by the company law review. Despite the view of the
Investment Management Association, which clearly has advised some
members of the Committee, we found that there was not a consensus on
change under the existing
provisions.</div><a name="0606305000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
company law review found that practice can evolve rapidly. It saw a
case for developing good practice guidance in polls, but noted that
there was already a common law requirement governing the calling of a
poll on resolutions likely to prove contentious. It is for the chairman
to control the meeting and for the shareholders at the meeting to
approve his appointment as chairman. There is no good reason for
legislative intervention in the relationship between the chairman who,
most likely, is also a director or a shareholder, and the other
shareholders at the meeting.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 330</div><a name="0606305000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">All shareholders, whether voting
in person or by proxy, have the right&#151;under clause 304(2), it
only requires five of them&#151;to demand a poll on resolution.
Furthermore, if the shareholders consider that the chairman has acted
improperly or out of order, they may seek remedy under clause 157,
which requires the directors to act in accordance with the
company&#146;s constitution. Section 459 of the 1985 Act would enable
a member or group of members to claim against the company on the
grounds that the company&#146;s affairs had been conducted in a
manner that was unfairly prejudicial to their
interests.</div><a name="0606305000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000655"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Obviously, the issue in dispute is whether a
different legal approach is developing as a matter of law or practice
in respect of advisory resolutions compared with resolutions that are
not advisory. As I said earlier, and to which the Minister responded,
the common law duties on a chairman are clear in circumstances in which
he or she is aware that a poll may lead to a different result. I
understand the right hon. Lady&#146;s reluctance to intervene by
codifying things when that common law duty is
understood.</div><a name="0606305000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position that concerns us relates to advisory resolutions, because the
law on that is still developing, but in the light of the
Minister&#146;s comments and the need to obtain consensus and general
practice on what is appropriate in developing law, it would not be
right for me to pursue the amendment. I am sure that there will be
continuing debate among practitioners and corporates as a whole on
whether advisory resolutions have different status in the context of
corporate law. If there were a dispute, I am sure that the courts would
rule on it appropriately in due course. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 244, in
clause 304, page 136, line 18, leave out paragraph
(b).</div><a name="0606305000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause touches
on the issues that we have just debated and relates to the right to
demand a poll. Clause 304(1) states that a company&#146;s articles
will be void if they seek to exclude the right to demand a poll save in
two circumstances, which
are</div><a name="0606305000543"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the election of the

meeting&#148;.</div><a name="0606305000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 244 questions the latter point. The adjournment of a meeting can be
an important issue, and I can think of cases when the subject of
whether a highly-charged meeting should adjourn has been quite
significant. In those circumstances where things are in the press and
the situation is volatile or charged, delaying something by virtue of
granting an adjournment can have a significant impact on public
companies. Its share value might be affected if the delay and
uncertainty continue, and so an adjournment, if granted, could tilt the
balance in favour of one outcome or the other.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 331</div><a name="0606305000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment questions the right
for a poll to be refused for the adjournment of a meeting if that is
encompassed within the articles of association. It is obviously
possible in practice that a company, as a public company, might not
take that provision in any event, because of procedure and the general
practice that arises in the corporate world. It is worth underlining
that point about the potential impact that might arise if an
adjournment is called and is successful, or, indeed, if it is
unsuccessful. There is certainly some merit in allowing a poll to be
called in such circumstances.</div>
<a name="0606305000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000657"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am afraid that I cannot agree with the
Conservatives. The amendment is identical to one that was tabled in the
House of Lords, and I shall repeat what was said there. I think they
are worried that a company could frustrate a group of shareholders who
might have made special arrangements to attend a general meeting by
proposing an adjournment of the meeting and forcing it
through.</div> <a name="0606305000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
the amendment would be that enough members acting together could
require a poll on a vote to adjourn the meeting. In our view, that
would be a disruptive change for the broad range of companies that have
taken advantage of the current position, and it could well frustrate
the majority of members who turn up to attend the meeting. There is
nothing to stop members appointing proxies to attend meetings in their
place if it is difficult for them to attend in person. We have
discussed that already. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have used the
Bill to extend proxy rights so that proxies always have the right to
speak, and not only at private company meetings. We feel that the
amendment is unnecessarily cumbersome and bureaucratic, and urge the
hon. Gentleman to pay heed to the debate that took place in the other
place and withdraw his amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000658"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am aware that the subject was debated in
the other place, and I have revisited the point because it is important
in achieving certainty in the corporate arena. It sits somewhat
unhappily with our previous debate about the chairman&#146;s duty in
normal circumstances under case law to call a poll if he or she
believes that the outcome of a poll would be different from the outcome
on a show of hands. I hear what the Minister has said and I note that
the matter was debated in the other place. She has indicated clearly
that she will not give ground and it would therefore be inappropriate
for me to delay the Committee further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000659"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I seek a couple of points of clarification.
The first is on a matter which we touched on earlier, but I am not sure
whether I couched it in the form of a question. Will it be possible for
a company member to attend a general meeting and appoint a proxy at the
same time by splitting his entitlement to allow the proxy to use some
of his shares? If so, a member could bring along his professional
advisory team by appointing them as proxies, which would give them
speaking rights and so on at the meeting. That is not currently the
case.</div><a name="0606305000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other issue,
to which I am sure we will come back when we debate nominee
shareholders, is the number of proxies that can be appointed in
relation to one shareholding. I assume that if someone holds 100
shares, he should technically be able to appoint as many proxies as he
likes based on the reference in clause 307(2) to the number of shares
or &#163;10 multiples of stock held. There is therefore the potential
for a large number of proxies to be appointed under one shareholding.
That may be appropriate in the context of the debate that we will have
on nominee shareholders and their rights, but it could be subject to
abuse. Does the Minister have any thoughts on
that?</div><a name="0606305000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000660"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I look forward to our discussions on nominee
shareholders. As I told Conservative members of the Committee outside
the Room, we are trying to resolve the matter with all parties
concerned so that we can suggest a way of operating that commands broad
consensus from those involved. We are close to doing
so.</div><a name="0606305000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is nothing to
stop a member appointing a proxy and attending a meeting himself. If
there were a vote, the member&#146;s vote would override that of the
proxy. I hope that that covers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern. I
believe that he also tabled an amendment that was not
selected.</div><a name="0606305000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000661"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It dealt with a separate issue: the ability
of members to split their holding, not to vote, but to give their
professional advisers speaking rights. From what the Minister said, I
think that it would be possible for a member to split his entitlement
to appoint a proxy and entitle him to attend to speak but not to
vote.</div><a name="0606305000213"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000662"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That is correct. On the other issue, which we will
have to discuss further, under the current law an activist could buy
100 shares in the names of 100 different people to enable him to attend
an AGM. If he were intent on disrupting a meeting, he could do so, but
he might find an easier way without having to buy 100 shares and
appoint proxies. I am not sure about appointing proxies, but in those
circumstances, as in the House or wherever similar meetings are held,
it is up to the chairman to take a view on how to control any
disruption, whether it is caused by members, by proxies or by anyone

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000663"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 342, in
clause 310, page 138, line 19, leave out subsection
(3).</div><a name="0606305000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2)
sets out the appropriate time periods to appoint a proxy. In normal
circumstances, that is 48 hours before the meeting or the adjourned
meeting is held. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify subsection
(3), which
states:</div><a name="0606305000545"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
calculating the periods mentioned in subsection (2) no account shall be
taken of any part of a day that is not a working
day.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is that
that may lead to confusion. The practice at present is that 48 hours
means what it says. Therefore, if a shareholders&#146; meeting were
to take place at 10 o&#146;clock on a Monday morning, the proxy form
would have to be back by 10 o&#146;clock on the Saturday
morning&#151;in other words, 48 hours before the meeting. The
registrars of plcs are geared up to receive notifications of such
matters at the weekend, and although it may not be the most convenient
time, it is practical and it can be
achieved.</div><a name="0606305000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
reading of clause 310(3), it appears that no account should be taken of
any part of a day that is not a working day. Therefore, to take my
example of a general meeting at 10 o&#146;clock on a Monday morning,
that seems to suggest that the 10 hours before the meeting on Monday
morning could be taken into account, but not the hours of Saturday and
Sunday, so the remaining 38 hours would have to be calculated counting
back from 23.59 on the Friday
night.</div><a name="0606305000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether that is the intention behind the provision as drafted,
because it adds complexity to companies&#146; assessments of the time
allowed for the receipt of a notification of a proxy. Indeed, it may
also limit the amount of time that a shareholder may legitimately have
to arrange for a proxy to be
appointed.</div><a name="0606305000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
becomes even more relevant in the context of our debate on time periods
for general meetings. Most general meetings, other than annual general
meetings, are held on 14 days&#146; notice. The time available in
which to appoint a proxy is therefore quite tight because the proposal
limits even further the time that a shareholder has to identify an
appropriate proxy who can attend the meeting on their behalf and to
complete and return the appropriate
document.</div><a name="0606305000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
that the provision appears to change current practice and has the
potential to disadvantage shareholders of a company as it affects their
ability to get an appropriate appointment notification to the company
within the time allowed. I would appreciate clarification as the
proposal seems to add
complexity.</div><a name="0606305000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000664"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b><b class="B"> </b>The purpose and intent of the clause are to
do entirely the opposite. The clause is meant to simplify matters. It
reflects an implementation of recommendations from the shareholder
voting working group, which was conciliated by Paul Myners. We
introduced the measure on his
recommendation.</div><a name="0606305000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
working group&#146;s concern was to alleviate companies and their
registrars of the unnecessary burden of having to receive and process
proxy appointments over a weekend. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 334</div>The hon. Gentleman understands that under current law, a company must
take receipt of a proxy appointment up to, for example, 11 am on a
Saturday and process it in time for a general meeting held at 11 am on
the Monday. I understand that he wants to protect investors by ensuring
that they can appoint their proxies as close as practicable to the time
of the general meeting, but we believe that it is not unreasonable,
given the working group&#146;s recommendations, to require that proxy
appointments are made on working
days.</div><a name="0606305000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I point out again
that the recommendation had the support of the wide group of interests
represented in the working group, including investors, brokers,
custodians, registrars and companies. Therefore, we believe that this
is a sensible measure to decrease the burdens on
business.</div><a name="0606305000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000665"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
response. In my comments, I recognised that companies, in conjunction
with their registrars, would have to bear some administrative burdens
to be able to process proxies received at the weekend. Therefore, I
understand the sense of the proposal and why it is being advocated.
There is always a question of balancing ease of administration for the
company with the rights of the shareholders. I again wave my flag for
the rights of shareholders. I am delighted to stand up for
them.</div><a name="0606305000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is
clear from what the Minister said that consideration has been given to
how to strike the balance and whether the proposal goes too far in one
direction. I am gratified that she said that the problem had been
examined, considered and consulted on with a wide group of
stakeholders. Therefore, in determining whether the proposal is
appropriate and in taking account of potentially conflicting interests,
I appreciate her clarification. We have also clarified the workings of
the clause. In the light of her comments, I beg to ask leave to

<a name="0606305000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000668"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Clause 319 makes provision for the procedure
to be adopted by public companies when holding annual general meetings.
Under the revised provisions, there is no requirement on private
companies to hold or convene annual general meetings at all.
Traditionally, a private company under the existing regime set out in
the Companies Act 1985 can opt out by virtue of the elective resolution
route.</div><a name="0606305000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 319 will
effectively reverse that requirement so that in essence a private
company has to opt in when deciding whether to hold an AGM. I note that
when that matter was discussed in the Grand Committee debate in the
other place, Lord Sainsbury
said:</div><a name="0606305000546"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
approach in the Bill has been to make no statutory provision concerning
AGMs held by private companies. This does not mean that private
companies cannot hold AGMs; it means only that the Bill does not
provide a statutory regime. The intention is that private companies
could write AGM provisions into their
articles.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1
March 2006; Vol. 679, c.
GC128.]</div><a name="0606305000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is obviously
absolutely true; private companies could do that.</div>
<a name="0606305000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying to save the legal
costs of recreating those provisions in the articles of association of
a private company. The Bill might be able to mirror the language
referring to public companies by stating that if a private company
requires an AGM, the provisions for public companies can apply equally
to private companies that elect to take that approach. That would not
compel or require private companies to do so, but would avoid the need
for them to mirror those procedures or provisions in their own articles
of association, which could require some expenditure if they were
different from what is contained in table A. The amendment therefore
seeks effectively to deem the notice period within the Bill to cover
the eventuality of private companies still needing to hold an
AGM.</div><a name="0606305000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not intend to
press new clause 31 and therefore will not speak to
it.</div><a name="0606305000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000669"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> As the hon. Gentleman confirmed, that issue was
dealt with in the House of Lords. As he will know, we see it as part of
the Bill&#146;s deregulatory proposals, particularly for small
companies, to lift some of the burden that comes with the statutory
requirement to hold an AGM.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 336</div><a name="0606305000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">During our White Paper
consultation in July 2002, we published some draft provisions for
opting into and out of AGMs. The responses to that consultation showed
that people viewed the provisions as confusing and overly complex,
which was the opposite of the &#147;think small first&#148;
approach that we were attempting to adopt in the Bill. The
Government&#146;s view is that we should not legislate for small
companies in that regard.
</div><a name="0606305000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
to reassure the hon. Gentleman, I will say that procedures for
resolutions at general meetings under chapter 3 will apply to both
private and public companies. If a private company wishes to call a
general meeting, the notice of meeting provisions under clauses 290 and
296 will apply. Whether it refers to such a meeting as annual is
irrelevant for the purposes of the requirements; notice will be given
to members. On that basis, and in the spirit of attempting to
deregulate a bit and to help lift the burden on small businesses, I
urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000670"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I note what the Minister said about not
wishing to burden small companies. The amendment would not burden them,
because it would not impose any additional requirement on them. It
merely seeks to clarify things and make life easier by not requiring
companies to reflect such provisions in the articles of association or
to incur related costs. However, I know that I am unlikely to obtain
any further movement from the Minister on the matter, so I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000672"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b><b class="B"> </b>Thus far this afternoon, we have had
some interesting debates on quite detailed and narrow issues of law and
practice. They have been of interest, but this matter has provoked
wider discussion.
</div><a name="0606305000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
debate relates to clause 325 and subsequent clauses, which will provide
a mechanism for shareholders representing not less than 5 per cent. of
the voting capital of a quoted company to demand an independent report
on any poll taken or to be taken at a general meeting of the company.
The request must be made no later than within one week of the poll
being taken, and the directors must appoint an independent assessor
within one week of the requirement to prepare a report for the company
on the poll or polls.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 337</div><a name="0606305000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute of Directors said
of the arrangement:</div>
<a name="0606305000547"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These provisions are
onerous and unnecessary. The Government has provided no evidence of any
abuse it is trying to redress. They will place increased costs and
burdens on companies for no discernable gain. In addition, in spite of
the statement that an adverse report on a poll will not affect the
validity of a decision, it is likely that companies would
delaythe implementation of the decision until the time for a
challenge has expired. In the case of decisions taken at EGMs this
could have a seriously detrimental effect on companies&#146; ability
to complete major transactions and would undermine the competitiveness
of UK companies.</div> <a name="0606305000548"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
procedure of calling for an independent report would be open to serious
abuse from those who were opposed to a transaction, but knew that they
would be defeated on a poll. They would hope to achieve their desired
aim by the back door rather than through the legitimate democratic
process of the poll&#148;.</div>
<a name="0606305000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a long quote from the
IOD. The Minister will be pleased to hear that the CBI is somewhat more
succinct and to the point in its comments. It says:</div>
<a name="0606305000549"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clauses 325-334 are
excessive and unnecessary and will place increased burdens and costs on
companies. They are also contrary to the Government&#146;s aim for
deregulation and the principles of better regulation&#148;.</div>
<a name="0606305000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions highlight some strong
feelings within the business community as to their need, requirement or
necessity and the evil that they are seeking to prevent.</div>
<a name="0606305000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the points that was
raised by the Institute of Directors was the impact of delay. It makes
the point that companies may seek to wait a week before implementing a
change for fear that a demand for some sort of report may be required.
If that were to be the case it may impose some considerable costs and
burdens on the companies. I am minded in that regard of companies that
may be doing a share offering where the longer the share offering waits
to be completed, the more the company may be required to pay in
subscription costs or placement charges to agents or underwriters. That
could increase the costs associated with companies&#146; placement of
new shares, which is not particularly desirable.</div>
<a name="0606305000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if we do not take that
point of view, there is another issue: what will be the sanction if a
report is received that is unfavourable and says that something has not
been done appropriately? As we have already discussed, the
chairman&#146;s ruling in relation to a particular matter is fairly
conclusive. If a report is called for there may be some further delay
to enable it to be undertaken. If a report is called for after the
general meeting has taken place it may be difficult for the expert who
has been appointed to provide the report to assess it and conclude
whether matters were conducted
appropriately.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000673"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Looking at the clause, that is the crux of the
matter: I am not sure how the expert could do that if he was not
there.</div>
<a name="0606305000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000674"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> This is clearly an issue. There are
provisions that allow the independent assessor to be present if a call
for a report has been made before the general meeting, but emphasis is
given to the seven-day period after the poll has been taken. I know
that that has been stressed by the Government almost as a cooling-off
period to allow shareholders to consider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 338</div>properly what they should do and what is appropriate. I can see that
argument from one side, but if one allows that it makes it difficult
for the independent assessor to properly assess what has taken place
because they were not at the meeting.</div>
<a name="0606305000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000675"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I presume that in order to make that decision we
will have to have someone at the meeting who is qualified to make it,
so this will be a regulatory measure and add
cost.</div>
<a name="0606305000571"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

<a name="0606305000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000676"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The cost and burden issue is clearly of
concern to the industry groups. The comments of the CBI and the
Institute of Directors are germane to and support my hon.
Friend&#146;s point. It is difficult to assess what evil the
provision is designed to cure. Is there a huge demand outside the House
for an independent right to make a challenge in this way? It appears to
be regulatory and burdensome, particularly as we have debated the
operation of section 459 of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to
unfair prejudice. That civil remedy may be available if something is
prejudicial to minority shareholders. It is difficult to understand
what lies behind this provision; what problem it is designed to
solve.</div><a name="0606305000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000677"></a>David
Howarth:</b> It might be difficult for a public company or a
company in which it is easy for members to sell their shares to obtain
a remedy under section 459. That route would not really help in such a
case.</div><a name="0606305000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000678"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, but the
problem is that there is no remedy under this provision either. It does
not lead anywhere. There is the right to an independent report, and
that is it. It could be open to people to take the reverse approach to
the approach that I highlighted initially, when I talked about a delay
occurring and companies not implementing a transaction or share
offering. People could say, &#147;Well, we&#146;ve got the
shareholder consent. We can rely on the fact that the chairman&#146;s
view is conclusive and binding. Therefore, we are going to complete the
transaction.&#148; It cannot be unscrambled after the event, because
no remedy underlies the calling for a report in any event. It is
therefore difficult to understand how the provision will operate in
practice.</div><a name="0606305000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000679"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> In practice, if the meeting is going to be a
difficult one, with a lot of points made and many people speaking,
people will be put on notice of that, so the registrars will probably
send a better team than they would have sent otherwise. The chairman
will be on notice, and there will probably be lots of lawyers in the
room, who will ensure that things happen. I just do not see how the
provision adds
anything.</div><a name="0606305000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000680"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. In
practice, for most plcs, the registrars will normally be present at a
general meeting in any event to check in shareholders and to check the
holding of shares that they have. Therefore, to an extent, there is
someone external to the company ensuring that the appropriate
procedures are adopted in respect of the way in which votes are
undertaken at the general meeting.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 339</div><a name="0606305000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000681"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend is very kind
to allow me to make so many interventions. The converse is that if it
is a small company, it probably will not have any of that, but it also
will not have someone who, under this clause, will be good enough to
check on whether things are being done. Therefore, there will be an
extra cost, because the company will have to bring such a person in. In
effect, it will probably have to bring the registrars in, whereas in
the past it would not have had to do
that.</div><a name="0606305000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000682"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> There is the issue of cost. That point has
been made clearly by the groups that I cited at the outset. The noble

Report, House of Lords,</i> 1 March 2006; Vol. 679, c.
GC135.]</div><a name="0606305000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I just
do not see that. I do not believe that there is the real issue of
investor confidence suggested by Lord Sainsbury to justify the
provision. It seems too burdensome and bureaucratic and not to have any
clear outcome. We believe that, as such, it is unnecessary and should
be removed from the Bill. As a consequence, our amendments would delete
clauses 325 to 334. Amendments Nos. 207 and 246 would make
consequential changes to clauses 335 and 336
respectively.</div><a name="0606305000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000683"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> This is the fourth time that the Opposition have
sought to remove these provisions from the Bill. There were three
debates on this precise issue that were designed to test opinion in the
other place. After the last debate, there was a division that, even
though it was in the other place, was lost by the resounding margin of
175 to 128. Nevertheless, the Opposition want to revisit the point
again today.</div>
<a name="0606305000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000684"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I should make it clear that, since that
debate, we have received further representations from the Institute of
Directors and from the CBI, emphasising that they were deeply unhappy
with these provisions. It is entirely appropriate, therefore, for the
Opposition to listen to those concerns and reflect them in
today&#146;s
debate.</div><a name="0606305000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000685"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Indeed. It is odd how representations go, however,
because the Government too have had representations&#151;from active
institutional shareholders&#146; groups, in whose interests these
provisions are included in the Bill. Those groups included the
Co-operative Insurance Society and Pensions and Investment Research
Consultants, who argued that the clauses were appropriate. As Members
of Parliament and as members of the Committee, all of us are lobbied on
a whole range of
issues.</div><a name="0606305000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606305000686"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I am reflecting on the
logic of the right hon. Lady&#146;s argument. It seems extraordinary
that the House of Commons and a House of Commons Committee should be
precluded from examining issues because they have been considered up
the other end. If the Government accepted every amendment that was made
up the other end, I am quite 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 340</div>sure we could come to some sort of arrangement, but I am sure that the
hon. Lady is not suggesting that.</div>
<a name="0606305000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000687"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> One reason why the Bill was considered first in the
House of Lords was that we recognised, as I hope Opposition Members
accept, that this was a detailed and technical Bill, and that there was
an enormous amount of expertise in the other place that could properly
be applied to examining the necessary detailed amendments. It behoves
us, however, to use our time sensibly. On Second Reading the key issue
raised by hon. Members from all parties, and on which we want to spend
time&#151;though we are getting close on time&#151;was
directors&#146; duties. The more we revisit issues that have been
debated, not once but on three separate occasions in the House of
Lords, the less time we shall have to deal with the non-technical,
fundamental issues that have been raised and which hon. Members from
all parties wish to debate.</div>
<a name="0606305000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606305000688"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<a name="0606305000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000689"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am not tempted to give way any further because I
want to proceed. I accept that the amendments are properly tabled, but
I am not going to debate procedure. There is just a difference of view
between the Government and the Opposition on how the time should be
used. I hope that Opposition Members will recognise that when sensible
amendments are tabled we consider
them.</div><a name="0606305000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000690"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> Will the Minister give way on that
point?</div><a name="0606305000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000691"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No I will not. The arguments put forward by the
Opposition simply do not stack up. First, they have said that there is
no mischief that needs remedying, but that is not so. The company law
review recommended a new right for shareholders to acquire an
independent report on a poll, and for a good reason. The review
received evidence to suggest that the registering and counting of votes
was accident prone, and that there were problems between institutional
investors executing votes and registrars recording and counting them on
behalf of companies.</div>
<a name="0606305000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000692"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Minister give way on that
point?</div><a name="0606305000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000693"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I will on that
point.</div><a name="0606305000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000694"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister makes an important point, but I am
not sure that it relates to the way in which the meeting is conducted.
There is a problem in the way institutions vote&#151;by the time that
votes go through the levels of people who would actually turn up and
cast a vote, there can be a problem. That is a different issue,
however, from attending and taking the poll at the meeting
itself.</div><a name="0606305000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000695"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That may be the case in some instances. However, an
example that was drawn to my attention was the much-publicised vote at
GlaxoSmithKline to approve the directors&#146; remuneration report,
which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 341</div>was defeated by just half a per cent. Those circumstances do not really
reflect the way in which institutional investors cast their votes, but
it might have been sensible to have had a
poll.</div>
<a name="0606305000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000696"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On that point, the Minister will appreciate that
if the vote had gone the other way, it would only have been
indicative.</div>
<a name="0606305000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000697"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Yes; I accept that. Nevertheless, there may have
been a shareholder interest in having a poll on the outcome of that
vote. That is my point about shareholder engagement.</div>
<a name="0606305000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paul Myners&#146; report,
&#147;A Review of the Impediments to Voting UK Shares&#148;, which
was published in January 2004 and fully endorsed by a City-wide group
of institutional investors, registrars, issuers and other industry
bodies, noted the continuing concern that the system for recording
proxy votes in company meetings was not as efficient as it should be.
The report highlighted a problem with lost votes at Unilever plc, when
institutional investors were given instructions to vote and the issuer
never received them.</div> <a name="0606305000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have mentioned the GlaxoSmithKline case, and there was the case of a
directors&#146; remuneration report at BAE Systems, which
Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against. The
concern was about whether the company had voted the shares, held in
American depository receipts where no voting instructions had been
given, to ensure that the report was
approved.</div>
<a name="0606305000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000698"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> All the Minister&#146;s examples appertain not
to the meeting itself but to the passing of votes from the institution
to the person who turns up at the meeting. She needs to find better
evidence to prove her point.</div>
<a name="0606305000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000699"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I do not accept that assertion. The issue that we
are debating is whether there ought to be a right to ask for a report
on a poll. How that poll is taken, how individuals vote, or whether
they vote on behalf of other shareholders are secondary points. The
point is whether shareholders in the round are satisfied about the
accuracy of the poll-taking.</div>
<a name="0606305000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
independent report of a poll seeks to remedy real mischiefs. The
Opposition have asked what value the provisions will add. As many have
noted, polls are increasingly used at general meetings, particularly
those of listed companies. The provisions enable members to require the
company to commission an independent report on the poll. Most polls are
conducted by the registrar who acts on behalf of the issuer, so it is
important that shareholders in their own right can require that the
report on the poll be conducted by a third party. As Paul Myners set
out in his report, if we are to have shareholder confidence, a
comprehensive action programme is required to address the
inefficiencies and obstacles in the process by which votes are
transmitted.</div>
<a name="0606305000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions
are an important part of that programme, enhancing the confidence in
the integrity and effectiveness of the voting process in quoted
companies.</div>
<a name="0606305000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000700"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Who does the Minister think that the third party
would be in practice?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 342</div><a name="0606305000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000701"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Somebody who was appointed and whose business it
would be. The appropriate person might be another registrar&#151;not
the registrar to the company&#151;with the sort of qualifications to
which we have referred. It might be somebody such as a third party with
appropriate experience in the conduct of polls.</div>
<a name="0606305000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I get the feeling that in this
context, although we will have different debates later, Opposition
Members&#146; concerns are more with the boardroom than the rights of
shareholders. That is the strong feeling I get in this fourth attempt
to strike out the clauses before us. The Opposition contend that the
potential burdens of the provisions outweigh the possible benefits, but
it is quite the opposite: the provisions empower shareholders with an
additional tool to hold the directors to account. Shareholders are not
an external body; they own a share in the company. Those interested in
stronger shareholder participation cannot have it both ways. If they
support moves to help shareholders exercise their rights, they must
also support the right of those shareholders to challenge if it is
appropriate.</div>
<a name="0606305000572"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="0606305000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
burden on a quoted company unless the shareholders exercise the right
to require an independent report. The cost-benefit analysis in the
regulatory impact assessment, to give an indicative cost across the
range of companies, suggested a cost of between &#163;350,000 and
&#163;4.2 million per annum. That is not an enormous cost across the
board.</div><a name="0606305000297"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000702"></a>Mr.

know?</div><a name="0606305000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000703"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It is obviously an
assessment.</div><a name="0606305000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000704"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> On what basis does the Minister come up with those
figures?</div><a name="0606305000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000705"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That is an assessment and an estimate based on one
or two independently assessed
polls&#151;</div><a name="0606305000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000706"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="0606305000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000707"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No, I will answer the question. It is an estimate
based on one or two independently assessed polls for between 50 and 100
per cent. of the AGMs of the 1,400 or so quoted companies at a cost of
&#163;500 to &#163;3,000 per report. I suggest that the hon.
Gentleman ought to look at the regulatory impact assessment, which we
provide, if he wishes to question whether those costs are accurate.
Those costs were laid out when we produced the 2005 White Paper and
consulted on the specific issue.</div>
<a name="0606305000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000708"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The debate so far turns on the accuracy of a
cost-benefit analysis that has to be to some extent speculative,
because we have never had a provision like this before. The Minister is
right that there is a feeling that there is a mischief to be addressed.
She has given some examples, although they were perhaps not exactly on
the point. However, there is an accurate feeling that there is a
problem with polls and with investor confidence which might grow, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 343</div>especially because the use of polls appears to be increasing. The
Government are right on that point.</div>
<a name="0606305000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
have a legitimate point about precisely how much this will cost. It is
legitimate to raise the potential problem of the abuse of the rights
that are put forward in these clauses. It seems to me that the only
rational way forward is for the Government to undertake to keep the
area under review and to come back after an appropriate number of
years. The Department should study what happens after four or five
years and undertake to come back to Parliament to remove or amend these
provisions if they turn out to have caused a higher cost than the
cost-benefit analysis has
suggested.</div><a name="0606305000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
perfect occasion to raise the issue of post-legislative review. In
these debates in Committee we are bound to make a decision now, but it
is always possible to come back to those decisions later. If the
Minister could give us an assurance along those lines, I would be happy
not to oppose the clauses.</div>
<a name="0606305000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000709"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. All good
legislation needs to be constantly reassessed and reviewed; there are a
number of new provisions in the Bill, including those that we will come
to when we consider shareholder voting rights&#151;the contentious
issue that we have kept to the end. If we are proposing anything new,
it makes sense to review it. We always keep new provisions under review
to test whether they meet their
purpose.</div><a name="0606305000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000710"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister is making a point that the clauses
are there to right a wrong. Can she explain how the provisions will
right the
wrong?</div><a name="0606305000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000711"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I was going to come to that point. The
Opposition&#146;s only valid question is whether the procedure is a
sufficient sanction when we are also trying to meet another objective
of our company law framework, which is to avoid creating uncertainty
for companies. We do not want resolutions passed in meetings to be open
to challenge; we want companies to have certainty. However, openness is
useful in so much of life and in so much legislation. In this case, the
facility to make a challenge and have an independent report will
provide one vehicle, if not an entirely failsafe one, for the threat of
accountability to ensure proper practice in the exercise of polls so
that reports on them will rarely be required. Often, opening up to
public account and ensuring public accountability is in itself a
powerful weapon in ensuring the proper conduct of
business.</div><a name="0606305000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say to the hon. Gentleman that without these provisions there is a
problem when there is unhappiness and a challenge is made. He might not
accept that, but there is certainly a problem of perception.
Alternative remedies such as section 459 of the 1985 Act, which was
brought to our attention by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David
Howarth), would be far more difficult for shareholders to exercise.
They would be costly routes&#151;not ones that shareholders would
want to take. We are trying to balance shareholder engagement and the
interests of a company, and I think that we have got it about right. It
is not perfect and I accept that the remedy is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 344</div>not as strong as we would like, but opening up to public account is a
sensible way to ensure that companies act appropriately.</div>
<a name="0606305000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions are intended to
deliver greater transparency and enhance shareholder engagement, which
are corporate governance objectives that we should surely all support.
Voting is the bedrock of corporate governance and the means by which
companies&#146; boards are held to account. If we want to encourage
more people to exercise their votes we need to empower them with the
tools to ensure that their votes really count. I therefore urge hon.
Members to allow the clause to stand part of the Bill and I urge the
hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) not to press the
amendments.</div><a name="0606305000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000712"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> This has been an interesting debate. The
Minister makes assertions about the Opposition&#146;s contention. It
is not the Opposition but the Institute of Directors and the CBI that
contend that the provisions are burdensome and unnecessary. The key
question was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr.
Djanogly) when he asked the Minister how the clauses on independent
reports will right
wrongs.</div><a name="0606305000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000713"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That was my slight concern. I understand that the
IOD and the CBI have raised the matter again, which is presumably why
there were three debates on it in the House of Lords. Shareholder
groups&#151;the Co-operative Insurance Society, Pensions Investment
Research Consultancy and others&#151;have expressed the opposite
view. The hon. Gentleman has often said that he is in favour of
shareholder interest. Is he in fact putting the boardroom before the
shareholder?</div><a name="0606305000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000714"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear the Minister&#146;s reference, but
it is interesting that, as far as I am aware, none of the groups that
she has mentioned have made representations to us on the matter. If
they felt as strongly as the Minister suggests, I would have thought
that they would have done so to explain why they feel the provisions
are required. I respect their point of view and the fact that they have
made representations to the Department. However, I remain unconvinced
that the wrong that has been identified by the groups that I mentioned
will be addressed by the cumbersome, expensive system
proposed.</div><a name="0606305000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has given an assurance that the system will be kept under review. The
problem is that once something like that is in place, it is virtually
impossible to take it out. As far as I can see, the provisions will not
really cure anything, because at the end of the day there is no remedy
and nothing to stop a company from implementing the transaction that
might be under question as a consequence of the provisions of the poll.
On the contrary, the clause might also lead to delays and uncertainty,
and therefore cost to the company.</div>
<a name="0606305000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
interested to know whether the additional subscription and placement
costs that might be charged to a company for delaying the closing or
implementation of the placement were taken into account when the
Minister arrived at the figure of &#163;4.2 million in the regulatory
impact assessment. I suspect that the figure relates only to the direct
cost of having somebody there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 345</div>at the meeting or of conveying a report on the conduct of the poll, and
does not take account of the indirect costs that could arise as a
consequence of the delay that might be occasioned by a company wishing
to await the outcome of the
meeting.</div><a name="0606305000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
persuaded that, on the balance of probabilities and risk, the clause
will promote and enhance shareholder participation&#151;which I
believe in&#151;and on that basis it is appropriate to test the
Committee&#146;s view by pressing the matter to a Division.

Brokenshire:</b><b class="B"> </b>We now come to part 14 of the Bill,

incurring of such donations or
expenditure.</div><a name="0606305000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
346 provides the definition of political donation for the purposes of
this part of the Bill. The Law Society is critical of the breadth and
uncertainty associated with the definition. It suggests that the lack
of clarity in the provisions of part 14 and their enormous complexity
impose considerable burdens and costs on companies, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 346</div>especially those with large groups that include overseas companies. It
is likely that many companies will continue to pass precautionary
resolutions. In this area, according to the Law Society, the Bill can
hardly be said to be deregulatory. It requested guidance on exchange
rate valuation to assist the valuation of non-sterling donations for
the purposes of the
Bill.</div><a name="0606305000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the Grand
Committee stage of the Bill, Lord McKenzie of Luton
said:</div><a name="0606305000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We will
consider further in consultation with the Electoral Commission whether
additional guidance might be provided to companies on the definition of

the Minister could provide an update on the situation and whether
further guidance will be provided to ensure greater clarity and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000734"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I have to get my head around this. The funding of
political parties is important and clearly something that rightly
concerns hon. Members on both sides of the House. I hope that we all
recognise during the debate on this set of clauses this afternoon that
we are looking at the matter from the perspective of companies and
their members, and how and when directors of companies need to obtain
authorisation from their members to do something that either subsidises
a political organisation or, as clause 347(1)(a)(ii)
says,</div><a name="0606305000551"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is capable of being
reasonably regarded as intended to affect public support for a
political party or other political organisation, or an independent
election
candidate&#148;.</div><a name="0606305000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for that control is simply to prevent directors from subsidising
a political organisation for personal reasons rather than in the
interests of the company. Effectively, the question we ask when
considering whether to burden a company&#151;I recognise that aspect
of what the hon. Gentleman is saying&#151;with a requirement to seek
a resolution is simply, &#147;Is there a risk of the directors using
the company&#146;s money for their own interests rather than for
those of the company?&#148; When considering whether to use company
funds directly or indirectly to support a political party, there is a
risk that directors will be swayed by their preference rather than the
interests of the company. Therefore, I believe&#151;I think we all
agree on this&#151;that it is right to regulate in this area.
Understanding that, the substance of the amendments&#151;I am
slightly unclear whether we are taking amendments, Mr.
Bercow.</div><a name="0606305000352"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000742"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We come to clause 347, which provides the
definition for political expenditure. It sets out what expenditure
incurred by a company would need to be approved in accordance with part
14 to be treated as lawful. The definition in the clause is
wide-ranging and
includes</div><a name="0606305000552"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the preparation,
publication or dissemination of advertising or other promotional or
publicity material&#148;</div><a name="0606305000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
notes that the activities must be</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 348</div><a name="0606305000553"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intended to affect public support
for a political party or other political organisation, or an
independent election
candidate&#148;.</div><a name="0606305000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is the breadth of the definition. Again, I would like certainty
and clarification. It seems that the definition could capture
activities the primary intention of which is to achieve some other
means and potentially limit the company&#146;s freedom of speech on
key issues affecting its business or operations. It is not entirely
fanciful to imagine a situation in which a Government policy might seek
to limit or curb the activities of a company or area of
business.</div><a name="0606305000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
entirely legitimate for companies in such a situation to exercise their
right to object, to highlight to a wider audience why they object and
to argue robustly why the Government&#146;s view is possibly wholly
mistaken. It is clear that if the Government have made some fundamental
error or misjudged the situation, the outcome of the company&#146;s
activities could reasonably be said to affect public support for the
relevant governing party. One then gets into a debate about whether
that outcome was the intention. Clearly, there is a balance to be
struck.</div><a name="0606305000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will no doubt argue that it is entirely inappropriate to use
shareholders&#146; money on advertising campaigns that promote
policies with which the directors personally agree rather than
political policies that will benefit the company, as there is a clear
conflict of interest. I note that in her preamble on the previous
clause, which may have been intended to be addressed to this clause,
she made that point clearly. I entirely agree, and it is right that
there should be protections governing such situations that reflect the
October 1998 recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public
Life. They were the precursor to the provisions in the Companies Act
1985, which were inserted by way of later
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
example that I gave is about political policies that benefit the
company and its shareholders and are nothing to do with the personal
political predilections of the directors. They directly affect and
directly relate to the business interests of the company. My point is
that legitimate business operations should not be subject to the burden
and cost of an approval mechanism that may result in delay at a
critical time in the company&#146;s future and could therefore be
damaging to the company&#146;s
interests.</div><a name="0606305000371"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606305000743"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): I take the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, but let us take a specific example. An oil
company might regard a proposed tax on oil as undesirable and wish to
campaign against it. Does he not agree that practically anything in
public life affects in some way practically every major company, and
that we give licence to companies to campaign on virtually anything if
we do not require some approval
process?</div><a name="0606305000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000744"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point that
we sought to encapsulate in our amendments. He is absolutely right. The
purpose of the expenditure should not be to influence a political party
or seek a political outcome in so far as it relates to a partisan
issue; in other words, to influence whether somebody should vote for
one party or another. That is why we have taken a twin-track approach
and provided two amendments that could be viewed in isolation. The
first takes a purposive approach; in other words, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 349</div>positive purpose should have to be that that was the intended outcome,
in other words the political outcome. The alternative amendment is
amendment No. 347, under which</div>
<a name="0606305000554"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;political expenditure does not
include activities intended to influence policy making or public debate
on issues directly affecting the business or other commercial
activities of the relevant
company&#148;,</div><a name="0606305000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">provided that
those activities have been properly sanctioned in advance by the
directors. We are being very focused and saying that a company cannot
take an approach willy-nilly and incur political expenditure that is
intended to affect the outcome of an election. It must be related to
its business activities, which is what the amendments would
achieve.</div><a name="0606305000574"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="0606305000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman rightly made the point about proper tests whereby a company
can ensure that its shareholder interests are protected properly and
the directors are not running off on some whim relating to their own
political aspirations or feelings. That is entirely appropriate and
right, and it is why the existing provisions in the Companies Act 1985
are reflected in the Bill. We certainly agree with the necessity and
the importance of that approach. The amendments make it clear that the
activities intended to influence policy making or debate must be on
issues that directly affect the business or its other commercial
activities. There is an additional provision in respect of the board
approving the related matter, so that an employee or another person
cannot simply incur expenditure and the matter has to be properly
considered by the board to give a further level of protection in that
regard.</div><a name="0606305000375"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606305000745"></a><b class="B">Paul
Farrelly</b> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab): I see from
amendment No. 313 what the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman is trying
to achieve. The amendment is much too wide. For example, could not a
company, when an election was called, highlight the fact
thatMr. Smith, the hon. Member for x constituency, supported
the policy that affected its business at some stage and then put out a
lot of negative publicity that was tantamount to running a negative
campaign against that person? That would be the potential effect during
an election period. The amendment would strike too
wide.</div><a name="0606305000376"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000746"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point, but I argue that that is something intended to affect the
support for the political party. The purpose of that action would be to
affect the outcome of the election, so it would not satisfy the tests
under the purposive amendment nor those in respect of the other
amendment. He has made a valid point, but I do not accept his line of
argument because the point is
covered.</div><a name="0606305000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000747"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> The hon. Gentleman is setting two tests that
may, especially during or running up to an election period, come into
conflict. There could be one hell of a battle in the courts in some
circumstances and a great deal of uncertainty about an election
outcome.</div><a name="0606305000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000748"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> There are remedies in such circumstances, but
I maintain that the amendments recognise the correct point made by the
hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 350</div>about influencing the outcome of an election. It would be entirely
inappropriate for a company to use expenditure of corporate money in
that way without the proper sanction of its shareholders. Let us be
honest: it would still be open to a company in such circumstances to
say to its shareholders, &#147;Well, we disagree with the approach
that that particular person is taking and seek your sanction for this
expenditure.&#148; If there were a particular interest that the
company and its shareholders felt strongly about&#151;even on the
basis of the protections afforded under existing or proposed
legislation with the appropriate shareholder sanction&#151;the
company could do
that.</div><a name="0606305000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not want to
inadvertently to catch situations when the company is genuinely seeking
to have its say on an issue that directly affects a specific business
interest. It would seem unnecessarily burdensome in those
circumstances. Speed might be important if a business of a company were
being undermined, but it should be able to argue and lobby quite firmly
about why the Government were wrong on a particular issue. The
amendment seeks to address that freedom of speech argument. We do so
without cutting across the point that the hon. Gentleman has made. The
amendments seek to provide further clarity to help companies in
deciding whether an approval resolution is required, and to address the
Law Society&#146;s point about unnecessary precautionary
resolutions.</div><a name="0606305000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be
interested to hear what the hon. Member for Cambridge will say in
relation to amendment No. 260 in the name of the Liberal Democrats. I
may have misunderstood, but the amendment seems to cut across the
ability of a company to lobby on matters of direct concern to its
legitimate business activities. However, that might be acceptable in
the context of our amendments, and I shall listen with interest to what
he has to say on that matter.</div>
<a name="0606305000381"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000749"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I shall speak to amendment No. 260, the purpose
of which is to extend the definition of &#147;political
expenditure&#148; beyond the realm of trying to influence political
parties and into lobbying as a whole. The purpose of the amendment is
to cut across business activities and to raise the issue of whether we
should be doing more about lobbying itself&#151;attempting to
influence Government policy and votes in Parliament. I suppose that the
fundamental issue here is the power of money in
politics.</div><a name="0606305000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are three separate reasons for tabling amendment No. 260. The first
refers back to the interests of company members: the reputation of the
company itself. Company members will have a legitimate interest in
political donations by that company. Presumably, if a company were to
make donations to a particular political party, its reputation could be
affected, especially in this new era of transparency, and the company
members might be unwilling to be associated with a particular political
view.</div><a name="0606305000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 260
proposes merely that lobbying activities can have the same sort of
effect on a company&#146;s reputation. For example, if a company with
shareholders were to lobby for the loosening of environmental
regulation, of social protection or of controls on foreign bribery, its
reputation could be affected. That would be of legitimate concern to
the members of that company&#151;its shareholders.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 351</div><a name="0606305000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concede that the second point
has a wider intent: a more transparent lobbying regime would help to
create a market for ethical investment and consumption. Investors who
want to invest responsibly and ethically, and consumers who want to act
similarly in respect of their purchasing decisions, will want to know
about the degree of corporate lobbying. Having more of that sort of
information will help to create an ethical
market.</div><a name="0606305000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third point
is the broadest and concerns simply the effect of lobbying on politics
and the economy. The view behind the amendments is that lobbying in
itself is not a good thing and that it has a corrosive effect on the
political process. Yes, it is legitimate for information to pass from
civil society to politicians about the possible effects of
politicians&#146; decisions, but that is not really what is going on.
We know that. What is going on are attempts to influence politicians by
groups privileged by their economic
power.</div><a name="0606305000386"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000750"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> The success of the university in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituency has blessed Cambridge with myriad new,
spin-off companies. He must be rushed off his feet. I can well
understand his interest in cutting down the amount of post that comes
in his mailbag, but is he seriously suggesting that every time a
company writes to its Member of Parliament it needs to have a
shareholder ballot and a
resolution?</div><a name="0606305000387"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000751"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman should understand that we are
not attempting to change the basic structure of the law, which does not
require a company to pass a resolution for each act or donation. The
basic structure, as the Bill says, is that an authorising resolution is
passed. That authorises the activity, which is what we want for this
part of the definition of political expenditure as
well.</div><a name="0606305000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally
we come to the economic argument for discouraging lobbying. There are
attempts at lobbying that genuinely try to reduce the inefficiency of
the economy, when a regulation is objectively costly for the whole of
society. Economic actors, including companies, may want to bring that
sort of regulation to the attention of the authorities. However, I
think that is a rare sort of lobbying. Normal lobbying is when one
company, group of companies or economic interest is trying to profit at
the expense of another. What they are trying to do is to shift burdens
from one part of the economy to
another.</div><a name="0606305000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us take the obvious example of taxation. Interest groups lobby for tax
breaks, for the reduction of taxation on their particular industry.
What is the effect of that, if successful? Well, the tax burden on
other parts of the economy will rise or government services will fall.
The burden of that lobbying effort on tax falls on other people. The
question that we should ask ourselves is whether that is the sort of
activity that we should be encouraging companies to engage in, because
it is merely shifting money from one part of the economy to another. It
is not making anything
new.</div><a name="0606305000390"></a>

production of value and wealth. Should we be encouraging them to spend
time and resources not on producing wealth, inventing new products or
trying to sell them into new markets, but on lobbying Government to
shift to those organisations profit, value and wealth produced by
somebody
else?</div><a name="0606305000575"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="0606305000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Economists talk
about such activity as non-productive rent seeking, which is precisely
what commercial companies engaged in lobbying do. They look to capture
other people&#146;s profits by changing the law. That is why
amendment No. 26 is as broad as it is. It covers the legitimate
interests of shareholders and legitimate interests in creating a new
market in ethical investment, but it also has the economic intention of
reducing non-productive
lobbying.</div><a name="0606305000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment moved by the hon. Member for Hornchurch is a clarifying
amendment that would leave the power to decide what to do in the hands
of the directors rather than the shareholders. From my point of view,
it would not have sufficient deterrent effect. Nevertheless, if my
amendment and his were passed, that would result in an interesting
legal position: companies would be allowed, if their directors said so,
to lobby within their ordinary commercial purposes, but could not go
beyond that without a shareholders&#146; resolution. That is not an
intended effect of my amendment, but it would be the effect if both
amendments were
passed.</div><a name="0606305000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000756"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> I apologise again, Mr. Bercow, for anticipating my
speech. This debate is genuinely interesting for the way that the
amendments face opposite poles of the possible discussion. My heart,
which is in the camp of the hon. Member for Cambridge, sinks when I
open a letter that turns out to be from the Association of British
Insurers or some other lobby
group.</div><a name="0606305000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000757"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> Unless it has a cheque in
it.</div><a name="0606305000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000758"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> Those people never send a cheque.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 353</div><a name="0606305000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increasingly, I
also feel that way about some good cause campaigns. They increasingly
resemble the negative lobby groups that the hon. Member for Cambridge
rightly criticised in that they present a one-sided argument, attempt
to raise money from their supporters with biased presentations of the
facts and attack alternative points of view with an inappropriate
vehemence. It tempts one to feel that the whole business of lobbying is
essentially unpleasant and should be
discouraged.</div><a name="0606305000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
in a free and democratic society, we cannot go far down that road. The
problem is that one person&#146;s lobby is another&#146;s rational
argument. We do not wish to reach the point where only certain
authorised bodies, such as political parties, are permitted to express
a view. It seems to me that if we adopted the amendment tabled by the
hon. Gentleman, it might have no practical effect. He suggested that
Greenpeace could get around it simply through an enabling resolution
saying that whenever it wanted to lobby, that would be
okay.</div><a name="0606305000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000759"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The difference would be that such a resolution
would not in any way be embarrassing to Greenpeace and would not reveal
to the world anything that we did not already know about Greenpeace.
That would not be the position with a commercial
company.</div><a name="0606305000403"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000760"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> If a commercial company asked its shareholders
whether they agreed that from time to time, when they thought it in the
company&#146;s interests, they could lobby for or against particular
parties, most shareholders might well say, &#147;Go for it.&#148; I
do not think that they would find the principle of authorising it
embarrassing. They might find authorising a particular campaign
embarrassing, but that is precisely the situation in which Greenpeace
would be in difficulty&#151;if it had to go back to its members every
time it wanted to launch a new
campaign.</div><a name="0606305000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, some Conservative amendments seem to go too far the other way.
One person&#146;s lobby is another&#146;s reasoned argument. The
problem with the Conservative proposals is that they would leave it up
to directors to decide what was in the interests of a company. The
court would be likely to decide that if the directors could reasonably
argue that they believed that something was in the interests of the
company, they would be entitled to spend x million pounds campaigning
on
it.</div><a name="0606305000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are familiar with wealthy business people who launch campaigns that do
not obviously relate to their business interests, such as the bus
company director who campaigned on section 28 in Scotland. People have
different views on homosexuality, but its relationship to bus companies
is obscure. If he had persuaded his fellow directors that section 28
was undermining society to the point that it was difficult to recruit
decent bus drivers&#151;which he did not, as this, I think, was a
personal initiative&#151;I am not confident that that would have been
overturned in
court.</div><a name="0606305000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000761"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The intent of the amendment is not a
subjective test; it would objectively need to be satisfied and approved
by the directors. Therefore, it would not be according to the
directors&#146; whim that they would have to decide whether something
was the case, and it would be open to challenge in those
circumstances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 354</div><a name="0606305000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000762"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> Yes. I understand the amendment. The hon.
Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but it would require the
directors to be objectively satisfied that something was in the
interests of the company. That, however, would still be a matter of
opinion.</div><a name="0606305000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, the
hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but if the court was
satisfied that the directors believed that something was objectively in
the interests of the company, it would not regard it as unlawful. That
seems to be a genuine problem, because who is to measure objectivity,
and in that example, who other than the
directors?</div><a name="0606305000409"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000763"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> To clarify, the court would decide. This is
an objective test. The objective test means that something is the case.
Subjectivity does not come into it. If the directors had persuaded
themselves that black was white and that white was black, and they had
been wrong on that, the court would uphold the fact that they were
wrong.</div><a name="0606305000410"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000764"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> Yes, but in the real world of politics&#151;if
that is not a contradiction in terms&#151;things are usually not
quite as clear as that. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is opening
a Pandora&#146;s box for lawyers. Every campaign that might be
launched would be challenged in the courts and people would be debating
the objective impact of homosexuality on bus
companies.</div><a name="0606305000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000765"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> It is interesting to hear the Opposition already
talking about the possibility and likelihood of conflict in the courts,
which is the point that I made earlier when setting out to oppose the
amendment. My hon. Friend will agree that the proposal is drawn so
widely that it would be open to the directors of the company to say, as
many companies have in the past, &#147;Actually, Labour is bad for
our business and the only good Government is a Conservative
Government.&#148;</div>
<a name="0606305000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000766"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> Yes, that hideous possibility has crossed my
mind.</div><a name="0606305000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000767"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Quite
right.</div><a name="0606305000414"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000768"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> The hon. Gentleman says quite right.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> There we have it. If we balance free speech with
the need for accountability, we end up with what, by a curious
coincidence, we have in the Bill, which is the fact that, yes,
companies are free to express their issues of business, but, yes, they
have to get the agreement of their shareholders to do so. That seems to
be a reasonable
balance.</div><a name="0606305000415"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000769"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> The hon. Gentleman was on rather better ground when
he was making a case against amendment No. 260. I thought that that
became clear, although he has convinced himself of his own arguments.
The remark that the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul
Farrelly) put on the record, however, will bear
repeating.</div><a name="0606305000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis of my experience&#151;like you, Mr. Bercow, I was elected
on 1 May 1997, which, in the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for
Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), makes me a rather long-serving
Member&#151;I point out to the hon. Member for Cambridge that to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 355</div>present lobbying and Government relations in the way that he has is
rather wide of the mark.</div>
<a name="0606305000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reflecting
on my experiences of companies that have had to bring issues to me, I
shall give an example. A company made pharmaceutical products for
animals that were going to be banned under a proposed European Union
regulation. The company was responsible for distributing the products
throughout the United Kingdom. They were absolutely essential to its
business, and it came to me to approach Ministers who were going to the
key European Union meetings.</div>
<a name="0606305000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">That had to be done at speed,
as&#151;inevitably&#151;the company became aware of that central
threat to its business only rather late in the day. No doubt it did not
belong to a powerful lobby group, although perhaps it should have, that
would have professionally represented its interests in Brussels and
ensured that those arguments were made
early.</div><a name="0606305000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
came to a Member of Parliament to put the case to a Minister of the
Crown so that the Minister of the Crown, representing the United
Kingdom at a European Council meeting, could put arguments on behalf of
what was represented as a key United Kingdom economic interest. It was
certainly an important economic interest in my
constituency.</div><a name="0606305000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is much more characteristic of the relationship between companies and
Members of Parliament than the picture that the hon. Gentleman gave. If
his amendment would require such a company to get a
shareholders&#146; resolution to talk to its Member of Parliament, it
is an absolute disaster that should be
avoided.</div><a name="0606305000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">We ought to
understand that, in the main, Government relations&#151;lobbying, if
one wants to call it that&#151;represent a necessary activity.
Companies face huge complications in the enormous area of relations
with the Government. As with any other aspect of company business,
whether it be accountancy or the law or anything else, companies of a
certain size are well advised to take professional advice in dealing
with the
Government.</div><a name="0606305000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">People who
know how to deal with the Government&#151;which Departments to go to
and which official in each Department, which Minister to press and
which levers to pull to effect the necessary outcome for their
businesses&#151;and who could be unintentionally affected by
Government regulation should not be required to approach their
shareholders to achieve that.

Howarth:</b> It is possible under clause 359 for the Secretary
of State to make exemptions for very small amounts of expenditure. The
amendment would catch expensive, powerful campaigns. When we get to
that clause, I will say more about how it works, but it is there to
prevent excessive use of the
powers.</div><a name="0606305000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000771"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> There are occasionally expensive and necessary
interests that must be represented. The hon. Member for Broxtowe said
that his heart sank when he received something from the Association of
British Insurers. The insurance industry is a vital part of our
economy, and it is in our interests that British insurance companies
should be able to succeed overseas. Governments of all persuasions have
spent an inordinate amount of time trying to open overseas markets to
British insurance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 356</div>companies so that the financial services that are such a key part of our
economy can succeed.</div>
<a name="0606305000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
massive interests. It is all right for the Secretary of State to say
that they can spend whatever the limit is, but I am afraid that for the
scale of the interests at stake we are talking about campaigning worth
hundreds of thousands of pounds, which might be a perfectly reasonable
sum to spend in trying to advance interests worth many billions to the
United
Kingdom.</div><a name="0606305000576"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000772"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> To clarify, I do not object in principle to
hearing from the Association of British Insurers. The problem is that
it and similar organisations tend to lobby on a one-sided and unhelpful
basis. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that, before he takes up too
enthusiastically the role of the lobbyists&#146; friend, he should
consider whether getting biased and one-sided interventions from such
lobbyists is really the best way to organise our public life. However,
I do not know what the alternative
is.</div><a name="0606305000427"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000773"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for admitting
that he does not know the
alternative.</div><a name="0606305000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
company needs to make a decision when approaching the Government or
Members of Parliament as to whether the function will be in-house or
one carried out by companies out of house. Given the complexity of a
company&#146;s interactions with Government, one cannot escape from
many cases having to be conducted on a professional basis. The bigger
the company, the larger the interests at
stake.</div><a name="0606305000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are deluding ourselves if we suddenly think that an inherently bad
thing. Companies getting their interests professionally represented or
presented to Government is an inherently good thing. Whether that is
done in-house by the companies or out of house is entirely a commercial
matter for them. The Government relations of companies is a necessary
evil.</div><a name="0606305000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">For Ministers of
the Crown to represent the interests of United Kingdom companies as
effectively as they can is in our favour, because we are all here to
try to protect their interests. The wealth that we tax here and the
resulting expenditure all come from the success of such companies. If I
can advance the interests of the Association of British Insurers, most
particularly in overseas markets, I am absolutely delighted to do so.
If it writes to me and asks how I can do that, I will be only too
pleased to assist, because that is of assistance to the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="0606305000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">When one gets
self-evidently self-interested lobbying, which is what the hon. Member
for Cambridge and others are driving at, most of us can recognise when
one interest is being played off against another. That lobbying is
normally and properly ineffective, as one might
expect.</div><a name="0606305000432"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000774"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> For the record, the deep recession from the late
1980s until the mid-1990s was a salutary lesson to the more rabidly
right-wing-led companies. Looking now at the Chancellor&#146;s
stewardship of the economy, a Conservative Government were not
necessarily always good for business compared with a Labour Government.
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will graciously agree.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 357</div><a name="0606305000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is that for some such
companies it would be quite possible with the setting up of the two
tests for a company&#151;for which we will take a fictitious name,
Belize Telecom UK Ltd.&#151;to drive a coach and horses through the
safeguards in other parts of the clause by setting up an alternative
test, which would be destined for the
courts.</div><a name="0606305000434"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000775"></a>Mr.

line of the golden economic inheritance to the Chancellor and what his
officials said to him when he took office, which was that the figures
were so good they were
unbelievable&#151;</div><a name="0606305000435"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000776"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000777"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I am grateful for that confirmation, Mr.
Bercow.</div><a name="0606305000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude, I fear that amendment No. 260 goes much too wide to win
support. Presented as it was by the hon. Member for Cambridge, it
betrays an unfortunate and unnecessary cynicism about the necessity of
Government relations today, given the complexity that companies
face.</div><a name="0606305000438"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000778"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000779"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I start by raising something that nobody has
mentioned, but which is helpful for setting the context of where we are
going. We have incorporated a few deregulatory measures into our
propositions. For example, we have removed references to the general
meeting, to make it clearer that private companies can authorise
donations and expenditure by written resolutions. We have also said
that a holding company must authorise a donation or expenditure by a
subsidiary company only if it is a relevant holding company&#151;that
is, the ultimate holding company or, where such a company is not a UK
company, the holding company highest up the chain.</div>
<a name="0606305000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">Holding
companies are now also permitted to seek authorisations of donations or
expenditure in respect of the holding company itself and one or more
subsidiaries, including wholly owned subsidiaries, through a single
approval resolution, as per clause 349(1). Companies are also permitted
to table separate approval resolutions in respect of donations to
political parties and donations to other political organisations, as
per clause 349(2). There has been some deregulation to simplify
procedures, and I hope that that is generally
acceptable.</div><a name="0606305000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
with my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) that the group
of amendments represents the two extremes of the spectrum. Despite his
protestations to the contrary, the hon. Member for Hornchurch is
introducing a subjective element into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 358</div>what would otherwise be an objective test. In an earlier exchange, he
appeared to think that the element he proposes would be objective
because the matter would be resolved by the courts. Clearly, we want to
minimise the occasions when things are taken through the processes of
the courts, but the subjective test that he is trying to introduce
would increase the amount of litigation. That is not where we want to
be at all. We want a simple, direct and objective
scheme.</div><a name="0606305000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is always difficult to respond to examples as they are raised. However,
the circumstances outlined by the hon. Gentleman, who thought under our
objective test it would be inappropriate for a company to spend money
on planning permission&#151;I cannot remember his precise example,
but it was something of that sort&#151;would not be considered as
political expenditure under that objective test, so he set up a false
example.</div> <a name="0606305000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who would
decide the primary purpose under the terms of the amendment? Where
would the distinction between the primary and non-primary purposes lie,
and who would take that decision? The directors would have to judge
subjectively whether the primary purpose of any expenditure could
reasonably be regarded as intending to effect public support for
political parties, organisations or candidates. I have sat and listened
carefully to the debate, and such judgments are, by their nature,
complex and nuanced. As we heard, they unquestionably carry the risk of
allowing directors to put their personal political preferences ahead of
the economic interests of the
company.</div><a name="0606305000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause as it stands includes a test for judging whether the directors
of companies ought to go to their members for authorisation before
committing expenditure. It would be foolish to enable directors to
avoid going to their company&#146;s members, which would be the
purpose of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s tests to approve a donation
based on the directors&#146; subjective judgment of its being
non-political. That would increase the risk of directors using the
company&#146;s money as if it were their own. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman accepts that our test would be
better.</div><a name="0606305000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
260 is at the opposite end of the spectrum. The hon. Member for
Cambridge seemed to be in favour of abolishing the Department of Trade
and
Industry.</div><a name="0606305000448"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000780"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is our
policy.</div><a name="0606305000449"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000781"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> And it is my job. The hon. Gentleman is welcome to
come and sit in my office for an hour or two. He will see that my
position as a member of the Government is very much about hearing
representations from companies on a range of matters in which we might
have an influence, either in domestic or European legislation, or
beyond. There is a huge difference between the facility to hear those
representations made through lobbying and the judgment that we have to
make, whether we are in government posts, are MPs or sit in elected
positions in local authorities or
elsewhere.</div><a name="0606305000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was trying
to think back to my education, a long time ago, and if politics is the
marketplace of interests, we have to allow those interests to have a
voice if we are to make sensible decisions. Throughout my political
career, however irritating occasional lobbying can be and however
partial it might be&#151;of course, it can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 359</div>partial&#151;hearing the experience and views of those who will be
most immediately affected by actions that we take either in government
or elsewhere, is crucial to ensuring that we take decisions that are in
the best interests of either those companies or their role in the wider
economy. The hon. Gentleman goes too far. There is legitimate lobbying
of councillors, MPs and Ministers which is essentially non-party
political. In a common-sense way, we all comprehend that in our
day-to-day work.</div> <a name="0606305000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not attempting to control what directors say. A director can go on
to the &#147;Today&#148; programme and put whatever view he likes
on whatever issue he likes. The control that we are trying to
introduce, which is perfectly proper, is that a director does not
commit the company&#146;s funds in pursuance of his own views on an
issue, particularly in relation to a political party or political
interest.</div><a name="0606305000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
313 provides that the board of directors of a company&#151;in other

intended</div><a name="0606305000555"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to influence

amendment provides that the directors of a company could collectively
commit any amount of unauthorised political expenditure. It is
self-evident that such a state of affairs increases the risk of
directors using the company&#146;s money in their own interests.
Recognising that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not feel it
necessary to press the amendment to a Division.</div>
<a name="0606305000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, the Government
have got it about right. We heard the two extremes of the argument; we

but I do not think that one&#146;s voice in that marketplace should
be proportionate to one&#146;s economic power. The purpose of the
amendment is to open the door to controlling that power. Information
flowing to the Government is obviously a good thing, but that is not
the same as putting pressure on the Government by commercial interest.
If the opportunity arises, I would like to test the Committee&#146;s
opinion on amendment No. 260.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000783"></a>James

political side of things and on the funding of political parties, and
we shall have more in the context of other
amendments.</div><a name="0606305000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">I disagree
strenuously with the Minister&#146;s allegation that the
Opposition&#146;s proposal is in any way extreme. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 360</div>was intended to provide clarification of wording that I think is

what has been suggested, it was not intended to drive a coach and
horses through the entire set of provisions. I note the comments of the
hon. Member for Broxtowe, but I do not accept his suggestion that our
amendments, as tabled, would allow partisan political
funding.</div> <a name="0606305000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that the legislation contains protection to avoid conflicts
of interest in which directors might otherwise seek to use company
funds for partisan interests of their own, rather than in the
company&#146;s best interests. I maintain, however, that the
amendments properly recognise that need and protect against such
situations.</div>
<a name="0606305000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">We debated
subjectivity and objectivity. Had I wanted there to be some sort of
subjective test, I would have drafted the amendment so that the test
was that of the directors&#146; view on the company&#146;s best
interests. I did not seek to do that; I kept the language objective. As
to my reference to the court, the meaning of all provisions of the Bill
will ultimately be decided by the courts, so I do not accept that the
amendments would cause any additional litigation. Indeed, our proposals
would avoid the potential for disputes going to court, because the
existing language is quite wide, woolly and uncertain, and may cause
disputes as to its
effect.</div><a name="0606305000462"></a>

of directors in case of unauthorised donation or

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000786"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 314, in clause
352, page 157, line 5, after first &#145;a', insert &#145;wholly
owned'.</div><a name="0606305000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause makes provision regarding the liability of directors in the
event that a company makes a political donation or incurs political
expenditure without the authorisation required by part 14. In those
circumstances, the directors in default are jointly and severally
liable to make good to the company the amount of the unauthorised
donation or expenditure, with interest, and to compensate the company
for any loss or damage sustained as a
result.</div><a name="0606305000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
company in default is a subsidiary, the directors of the ultimate
holding company are also potentially liable. As such, the provision
will pierce the corporate veil of the subsidiary company and make other
people liable for the defaults of the relevant company. Obviously, that
approach requires caution. That provision was introduced into the
Companies Act 1985 and then reflected in the Bill on the basis of
control between the board of the holding company and that of the
subsidiary. The interests of the shareholders of the holding company
might be adversely affected or prejudiced without that
protection.</div><a name="0606305000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing Companies Act, however, provides an important limitation.
Section 347F7(a) of that Act states that liability shall not arise
if</div> <a name="0606305000558"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the subsidiary is not
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the holding
company&#148;.</div><a name="0606305000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">That important
qualification is not reflected in clause 352(3)(b)(i) of the Bill,
which states merely that the defaulting company has to be a subsidiary.
That approach exposes the directors of any holding company to the risk
that they will be liable to compensate a subsidiary over which they
might not have direct control.</div>
<a name="0606305000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
impossible to imagine a situation in which company A holds a 51 per
cent. interest in company B, but does not control the board of company
B. Section 736 of the Companies Act states that a company is deemed to
be a subsidiary of another if it is a member of it and controls the
composition of its board of directors or holds more than half in
nominal value of its equity share capital. Therefore, even though
company 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 362</div>A is unable to control the activities of company B, company B could
still incur an unauthorised donation, and the directors of company A
could be liable to compensate company B even though they were not party
to or able to stop the payment of such a donation. Similarly, the
provision makes no allowance for the proportion of the shareholding
held, so while the holding company is only a 51 per cent. holder of the
shares, its directors are liable for 100 per cent. of the
compensation.</div><a name="0606305000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Grand
Committee, Lord McKenzie
said:</div><a name="0606305000559"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If we

the directors are held to account if they fail to do
that.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1 March
2006;Vol. 679, c.
153.]</div><a name="0606305000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet that
is not what the 1985 Act does. It draws an important distinction
between the approvals mechanism and the sanctions provisions in respect
of non-wholly-owned subsidiaries under section 347F(7)(a). The existing
Companies Act clearly recognises that it may not be possible for a
director of a holding company to procure compliance by a
non-wholly-owned subsidiary. The logic was right when it was
introduced. It is right now, and it should be reflected in the Bill,
too.</div><a name="0606305000479"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000787"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I want to make two points about the amendment, the
first of which is legal argument. The definition of
&#147;subsidiary&#148; under section 736 of the 1985 Act
essentially defines a subsidiary as a company controlled by a holding
company by virtue of the fact that the holding company controls the
majority of its voting rights or has the right to appoint or remove the
majority of its board of directors. Therefore, in many
cases&#151;indeed, most&#151;the directors of a holding company
will control the voting rights that the subsidiary needs to pass a
resolution approving a political donation and, if not, will have
control of the board.</div><a name="0606305000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the definition of &#147;subsidiary&#148; is
slightly different in relation to the accounts and reports provisions,
and that may have given rise to some misunderstandings about the
potential liability of the directors of a holding company if a
subsidiary makes an unauthorised political donation. I reiterate that,
for the purposes of the political donations provisions that we are
discussing, unless a company&#146;s voting rights or board of
directors&#151;or both&#151;are controlled by the holding company,
it is not considered a
subsidiary.</div><a name="0606305000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point relates to the underlying policy intention of the clause, which
is to ensure that if, for example, the directors of a holding company
use the controlling voting rights that they have in a subsidiary to
pass a resolution authorising the subsidiary to make a political
donation without an authorising resolution from the members of the
holding company, they, as well as the directors of the subsidiary, are
liable.</div><a name="0606305000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 314 would mean that the directors of a holding company would not be
liable for an authorised political donation if the subsidiary was not
wholly owned, when none the less they controlled a majority of voting
rights of the board or the subsidiary. In our view, that would weaken a
sensible and necessary provision, which is why we oppose the
amendment.</div><a name="0606305000483"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000788"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for setting out
the position. She has reflected what I said initially about the
subsidiary. The key matter is that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 363</div>proposal is a change from the 1985 Act, which
recognised the distinction of the wholly-owned subsidiary and limited
the remedies in that way. Can she explain what problems have occurred
since the Act was introduced to justify the change in
policy?</div><a name="0606305000484"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000789"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I can write to the hon. Gentleman if we have
information about that, but I assume that during the company law review
such issues were considered. I wish to give him one more piece of
information that I think might help him. Worries that have been
expressed about the lack of safeguards for directors of holding
companies, if they have no controlling practice of the subsidiary, are
dealt with under subsection (3)(b). That provides that directors will
not be liable if, having taken all reasonable steps, they could do
nothing to prevent the donation. This is a sensible set of
propositions, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="0606305000485"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000790"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I thank the Minister for her explanation. In
large part, she reaffirmed what I was saying. There is a potential
issue of liability for directors of the holding company. It certainly
appeared to be important in the 1985 Act to maintain the distinction
between a wholly-owned subsidiary and a subsidiary in which there was
only a 52 per cent. holding. I believe that that original distinction
was drawn to highlight and address some of the potential risks that I
mentioned in my comments on the clause.</div>
<a name="0606305000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
the Minister is not willing to give ground on that point, and although
I think that it is a valid issue that deserves further examination and
consideration to ensure that we are not creating inadvertent problems
or issues as a consequence, I am minded not to press the amendment to a
vote. I shall certainly listen with interest to any further
representations that the Minister might wish to
make.</div>
<a name="0606305000487"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000791"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The only thing that I want to say to help the hon.
Gentleman is that once I have written to him, he can make a decision on
whether he wants to raise the issue again on
Report.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000792"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful that the Minister has agreed to
write to me. If that letter could be written before the conclusion of
our consideration in Committee, I would be grateful, as that would mean
that as a Committee we could at least hear the results of that. I am
gratified by the points that she has made and by the fact that she is
prepared to write to me. In the light of that, I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000795"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause provides a mechanism for
shareholders to bring proceedings to enforce the liability of any
person under clause 352 in the event of an unlawful political donation
being made or if unlawful political expenditure is incurred. Subsection
(4) provides relief from liability in certain circumstances, including
if the unauthorised amount has been made good to the company or if
proceedings have been brought by the relevant company.</div>
<a name="0606305000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 315 and 316 are
probing amendments, as subsection (1) talks about proceedings being
enforced by the company. When holding company director action might
apply, I want to be clear whether the reference to the company means
the company that has incurred the illegal donation or expenditure, the
holding company or both alternatives. If the latter two constructions
are applied, the directors of the holding company should be granted
relief if an action is diligently pursued by the subsidiary or if the
sum is made good to the subsidiary as contrasted with the holding
company.</div> <a name="0606305000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
317 raises a different issue, and confirms that ratification of an
action by shareholders will provide relief. Obviously, under section
347C(5) of the 1985 Act, ratification is not allowed. I note that that
section is not incorporated here, and therefore the view is that
ratification is, by the omission of such provisions, permissible. That
certainly is the intended effect of the provisions. The amendment was
intended to put clarification on the face of the Bill, given that the
clause is a reversal of the pre-existing situation, and to make the
position absolutely clear.</div>
<a name="0606305000580"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000796"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing
amendments Nos. 315 and 316 to our attention. We should like to reflect
on and return to the issue that he has raised. He rightly said that
clause 352 imposes a liability on the directors of the subsidiary donor
company and its relevant holding company. Clause 353 gives conduct of
legal proceedings to enforce the liability to members of the company.
In that case, &#147;the company&#148; means the donor company, not
the relevant holding company. However, if the company is a wholly owned
subsidiary, it will not have any members with an interest in pursuing
the action. Accordingly, the action must be capable of being brought in
the name of the donor company by members of the relevant holding
company, and, arguably, by members of any intermediate holding company,
too.</div> <a name="0606305000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
cannot accept amendments Nos. 315 and 316 as drafted, we accept their
intent, and I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 365</div>happy to undertake to table amendments on Report to
address the issue that the hon. Gentleman has drawn to our
attention.</div> <a name="0606305000499"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure whether I am right or wrong, but with amendment No. 317 it seems
that the hon. Gentleman would like to provide for a director to apply
to court when there had been an authorising resolution, so as to
prevent the bringing of a shareholder action relating to an
unauthorised political donation. If there is an authorising resolution,
the political donation cannot be unauthorised. I do not know whether
there was a drafting issue, but the amendment does not make sense, and
he may want to consider that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000800"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We now turn to the treatment of trade unions
for the purpose of the Bill. As I understand it, the exemption
incorporated in this clause is that trade unions are not to be regarded
as political organisations for the purposes of the Bill. The exemption
is based on uncertainty about whether the provision of company rooms
for trade union meetings, the use of company vehicles by trade union
officials and paid time off to trade union officials could be construed
as a political donation requiring an appropriate shareholder
approval.</div>
<a name="0606305000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is entirely appropriate for
companies to support trade unions. Trade unions play an extremely
important role in representing and supporting employees and their
interests in a range of fields, whether pay and conditions, safety,
resolving disputes when an employee may have been treated
inappropriately by their employer or supporting employees who have been
injured at work or contracted illnesses as a consequence of their
work-based activities. They also undertake the essential role of
supporting the personal development, education and training of their
members and generally promoting good working practice. Companies should
be able to facilitate such activities and it is right that the Bill
should seek to ensure that such support can be provided without the
need for a cumbersome approval process. I am concerned that excluding
trade unions from the definition of &#147;political
organisation&#148; would go much further than
that.</div><a name="0606305000508"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
history of trade unions is inextricably linked to political activity,
and the connection is maintained today. The comments of the chairman of
the Labour party, the right hon. Member for Salford (Hazel Blears), are
germane. She spoke to the BBC on 18 June on the issue of party funding
and defended trade union backing of the Labour party. She
said:</div><a name="0606305000560"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
a view that trade union donations include affiliation. I think there is
a very strong argument that affiliation fees are actually the aggregate
membership of millions of people who want their trade unions to be
collecting for us in the way they have been for over a hundred
years.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
added:</div><a name="0606305000561"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
a lack of understanding about the way in which certainly our party is a
federal organisation of different kinds of membership and that
organisations are members in themselves.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 367</div><a name="0606305000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
line of argument seems to affirm that trade unions, or at least some of
them, are an important structural part of the Labour party&#151;a
political party. From the conceptual perspective, therefore, I find it
extraordinary for the Government to state in the Bill that it is
impossible for a trade union to be regarded as a political
organisation, when the chairman of the Labour party appears at the same
time to be saying that unions are an integral part of the
party&#146;s political
superstructure.</div><a name="0606305000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current wording of the clause would make it entirely possible for a
company to make a donation to a trade union that is then passed
directly on to a political party of whatever colour. Such a donation
would be exempt from the protections afforded to shareholders even
though it might have been made in the knowledge that it was to be used
by a political organisation. It would thereby bypass the protections
that would otherwise cover such a
situation.</div><a name="0606305000512"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606305000801"></a><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher</b> (Burnley) (Lab): What is the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s response to the TUC, which says that if a trade
union accepts a donation from an employer for such a purpose it will
lose its certificate of independence, which it is desirable to
have?</div><a name="0606305000513"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000802"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is interesting that the hon. Lady refers
to the status of a trade union following the TUC&#146;s
representations to the Better Regulation Task Force, which
said:</div><a name="0606305000562"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
often forgotten that trade unions are employers themselves and
businesses. As such they experience the same problems as other
businesses of keeping up with employment law
changes.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">It therefore
draws direct parallels between companies and trade unions. That is why
amendment No. 219 would delete subsection (1), but only on the basis of
exemptions that would be granted under proposed new subsection (5),
which would be inserted by amendment No.
220.</div><a name="0606305000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
comments of the right hon. Member for Salford also drew a distinction
between affiliation fees and political donations made by a trade union,
seeing the former as being collected almost on behalf of the party,
unlike the more general donations that a trade union might make. That
leads us to the other aspects of the additional wording proposed in
amendment No.
220.</div><a name="0606305000516"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000803"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> With due respect, although it is of course true
that trade unions are employers, I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman
answered my question. No trade union would want to be a post box for a
donation from a company to a political party because it would lose its
certificate of
independence.</div><a name="0606305000517"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000804"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> There is still an argument for displacement
and room for doubt on the matter. The fact that the TUC holds that view
does not detract from the more general line of argument that I am
adopting and the need for clarity. However, the hon. Lady correctly
highlights the issue of how funds are used and how funds that go from,
say, a corporate organisation to another organisation might be
appropriately treated. That leads on quite directly to the second part
of the amendments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 368</div><a name="0606305000518"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000805"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I must ask the basic question. If &#163;1
comes in from a company for educational purposes, presumably that is
&#163;1 that the union will not have to spend itself and &#163;1
that it could provide for political
purposes.</div><a name="0606305000519"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000806"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> That is a fair point in the displacement
argument, hence the reason for ensuring that proper and appropriate
protections cover such a
situation.</div><a name="0606305000520"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000807"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree, with regard to
answering the intervention from the hon. Member for Huntingdon, that it
is ultra vires for trade unions to make any sort of transfer from their
general account to their political
account?</div><a name="0606305000521"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000808"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I still take the view of my hon. Friend the
Member for Huntingdon in terms of the displacement argument. There is
still a risk that money will be used in the manner that he
highlighted.</div><a name="0606305000522"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members will be aware that the legislation on trade union funds is now
in sections 71 to 96 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Consolidation) Act 1992, the history of which dates back to the Trade
Union Act 1913. That established the concept of a union having to
establish a political fund, with the ability of an individual member to
contract out of a political levy. The Trade Union Act 1984 extended the
ambit of the legislation to cover &#147;political objects&#148;.
Under the current legislation, political fund review ballots must be
held every 10 years to ensure that members wish their political funds
to continue.</div><a name="0606305000523"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
clear parallels with the provisions before us in the context of
companies, with unions being required to obtain the consent of
individual members in respect of the use of funds for political
activities. The Department of Trade and Industry said in its
consultation document, &#147;Review of Employment Relations Act
1999&#148;, in the context of any possible reform of the
arrangements:</div><a name="0606305000563"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government understands the case for reform. However, these ballots
serve an important democratic function and ensure that union members
can at regular intervals collectively authorise their union&#146;s
involvement in political
activities.&#148;</div><a name="0606305000524"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
right, and the same logic applies to the approval mechanism set out in
part 14 of the Bill if a company wishes to make a political donation or
to incur political expenditure, so that the members of the
company&#151;its shareholders&#151;are given the right to approve
the use of company funds for political
purposes.</div><a name="0606305000525"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that there should be more broadly equivalent treatment in terms of the
permissions required by both companies and trade unions in relation to
political donations and expenditure generally, but that wider debate
would not be in order in the context of the Bill. However,
amendmentNo. 220 would provide that if a company wished to
make a donation to a trade union other than for the purposes set out in
subsection (5), it would need to be satisfied that the relevant union
had obtained an approval from its members that was similar to the one
the company would have obtained from its members. The amendment would
harmonise the approval regime between companies and trade unions in
relation to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 369</div>political donations and expenditure, at least in so far as funds are
received from
companies.</div><a name="0606305000526"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
that a company should have to seek the approval of its members to make
a donation to, or to incur expenditure for, a trade union in its wider
political capacity. It is right that a company should be able to
support unions in their essential role in promoting the interests of
the employees of the relevant company without unnecessary burdens. It
is also right that a union should require the consent of its members to
apply the funds given to it for wider political purposes, just as a
company would be so required, with a resolution at least every four
years.</div><a name="0606305000527"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment would give effect to that approach and would be an important
step forward in terms of creating equivalent treatment between
companies and trade unions in the context of political activity. Both
have members, who should be protected in the same
way.</div><a name="0606305000528"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000809"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> The intention behind the Conservative attack on
trade unions through the requirement to stage repeated ballots was well
known and it has been roundly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 370</div>defeated, because in almost every instance members of trade unions have
voted in favour of keeping political funds. The contortions,
convolutions and hypothetical fantasies that the hon. Gentleman is now
outlining seem to be yet another attack by the Conservative Front Bench
on trade unions across the board.</div>
<a name="0606305000529"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606305000810"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Not at all. This is not an attack on trade
unions. The amendment that we have tabled reflects the importance and
value of the work undertaken by trade unions by recognising all their
work on education and training, representing employees, consulting
employers and the relevant company and facilitating good industrial
relations. All of those are recognised in the amendment and would not
require any special consent from either the company or the union. The
amendments properly reflect that while drawing direct parallels, as the
Government&#146;s own Better Regulation Task Force recognised the
similarity of companies and trade unions in many
respects.</div><a name="0606305000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debate
