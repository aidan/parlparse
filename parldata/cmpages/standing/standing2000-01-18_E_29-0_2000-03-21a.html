<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now move to part IV of the Bill, on railways. Chapter I deals with the Strategic Rail Authority. All aboard, as they say.

<H4><center>Clause 176</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Authority</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 99, line 1, leave out subsection (2).

<P>
We embark at last on the final part of the Bill, which deals with the Government's proposed reform of the supervision of the railways. We have no objection in principle to the establishment of the Strategic Rail Authority. It is obvious that the Government do not have a clue what they are doing with rail policy and they need someone to tell them what they should be doing. However, we believe that this body, which is accountable and answerable to Ministers, should be explicitly part of the Government. It should be more advisory and act more as a catalyst than is envisaged in the Bill. There is a job for a body to undertake the sort of strategic guidance that a competent Minister would be able to undertake, but which is clearly not being undertaken at the moment. Therefore I move the amendment, to delete
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) The Authority shall not be regarded as the servant or agent of the Crown <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because it is obvious that what the SRA needs to do is the job that Ministers are not doing.

<P>
With your indulgence, Mr. Gale, as we concentrate on the first part of the section that deals with railways, would the Minister set out how he imagines the SRA should function? We have been having to read the smoke from the chimneys as regards the SRA's policies and what the Government intend for it ever since the shadow Strategic Rail Authority was established and Sir Alastair Morton was appointed.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should have said at the very beginning that in accordance with the procedures that I have chosen to adopt for the rest of the Bill, I am happy to have a reasonably broad-ranging debate at the start of this section if the Committee finds that helpful-again on the usual terms and understanding that we shall not re-run that debate over every clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Gale. We have been having to interpret exactly what the shadow Strategic Rail Authority has been intended to do from Sir Alastair Morton's speeches, which have been extremely welcome for the information that they have given. There have been precious few ministerial utterances on the subject, apart from the blitzing propaganda events of the train summits, which seem to have more to do with spinning benefit for the Government than making progress on the railway.

<P>
The progress on the railway that the Government like to claim as their own is in fact a product of the previous Government's policies. The railways have now been in the private sector for four years. I have just received a useful summary from the Railway Forum that explains how the industry is spending £24 billion over five years. The railways are carrying 100 million more passenger journeys than two years ago and running 1,500 more trains a day than in 1995. It is becoming cheaper to travel by train. There will be 2,200 new passenger coaches in service by the end of 2002. The number of freight tonne kilometres rose by 15 per cent. to 17.4 billion in 1998-99 compared with two years earlier. The industry is undergoing its biggest ever investment programme in Britain's railways in more than 40 years. By April 2000, 99 per cent. of all stations will have up-to-date systems for passengers with up-to-the-minute travel information by April 2000.

<P>
We envisaged that progress when the industry was privatised. The Government have been able to enjoy that progress before a single dot or comma of their legislation is on the statute book. It is incumbent upon the Minister to open the debate with conciliatory statements of support for an industry that has been investing so heavily and effectively in the railways.

<P>
There is far more to do. Forty years of nationalisation left the railways under-invested and clapped out. Sir Alastair Morton said in June 1999 that he had encountered a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>battered, historically under-funded, previously non-growth system now in the process-the painful process-of transforming itself into a modernised, growth oriented, larger and better system.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
With your indulgence, Mr. Gale, may I cite what the Deputy Prime Minister said about the privatised rail industry that he inherited? He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The railway industry has had plenty of well-deserved criticism, but there are now positive signs of revival in Britain's railways. Passenger traffic is rising. Over the past five years, passenger kilometres have increased by approximately 20 per cent.-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This was last summer; the figures have improved further since then-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>And roughly 14 per cent. of that growth has occurred in the past two years.-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
-[Official Report, 19 July 1999; Vol. 335, c. 799.]
<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister spoke of 1,000 extra services, increases in rail freight, new stations and station car parks. The Conservative party envisaged that renaissance of the railways when they privatised the industry. The Labour party scorned it, but it is now being delivered-and, I repeat, before a dot or comma of the Government's legislation is on the statute book.

<P>
Fifty years of decline have been turned into four years of renaissance. Even safety performance-that much discussed issue-has shown a general improvement since privatisation, which is a trend that the privatised industry inherited from the previously state-owned industry.

<P>
The challenges facing a railway industry that is confronted with opportunities for growth are far more daunting than was envisaged when it was privatised.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the reason for the acceleration of investment in rail by the private sector is that the expectations of the marketplace have been geared to what the Government have predicted and provided for roads. The Government's strategy to encourage investment in railways rather than roads, compared with the expectation when Railtrack was sold off for £1.8 billion-it is now worth £8 billion-that it would fail, has given rise to the success of the railway industry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman seriously deludes himself. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the industry was gasping for the level of investment that it enjoys today. There is more than double the investment in the railways now than there was before privatisation because the industry has access to capital markets in a way that it did not before.

<P>
If the hon. Gentleman's rail policy depends upon choking off the roads by creating extra congestion to force people to use the railways, no wonder the Government's transport policy is ineffective and unpopular. For 50 years there was a decline in the number of trains and passengers. That was reversed by Conservative, not Labour, policies. It is hard for Labour Members to accept that change of fortunes-the railway renaissance came about because of yet another successful privatisation undertaken by the Conservatives.

<P>
The hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward) shakes her head, but where would the money come from if the railways were still in the public sector? Perhaps the Secretary of State would be talking about a public-private partnership like the one that he is trying to impose on the London tube. Who would support that, apart from those involved in its implementation? Not one London mayoral candidate would do so, and many hon. Members object. What is the result? Ticket prices are still rising faster than inflation and investment has been cut compared with what was spent under the previous Government. There is no sign of the doubling or trebling of investment that has been achieved on the mainline railways. If only the Government were committed to achieving for the underground what we did for the surface railways there would be progress, but the governing party is still wedded to the doctrine of state control and intervention and that is what is threatening the continuing railway renaissance.

<P>
The Bill, in the shape of its proposals for the Strategic Rail Authority, the additional powers given to the regulator and to a certain extent the way in which the regulator has already behaved, has been politicised once again. Under the proposals, the Strategic Rail Authority may become a bottleneck for investment rather than a facilitator.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): The hon. Gentleman convinces himself rather than the rest of the Committee and then changes tack. Is it not a fact that all the privatised railway companies have written to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions welcoming the Government's proposals? The hon. Gentleman does a weak case no good by arguing against it himself.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I made it clear that we accept in broad principle that there should be a body to help the Minister conduct railway policy, but I have spoken to a number of the pressure and interest groups that represent the industry and they have concerns. We shall be raising those in detail. The fundamental problem is confined to some specific and narrow areas of the Bill. Those include, for example, some aspects of the powers to amend licences that would interfere with franchise agreements, the power of the regulator to direct investment and the way in which public funding is to be applied. These threaten the railways.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) is a director of a transport company that is in the news at the moment. It is interesting that in the bus industry there has been an explosion of spontaneous investment and activity as the result of privatisation and the same process is in train in the railways. However, in their three years of stewardship, the Government have started to undermine that process and have made the industry once more look far too much towards the Secretary of State, to the instruments of the state and ultimate to the Treasury. If the hon. Gentleman wants me to explain that further, I will do so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants the hon. Member to stop waffling and answer a straight question. Did the privatised railway companies welcome the proposals that we are discussing this morning publicly? Yes or no?

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The privatised railway industry will say all sorts of things because it is confronted with a fait accompli in the Bill. It knows what is coming and it might as well welcome it as fight it. The Secretary of State, the Prime Minister and other Ministers have waged a publicity war against the industry to escape their own responsibility for the problems that still exist. The Secretary of State as good as tried to blame the Paddington crash on Railtrack. He has now had to withdraw the policy proposal that he launched so precipitously after that accident and he is rightly awaiting the outcome of the Cullen inquiry. The train summits were an exercise in fingering the rolling stock of the train-operating companies with the blame for the state of the railway when that blame lies as much with the 40 years of backlog of investment under nationalisation.

<P>
I will readily give way to the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East if he will answer this question. Where would the double or treble investment come from if the industry had not been privatised?

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The fact that the hon. Gentleman is putting across a curate's egg message should not allow any of us to be blind to the fact that under successive Governments-Labour and Conservative-the Treasury consistently underinvested in our railway system. That is a fact. There is no point in arguing about it. Let us come back to reality. The hon. Gentleman is long overdue so far as reality is concerned. Is it not a fact that, well before the Bill was published, the privatised railway companies welcomed the Government's proposals for a Strategic Rail Authority and all that goes with it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am perfectly happy to concede that the companies would like an organisation to be a buffer against the over-politicised Secretary of State who has re-politicised the whole transport debate with regard to railways. They would like a professional railwayman to represent their interests to Government and to Ministers and to bring some reality. I was not the one who finally stripped the Secretary of State of his transport responsibilities; it was the Prime Minister, who handed them over to Lord Macdonald of Tradeston, the Minister for Transport. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should defend the Secretary of State when now no one defends the Secretary of State's role in transport policy except himself.

<P>
I fully acknowledge that the industry is welcoming the possibility of having a more sensible dialogue than the shouting match that the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State initiated when they were first elected. What we want from the Minister this morning, however, is an explanation of how the industry will deliver the huge investment demands that it has now identified for the next 10 or 15 years. When the Railtrack management statement comes out on 29 March, we anticipate a total investment demand in the next 10 years of some £40 billion to £45 billion. As a result of Government action in the intervening period, the industry is probably less able to fulfil that investment programme than it was two or three years ago.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I was wondering whether my hon. Friend might remind the Committee about the impact on Railtrack shares of the interference of the Secretary of State, which will make it harder for that company to raise the money that it needs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend is right. One of the main charges that the Minister must answer in the Committee today is what the Government will do to restore overall investor confidence in the railway. Once they had dropped their ludicrous plans to renationalise the railway, they inherited an enormous amount of goodwill and competence from the City of London towards the various companies investing in the railway, particularly Railtrack.

<P>
When the Government were first elected, the Railtrack share price moved up from about £12 to £17 and it may have been somewhat frothily valued at that stage. The share price has now fallen right back to about £7.50. Railtrack had such a drubbing from the spin doctors at No. 10-the Minister should listen to this because he is responsible-and from the political antics of the regulator, who put out a press release shortly after the Paddington crash threatening to remove Railtrack's licence, when it is probably not in his power to do so under such circumstances. What is that sort of political manoeuvring intended to achieve? Should not the regulator act in a restrained and independent manner rather than become caught up in the politics of defending the Secretary of State in a difficult corner, which is what happened?

<P>
The resulting lack of confidence in Railtrack means that whereas 18 months ago it could issue hundreds of millions of pounds worth of bonds-such fashionable instruments nowadays-to raise money to invest in the railway, in a matter of minutes, today its credit rating has been downgraded and the share price is at an all-time low, not far above the flotation price. That is because the regulator has been conducting a vendetta and sees his role as being to punish the rail companies on behalf of the passengers, regardless of the overall objective of those companies, which is increased investment in the railway.

<P>
Much the same lack of confidence is assailing the train-operating companies. The Government came in with the laudable intention of renegotiating the franchises, but that process has been dragging on for three years and there is evidence that the train-operating and rolling stock leasing companies are beginning to experience investment hold-off because no decisions have been made and the franchising process is taking too long to complete. The certainty in the industry has been reduced, which means bigger risks for investors: investors are inclined to hold off as risks increase.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): It is clear from the hon. Gentleman's statement that for the Conservative party shares are more important than proper safety review.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is absolute rubbish.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> You are saying that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am not saying that at all. Safety requires investment, better management and an improved culture. I have supported a great deal of what the Secretary of State has been doing to improve safety on the railway. His driver training initiative was extremely good and the Cullen inquiry is likely to be extremely productive. The hon. Gentleman ignores the fundamental fact that the trend on signals passed at danger has steadily declined since privatisation. The only time that that trend started to move up again was last summer and no one asked why. That was a failure in the industry, a failure of regulation and a good reason for setting up the Cullen inquiry to find out how to avoid such a terrible accident ever happening again.

<P>
It is a question of investment. Sir Alastair Morton says that there are three very important words for the industry: ``Investment, investment and investment.'' If the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) believes that money can be raised for the railway while the regulator is being allowed to collapse the share price of the main infrastructure company, he will be disappointed, but that will be the outcome of the Government's policy.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning </B>(Mr. Nick Raynsford) indicated dissent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister shakes his head. Why is the review of access charges taking so long? When will there be certainty so that Railtrack can plan ahead to deliver its network improvements? I have no doubt that it has told the Minister and the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), that it requires certainty about the future so that it an deliver network enhancements. When I became shadow Transport Minister, one of my first meetings was a briefing with Railtrack. It was saying that it wanted a revised system of incentives and penalties to encourage better performance and reward network improvements. What have the Government been doing if the same message is still coming from Railtrack after they have been in office for three years? Having ditched their policy because they realised that they could not turn the clock back to the old days of socialism, they were elected without a policy. They have conducted a vendetta against the privatised industry that has undermined its ability to invest. They have robbed the regulator's office of its independence so that it now acts knowing the mind of the Secretary of State and-maybe unconsciously-does his bidding. That has effectively undermined the financial viability of the industry.

<P>
The key question that the Minister needs to answer as we discuss the clause that establishes the Strategic Rail Authority is how the Government will deliver the £40 billion to £45 billion of investment in infrastructure that is needed? How will the money be raised to ensure that that investment goes ahead, or is it all a pipe dream? This Government inherited a greater opportunity for a railway renaissance than any other since the first world war and so far they have squandered it. What will they do to deliver the investment the railways need? I shall look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): It is good to welcome the hon. Gentleman back. We have missed him in the past few weeks, but he has found something into which he can stick his teeth for a while.

<P>
As we said on Second Reading, we support the introduction of the Strategic Rail Authority. Considering what has gone before and the lack of direction and mess in the industry after privatisation, something is required to get things on a proper footing and to take the long-term view. That has been beyond the system until now.

<P>
Since privatisation, there has been considerable growth in passenger demand. I will leave the Minister and his opposite number to decide who should take all the credit for that. Alongside that there is the need for substantial investment in the rail network to improve the quality of available services to users.

<P>
The Liberal Democrats had hoped that the Government might follow through the good things they said about an integrated transport system and make the Strategic Rail Authority a strategic transport authority with more onerous responsibilities for integrating different modes of transport, to ensure that the links and shifts between them are facilitated. To give a heavyweight organisation, as the SRA will be, that responsibility would be worth while. We regret that an opportunity has been missed.

<P>
Whatever different transport policies the parties promote, the key issue is the need for consumer choice-to provide an alternative to the private car to ensure that we deliver on many of our enviornmental objectives and give substance to the rhetoric of which we are all occasionally guilty. We all want a cleaner environment with fewer people using cars, but we must recognise that, unless there are viable alternatives, people will continue to use their car.

<P>
In that context, the development of an integrated transport system is important. There is a clear responsibility to make sense of the rail network and the Strategic Rail Authority is a worthwhile development for that reason. The key task of the authority is to try to strike a balance between a regulated environment that includes elements of competition and a free-for-all, which even the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) will recognise is not a feasible option in the current climate.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman will recognise that the 1993 Act does not provide for a free-for-all: the industry is heavily regulated, not only by the regulator, but by the franchising director. It was never envisaged that there should be a free-for-all, so I do not know whose policy he is talking about.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being a tad defensive. I said that not even he would argue that there should be a free-for-all, and all his intervention has done is reinforce my point.

<P>
There has to be a balance, but where is it to be struck? The Government cannot escape the need to invest: the substantial demands being placed on the existing rail industry and the substantial demands for its future growth require substantial investment. The infrastructure is pretty well at the limits of current capacity. Last year's network management statement from Railtrack tells us that the company envisaged having to spend £27 billion in the following 10 years. It is now mooted that the figure for investment in the updated statement, which is due at the end March, will be between £35 billion and £40 billion. If we are to believe press reports, the chairman of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority, Sir Alastair Morton, has said that the investment required over that period may be as much as £45 billion. We can be confident that all those figures understate both the investment that is required and that which will be delivered.

<P>
To what extent do the Government expect to provide any of that investment? As usual, the House of Commons Library produced a useful research paper in anticipation of the Bill. It states that, because of the way in which the proceeds from privatisation and other sources are developing, there will be a decline over time in the amount that the Government put into the rail industry. The Government's rhetoric merely pushes the resposibility for investment elsewhere-specifically, on to Railtrack, train operating companies and rolling stock companies. It would be interesting to know whether the Government have ruled out future Government investment in the rail industry. Is there any prospect of any premiums realised from the on-going franchising process being redirected to the SRA, so that it can begin to develop the services that it has a responsibility to provide?

<P>
The Budget statement is to be made this afternoon. We cannot guess its details, and I would not expect the Minister-assuming that he knows them-to lose his job by revealing them early. We do not know what will happen to fuel duty, or whether there will be real increases in resources and the creation of ring-fenced funding for public transport. However, is it part of the Department's plans that the SRA should receive some of that funding, either this week, next month or whenever, as services are developed?

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> This afternoon, will the Liberal Democrats support or oppose increases in fuel duty over and above the rate of inflation, or does it depend on the phases of the moon?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I am always delighted to take an intervention from the hon. Gentleman. As we are in a benevolent phase of the moon, we shall oppose any increase above that required to substitute for vehicle excise duty. We intend to get rid of VED on cars up to 1600 cc and we shall compensate with an increase in fuel duty.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying desperately hard, but I cannot relate VED to the rail regulator. Could we come back broadly within the parameters of the Bill before us?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale, for falling for the seductive question asked by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East; I promise not to do so again.

<P>
If the Government will not provide investment, will Railtrack be expected to foot the entire bill? The hon. Member for North Essex has already highlighted the increasingly parlous state of Railtrack's finances. The halcyon days of £18 per share seem a long time ago, but they occurred at the tail end of 1998, and so were as recent as 18 months ago. There was a brief rally in December after the rail regulator appeared to hint of a more relaxed access charges regime, but, since then, the shares have pretty well been in free-fall: quite recently, they were as low as £6 each.

<P>
What confidence does the Minister have that Railtrack will have the financial muscle needed to raise in the market funds for investment? Now, many people would doubt its capacity to achieve that, not through any lack of willingness on its part, but because of the state it finds itself in as dot.com companies rush by on the outside. If Railtrack is not to be the sole provider of infrastructure investment, what role does the Minister envisage for the special-purpose vehicles that are being touted by some of the franchise bidders for investment in rail services?

<P>
We are all aware of Virgin Trains' bid for the east coast main line. It envisages huge sections of new track from Huntingdon to York and some fairly major modifications to existing track. That scheme clearly falls well within the Government's appeal for creative solutions to existing problems, but will the whole concept of a special-purpose vehicle find favour with the rail regulator? A report in the Financial Times of 14 March highlighted the rail regulator's concerns about extending his regulatory powers beyond Railtrack, to cover other track and infrastructure operators. Two questions arise: does the Minister believe that the rail regulator's powers should be restricted to infrastructure owned by Railtrack, or, if he is to tolerate different providers of infrastructure, will he seek to extend his regulatory powers to cover other parts of the service-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can we limit the number of private conversations? They make it difficult for me to hear the hon. Member who has the Floor.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.

<P>
A rather large square has to be circled and it is not clear how that will be managed. The focus so far has been on future investment. There is a substantial amount of investment at present, for which the hon. Member for North Essex was keen to claim credit. Nevertheless, it is a growing public scandal that there is a huge amount of new rolling stock sitting in yards waiting for permission to be put on to the railways. There has been an extraordinary exchange of correspondence between the shadow SRA and Railtrack about what the SRA regards as Railtrack's failure to complete the vehicle approval process and so allow the new rolling stock into service. Sir Alastair Morton described the position as a farce after the Deputy Prime Minister visited Adtrans in February and found sitting idle in the yard the very vehicles that he had seen there last August. Those who have heard the bold claims that everyone is making about the current level of investment in the railways will be surprised to hear that.

<P>
There are always at least two sides to a story, but this story has several sides. Where is responsibility for getting over such difficulties allocated in the new regime? At the moment, Railtrack has no incentive to get on with the approval process because it gets nothing out of undertaking such action, so it does not have dedicated teams meeting regularly to tackle such matters. People in the industry say that there is a great deal of frustration about Railtrack's lack of effort. No doubt, Railtrack will say that there are other sides to the story; wherever the blame lies, there is an awful lot of rolling stock that is needed on Britain's railways lying idle. That will be a major problem in future when further growth takes place. What part of the new regime tackles that issue? At the moment, that is not clear.

<P>
On the related matter of land, key to the SRA's strategic function is its ability to plan new interchanges, whether between different modes of transport or new developments in infrastructure; therefore, land assets inherited from the British Railways Board will be crucial to that strategy. To what extent is the SRA expected to retain land that it or outside bodies believe might play a role in developing our rail network? The Minister has an opportunity to address that this morning, but I also hope that we shall discuss it in relation to later clauses. Various outside bodies have highlighted an apparent contradiction between clause 182, which sets out the strategic functions of the authority, and clause 193, which states that the SRA can develop land and sell it off, thus becoming a private-sector developer in its own right.

<P>
The type of investment that has caused the most concern in the public mind recently relates to safety; indeed the Ladbroke Grove tragedy and the Southall report are fresh in ministerial and other minds. A significant question remains about who is expected to pay and, having listened to ministerial statements and met with interested parties in the rail industry, I am not at all clear that there is consensus on that issues. Will it be the rolling stock companies, which are responsible for new rolling stock; Railtrack, which must alter the line; or some other body? We need a clearer picture of who is responsible for safety investment under the new regime, and who should make plans accordingly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks an interesting question, but I am not sure that it is the right one. If one body or one individual is to be responsible for rail safety in a diversely owned and operated industry, is there not a danger of absolving everyone of the obligation to ensure that their own operations are safe? Everyone has an obligation to invest in and manage safety and to promote safety culture. If the intention is to create focus for safety management in the industry, unless the function is regulatory, it will not have the desired effect.

<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I welcome that intervention. It is important for the Minister to clarify where he believes responsibilities for different types of safety expenditure lie. My impression-and it is shared by the public-is that a merry-go-round or a game of musical chairs is going on at the moment and we can only wonder who will be left standing at the end of the process to pay for safety.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point was not directly relevant to my argument, but I agree that every participant in the rail sector-as in the air and other sectors-has a responsibility for safety, and no one should pretend otherwise. We have been developing a dangerous regime and culture in which lapses in safety were starting to be tolerated.

<P>
In the aftermath of the Ladbroke Grove accident, the future of the safety and standards directorate within Railtrack was brought into the open. We have heard different Government statements to the effect that they were minded to transfer responsibilities from Railtrack elsewhere. It is clear from the Deputy Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons a few weeks ago that some movement has been made, which we welcome.
 
<P>
We remain concerned about the odd suggestion to create the oxymoron of an ``independent subsidiary'' of Railtrack to act as the safety and standards directorate. It is either independent or a subsidiary; it cannot be both. In an article in the Railway Gazette International, it is clear that the industry largely interprets that as a cosmetic manoeuvre. I accept that the Deputy Prime Minister regards it as an interim measure. It is not the answer because Lord Cullen has yet to conclude his inquiry before taking his final decisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a sound point, but does he agree that it would have been better for the industry if the Deputy Prime Minister had not shot from the hip so soon after the Paddington crash? He should have waited for a proper Health and Safety Executive report, or indeed for the Cullen inquiry to finish, before making recommendations. Instead, he fired off a briefing to the newspapers soon after the Paddington accident for certain purposes, but we had better not go into them in the context of this Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I do not wish to engage in mud slinging, which the hon. Gentleman so clearly enjoys. Credit should be given where it is due and some pretty swift decisions were taken about inquiries, some of which have reported, for example the Davis inquiry. Issues were brought together on which there appeared to be a consensus-though the hon. Gentleman seems to be diverging from it-about how to develop train safety systems.

<P>
I accept what the hon. Gentleman says about coming up with a solution at this stage, as we should be mindful that Cullen has still to report. That leaves us in a half-way stage, which is not helpful, and the Bill lacks the capacity to enable Ministers to implement the decisions that the Government say they were minded and may still be minded to do. Does the Minister believe that he will have the capacity to do so under the Bill? If so, fine. To have to wait for further primary legislation would be a great shame if, when the next inquiry reported, a consensus emerged on the need properly and fully to separate the operations of the safety and standards directorate from Railtrack.

<P>
Competition is a fraught issue. As I said earlier, we wanted to establish a completely regulated system that takes account of the way in which the rail system has developed over the centuries, its shortcomings, and the lack of potential competition. On the other hand, I am sure the Committee agrees that allowing anyone to put trains on to the railways would be nonsensical. In the new environment, investment demands and the requirements of different franchise companies are such that there is a prospect of letting 20-year franchises. Many have welcomed that, and we would join them in doing so, because such a system would create stability and allow proper investment decisions to be taken, thus further enhancing the quality and extent of investment that companies are willing to undertake. What is important in such an environment is the scope it allows for competition on some or all of the system.

<P>
Will we have to accept local monopolies as the price of obtaining the improvement in services that so many people demand? Virgin Trains has raised the walk-on fairs from Manchester to London by 50 per cent. in the past two years, but I am not aware of anyone claiming quality improvements that match that price increase-far from it. If that is what happens under the existing regime, what confidence can the consumer have that their interests will be looked after in future? What guarantees are there about levels of service and the ways in which fares will develop? What powers will the regulator use and how frequently will he use them?

<P>
In major conurbations such as Manchester, in the midlands and in parts of Scotland, competition will be possible and consumer protection will have to be provided. The flip side is found in more peripheral areas such as the north of Scotland, parts of Wales and Cornwall, where the danger is that, whenever the sums are done, the few companies interested in railways in such areas will see that a large subsidy is required to keep the routes operating and developing in tandem with routes in parts of the country with more dense populations that demand the benefits of a modern rail system. At stake are accessibility, social inclusion and assistance for economic development-issues that are at the heart of the Government's Agenda. It is important that the more peripheral areas continue to enjoy the services they still have.

<P>
There is a need for the Strategic Rail Authority to consider the introduction of services in areas where none exist, or the reintroduction of services that have been discontinued. In our previous two or three sittings, members of the Committee have become familiar with the campaign of my hon. Friend, the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) to get the open-top buses of Bath properly regulated. This is not special pleading, but I should like to raise the question of the Waverley line in my own constituency in the Scottish borders-which is the easy way round the Minister's usual problem with my constituency's name. That cut, made 30 years ago, was one of the worst of the Beeching cuts. In consequence, areas of the borders have begun to suffer as they have become more peripheral to Edinburgh and to the north-east and north-west of England.

<P>
The Minister will be aware of the recent completion of a feasibility study sponsored by the Scottish Executive that involved different groups from the borders and other areas. The Waverley line is a classic example of the type of facility that the Strategic Rail Authority ought to consider. The recent announcement of approximately £800,000 to cover the first three years' operating costs of Edinburgh's crossrail scheme reveals that the shadow SRA regards itself as having an important role to play in that respect. I hope that, during our debates on this part of the Bill, the Minister will assure us that he, too, regards it as the SRA's responsibility to sponsor the development of routes, such as that running through my constituency and on to the north of England, thus providing a third strategic link between Edinburgh and England.

<P>
I shall briefly address the issue of freight. The role of rail freight is absolutely essential to our effort to achieve the environmental objectives of a more modern integrated comprehensive transport system. With the Government's support, the key operators, English Welsh and Scottish Railways and Freightliner, have indicated their desire for rail freight's current 7 per cent. share of the freight market to triple over the next few years. The companies have invested accordingly and some of their new wagons are now plying their trade up and down the country.

<P>
As understated aspect of the Bill is the role that the SRA is to have in the promotion of rail freight. Some concern has been expressed in the industry that the Treasury does not want to pay subsidies to the rail freight sector, and that Railtrack itself, dependent though it is on English Welsh and Scottish Railways to get its maintenance and infrastructure improvement teams around the network, regards freight as a nuisance that gets in the way. It does not take a genius to work out that passenger train operating companies regard freight as something that gunges up their lines and prevents them from operating a full range of services. Do the Government support the rail freight operators' objective of tripling the market share for rail freight? If so, how will they support the companies? There are conflicting signs from the Government on that matter.

<P>
The question of 44-tonne lorries is directly relevant to that point. I may have missed it, but I am not aware that the Government have responded to the Commission for Integrated Transport's recommendation that 44-tonne lorries should be introduced. I hope that that strange silence is the result of the Government's not being sure that the advice that they have received from the commission is right. The rail-freight groups are absolutely adamant that the introduction of 44-tonne lorries will damage their market: instead of tripling their share of the freight sector in the next few years, they anticipate that share being halved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No doubt, we shall have opportunities to discuss the prospects of freight later in our deliberations. Two facts are germane to the hon. Gentleman's argument, the first of which is that, even though the Commission for Integrated Transport must have been aware of its being prepared, it did not have at its disposal the recent McKinsey report on the effect of 44-tonne lorries. Secondly, fundamental to rail freight's future is the price that freight pays on the railway. That issue forms part of the access review that has been going on for some time now, and it must be resolved if freight companies are to have the certainty they need.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I welcome those observations and hope that the Minister will deal with those additional points in his reply. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has received, or sought, alternative advice on the issue on which the commission has now provided public advice. People are horrified at the idea of 44-tonne lorries hurtling round the countryside, not believing-understandably-that the proposals will reduce the number of lorries on the roads. We are talking about a rising economy and a rising tide of freight, so in time there will be more lorries. The real difficulty for most rail freight operators is whether the existing rules are being enforced. One industry source told me recently that the average truck driver can expect to be stopped and checked once in four years. If drivers are shrewd enough, or dodgy enough, always to be operating at night, there is virtually no chance of being caught.

<P>
Will the Minister say how the enforcement regime will be strengthened and the extent to which we can expect that any measures or decisions taken by the Government on the 44 tonnes and the existing regime will not undermine the very point of rail freight, which we all appear to support.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> My constituency is substantially a rural one with no rail links. Will the hon. Gentleman agree that the introduction of 44-tonne lorries would reduce freight costs in his constituency?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The hon. Gentleman's constituency is beautiful. I used to live in Jedburgh and from time to time we would go to Hexham for Christmas shopping and various other things. There are some beautiful old roads left by the Romans and I suspect not much has been spent on them since. The truth is that most of the lorries that are passing through my constituency, and probably his, belong to his right hon. Friend, the former chairman of Asda. There are no Asda superstores in my constituency but I see many of its lorries passing through. We need not get into a parochial argument about this: the truth is that the many lorries are damaging the roads at the moment. I would love there to be an alternative of rail provision in my constituency to take some of that frieght off the road. After the battering that my local economy has taken in recent years, however, the damage being done by local lorries is not that great.

<P>

<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is perpetuating a further myth. A 44-tonne lorry is precisely the same size as any other large lorry on the road except that it has an additional axle. The fact that it has an additiontal axle means it does less damage to the road surface, even with the extra weight, than lorries with lower weights. If he wants the technical details, quarry lorries do far more damage to roads than 44-tonners will.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> There is a range of arguments, but we shall soon be questioned by you, Mr. Gale, as to which part of the Bill this relates. The public concern has been that the current regime has not been enforced, and that every time there has been an increase in axle and heavy goods vehicles weights we have been promised that it will be the last one. How many axles can a lorry have? There is a limit.

<P>
The Committee has indulged me for longer than usual this morning. We have listed a series of issues with which I hope the Minister will deal. We will return to the detail in individual clauses and amendments, but we broadly support the SRA. It will bring an important new direction and cohesion to a sector that is easily picked off and attacked by different parties and members of interest groups and the public. We need to improve that, to get the investment in and ensure that the competition is still there so that the consumer is being looked after. However, without a proper, successful rail network we shall not be able to move people out of their cars and on to other forms of transport.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> After the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), I want to give my wholehearted support to part IV of the Bill and the establishment of a Strategic Rail Authority. It should be seen in the wider context of our ambition for an integrated transport policy, which has been evident throughout the Bill. As we all know, an integrated transport policy is essentially a multi-modal, seamless network that carries goods and passengers effectively across Britain. It is part of a wider ambition for economic success and environmental sustainability.

<P>
On the railway as a key part of that network and the purpose of the Strategic Rail Authority in delivering those ambitions, we inherited from the previous Government a shambolic, fragmented system in which one could not go from A to B, which followed a rip-off whereby the railway industry was sold off for peanuts. Railtrack was sold for about £1.8 billion and was later valued at £8 billion. The asking price in the first instance was below what the market would have paid, as was clearly shown by the Public Accounts Committee on which I serve. It was sold just before an election when there was uncertainty over what a new Government's views towards it would be. Since then, it has appreciated and contrary to what has been said by the hon. Member for North Essex about the utterances of the Government-[Hon. Members: ``Where is he?'']-I do not know where he has gone, I suppose that he has gone on a train. The current share price is more than 50 per cent. of what it was at flotation, despite problems of confidence in the public mind-problems caused not by the Government but by events and legitimate concerns in the rail industry.

<P>
The share price has recovered and more investment has gone into the rail industry. The reason is that investors know that the Government are not hell bent on predict and provide-providing more roads-and they know that a higher share of transport growth will go into the rail network, both for consumers and for freight.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale focused on freight, I should mention that the rail freight business was sold by the previous Government not for nothing but for minus £250 million. It was given away with £250 million of taxpayers' money, yet the Government now want more freight to go on to the railways. There is a debate as to whether it is to be three times or four times, but what is certain is that more and more freight is likely to go by rail. From an entrepreneurial point of view, it must be clear that rail is a commercially viable place to invest, given the wider conditions brought about by the Government-conditions that we advocated even before the election.

<P>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for North Essex has gone. I want to speak to two of his arguments. He seemed to be saying that, whatever happens, the Government should never say anything that might undermine the share price, even if we have a disaster and have to set up an inquiry. Everyone who saw the Panorama programme or The Mirror or any part of the national media would have seen investigative journalists looking into the background, not least the investment in signals systems. Indeed, I remember reading a headline in the trade press that said: ``Railtrack say extra signals don't make business sense.'' It is important that such matters are discussed. The Deputy Prime Minister set up an inquiry, which was the right thing to do. If there is a problem we will set up an inquiry. We are here to support the public, not simply to support the share price.

<P>
The essence of the Strategic Rail Authority is to underline the fact that we will help to create conditions in the marketplace-expectations of growth in the industry-that will fuel more investment. The SRA is meant to co-ordinate a coherent system that increases efficiency and the overall network strength and therefore increases the viability of extra investment.

<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for North Essex has returned. I was about to mention another of his arguments. He said that the Strategic Rail Authority should be a buffer of experts between the Government and the industry. If that is the case, why has he tabled the amendment? If the SRA is to be ``a buffer'', it will not be much of one if it is suddenly made part of the Government. At present, it is a quasi-independent, autonomous, expert body that is charged with co-ordinating and delivering rail services effectively within a wide, integrated transport system. The hon. Gentleman's amendment suggests that the SRA should be part of the Crown. He does not know whether he is coming or going, as is so often the case. I assume that he will seek to withdraw the amendment, because he has already argued a convincing case against it.

<P>
Finally, with the SRA, it is our ambition to deliver a more efficient, joined-up rail system in terms of ticketing and integrated track coverage between the regions. In time, we see that as the key to the system enjoying more patronage, lower prices and more resources. The SRA will not be a peculiar buffer in an administrative and bureaucratic morass, but a key strategic instrument in delivering success to the industry and to Britain.

<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) made an interesting point about rail freight. He may have noticed in the changed estimates that went through the House last Wednesday that the Government have switched £27 million from the Budget heading for grants to rail freight to aerospace, Eurocontrol and National Air Traffic Services. Either the Government have overprovided or there are no opportunities to give grants to rail freight. We hope that by the time we reach the end of the Bill, we shall understand better how to improve the prospects for more freight to go on to rail. It is an important matter, but no one signs up to it and says, ``That is what we all want.'' To achieve it is much more difficult, especially as our rail system is to a large extent a feature of the industry of the Victorian era, when the railways were built, rather than the construction of a modern economy, with so many factories and businesses spread out into smaller towns.

<P>
In broad terms, we can all agree that the railways have suffered under-investment post war. They probably suffered under-investment pre war as well, because the private rail companies faced problems in the 1930s. Many of them made no money and the second world war put great pressure on the railway industry. Much of it was run down, because the railways had not been run at full capacity for war purposes; then nationalisation followed. When one takes into account the money to go to railways, as against hospitals, schools, foreign aid, defence and all the other priorities of Government, it is inevitable that railways may not receive highest priority. In post-war years, not only did British Rail have a number of limits on what it could invest, but even until the late 1970s any investment over £250,000 had to go to the Secretary of State for Transport for approval. The major refurbishment of a station had to be referred to the Minister. Clearly, that is no way to run a railway.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Does it not logically follow from what the hon. Gentleman said that he should vote against amendment No. 22, which calls for referrals to Ministers rather than semi-autonomous support?

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I will deal briefly with amendment No. 22 when I have answered the hon. Gentleman's point. The main benefit of privatisation is that it allows money to come from outside government, from investment based on commercial decisions. It is advantageous also in terms of management. I have no doubt that the privatisation of rail is a good thing for the country. It was not especially good for the Conservative party, because, given the length of time that it would take for people to see the benefits of higher investment within the industry, it was what Sir Humphrey Appleby would have called ``a brave and courageous decision'' to privatise rail in 1993. I suspect that it is one of those matters on which people will look back in five or 10 years and say, ``It was a good thing to do.'' I am not sure, however, that we gained many votes by it-I suspect that we may have lost one or two. Nevertheless events have proved that Conservative Governments always do what is in the national interest rather than their own. It will be said that the policy of my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) is in the nation's interests.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
To return to amendment No. 22, clause 176(2) is curious. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Authority shall not be regarded as the servant or agent of the Crown or as enjoying any status, immunity or privilege of the Crown; and its property should not be regarded as property of, or held on behalf of, the Crown.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We should like a full explanation from the Minister of why the subsection is included. As I understand it, the Secretary of State can direct the Strategic Rail Authority through many clauses to take specific action, but clause 176(2) seems to immunise him from providing a buffer by stating that the responsibility should not flow in the way that it should. The authority has the power to make regulations. I notice later that it can make regulations about smoking on railways. Occasionally, such matters lead to legal action and great concern. How would that operate?

<P>
The Strategic Rail Authority would make a regulation that would be implemented by a franchisee. If someone was very upset by it, would they sue the franchisee or the SRA? If it could be traced through to him, can they sue the Secretary of State? I am interested in the status of the SRA. Earlier in the Bill-which seems a long time ago-we were talking about the Civil Aviation Authority, which is a Crown body. The SRA has a similar role, but may be constituted differently. Will the SRA have to have liability insurance against being sued? If it is not to be regarded as a Crown body, will the Crown underwrite it? I notice that the Bill provides for a £3 billion borrowing power. Will the Minister tell us whether the Government intend to give the SRA £3 billion from day one? If not, will the borrowing power rather than a specified amount of money be given to the SRA? Will the £3 billion count against the borrowing of the Treasury? Will the SRA, as constituted, count as a pubic debt? We are trying to probe these issues and how clause 176(2) of the Bill is to be interpreted. It is the chain of responsibility that concerns Opposition Members. How will it work? What is the impact of clause 176(2)?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> Now that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central has heard my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) explain the reason for the amendment, I hope that he will understand its purpose. As my hon. Friend has said, it is to throw some light into the darkness of the relationship between the Secretary of State and the SRA. When the Minister replies, I hope that he will go further and try to explain the relationship between the Strategic Rail Authority, Railtrack, the operating companies and others involved in running the railway, because it is not clear.

<P>
Schedule 13, which relates to clause 176, gives the Secretary of State virtual power over everything that the Strategic Rail Authority does. He has to approve borrowing and can lay down terms and conditions of loans, appoint staff and direct the SRA to pay his Department or the Treasury funds from its own accounts. In sum, he has complete control over the activities of the SRA. It is therefore important to know the balance between the authority and those who are running the railways.

<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale spoke about how the Strategic Rail Authority might encourage the development of rail-road interchanges. Opposition Members are unhappy about running a railway system in this way. It is going back to the old days of nationalisation, as it is now up to the Secretary of State and others to determine what developments should take place. We prefer to view the SRA as a much lighter, knocking-together-of-heads regime, rather than a regime to pick winners and losers in the rail industry, which will be disruptive and will detract from the essence of privatisation's success-allowing independent entrepreneurial companies and individuals to come up with good ideas to improve the rail network. We want to encourage, not discourage that.

<P>
If the SRA is to lose its £3 billion borrowing powers to spend on rail infrastructure, it should be at the behest of the rail operating companies. The explanatory notes state that the SRA should be able to make loans for projects that may not be commercially viable, but are desirable for the efficient running of the railway. One has to be careful about going into that sort of territory. It would be possible to improve the Welwyn viaduct, with which the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn), who knows much about the railways, would be familiar, though he is not here at present. That would mean widening the main line to the north-hugely expensive and not commercially viable. The SRA might conceivably decide to invest funds in that project. Will the Minister make it clear whether the SRA could operate in such a way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there are other examples of autonomous groups appointed by the Secretary of State-the Monetary Policy Committee, which is independent of the Bank of England, for example? It is not an exact analogy, but it was established by the Secretary of State to provide independent and expert advice in the service or administration of an industry. Is that not a fairly coherent model that can be adapted to different sectors? The hon. Gentleman and Opposition Members often argue for less centralisation and less of a Government hands-on approach. The Bill allows for that, so the hon. Gentleman is arguing against it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. I may have misunderstood what he said. We are trying to question the Minister.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central suggests that the provision amounts to a reduction of interference and regulation, but it does not. It has been described as re-nationalisation by the back door by an independent firm of solicitors that specialises in railway law-the same firm with which the present regulator used to be a partner. The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) is that the entrepreneurial activity that raised the level of investment will now be squeezed out by the new powers given to the Secretary of State under the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Ridiculous!

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman says ridiculous, but it is not ridiculous. We are trying to find out what the SRA can do. At its worst, it could reintroduce back-door nationalisation. We want to establish the precise relationship between the SRA, Railtrack and the operating company. We want to know how much interference there will be and the extent to which funds can be used to back winners and losers. Will the SRA play the disastrous old game of nationalisation or will it be a light regime to knock a few heads together when necessary?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are concerned about back-door nationalisation, why are they calling for greater ministerial powers to control the SRA? That is a complete contradication and farce.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is called a probing amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central has been a Member of Parliament since 1997, so he ought to realise that the purpose of tabling amendments is not to rewrite the Bill but to gain ministerial answers to questions. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex has asked the Under-Secretary many questions that he could not have asked had he not tabled a probing amendment. The hon. Gentleman should learn that that gives us an opportunity to question the Under-Secretary about such a key relationship.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The amendment provides the Under-Secretary with an opportunity to say how independent the SRA is intended to be. His reply will provide us with ample ammunition to attack other contradictory provisions in the Bill that suggest that the SRA is not meant to be an independent body because the Secretary of State has powers over it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Absolutely!

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I will, but I am beginning to feel like I am umpiring between two hon. Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall be brief. I accept that the amendment is a probing amendment. However, why does it not relate to subsection (2) and state that the members of the authority should be independently appointed, autonomous or free from shackles? Instead, it deals with giving more power to the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's proposal may be very good. We would welcome his input if he wants to help us draft future amendments. He obviously understands such matters.

<P>
I completed my remarks some time ago. It is extremely important that the operating companies and Railtrack know precisely where they stand vis-à-vis the SRA? I trust that the Under-Secretary will make that clear in his tour d'horizon.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> We are used to overviews at certain points in our deliberations, especially when we start to discuss individual parts of the Bill. However, the present overview has descended into microscopic analysis of many details of part IV and the operation of the railway industry.

<P>
Yesterday, in a Committee debating delegated legislation on the rural bus subsidy, 23 questions and points of concern were drawn to my attention. Today three times that number have been raised, and I fear that I shall not be able to respond in the detail desired by hon. Members. I remind them, however, that we shall have ample opportunity to debate such matters in due course. Without exception, we shall return to almost all the matters raised in this morning's discussions when we debate later clauses. Nevertheless, I shall endeavour to deal with as many points as is reasonably possible in the limited time reamining.

<P>
I shall deal with the interventions in reverse order. The hon. Member for Hexham asked for an explanation of the relationship between the key players, as described in the Bill. I shall deal with that later, as I shall the Strategic Rail Authority's financial activities and opportunities. The hon. Gentleman pleaded that the SRA should not be allowed to operate with a heavy hand or stymie innovation in the industry. That is also the Government's hope and expectation, but while train operating companies continue to be paid with public money to provide services, it is not unreasonable for the SRA to exert some influence on the services that appear to be provided with that public money. I will return to the hon. Gentleman's other points in due course.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Mr Jenin:</B> There is a major philosophical difference between the two main parties on the issue. Of course, the railway industry will not survive without some public subsidy, but the 1993 Act arranged for that subsidy to be applied as neutrally and with as little distortion as possible to promote maximum freedom for management and innovation. The Bill uses the pretext of public subsidy to restore many of the controls and influences over the railway that existed under nationalisation. Does the Under-Secretay recognise that that will stifle innovation and crush the industry's ability to raise its own finance?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It does nothing of the sort. That is not the Government's intention. If the hon. Gentleman had ever examined a franchise agreement he would know that they are remarkably detailed agreements on the provision of services, so that practice would not take place. The notion that this is a device to restore-let me quote one of the hon. Gentleman's interventions on my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central-``Nationalisation'' of the railway industry is preposterous. I have become fond of the hon. Member for North Essex, although he was naughty in an intervention this morning, but I will come back to that. However, it sometimes worries me that he is beginning to lose his ability to distinguish between propaganda, which, after all, is a perfectly normal, legitimate part of the political process, and fantasy. I caution him to take a hold of himself. Perhaps that is something that his Whip-Whips, as we know, have concern for our general moral well-being-should look at.

<P>
I hasten back to the intervention by the hon. Member for Poole. I was amused when he promised to deal very briefly with amendment No. 22 for all the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central exposed beautifully. It was a total contradiction, but we shall return to that in course. The hon. Gentleman spoke sincerely about the importance of rail freight. He said that perhaps we all pay lip service to the need to shift freight from road to rail but do not always achieve this. This may have been true during the previous Administration's time, but it is not true of ours. We have a good story to tell.

<P>
Perhaps I may regale the Committee with the facts of the Government's expenditure. This is not a story about privatisation, it is about Government expenditure on rail freight grants. In 1993-94, Government support for rail freight facilities amounted to £2 million. In 1994-95, it was £3 million; in 1995-96, £4 million; and in 1996-97, £15 million. In 1997-98, there was a 100 per cent. increase to £29 million and in 1998-99 the magnificent sum of £29 million was given again. During the past six months, the Government have been happy to announce the two largest freight facility grants since the inception of the rail freight facility scheme. The Government do not pay lip service to rail freight investment; we deliver.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> When did the industry set itself the target of trebling rail freight? Was that before or after the election?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> To be honest, I do not know. Under the Labour Government, investment in rail freight has doubled and that figure has been sustained. That is a proud record and I make no apology about that achievement.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Crodyon, Central, exposed the contradiction at the heart of the Opposition amendment in an excellent speech. The Opposition do not know whether they are coming or going. They do not know whether the SRA should be a part of the Government or not. My hon. Friend caught the Opposition on a raw nerve with his incisive analysis of the weaknesses of their amendment. He is extremely knowledgeable about these matters and he treated us to an excellent historical analysis of the original rail privatisation, which he rightly described as the creation of a shambolic, fragmented railway following a rip-off sale of the system. I am most grateful to him for his support.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): In praising his hon. Friend's attack on privatisation, does he recall the Labour party's public position of moving towards a publicly owned and publicly accountable railway? Does he believe that the Bill is moving towards a publicly owned and publicly accountable railway?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No, that is not the Government's intention here. I make no apologies for that. The Government have made a clear decision that we need to engage in fruitful co-operation with the privatised railway. We recognise that there has been real progress, but that many problems remain. We are where we are and the Government intend that by co-operating with the train-operating companies, Railtrack and the other key players in the now privatised rail industry, we will create a growing and prosperous railway system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Given that that is the case and that the hon. Gentleman is moving back from that public commitment, will he apologise to the people of this country for reneging on a commitment on which he was elected?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I do not think that that was the commitment with which the Labour party went into the election. We were rather niftier on our feet. We have no basis on which to apoligise to the British electorate. We told them what we would do and we are in the process of delivering on that promise, as on so many others.

<P>
On the contribution from the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, my heart rose when he referred to the Waverley line. It was on that line that I had my first vision-[Laughter.]-of his beautiful border constituency. I have had many visions since then. It was certainly a splendid line and I commend his campaign to restore it.

<P>
I was more than a little grateful for the hon. Gentleman's observation that we could return to many of the points of detail that he raised. Let me attempt at least to deal with some of the issues. He asked about investment and, if I understood him correctly, he said that he feared that we were pushing responsibility for investment elsewhere on to Railtrack and the train-operating companies. It is our hope and, again, our expectation that although there will remain an element of public subvention in the operation of the rail network in this country, it is not unreasonable to expect that a proportion of the investment in an expanding and increasingly profitable railway should come from the rail companies themselves in their various forms. Nevertheless, the SRA will continue to play a significant role in investment in the railway, as the Bill makes clear. Frankly, it would be totally premature to discuss detailed sums of money or the financial vehicles whereby additional investment may become available. That is for later debates.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about delays in vehicle acceptance. Formal responsibility for vehicle acceptance rests with Railtrack. There have been delays, but it is important that new stock should be safe and properly approved. The Secretary of State has asked the shadow Strategic Rail Authority to set up a task force with all the parties-Railtrack, the Office of the Rail Regulator, the train operating companies and the manufacturers-to iron out the problems. I am pleased to inform the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that that new process is working satisfactorily.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about railway land. He pointed to an apparent contradiction between development powers and the strategic authority. He is, by the way, right to say that we shall return to land at a later stage. Let me tell him at this point that the position is clear. The Secretary of State will be able to give the SRA directions on how the SRA's land is to be used. If there is a good rail use in realistic prospect, the land can be held by the SRA; if it is not needed, the SRA may sell it.

<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale also asked about safety, which is a reasonable and proper issue to raise. In general terms, to go further on safety than we have so far would have been disruptive with a consequent risk to safety on the railway. We have been able to implement a number of measures already, as the hon. Gentleman is aware, pending what we expect to be possibly more far-reaching recommendations from Lord Cullen. We did not want to take steps at this stage that might make it harder later to respond appropriately to whatever Lord Cullen may advise. However, it remains the case that in the light of various recommendations that we receive it may be necessary to proceed with primary legislation on rail safety. I hope that that is helpful.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked an interesting question about more than single company access to a track. I served on the Standing Committee of the 1993 Act when much play was made of the possibility of competition between companies on the same stretches of track. That did not happen, for a variety of reasons. Such a system is not envisaged, although it remains part of the measure. It is a matter that relates to the financial viability of train-operating companies. Only now do most of them have the prospect of making profits. Track capacity has to be taken into account too, of course, and there is unlikely to be a shared and competing access to track in the foreseeable future.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I asked about the hon. Gentleman's views on competition. He highlighted real, practical issues and experience reinforces the Government's view, which is shared by many people. I want to know what protection there will be for consumers. The franchise periods will be 20 years, rather than five or seven. How much more active will the regulator be to protect consumers in matters of quality?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My answer to the hon. Gentleman's questions is in two parts. First, the hon. Gentleman will concede that the new regulator-appointed by the Government-has already been somewhat assertive with regard to Railtrack. Secondly, the Bill considerably strengthens the powers of the future SRA over consumer protection. We are putting the rail user bodies on a much more formal basis and giving them a wider remit. The Government are setting up the framework for vigorous representation of consumer interests in the future shape of the franchised railway.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned 44-tonne lorries during a discussion about freight and I answered part of his question when I responded to the hon. Member for Poole. Any decision on those lorries, I can say categorically, is not for the SRA, which is the subject of our debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The Under-Secretary cannot duck the issue. The decision will have a major impact on the rail freight industry, which is the responsibility of the SRA. The rhetoric is that we should have more rail freight. I asked whether the hon. Gentleman had received any other advice and when we could expect a decision. If he cannot give a decision now, that is fine.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The answer is that the Government asked the Commission for Integrated Transport to hold an inquiry into the matter. It received wide-ranging representations from a variety of bodies and interests and came up with a recommendation; a decision on the matter will be taken in due course.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Under-Secretary tell the Committee whether Sir Alastair Morton has made representations to the Government on the subject of 44-tonne lorries? Does he support the view of the Commission for Integrated Transport?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am not in a position to respond to the hon. Gentleman on that matter. I am not aware that such representations have been made. I regret that I cannot help him further, but that is the reality of my information on the matter.

<P>
Let me turn to the hon. Gentleman's introductory remarks. This morning, there has been a serious retreat from the good-humoured and reasonable way in which we have hitherto conducted our exchanges. The hon. Gentleman's assertion that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister ``as good as blamed Railtrack for the Paddington crash'' is unjustified and I utterly refute it. I also refute the allegations about newspaper leaks, which my right hon. Friend has explicitly denied. I hope that the hon. Gentleman regrets his words and that he will, on reflection, retract them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I see that the hon. Gentleman declines to do so. I very much regret the unpleasant tone that he has introduced into this morning's proceedings, but I do welcome his initial remark that the Opposition have no objection in principle to part IV. That is entirely reasonable, given that our proposals for the Strategic Rail Authority have been welcomed by train users, operators and the Select Committee, and by Parliament as a whole, as evidenced by its giving the Railways Bill its Second Reading.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Bill was not welcomed by the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs. The Committee divided on the report and Opposition Members voted against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. However, the Select Committee's report begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We welcome the Railways Bill, which we believe is a practical way of addressing the problems of a restructured railway.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the very words of the report expressing the considered view of the Select Committee, which clearly welcomed the Government's proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): My hon. Friend may be aware of the comment by the Institution of Civil Engineers:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Establishment of the Strategic Rail Authority should give the necessary strategic leadership to a rail sector which has lacked this since its fragmentation and privatisation.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Exactly. I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding the Committee of the genuinely warm welcome for the Government's proposals.

<P>
I shall take the Committee on a tour of this part of the Bill, but, first, I shall respond to some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for North Essex. He asked what progress had been made with franchise replacement. Our policy will replace the previous Government's short seven-year franchises with long franchises running for 15 or 20 years; that will provide more certainty for train operators and increase their ability to invest. The Committee will be aware that franchise replacement is under way, with proposals for the Chiltern, east coast and Connex South Central lines. The Committee will also be interested to hear that the franchising director will announce this week the key features of the first three replacement franchises. The hon. Member for North Essex has not asked his questions in vain: they have elicited a piece of news, which I am delighted to convey to the Committee.

<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex also mentioned the delay in the regulator's access charge review. It is being conducted according to the timetable in the access agreements. It goes without saying that the regulator is conducting a careful and thorough review. I hope that will also help the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
I do not propose to engage in a lengthy analysis of the pluses and minuses of the privatisation experience. However-and this is in some measure a response to the challenge laid down by the hon. Member for North Essex-the Government do, of course, welcome recent progress in the rail industry. We welcome the increase in the number of services and in rolling stock investment and the greater focus on the customer. The fact remains that there are still serious problems. There are no grounds for complacency about the passengers' experience of a declining overall record in punctuality, overcrowding and still unsatisfactory levels of investment in the network. The railway industry still suffers the consequences of its fragmentation into 100 different pieces in the early 1990s-a process that inflicted considerable damage and led effectively to the drying up of new investment in rolling stock for three years. There has been progress recently and it is true that investment by the industry in track and rolling stock is improving.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> When the hon. Gentleman mentions damage to the rail industry, he is talking about an explosion of investment in new rolling stock and infrastructure. The industry has reduced the investment in rolling stock because of the hon. Gentleman's refranchising process. He should be asking the SRA to back or sack each rail franchise. It is the back-them-or-sack-them decision that will lead to the future investment that is still required.

<P>
I am not complacent about the problems that the privatised rail industry inherited. They are big problems, but the Government have not been tackling them in the long term. They have been more concerned with headlines that undermine the credibility of what was done before, rather than working on what they should be doing now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman brings me back to my earlier worries about personal fantasies and propaganda. The reality is that for three years in the early and mid-1990s there were virtually no new orders for railway rolling stock such was the damage and lack of confidence inflicted, particularly on the railway manufacturing industry as a result of privatisation. If there is now a powerful move towards rolling stock renewal, which we welcome, that is in part due to a new confidence in the railway industry. It is also because of the desperate need to make up for low levels of investment in the earlier period.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The facts speak for themselves. I shall quote the figures for the industry's investment in track and rolling stock from the early mid-1990s to the present. In 1994-95, £1.35 billion was invested; £1.2 billion in 1995-96; and £1.25 billion in 1996-97. In the new climate of confidence in railways that the election of this Labour Government injected into the industry, investment increased to £1.5 billion in 1997-98, and £1.7 billion in 1998-99. Our current expectation for 1999-2000 is that more than £2 billion of new money will be invested in track and rolling stock in the railway industry.

<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex talks about the historically low levels of investment in railways. Why was investment so low? Hon. Members must correct me if I am wrong, but did not the Conservative Government choose to starve the railway industry for 18 years?

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): In fact, the hon. Member for North Essex spoke about 50 years. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary could remind us that the Conservative party was in power for 35 of those 50 years.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is entirely correct, but that historical error will certainly not be repeated. The hon. Member for North Essex should realise that investment in the rail industry has been historically low precisely because, as my hon. Friend says, Conservative Governments have been responsible for most of that period and have systematically starved the railway industry of proper investment.

<P>
I have dealt with most of the issues raised by Opposition Members, so I shall now revert to my main mission: to fulfil the Committee's expectation of hearing an overview of part IV, chapter I. We have had a tour d'horizon from the cockpit of planes in part I and a tour by guided bus in part II, so with your indulgence, Mr. Gale, perhaps I can now take the Committee on tour of part IV on the ``Roger Gale Flyer''. I have just thought of naming a train after you, but I am sure that that will be only a matter of time.

<P>
The House has seen similar provisions before in the Railways Bill, which was scrutinised by the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee. Part IV will meet our commitment to set up the Strategic Rail Authority and to provide more effective and accountable regulation. We want to develop a growing, safer, better-invested railway that is committed to delivering improved performance, quality and capacity.

<P>
The SRA will be the new guardian of the public interest and its creation has been widely welcomed by the industry, users and the Select Committee. The railway provisions will enhance enforcement and deal with other matters, but I shall start the tour on the ``Roger Gale Flyer'', as in the Bill, with the SRA.

<P>
Under chapter I, we shall establish the SRA, set out its mission, powers and duties and transfer to the SRA the functions of the franchising director, the British Railways Board and some of those presently the responsibility of the rail regulator and the Secretary of State.

<P>
Clauses 176 to 179 and schedule 13 provide the basic structure of the SRA, its status, membership and appointments. They make provision for the staffing and financing of the authority.

<P>
As has already been discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central, the SRA will be a body corporate and not a Crown body. In Whitehall terms, it will be classed as a non-departmental public body-known in the trade as an NDPB. The authority will have a board consisting of the chairman and between seven and 14 other members appointed by the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On the question of the status of body corporate, has the Minister given consideration to the effect that transferring the functions of the franchising director, who is currently an appointed individual, to the body corporate, which is by definition less accountable-a bureaucracy is less accountable than an individual-might have on the accountability of the franchising process?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman points precisely to one of the Bill's purposes, to which I would have thought he would not take great exception. It creates a more arm's length relationship between the Secretary of State and the Strategic Rail Authority. That is exactly what the Opposition have been calling for with their demand for a lighter touch on the rail industry. We are confident that the arrangements for accountability that are enshrined in the Bill will provide proper accountability. At the same time, we are creating a somewhat more independent structure than we have seen heretofore in the railway industry, which we believe will be helpful to the SRA's constructive, proactive and creative role.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is impossible for the Minister to argue that the franchising director, who is an independent person appointed to manage a franchising process, is somehow more independent of Ministers than the proposed structure, which blurs the director's responsibilities between a board and a bureaucracy and makes him specifically accountable-with guidance that the Secretary of State can issue at any time. Our concern is that that is not providing for a lighter touch; it is providing for a more political and interventionist approach.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> On this one, the hon. Gentleman and I will simply have to agree to differ. There will be ample opportunity, as we approach more detailed provisions, for us to examine the precise nature of the relationship between the SRA and the Secretary of State. Let me continue my tour of the rail network.

<P>
Schedule 25 deals with first appointments. It is intended that the first chairman of the board will be Sir Alastair Morton, who is currently chairman of the British Railways Board. The first chief executive will be Mike Grant, who is currently the franchising director. Schedule 13 includes fairly standard provisions for NDPBs, to regulate members, staffing procedure and audit. Part II of the schedule provides for the financing of the authority. The SRA will be funded by the Secretary of State and will also be entitled to borrow money, subject to certain restrictions.

<P>
Clauses 180 to 182 set out the framework in which the SRA must work, with a hierarchy of purposes, strategies and duties. They are fundamental provisions. I hope that it will assist the Committee's subsequent debates if I explain briefly how those three clauses hang together.

<P>
Clause 180 sets out the three primary, high-level purposes of the authority: in other words, its ``objectives'' or ``mission''. Clause 181 requires the SRA to explain how it will give effect to those purposes through strategies that it must formulate and keep under review. Again, the strategies will necessarily be at a high level. The Secretary of State has the power to give directions and guidance to the authority, for example, on the matters to be covered by the strategies.

<P>
Under clause 182, the SRA will have to exercise its functions with a view to furthering its purposes in accordance with its strategies. It will also need to exercise its function in the manner calculated best to achieve the considerations listed in paragraphs (a) to (f) of subsection (2): for example, protecting the interests of users and promoting ``network benefits'', including through ticketing. The SRA also has to have regard to the considerations in subsection (3), namely, safety, the interests of disabled people and environmental effects. The Secretary of State may give directions and guidance to the SRA as to the manner in which it should exercise its functions.

<P>
Clause 183 gives Scottish Ministers the power to give the SRA directions and guidance in respect of certain services. That provision accords with the arrangements for executive devolution of rail matters announced during the passage of the Scotland Act 1998. I dare say that we shall have further debate on the matter in due course.

<P>
Clause 186 is wide-ranging. The authority has power to enter into agreements for the purpose of securing the provision, improvement or development of railway services, facilities, assets and so on. That includes a power to give grants, loans, guarantees, or any other form of financial assistance.

<P>
Clauses 187 and 188 set out the procedures that the SRA will need to follow before it can act as a train operator. We revised the provisions that were formerly in the Railways Bill to ensure beyond doubt that those operating powers were for use only as a last resort. Clause 189 gives the authority powers to secure substitute bus and taxi services where necessary.

<P>
Under clauses 190 to 193 and schedules 15 to 18, the authority will assume the functions of the franchising director and the British Railways Board, including the board's responsibility for the British Transport police. Those provisions also provide for the transfer to the authority of the consumer protection functions of the rail regulator. Consumer protection matters include telephone inquiries, through ticketing, penalty fares, the protection of the interests of disabled people and administrative responsibility for rail consumer bodies.

<P>
Under clauses 194 to 197 and schedules 19 and 20, the authority is given the additional miscellaneous powers that it will need. They relate to the making of railway byelaws; the power to transfer property, rights, liabilities and staff to a wholly owned subsidiary of the authority, or to the Secretary of State, or to a franchise company; the power to promote or oppose Bills in Parliament; and the power to promote Transport and Works Act 1992 orders.

<P>
That completes my overview of part IV.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): Can my hon. Friend confirm that the consultation that takesplace with Scottish Ministers will also take place with the National Assembly for Wales?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I cannot give my hon. Friend that guarantee. As he is aware, specific undertakings and commitments were made under the McLeish settlement during the passage of the Scotland Act, but I am not aware of comparable commitments made in respect of the Welsh Assembly. Having said that, by means of Government amendment, the Bill goes a long way towards clarifying the rights and responsibilities of the Welsh Assembly.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): We should not lose sight of the important distinction that the Scottish Parliament has legislative powers and the Scottish Executive has a role and influence in the Scottish economy that goes beyond that of Welsh devolved institutions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for drawing that to our attention. He is absolutely right, and I am sure that the implications will be teased out in future exchanges on the matter. I must hasten on, lest my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. John Smith) be stung into a response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I make one additional observation, which is that the National Assembly for Wales has responsibility for delivering integrated transport in Wales and overseeing the integrated transport plans there.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) and my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan have both set out their stall for future debates. I look forward to considering those issues soon.

<P>
I turn now to the amendment, which is the ostensible reason for our debate. The hon. Member for Poole asked who would have legal responsibility and how the chain of legal responsibility would work-in short, who sues whom? The answer is that liabilities follow activities. The SRA will be responsible for its activities. It will be possible to sue the authority, which will also be subject to judicial review. Subsection (2) does not provide immunity against legal action. If that were otherwise, the operators would be liable to legal action if they were responsible for an incident.

<P>
Subsection (2) clarifies the status of the authority as a non-departmental public body. Without that provision, there would be confusion as to the status of the SRA. It is true that the SRA will acquire functions that relate to franchising, as well as some regulatory functions from the Crown. However, looked at in the round, the extent of the authority's functions, especially the enhanced powers to give financial assistance, are more consistent with the activities of mainstream NDPBs, such as the Housing Corporation or the regional development agencies, which act more commercially than is traditional in government. The amendment would achieve nothing and would detract from the clarity of the Bill. Opposition Members have made it clear that the amendment was designed to probe and it has certainly succeeded in doing that for the past two and a half hours.

<P>
We have given careful thought to the purpose and functions of the SRA and to the organisational structure that would be most effective. We want the SRA to be a flexible and proactive player in the railway industry, setting out a strategic vision and working continuously to promote and improve the network. To achieve that, the authority should have wide powers to award franchises and give financial assistance on terms that suit the needs of the railway industry. Sometimes, that may require the authority to act commercially, by borrowing and lending money or investing in equity. The authority will inherit staff from a Government Department, a nationalised industry and two non-ministerial Government Departments. It will need employment packages that are flexible, but within the normal public sector framework. Such requirements are best served by constituting the SRA as a public body outside the Crown. It will be a development body for the railway section. The Housing Corporation and the regional development agencies would be equivalent bodies-all are non-departmental public bodies.

<P>
I hope that in the light of my explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for the trouble that he has taken to answer some of the points that were raised. However, the Under-Secretary did not deal with the key question of how the Strategic Rail Authority will deliver the extra billions of investment that will be needed by the industry and are likely to be specified in the network management statement that Railtrack will produce later this month. That question will hang like a cloud over our deliberations on this part of the Bill.

<P>
The Under-Secretary spent a considerable period deriding what he described as my propaganda and fantasies about the effects of the Government's policy. However, under the stewardship of the Under-Secretary and the Government, investors have deserted Railtrack in droves. They have been responding to policies and announcements made by Ministers and the regulator appointed by Ministers: they cannot be blamed for their decisions, given what has been said.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman winningly and enthusiastically took up the cry that the industry has become shambolic and fragmented as a result of our policy. However, that only underlines his misunderstanding of the industry that he has inherited. If we introduced a Bill creating a modern airline industry with a multiplicity of airlines, diversity of airport ownership, infrastructure and service companies, complex national and international regulation, the Under-Secretary would throw up his hands in horror. Indeed, the Labour party did exactly that when we privatised British Airways, saying that it would be the pantomine horse of capitalism. However, it has turned out to be a rather successful business until recently.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The printed record will clarify the context of my remarks. Furthermore, I characterised the description that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central gave of the fragmented and shambolic railway that would result a rip-off sale of the system as an excellent historical analysis of the original rail privatisation.

<P>
The privatised railway operated unsatisfactorily for a period after the original privatisation. I am delighted to say that it is starting to get its act together, backed by a supportive Government committed to public transport and the rail industry. We recognise that there is now an opportunity for fruitful and positive co-operation between all the partners.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Bill makes no provision for that, otherwise I would relish the prospect of the Under-Secretary taking advantage of such an opportunity.

<P>
If there were problems with privatisation, that might have had something to do with the fact that the Government attempting it had a small majority and the Labour party was doing everything conceivable to undermine its viability. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that some of the difficulties inherited by the Under-Secretary are the result of the irresponsibility with which his party conducted opposition to that sale.

<P>
Despite the problems mentioned by the Under-Secretary, the industry has doubled its rate of investment, increased the number of passengers by 25 per cent. and is in the process of trebling rail freight. Indeed, one wonders whether the Under-Secretary's first vision on the Waverley line was his road to Damscus. His party now realises that there is no way back and that not a single railwayman has any appetite for going back to the bad old days of British Rail.

<P>
I reiterate our acceptance that, in principle, a body such as the SRA can play a useful and constructive role. The railway industry's new confidence, which the Under-Secretary mentioned, is a result of the policies that he has inherited. In the three years prior to privatisation, 1,043 new vehicles were ordered at a cost of £889 million. In the three years following privatisation, 2,500 new carriages were ordered, at a cost of £2.5 billion. That seems testament to the improved confidence to which the Minister now lays claim.

<P>
The aim of our amendment is to find out whether the new body is to be a creature of the Secretary of State that will enable him to revert to his old socialist ways and play trains. For all the ambitions of independence that the Minister has for the body, the Secretary of State will be able to hire and fire the members of the authority. They have no tenure under these provisions; they are subject to Government financial control and the Secretary of State's guidance. The accountability of the franchising director, who is an individual with clearly defined objectives, will be reduced. He is more accountable to the process of which he is meant to be in charge-the authority will make him subject to a politicised process.

<P>
The Under-Secretary says that he wants the SRA to be the guardian of the public interest. I may be old fashioned, but I thought that that was what Ministers were meant to do. Ministers have decided that they cannot do this job on their own. The privatised railway represents unfinished business, but so does the Bill. The original bill comprised 34 clauses; the new Bill comprises 47. When the Government was elected, I feared that ours would be the pain for having privatised the industry and theirs would be the political gain as they reaped the fruits of that privatisation and enjoyed the flow of new investment into the railway. The Minister's failure to understand the dynamics of this new and developing industry means that our vision for the railways is failing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Which of the principles of the establishment of the SRA does the hon. Gentleman support?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Our principle for the SRA would be as an enabler, a facilitator and a catalyst rather than as a player. Sir Alastair Morton described himself as a player. He intends to be an investor, not merely a promoter. Indeed, the Bill provides for him to be a revenue subsidiser, as well as someone who hands out capital grants. The concern must be not that the ownership of the assets of the industry will be taken back under state control, but that the instruments of control through regulation and financial control will be re-established, thereby choking off the spontaneity and the access to private capital that the industry currently enjoys. The shortcomings of the Bill are essentially that it is potentially extremely interfering, interventionist and therefore destructive. We support the idea of the Strategic Rail Authority, but we have many questions to ask and we shlal do so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have examined the main line, the branch line, the sidings and every goods yard relating not only to clause 176 but to most of this chapter of the Bill. I therefore propose to put the clause directly to the Committee.

<P>
Clause 176 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
