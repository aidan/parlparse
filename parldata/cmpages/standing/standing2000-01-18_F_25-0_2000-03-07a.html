<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I was just about to conclude by saying that if the motion is withdrawn we shall return to the new clause later.

Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Long term solvency of trust-based</center></H4>
stakeholder schemes 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Trust-based stakeholder schemes shall be regulated and monitored as to their long term solvency.'.—[Mrs. Lait.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause seeks to probe, and I am sure that the Minister will be able to reassure me on the issues that it raises, which were brought to my attention by the Investment and Life Assurance Group. The group was concerned about stakeholder schemes based on trustees, which might not be solvent for the first few years of their existence. Understandably, one imagines that the regulatory regime for insolvent pension schemes is draconian. The group was concerned that a regulatory regime should be established for trust-based stakeholder schemes and that it should be able to provide for the particular and unfortunate circumstances that I have described. Such circumstances might apply to a scheme for the first few years of its existence, until it becomes solvent and able to exist in its own right, without any comeback on the trustees. One of the biggest problems for stakeholder schemes will be finding trustees. If potential trustees think that they will be penalised because of the initial years of some schemes, it will be even more difficult to secure their participation.
<P>
I understand that regulatory regimes are already in place that allow such circumstances to be monitored and regulated with a lighter hand. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reassure me and the Investment and Life Assurance Group on its concerns and ensure that they are dealt with.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Lady. I am not sure what she means by the word ``solvent'' in respect of the pension funds about which she spoke. The new clause would introduce a requirement for trust-based stakeholder pension schemes to have their solvency regulated and monitored. Stakeholder schemes will, however, be money purchase arrangements under which the members' contributions and associated investment growth will build up a fund. Upon retirement, this fund will provide a pension, usually by the purchase of an annuity.
<P>
The liabilities of the scheme are, by definition, equal to the value of its assets. There will, therefore, be no minimum funding requirement for stakeholder schemes similar to that which is used to underwrite final salary occupational schemes. The issue of insolvency does not have much meaning in that context. We should, however, consider the question whether schemes can operate effectively within the maximum allowable charges. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Beckenham was getting at that matter rather than the minimum funding requirement, which does not exist for the schemes in question. I hope to reassure the hon. Lady by clarifying how trust-based schemes and their requirements will operate.
<P>
The trustees of a trust-based stakeholder scheme will be responsible for undertakings made by the scheme. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 sets out a number of requirements for the conduct of trust-based stakeholder schemes. Those broadly follow many of the requirements for occupational schemes, which are set out in the Pensions Act 1995. For example, trustees are responsible for selecting and monitoring an appropriate fund manager. They must prepare a statement of investment principles. Trustees and their fund manager must consider possible investments, the balance between them, and the risk and expected return. If a scheme undertakes to operate within a charge limit, it will be for the trustees to ensure that arrangements are in place for that to happen.
<P>
Trustees can be insured against some of the liabilities that they take on in that role. We will need to see whether the insurance market is able to offer insurance against an overrun in costs. It is too early to tell whether that will be the case, but the most practical way of dealing with potential difficulties will be through the contractual arrangements that trustees make with those organisations that provide services to the scheme.
<P>
As many respondents to last year's consultation on scheme governance identified, it will generally be the case that the provider of services agrees to deliver those services for a pre-determined share of the overall scheme charges. It is therefore the provider in those circumstances who is responsible for cost overruns, not the scheme or its trustees. Similarly, in some schemes, a sponsoring organisation, such as a trade union, might take on that liability to limit the individual liability of the trustees.
<P>
In the event of malpractice, such as theft or fraud from a scheme, section 81 of the Pensions Act 1995, as applied by schedule 1 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, provides stakeholder schemes with protection and allows trustees to apply to the pensions compensation board for compensation. Existing financial service compensation arrangements will also apply in the case of the insolvency of, say, an investment manager who is holding funds on behalf of the scheme.
<P>
The regulation of trust-based stakeholder schemes will fall to the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority. The Pensions Act 1995 gives OPRA wider-ranging functions and powers to ensure that trustbased stakeholder schemes operate within the law and are safe and well run, so that people can have confidence that their anticipated retirement income will be there when they need it.
<P>
We have always said that one of underlying characteristics of stakeholder schemes is that they will offer members security. By that, we mean that schemes will have a governance structure to give members confidence that they are secure and run in their best interests. The arrangements that we have put in place for trust-based stakeholder schemes will achieve that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that reassurance. Questions remain on whether the regulatory regimes will operate with a light hand if there are potential difficulties and with a view to the long-term future. Provided that the stakeholder pension trust base is regarded as being sound, it should be no more onerous for people who volunteer to be trustees to monitor and regulate it. On the basis of the Under-Secretary's response, which I might examine in more detail, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss new clause 20—Alternatives to annuities
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—The Secretary of State may, by regulations, approve alternative schemes of payment of pensions to those people currently committed to annuities purchased on retirement.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I hope that Committee members can concentrate with the repetitive din going on outside. Perhaps if we develop headaches, we can resort to some product from the pharmaceutical industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is investment in London.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sure that it is investment in London, but it is probably not new houses on brown-field sites.
<P>
For some time now, one of the underlying problems that has been a concern to pensioners and people who are approaching pension age is the poor deal that they are receiving from obligatory annuities. New clause 19 addresses that problem. New clause 20 addresses the issue of income drawdown, which is a related but separate issue, so I shall deal with it separately.
<P>
I should declare the fact that my husband is working under an income drawdown system, although I am glad to say that he is not 75 and having to take the obligatory annuity because he would be a very unhappy chap if he was. He would be unhappy because annuities are not good value at the moment. They are not good value first, because the national health service is managing to keep us all alive for much longer and, secondly, because there are not many long-dated gilts in the market. That means that people who have been prudent and who have been saving for some considerable time under the rules of anything other than an occupational pension scheme are having to purchase low value annuities, which are not meeting their expectations for their retirement.
<P>
To a certain extent, the Government have recognised that, because they published a consultation document, to which responses were required by 29 February. I appreciate that it is a little early for them to have received any serious response. Indeed, I recognise that should we be able to persuade the Government to agree to our sentiments in principle, new clause 19 would be seriously defective. In fact, I imagine that we would need a large and complex Act to replace annuities, but the new clause is intended to open up the debate about how people can better provide for themselves. [Interruption.] Ah! That is nice. Do you think they have stopped for tea? I am relieved that the pile driving has stopped temporarily. I hope they have a very long tea break.
<P>
Most pensioners who have been sufficiently prudent to save for themselves find that their pensions are not as good as they had hoped. The Government's consultation document is timid and does not begin to think through whether an annuity is the best way for people to provide for their retirement. Many people maintain that there is a real necessity to ensure that as few people as possible are a drain on the state, and annuities provide for that. Somebody might have a large pot of money when they retired and immediately blow it. After a year or two of spend, spend, spend, they would have got rid of the £100,000, £200,000 or £250,000 that they had saved, and would immediately fall back on to the state and provisions such as the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
There are ways around the situation. The retirement income working party suggested only last week that everyone should be obliged to take an annuity that would provide them with an income at least equivalent to the minimum income guarantee. That would be a compromise. People would be able to put their money in an occupational pension fund. Fund managers could invest it more sensibly in the stock market or property, for example, so that it yielded in higher returns. People who have been able to look after their pension pot have found the past two or three years to be profitable.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hoped that the new clause would widen the debate on annuities. Annuities suit people who want to know that they will have the certainty of a monthly income that they do not have to think about when they retire. They are prepared to accept that the returns are not good. Others are interested in investment and want to take steps to improve their position. The compromise might be to have a smaller annuity to provide the equivalent of the minimum income guarantee and to allow everybody either to manage their own pension pot, or to arrange for pension fund managers or investment trust managers to do it for them. The City is there to provide.
<P>
We had long debates during the last year's Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill Committee about the provision of annuities and about how bad a deal they were. I vividly remember saying that the City would be able to come up with instruments to replace them. Government Members were sceptical that the City could do that, but it has in the past year. New ideas are emerging to help people to manage their pension pots better than through investing in annuities. Over time, a wider range of instruments will become available.
<P>
I would like to encourage the Government to create the circumstances in which people are able to use more than old-fashioned annuities. Another idea is that there should be a link to a longer-term average rate of return on pension funds. Such rates are published and can be tracked over the past 50 years. With due weighting to ensure that the regulators were happy, an income stream might be based on them. I am sure that the great financial brains of the City could produce such an instrument.
<P>
I encourage the Government to think more widely than they did in their consultation document and to allow people to benefit from the money saved for their pension. Such savings are huge—equalled only by the wealth that might be invested in a house—and should be made inheritable. An annuity ends with the death of the owner. It would be a huge pot of money if one had a reasonable pension. It seems iniquitous that it cannot be put into the pot of inheritable wealth. Indeed, if such a thing were to happen, it could go some way to solving the costs of long-term care for those with that level of pension income.
<P>
I turn briefly to the 75-year rule and the income drawdown. We have said before that the labour market is changing. Demographic changes will probably mean that more people will work for longer. However, more people may retire earlier, having another, third life before reaching retirement age. Why does it have to be the age of 75 if people are living healthier and longer lives? What is it about 75 that makes the Government insist that, however well they have managed their pensions investments, people must buy an annuity then?
<P>
I see absolutely no need for an age limit. It should be possible for people to decide when they wish to buy an annuity. By abolishing the 75- year rule we may get rid of annuities for those who wish to go down the income drawdown route. Indeed, because of the poor return on annuities, I understand that last year a third of all pensioners opted for income drawdown at 75. A market exists, which shows that people resent the annuity. What is it about the age of 75 that requires am annuity to be purchased?
<P>
The simplest way to get rid of annuities is to get rid of the income drawdown, leaving it as an option, and opening up the pension market. That would give people flexibility and diversity, which would allow them to invest tax free as much as they could. We should not consider that to be a tax break for the rich. We should encourage people to make the most of their pension funds, and we should get rid of the income drawdown at the age of 75. It is with pleasure that I move the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I offer my apologies, Mr. O'Brien, for not being here at 4.30 pm.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is the second time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> As the hon. Lady says, it is the second time. I am happy to put that on record. I apologise also to the Minister of State, as he would have prepared notes to respond to the amendment. I regret not being here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is worse than that; I studied them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> He has studied them, for which I am grateful. My only reason for rising, Mr. O'Brien, was to apologise to you and to the Committee for not being here on time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's short speech. It is not easy for members of a minor party always to be here, and I do not criticise him.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) raised what seemed to be two issues, but what were one issue compartmentalised. I shall try to respond to both aspects, but I must enter a caveat. I am not trying to cop out of the argument, because we have joined-up government and collective responsibility, but the Committee will appreciate that many of the rules that govern annuities are made by the Inland Revenue. Those rules are made to defend public money, and changes in those rules are essentially a matter for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, so I cannot deviate from my prepared text.
<P>
An Annuity is a guaranteed sum of money. Recently, I received a deputation from a group that cannot accept pensions because of its religious beliefs. As it put it to me, an annuity is a gamble with God's gift: one's life.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): The brethren.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, the brethren. That is what an annuity amounts to—it is a gamble. Some people will live a long time and others a short time. The guarantee is made whether the annuity is flat rate or indexed. For people who live a very short time after they have taken out the annuity, the pot is lost because the annuity has been purchased, which makes the system fluid. The matter is complex and involves many millions of pounds and years of commitment. I do not wholly buy the argument that because annuity rates are low, the current circumstances are bad compared with those of the past. I shall give the Committee an example of what I mean in a moment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This is an interesting subject, on which I have never understood successive Governments' point of view. I asked the Minister a question about the 75-year rule about a month ago on the Floor of the House. He answered that he had to protect the public purse and said that he could not allow people to use the rule as a form of tax avoidance—I think that those were his words. I do not understand that argument. If somebody has saved money all of his life, why should the Government prevent him from doing what he wants at the age of 75?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The money has not come just from the individual. The pot will have been put together with tax relief. The hon. Member for Beckenham said that what is left should be passed down the family. That is not on. A good part of the pot will have come from the general public through tax relief. The money will come back to the Treasury through taxation of the pension—that is the way in which the system works. There is tax relief on the building of the pot and tax payments are made on a taxable pension. If somebody could chop up the pot and say ``I'll have a bit of income drawdown, and, subject to the vagaries of life, I want to leave the pot to the family,'' he would be passing on the Chancellor's tax money. [Interruption.] Hang on a minute. I cannot go into all the byways and highways of the matter immediately.
<P>
The Committee should consider what would happen if the 75-year limit was abolished—it could be changed, but let us imagine for a moment that it was abolished. One would have to take account of the fact that people's pots were not fully used up, as their income drawdown would last a long time. However, a pot would be left at the end of their lives. That is the objective of the exercise: to keep the money in the family. A regime would have to be in place to tax what was left of the pot so that the money would return to the Treasury. One would still leave money to the family that would not be available if the annuity had been purchased, which would be the advantage. I am not knocking the system. 
<P>
Last week, I spoke in the Moses Room when Dr. Oonagh Moulding launched her second report, which is extremely useful. The interest of the Department of Social Security—as opposed to the wider interest of the Government—is in people who do not save for a pension, do not put by during that period of their lives over which they have more control, use their money in such a way that pension income is not provided for, and fall back on the state—by which I mean the means test. Such behaviour defeats the object of the exercise. Our concern is that people who have made provision with such schemes are not able to use the pot in such a way that they end up back on the state. The Department of Social Security has no other interest. Clearly the Government have an interest, but my Department does not have an ideological hang-up. We are trying to ensure that, having provided for a pension, the individual does nothing that returns him to the means test. Although the solution in last week's report ``Choices: an independent report to encourage the debate on retirement income'' has not been fully worked out—the examples are of single people—it gives a broadbrush idea of possible changes. I have not read the technical material—it is a complex matter—but the report makes practical suggestions that look seductive. Indeed, they may provide a way of giving people a choice when they retire and have to decide what to do with their pension pot. That debate will continue.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Inland Revenue has reviewed its work as it relates to annuities. My Department is consulting on the technical issue of limited price indexation. We recognise that, with today's different financial instruments, it is necessary to ensure that the law is not so rigid that it blocks out flexibility and the use of other instruments to achieve the same end. I do not want to give hope that a big consultation exercise is under way to get rid of the present system. We are consulting on a narrow, technical matter. Nevertheless, we have received reports by the working party on retirement income and others—indeed, I received a couple recently. I do not have a solution to the brethren's argument, but it deserves a response. The issues are being considered, and I understand that the pressure is on because of the age and the apparent drop in income.
<P>
Our legislation relates mainly to the use of the protected rights element in pension savings, which replaces SERPS. If people are not contracted out, they are contracted in, it is compulsory. We want pensions with protected rights to be treated in a similar way. For example, pension benefits that are based on protected rights cannot be taken until the age of 60 and must provide spouse benefits. There is a wider debate on that issue and no doubt the House will return to it.
<P>
In return for tax privileges that are related to contributions, the Government have decided that it is right for the proceeds to provide a guaranteed stream of income in retirement. That is important. No other instrument will give that guarantee, which is the main feature of the annuity, but it requires the spending of the pot. There is some flexibility in annuity rules, subject to specific limits. The income can be drawn directly from the fund as an alternative to the annuity purchase, but that can continue only until the age of 75.
<P>
As people who receive representations on that, we have to ask ourselves what someone lives on between normal retirement age and 75. A person with substantial earnings could have a large drawdown—a big annuity and a big pot—possibly because he has continued working. It is not the case that someone stops working at 65 and survives for 10 years before taking the annuity. We are talking about people who have access to an income stream that can sustain them at an acceptable level until they are 75, not people who are at the lower end of the market. 
<P>
Stakeholder pensioners will not be into pension pots of £200,000 or £150,000. We are not talking about moderate earners. Let us be clear that we are talking about higher earners, probably the top 20 per cent. The advantage of income drawdown is that it allows an individual some choice when purchasing the annuity. It is unsuitable for people with modest funds because there is a danger that the fund will become depleted if the returns are insufficient to cover both the charges to the provider and the income being withdrawn. Of course, most people buy the annuity immediately on retirement. Some people, including the hon. Member for Beckenham, have argued that we should relax the requirement because annuity rates have fallen, but I shall give the Committee an example, based on many assumptions, which I shall give afterwards.
<P>
In 1990, a person on average earnings might have retired with a pension pot of £31,000, which would have bought that person an income of £92 a week, equivalent today to £119 a week. By 1998, although annuity rates had fallen from 15 per cent. to 9.5 per cent., someone with the same earnings and contributions pattern might have accumulated a fund of £97,000, enough to provide an income of about £175 a week. Such a person could expect the real value of that pension to be maintained because inflation has fallen to about 2 per cent.
<P>
Although annuity rates have fallen, it is necessary to compare the situations of people who retired on average earnings on each of those dates to see how much each one would have received. The figures that I quoted are based on the following assumptions: that each individual contributes to a personal pension for 31 years; each year, every individual contributes 10 per cent. of earnings; for the first 21 years of contributions, the fund is invested in equity; over the last 10 years of contributions the fund is switched into gilts at a rate of 10 per cent. of the fund for each year; equity growth is in line with the FTSE 30 index; the return on investment in gilts is in line with the Barclays capital total return index for gilts; and the annual charge is 1 per cent. of the fund. That example shows that, during periods of long-term low inflation, the fall in annuity rates is not necessarily a bad thing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that one of the problems is the fact that the Government are not issuing many long-term gilts, which affects annuity rates? The figures that he quoted for 1998 would be affected by the fact that, at that time, the Government were issuing more long-term gilts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes. I am conscious of that. I quoted the figures for 1998, but I have a feeling that the current figure is probably less than 9.5 per cent.
<P>
We are considering the issue and we do not have a closed mind on it. However, as last week's report showed, it is not as simple as removing the requirement to buy the annuity at 75. There is much more work to be done. I am certainly prepared to join in the debate, as I have made clear since I became a Minister at the Department of Social Security. We do not want to shy away from the issue—far from it, but I cannot offer any hope of change because most of the issues are governed by Inland Revenue rules. No doubt, we shall return to the issue on Report or in the other place, when I shall try to be as open and constructive as I have been today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I was pleased by what the Minister said. Ministers always get twitchy in the pre-Budget period, but I am glad that they have opened up a little recently and have not been in such a purdah-like silence as they used to be. The Minister has been as open with us as he could have been. The subject is interesting, and I hope that the Government will continue to think creatively about it.
<P>
I understand the Minister's brief point. The Treasury believes that it has a lien on an asset that somebody has built up using tax relief. We used to use tax relief to purchase our homes, feeling that we would be fully entitled to leave them to our children when we died. The Treasury did not insist on our having to give up our home or on having complicated rules for us once we had reached the age of 75. I am not sure that the Treasury has a strong case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): Is it not true that the Treasury need not provide income support if a person has a private pension?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes. The Minister was fair on the subject. It is refreshing when Ministers say, as the right hon. Gentleman did, that they cannot speak for the Government, but can explain their Department's attitude. He said that the Department did not have a view on the matter, although it did not want people blowing their pot of gold and turning to the Government so that they might live on income support. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham responded to that point. She said that rules could easily be devised under which, for example, an annuity had to be taken out at the age of 75 to ensure that one would not require state support because one had fallen below a certain income.
<P>
Creative ideas are floating around, and the Government could earn credit and popularity by picking them up. We are entering an age in which people should not be required to move in a set direction; people want more flexibility in the way in which they manage their affairs.
<P>
As the Minister said, we are considering reasonably well-off people; we should not be unconcerned about them just because they have had a good job. They still have a right to independence and justice. What business is it of ours if they do not want to take out an annuity, preferring to draw down income, if they wish to leave their pot of money to their children, or if they want to blow the lot on a world cruise? The state should be interested only in their not falling back on state support and in taking back the money that it has contributed through tax relief. The state takes back a lot from such people through inheritance tax—they typically pay 33 per cent. However, if that was not enough, I would be happy for the Treasury to argue for further tax relief to ensure that the money that it put into the scheme was recovered.
<P>
I was happy with what the Minister said. The Government are obviously trying to move towards openness. I commend what they are doing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I, too, would like to thank the Minister for the spirit in which he has entered the debate. There is general agreement that we do not want people to fall unnecessarily on to the state. We might have a parting of the ways regarding matters such as tax regimes. We are approaching the Budget, and the Minister made his Department's responsibilities clear. The bulk of responsibilities are obviously with Treasury. As he said, we might return to the matter on Report or in another place, depending on whether the Treasury is as enlightened as the Minister of State. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
(5) Where the appeal tribunal or Commissioner acts in accordance with sub-paragraph (4)(b), following the determination of appeal B the relevant authority whose decision gave rise to appeal A shall, if appropriate, make a decision (under paragraph 4) superseding the decision of the tribunal or Commissioner in accordance with that determination.

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 28, line 26, leave out `may' and insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 172, in page 28, line 26, after `determine', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`with reference to (2A) and (2B) below:
<P>
(2A) An earlier date shall be no earlier than six months before the end of the last period taken into account in a review under this section.
<P>
(2B) A later date shall be no later than six months after the end of the last period taken into account in a review under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am feeling a slight touch of déjà vu in returning to clause 30. We have not yet debated the clause, but it is relevant to the state second pension, a subject that we debated this morning and that we spent a long time discussing a couple of weeks ago.
<P>
The amendments focus on mechanisms for reviewing the lower earnings threshold. We believe that it is important to get those right, given their importance to the state second pension. The threshold is the basis on which entitlements are calculated. We want to explore the subject with the Government, both to ensure that it is dealt with fairly and consistently to the benefit of future pensioners, and for reasons of public finance. I sometimes think that the Minister of State believes that we do not care about public finances, but he may be assured that sound public finance has long been a major concern of the Conservative party.
<P>
The amendments relate to proposed section 148A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. That provision empowers the Secretary of State to uprate the lower earnings threshold in line with average earnings. Under section 148A (2)(b)(ii), that will be based on earnings increases during a review period, which, once the pension is up and running, will be once every tax year. The review period is to be either the time since the end of the previous review period or since
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other date (whether earlier or later) as the Secretary of State may determine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We object to the latter because it gives the Secretary of State such wide discretion. We propose to limit the provision by replacing ``may'' with ``shall''. We then want to limit the Secretary of State's discretion by stating that the review period must start within six months either side of the previous review period. That is quite a long time, even in governmental terms—and even in terms of ``shortly'', a word that is becoming increasingly familiar.
<P>
 With this probing amendment, we are trying to draw the Minister of State on the matter of discretion. The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to set the review date at will.
<P>
Far be it from us to suggest such a thing, but that could be manipulated for reasons other than clear finance. Uprating should be a neutral process, designed to keep movements in the low earnings threshold in line with average earnings. The suspicion, which is increasingly reflected in opinion polls, is that the public do not trust politicians. We want to ensure that the Secretary of State does not have a wide discretion to decide when to set the review dates for the low earnings threshold.
<P>
Mr. Rooker: I hope that I can satisfy the hon. Lady. I take on board her point about opinion polls. In an alert democracy, the public should be suspicious and questioning of politicians.
<P>
To recap, we are introducing the low earnings threshold to help those who benefit least from SERPS. In general, low earners will receive twice as much as anyone gets from SERPS. However, we need to ensure that the £9,500 trigger keeps pace with increases in national average earnings, which is the purpose of the clause. Section 148 of the 1992 Act ensures that earnings factors on which the additional SERPS pension is calculated are increased in line with national average earnings until state pension age. New section 148A makes a similar provision for the low earnings threshold.
<P>
We intend to use the same method for uprating the low earnings threshold as we use for uprating earnings factors, which is based on the monthly average earnings index for all employees that is compiled by the Office for National Statistics. We have introduced some flexibility into the setting of the review period because there could be difficulties if information was not available when needed. For example, the average earnings index was suspended for several months in 1998. If that happened again and we were tied to a precise review period, we might not be able to publish the revised figure for the low earnings threshold before the beginning of the new tax to which it applied. As that would hamper people's opportunities to make reasonable choices about pension provision, we have included the power to vary the review period.
<P>
We envisage using the power only when the figures for the normal review period are not available. The review period would continue to cover the full 12 months and take place from the nearest period for which figures are available, before or after the usual date. We cannot foresee circumstances in which the period would alter by as much as six months.
<P>
I hope that that explanation of how we will use the power in clause 30 is acceptable to Opposition Members. However, I am happy to respond to further questions. We wanted to be specific about why the review period might vary. That would happen only when the normal run of the figures were not available, perhaps because of a gap in the figures or a computer glitch. The figures are produced independently by the Office for National Statistics. They are not manipulated by Ministers. We cannot pick and choose the figures for upratings.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> On the basis of those assurances—let us hope that we do not have computer glitches at the Office for National Statistics—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 28, line 28, after `increased', insert `or decreased'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 174, in page 28, line 39, after `increased', insert `or decreased'.
<P>
No. 175, in page 29, line 5, after first `increase', insert `or decrease'.
<P>
No. 176, in page 29, line 5, after second `increase', insert `or decrease'.
<P>
No. 177, in page 29, line 6, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) Where no increase or decrease is ordered by virtue of subsection (6), this shall be taken into account in subsequent reviews.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Discussion of deflation is unusual in Parliament, perhaps because it is between 60 and 70 years since it last occurred in Britain. However, politicians and economists should spend more time considering the subject. We have low inflation, which is admirable, but it is not far from potential deflation, which could occur if something goes horribly wrong. One could argue that properly managed periods of deflation can be as helpful as periods of low inflation, but I shall not go into the economics in too much detail.
<P>
The amendments seek to initiate such discussion. There is an assumption that the lower earnings threshold will be uprated every year. I use the word ``uprated'' advisedly; commercial rents with upward-only revisions caused grief and distress during the recent big downturn in the property market. If the economy moved into a period of deflation—I should describe that proposition with the word ``inconsiderable'', meaning unconsidered and not thought about—public finances and the state second pension could be affected because legislation had not taken deflation into account.
<P>
The amendments seek to allow for the possibility of decreases in the lower earnings threshold. It may be difficult to comprehend why we should ever think about deflation, but no thought was given in the early 1920s, after the great war, to the deflation that hit the country in the 1930s. Many of us have been brought up reading not only social histories but novels that deal with the effects of deflation on communities at that distressing time. Inevitably, in a period of deflation, benefits, allowances and wages must decrease in line with falling prices. People assume that prices and wages rise, and they can be forgiven for doing so after 70 years of it. Coping psychologically with price and wage decreases would make deflation difficult and painful. That is why we thought it incumbent upon us to explore how the Government would react to an economic shock that caused deflation. Practically every hon. Member present lived through the shock caused by the 1970s oil price rise. Indeed, we have also lived through Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism.
<P>
Deflation has consequences and is difficult to live with and to predict. It is not inconceivable that another economic shock could turn into a period of deflation. If the whole of Government expenditure is based on upward-only increases and legislation cannot bear the pressure of decreases, the public finances will quickly get into a complete mess. That is the thinking behind the amendments. Will the Minister tell us how the state second pension encompasses provision for possible—I say no more than that—deflationary circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to contemplate it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> But it may happen.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> On a misty Tuesday afternoon in early March 2000 I do not want to contemplate wages, prices and pensions going down. We are not planning for deflation. We have had enough trouble explaining to people the benefit of low inflation, with respect to this year's retail price index increase to benefits. I do not really want to become involved in debate about consequences. The hon. Lady talked for most of her speech about earnings. Only towards the end did she mention the possibility of lower prices, benefits and pensions. The Government have no plans for that. I must put that on the record to avoid misunderstanding.
<P>
We are introducing the low earnings threshold specifically to help people on low earnings who get little from SERPS. Under the current system of earnings valuation, since SERPS was introduced in 1978, there has not been a single year when the earnings factors have not needed to be increased. There have been periods of high inflation since that time, with peaks of 27 per cent. under the Labour Government and 21 per cent. under the Government of Baroness Thatcher. However, for the amendments to have any effect, average earnings would need to fall not just in real terms—that is, to increase by less than prices—but in absolute terms. I am not sure whether that has been fully appreciated.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 173 to 176 cater for mainly theoretical circumstances. It seems unlikely that they would ever have a practical effect. Even if there were a one-off year in which earnings fell, it would not follow that we would want to reduce the low earnings threshold. The threshold is uprated to ensure that, as earnings increase, its value is maintained broadly in line with them. That is to ensure that we continue to offer help, through the state second pension, to the target group—those at the lower end of earnings distribution. I very much doubt that we should want to allow for a one-off freak occurrence in a way that would mean deviating from our policy objective of targeting that low-income group.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Perhaps I may draw on my hon. Friend's experience. Has he ever come across circumstances in which such a clause has been included in a Bill, perhaps by the previous Government? I am intrigued by the notion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, I have not.
<P>
The proposed new section 148A(6) that the clause would insert in the Social Security Administration Act 1992 would allow the Secretary of State to leave the low earnings threshold unchanged when the increase in average earnings appeared to be inconsiderable. Amendment No. 177 would require the subsequent review to take that into account. However, in no year since 1978 has the increase in average earnings been so small that the provision would apply. Subsection (6) would apply only when the increase in average earnings was so small as to be negligible. In any event, the low earnings threshold is rounded to the nearest £100, so the amendment would have no practical effect.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham referred to the issue of sustained deflation. I realise that I have skirted round that, and I intend to continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Collapse of the economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> My hon. Friend speaks of the collapse of the economy—something it is almost dangerous for us to include in debate. Thank heaven that we are not being broadcast. On the other hand, no one has been interested enough to broadcast any of our proceedings, so it is hardly likely that it would happen today.
<P>
A sustained period of deflation would involve much more perverse effects for the economy than those that might concern the earnings threshold. There is no provision on the statute book—and some of the legislation on the statute book is very old—for any social security benefit to be decreased. That partly answers the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford). It has never been contemplated, and putting it on the statute book for the state second pension would send out the wrong signals. I hope that on reflection the hon. Lady will withdraw her amendment and not bring it back on Report.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My impression from the Minister's comments is that he believes that he is still living, or rather that he would like to live, in a command economy—perhaps in the 1970s. He believes that the Government can plan for the health of the economy, which is insulated from the outside world. Governments do not plan for deflation, but it can happen and has happened in living memory.
<P>
His reaction has been most revealing. I accept no provision comparable to the amendments is on the statute book. However, it might be interesting to study legislation of the late 1920s, to find out whether anything of the kind was repealed. It is rash for any Government not to contemplate the possibility of deflation. Although I do not contemplate it in the immediate future, because I cannot imagine how we would enter a deflationary situation, it is incumbent on Ministers to bear in mind the possibility, particularly when inflation is so low. The stock market is expanding and if something went wrong, it could go horribly wrong.
<P>
I accept that there is not much point in putting the provisions in the Bill. I got what I expected from the Minister and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Amendment made: No. 350, in page 28, line 31, leave out `of sections 44A and 45ZA'.—[Mr. Rooker.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 179, in page 29, line 14, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) The Secretary of State shall make Regulations setting out the manner in which the general level of earnings shall be estimated.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall be brief because I expect that the Minister will give a very similar response to the one that we received on amendments Nos. 171 and 172. However, our intention was once again to tease out how the Secretary of State would approach reviews of the lower earnings threshold. I suspect that it would be on the basis of Office for National Statistics figures, but should be grateful for confirmation, or to learn how much discretion the Secretary of State would have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady is right. I shall see whether I can avoid repeating what I said about amendments Nos. 171 and 172. It is fair to ask us to put on the record how we intend to operate the level of the low earnings threshold. A similar power in section 148 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 relates to the revaluation of earnings factors for SERPS. We propose to use the same method, based on information supplied by the Office for National Statistics.
<P>
The Bill gives the first review period as 1 October 1998 to 30 September in the year before the introduction of the state second pension. The Government have had to use the current figures—£9,500 and £21,600—during the Committee's proceedings, but they will be changed before implementation. We intend to compare average earnings over intervening whole-year periods from 1 October 1998. That will continue to happen even if we have to change the months we are comparing from one year to the next. That would occur, for example, if the September index was not available.
<P>
It would not be right to require the precise method to be set out in regulations, which would mean that we could not adapt as quickly as we would like to a change of circumstances such as the complete suspension or revision of the index. We must be able to publish the lower earnings threshold in good time for the coming tax year. That approach is consistent with existing uprating provisions, which apply not only to SERPS but to social security benefits in general. I hope that that explanation satisfies the hon. Member for Beckenham.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 236, in page 29, line 14, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(g) The Secretary of State shall be required to make Regulations to enable the Government Actuary to be included in any investigations the Secretary of State shall be required to make relating to the impact of restoring the full tax-free status of pension funds and the impact, if any, this may have on the minimum income guarantee.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have spent a large part of our discussions considering the impact of stakeholder pensions and the state second pension, and their interaction with the minimum income guarantee. The amendment urges the Government to consider restoring the tax-free status pension fund. We are anxious about the effects of its abolition and about people who do not expect to be paid low pensions but who might suddenly discover that the withdrawal of advance corporation tax means that they will receive a much lower pension than they had planned for and will fall under the minimum income guarantee. The impact of restoring tax-free pension funds should be investigated, as its restoration would avoid the need for more people to fall back into the minimum income guarantee. The Government Actuary should be included in such investigation as he is in the pivotal position of being able to provide necessary statistics.
<P>
We are increasingly aware of the impact of the withdrawal of ACT on pension funds. Its effect on local authority pension funds was mentioned recently during social security questions in the House. The Greater Manchester fund is down £30 million, the Cornwall fund is down £33 million and that of Staffordshire is down £75 million. I understand that the Dundee fund is down by £30 million and that that of Highland region is down by £34 million. Those are substantial sums for replacement, and their loss will affect pensioners' incomes. The Opposition do not approve of the withdrawal of ACT, and we believe that it would be sensible for the Government to investigate its impact because of its potential effect on state benefits.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I was a bit surprised to see the amendment, which does not appear to bear much relation to the clause, although I know that it deals with a policy about which Opposition Members feel strongly.
<P>
The tax-free status of pension funds was not affected by the abolition of payable tax credits on dividends. We debated similar points during discussion of national contributions on benefits in kind. Pension funds continue to enjoy privileges. Contributions paid to approved pension funds remain tax exempt, as do investment income and gains. The difference is that pension funds no longer receive a payable tax credit. The performance of pension schemes depends crucially on investment performance and economic growth, which are best supported by creating a stable environment.
<P>
I remind the Committee that the Government withdrew the tax credits as part of a much wider package of reforms to help companies and to benefit the economy. It included a reduction in corporation tax from 33 per cent. to 30 per cent., to which the hon. Lady has not objected, and the abolition of advance corporation tax.
<P>
The package was in everyone's interests, including those of pension funds, which look after the welfare of today's and tomorrow's pensioners. Withdrawal of the tax credits removed a distortion in the system that encouraged companies to pay out their profits as dividends, rather than retaining them for reinvestment. The changes bring benefits to the whole economy. The amendment would isolate one part of the package, ignoring the benefits of the more favourable climate for long-term investment and the resultant improvement in investment performance from which pension funds and pensioners benefit in the long run.

<P>
The previous Government saw the point of the move and cut pension fund tax credits from 25 to 20 per cent. in 1993. The changes announced in the 1997 Budget encouraged long-term investment and allowed us to have the largest cut in corporation tax ever. Pensioners end up on income-related benefits mainly because they do not have the opportunity to save—because of low earnings, caring or disability—and to build up a decent income for their retirement. Our strategy on pensions will address that problem by introducing stakeholder pensions and improvements to SERPs through the state second pension. The Government will ensure that such people have an opportunity for the first time to provide for their retirement. I hope that the hon. Lady will seek to withdraw her amendment following that explanation.

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> We could debate until the crack of doom the effects of the withdrawal of ACT on pension funds. Pensioners and people approaching pension age will be badly affected by that change and they are beginning to express their dismay about the matter to Opposition Members such as me. However, as we are unlikely to persuade the Government that they should investigate the interaction with the minimum income guarantee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. We shall think hard about what to do next.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 180.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): Not moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I take exception to the late withdrawal of the amendment. I was relishing hearing an Opposition Member read it out. I was going to invite someone to do that, and am upset that it is not being moved.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order. Amendment No. 180 has not been moved and so we shall proceed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 298, in page 29, line 36, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) In section 190(1)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, after ``146'', insert ``l48A,''.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 181, in clause 31, page 30, line 13, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
No. 293, in page 30, line 13, after `control)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in subsection (1) below ``section 28(3);'', insert ``section 45ZA(6);'' and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The amendments would strengthen parliamentary supervision of the state second pension. Amendment No. 298 would require orders concerning revaluation of the lower earnings threshold to be subject to affirmative resolutions. The National Association of Pension Funds argues that that has been the practice for similar decisions. The upper and lower earnings limits are subject to affirmative resolutions; why not this one?
<P>
The point of substance for which we propose using the affirmative resolution procedure is the change to revaluation of earnings surpluses made with respect to SERPS under the Pensions Act 1995, which will be continued under clause 30(4). Amendment No. 293 to clause 31 would also require regulations to be made under the affirmative resolution procedure. At the moment, the clause provides that orders appointing the first or second ``appointed'' years—that is the start of stages 1 and 2—will not be subject to parliamentary control. Given the importance of stage 2, we hope that the Minister of State will confirm that it will be done by affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
This, dare I say it, is a familiar debate. We would prefer the affirmative rather than the negative procedure to be used for making regulations. As the Minister acknowledged in previous debates, the move to stage 2 is fundamental. The affirmative procedure would allow the House to debate how that change would affect the success of stakeholders and the rebates for S2P. The reason for the amendments is that we want to ensure that the representatives of those affected by the changes can debate them thoroughly—as and when the Government decide to implement them.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Amendment No. 298 deals with the annual revaluation of the low earnings threshold. Its value for the year 1999–2000 is £9,500. We shall increase that sum in line with average earnings so that it retains its value against current earnings.
<P>
We shall make an order in the year before state second pension is introduced that will take account of increases in average earnings. It will take account of earnings between 1 October 1998 and 30 September in the year before introduction. In practice, that will mean comparing the September indices for the relevant years. That will ensure that only full years are taken into account and that enough time will remain for the order to take effect on its introduction the following year. Thereafter, orders will be made every year to take account of increase in average earnings.
<P>
Amendment No. 298 would make those orders subject to affirmative resolution. Our intentions with regard to revaluing the low earnings threshold are set out clearly in the Bill; the threshold will go up in line with average earnings. It is not therefore necessary or desirable to subject the annual orders to further parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
Amendment No. 181 would subject the order that sets the date of implementation of the second state pension to affirmative resolution procedure. The order-making procedure envisaged in clause 31 is similar to the commencement order provisions that provide the starting date for most measures introduced by Acts of Parliament, and they are not usually subject to negative or affirmative procedures. Commencement order provisions merely confirm the start date of something that has already been exposed to full debate in both Houses of Parliament, without making changes or adding new measures. That is exactly what will happen under the order-making procedures in clause 31. I suggest that it is unnecessary for hon. Members to seek further parliamentary control.
<P>
I hope that the Opposition do not intend, through the amendment, to delay the start of the second state pension. We want to encourage those who can make provision for their retirement to do so, which is why we have introduced stakeholder pension schemes, which will start in 2001. However, it will take some time for those schemes to establish themselves and for people to move out of the state scheme and into such funded pensions.
<P>
It is not right that we should have to wait for that to happen before we start to help those for whom a funded scheme is not an option. We are reforming SERPS by introducing the state second pension. We want to help low earners, carers and long-term disabled people with broken work records, which is why we want to introduce it as soon as possible. The introduction of the second state pension is at the heart of our pension reforms. By providing more help in retirement to those who need it most, we will reduce the number of pensioners who are dependent on the minimum income guarantee. The second effect of amendment No. 181 would be to subject the setting of the start date for stage 2 of the state second pension to parliamentary procedures. When stakeholder pension schemes have become established as low-cost flexible funded schemes, we shall encourage moderate and higher earners to contract out of the state scheme and build up their own funded pension provision, for which they will receive an earnings-related national insurance rebate, which will be paid into their pension fund. We have discussed all those issues today.
<P>
We have clearly stated that we shall not introduce stage 2 of the state second pension until we are sure that the time is right. I recognise that Opposition Members will want to see the information on which that decision is based to satisfy themselves that it is sensible to move to the second stage. We have already given an undertaking that we will supply the House with the necessary information when the time comes.
<P>
Amendment No. 256 would remove from the Bill the reference to April 2002, the earliest date from which state second pension will be implemented. I hope that, given that explanation, the hon. Member for Beckenham will agree that there has been sufficient parliamentary scrutiny of the earlier aspects of the Bill. We undertake to provide the appropriate information so that a sensible debate can be held about the move to stage 2 of the second state pension when that time comes.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am reassured by the Under-Secretary's remarks about the amendments, although I want to consider a little more closely what she said about the introduction of the state second pension. She was careful to say that the Government would provide enough information, but I should like to ensure that we will be able to use that information in a debate. However, in the hope that we shall return to the issue at a later stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to ask a quick question because we debated home responsibilities protection at some length in Committee, especially on 8 February. During that sitting, the Minister said in reply to a question that I asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Off the top of my head, I believe that it will apply to both—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
home responsibilities protection. He went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In fact, I am advised that this important change will apply to both pensions. People may turn up at the Department with claims dating back to 1978, although relevant evidence may not still exist. We must not leave the matter until a person retires, and we must make the system much more up to date.—[Official Report Standing Committee F, 8 February 2000; c.398.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That did not ring any bells until I looked back at Hansard, because a little later in Committee, the Under-Secretary said the exact opposite. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For basic pension purposes, people will still be able to provide information that relates to periods between 1978 and the introduction of state second pension until they reach retirement age. There will be a split in the benefits that HFP will confer.—[Official Report, Standing Committee F, 8 February 2000; c.424.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My reason for rising to clarify which is right. Will there be two different HRPs or one? In other words, when will the cut-off point be? Will it be after three years for both, or just before retirement age for the basic state pension and after three years for the state second pension? We need to be clear about that when we debate the Bill on Report.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Without notice and the copy of Hansard, it is difficult to respond. The basic state pension and the state second pension are operated by two different systems. Perhaps we were talking about two different pensions. There will be one system—more on that soon. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman unless, of course, I get more information before I sit down. [Interruption. ] It seems that people can continue to draw basic retirement pension back to 1978 until the state second pension is introduced, after which, the three-year limit applies. I was right and wrong. Two pensions are involved, but when the new system comes into effect, it will not be possible to return to the old system. There will be one system. The three-year limit will apply when the state second pension is introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That has removed one or two of the veils that mist my reading of Hansard. I would appreciate it if the Minister could amplify that point in a letter before Report. I meant to give him a copy of Hansard but, as we reached this stage earlier than I anticipated, I decided not to let the chance to raise the matter pass by.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I would be happy to revisit the matter raised by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow). It is not unimportant and I do not want there to be any misunderstanding.
<P>
We have reached the end of the Committee stage. On behalf of the Committee, I thank you, Mr. O'Brien, for your chairmanship. I hope that you will pass on our gratitude to your innumerable colleagues—I think we saw five out of six, including Mrs. Michie and Mrs. Adams—who were on stand by. We understand the situation and are extremely grateful. We tried to make the Committee as exciting as possible for the Chairmen. I also thank the Clerks for their invaluable work in assisting the smooth running of the Committee, and Hansard.
<P>
I thank all Committee members. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were constructive and my hon. Friends—in particular my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who carried a large burden—were supportive. I want to express my gratitude to my officials because a Bill requires substantial back-up. It is possible to feel isolated standing here alone, but the support was excellent.
<P>
I also want it on the record, simply because of the earlier hiatus in the Bill, that we appreciate the work of the parliamentary counsel for doing what we requested. We tried to put the totality of the pension plan before the Committee rather than split it between the debates in Committee and on Report, and I realise that that created extra burdens. It is important to mention the work of the House authorities, especially the Public Bill Office which serves the House and not the Government.
<P>
I do not want to make a big deal of this, but we have created a 40-year precedent. It is a minor, uncontroversial matter—entirely without substance—but apparently it is the first time in 40 years that Ministers have operated as a team in a Standing Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> All I can say is thank goodness I was here to witness it.
<P>
I should like to be associated with all of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks about our Chairmen, Clerks and Hansard writers. Our proceedings have been constructive and we have explored many difficult issues. The right hon. Gentleman referred to your innumerable colleagues, Mr. O'Brien. According to the rules of the House, those colleagues are not necessarily in place to form a dining club or an all-party grouping. Most of them came and listened to our views on accrual rates. I am reminded of a film about the evacuation of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war, starring Dame Judy Dench, who played a bank official. It was the custom of Europeans to leave their cardigans on their chairs or other personal items on their desks to look as if they were returning. I often regard the names of the other chairmen as I do Dame Judy Dench's cardigan. We are grateful for the great skill with which you, Mr. O'Brien, and Sir David kept our proceedings in order.
<P>
We all had our favourite point in the proceedings. I am great fan of P. G. Wodehouse, and, thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), we had what could be described as a P. G. Wodehouse moment. During discussion of accrual rates, my hon. Friend told the Committee that as a teacher he could get a labrador through pure economics and that it did not even have to be especially bright. From that point onwards, I felt that Bertram Wilberforce Wooster would always have driven through the New Forest rather quickly in case he met a labrador that wanted to engage him in such conversation, even if he felt up to it.
<P>
In addition, I thank all my hon. Friends and especially my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham for their constructive contributions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have a border collie cross that is already enrolling for the free course offered by the hon. Member for New Forest, West. I associate myself with all the comments made. The Committee has been interesting and our proceedings were a useful learning experience in respect of the pensions system. It is an important part of serving on a Committee that one picks things up by being present in the Room and listening to other hon. Members.
<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George), who is not present—he will not thank me for putting that on record. He took the lead for the Liberal Democrats on child support and I was especially grateful for his work on that aspect of the Bill. I thank all the Chairmen and look forward to considering the Bill on Report.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall pass on to my co-Chairmen the best wishes of the Minister and of other hon. Members. I thank my Clerk, the Hansard writers and members of the Committee tor their cooperation. As a Chairman, I am often reminded of a story about three Europeans who are condemned to death in a prison in Asia. The night before they are to be executed, the warder says,,``l'll grant you a wish each.'' The Frenchman says, ``l would like to have a nice French meal with all the trimmings.'' The German says, ``I would like to address all the people in the prison, including staff and inmates, on the work of the German nation—it will take about 90 minutes.'' When the Englishman is asked what he would like, he replies, ``l would like to be executed before he speaks.'' As a Chairman, I would sometimes like to be executed before an hon. Member speaks, but not in this Committee. We have had a pleasant time debating the Bill, and I thank everyone for their splendid contributions, which will be reflected in the legislation.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
