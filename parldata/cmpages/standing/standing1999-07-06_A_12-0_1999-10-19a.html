</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I conclude by saying that the amendment covers territory relating to schedule 3. It deals with matters raised by the industry and would make passport provisions in schedules 3 and 4 cater for reciprocity.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> First of all, let me convey the apologies of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, who is unable to attend the Committee this afternoon as she is in the Chamber. I also wish to take this opportunity to express thanks for the kind remarks made by Opposition Members at the outset of our deliberations. On the occasion of my speaking debut in this Committee, I am pleased to be under your guidance and supervision, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
Before lunch, I listened with great interest to the speech made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight). It may be helpful if I respond to his remarks on amendment No. 194.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has corresponded with the hon. Gentleman on the matter raised by him and our officials have been helpful in providing an insight into his thinking on the provisions. Having examined how schedule 5 fits into the Bill, we have tabled a number of related Government amendments. At the moment, persons authorised under schedule 5 are covered by clause 28(1)(d), although that provision does not refer to them directly. Subsection (l)(d) also covers Lloyd's.
<P>
We want to examine with parliamentary counsel the matter raised by the hon. Gentleman, with a view to considering whether clarification of the Bill's wording is necessary. As a result, we may propose an amendment on Report which has the same effect as that tabled by the hon. Gentleman. Of course, I should have liked to accept his amendment, but changes to the drafting of other parts of the Bill mean that we will probably have to adopt a slightly different wording to that which he proposes.
<P>
None the less, we accept the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's amendment and shall give our favoured form of words on Report to achieve the desired result. On that basis, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are heartened that the Government understand the matter that we have raised and, on the basis that they will address it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>EEA PASSPORT rights</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 196, line 28, at end insert `; and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) any similar financial services directive (including, without limitation, the UCITS Directive) prescribed by the Treasury.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 173, in page 200, line 16, at end insert--
<H4><center>`Consequential amendments</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>17A. If the Treasury prescribe other directives for the purposes of paragraph 1, it may make such consequential amendments to this Schedule in relation to the EEA rights granted by any such directive as, in their opinion, are necessary or desirable.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Schedule 3 raises a subject on which we have received legal advice and extremely constructive correspondence with the Treasury and other Departments. The Government are likely to deal with a number of matters that we wish to address. I shall therefore deal with the various issues raised by our amendments as painlessly as possible.
<P>
Amendment No. 168 is designed to make life a little easier for the Treasury, and I am thinking particularly of the Conservatives' return to power in the near future. It would grant sufficient flexibility to allow for UCITS directive mark 2 in the EU and to minimise the extent to which amendments to be made in the light of EU changes that are relevant to our law must go through the procedures required by the European Communities Act 1972. As everyone knows, the Commission is expected to bring out a UCITS directive mark 2 in the near future, although it has been slow in producing it. The new directive will give passport rights to the manager of an authorised UCITS fund rather than to the fund itself.
<P>
Amendment No. 173 makes provision for consequential amendments. If I may request your guidance, Mr. Atkinson, would it be helpful if I dealt with all the amendments together or on a line-by-line basis?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman spoke to the amendments as they are grouped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that we need to be able to respond to further single market directives. He is also right to draw attention to the UCITS directive, which is being negotiated this very day by officials in Brussels on our behalf. Of course, we have sufficient powers under the European Communities Act 1972 to deal with the consequences of that or any future directive. We do not, therefore, need an additional order-making power in the Bill to add to the list of directives in paragraph 1. Nor do we need an additional power to make consequential amendments to the schedule. In any case, we cannot be sure that a future directive will necessarily follow the pattern of the previous one. It might not, therefore, be desirable to implement it through the schedule; we might need to adopt a different approach to implementing future directives, depending on the form that they take. In any case, we do not need the power in the amendment because the European Communities Act gives us the power that we need in regard to the UCITS directive and to any other directive that is implemented. On the basis of that reassurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Which part of the European Communities Act gives that power? Or is it article 49 of the treaty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not know which article it is, but it is a feature of the Act that a nominated Minister is given powers to make whatever changes a directive requires in United Kingdom law; otherwise directives could not take effect. [Interruption.] I understand that that power is contained in section 2(2) of the Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is not a fundamental issue of law. Our point was that the approvals procedure that the European Communities Act requires is quite torturous. The amendment would have dealt with the issue of adapting things where appropriate in a simpler fashion. The Government are not interested in the issue and it is not sufficiently material to put to a vote, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 198, line 19, at end insert `applicable to it'.
<P>
The amendment is intended to make it clear that the only service condition that needs to be satisfied is the one required under the directive applicable to the firm. Slightly different procedures apply for passporting on a service basis depending on the particular market directive. I believe that the Treasury's stance is that that this may not be necessary but that it might be a useful amendment. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Again, I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary and adds nothing to the Bill
<P>
The service conditions referred to in paragraph 12(b) are those set out in paragraph 14. Those are clearly the conditions applicable to the EEA firm in question. The amendment would have no additional effect and there is always a risk that an unnecessary provision could create doubt in other areas. In particular, adding those words would appear to cast doubt over whether the establishment conditions defined in paragraph 13 are the establishment conditions applicable under paragraph 12(a). As the Bill stands, it is clear that the service conditions referred to are those set in paragraph 14. I therefore hope that on that basis the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the conditions set out in paragraph 14 deal with the point being made here. I am sure that if a subsequent discussion between lawyers suggested that there was a slightly different point and that the directive applicable to the firm should apply, the Government would take up the matter.  I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 199, line 40, leave out `13 or 14' and insert `12(a) or 12(b)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 172, in page 199, line 43, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`through its United Kingdom branch or'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in the case of paragraph 12(a), through its United Kingdom branch or, in the case of paragraph 12(b),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is a drafting point. It seems to us that the wrong paragraphs may have been referred to. Only paragraph 12 appears to refer to qualifying for authorisation albeit under the procedures set out in paragraphs 13 and 14. I understand that the parliamentary draftsman is looking into this. Amendment No. 172 would make it clear that the permission to establish a UK branch is as a result of authorisation under paragraph 12(a) and permission to provide services is as a result of authorisation under paragraph 12(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, it is a matter of drafting. It is almost a matter of taste which of the two one adopts. As he pointed out, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has written to the hon. Gentleman with an undertaking that we will seek the views of the parliamentary counsel on this alternative. I am happy to repeat that undertaking this afternoon. If a change is desirable we will table an amendment on Report and if not we will leave things as they are.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 174, in page 200, line 27, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`identifying the single market directive under which each relevant activity is authorised'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 160, in page 202, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except where under the relevant single market directive regulation is primarily the responsibility of the host state regulator.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment reflects some quite complicated territory. I understand that the Treasury lawyers currently feel that either part of it may be unnecessary or that it seeks to achieve what we should not want it to achieve.
<P>
The amendment would insert at the end of line 27,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``identifying the single market directive under which each relevant activity is authorised'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is an attempt to provide to UK banks wanting to passport abroad greater flexibility than they have currently. The general principle is that banks can obtain their passport under the second banking directive, and non-bank investment firms under the investment services directive.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The scope of the 2BCD passport is different from the scope of the ISD passport--in some respects wider, in other respects narrower. The ISD passport covers arranging deals in existing securities and receiving and transmitting orders, which the 2BCD passport does not. The amendment would provide the ISD passport, as well as the 2BCD passport, to UK banks. The ISD contemplates that it may apply to banks as well as non-bank investment firms because the investment firms to which it applies are defined as firms that carry out any of the four particular investment services referred to by the ISD as core investment services. Generally, core investment services are receiving and transmitting orders, including arranging deals in existing securities, dealing with agents, discretionary investment management and underwriting new issues. The principle is that banks providing any of those services will be treated as investment firms to which the ISD passport applies. The ISD does not want to duplicate the 2BCD passport and therefore provides that only certain of its articles, particularly those about the imposition of business conduct rules and about membership of exchanges, apply to banks. Clearly, the ISD contemplates that its passport is appropriate for banks that are authorised as investment firms--instead of being the result of the banking licence under 2BCD. That is why certain articles of the ISD are excluded with respect to banks authorised for one or more core investment services by their banking licence.
<P>
We need to make it clear that authorisation for core investment services is not extended to banks simply because they are banks: they need to apply for it separately. That can be done now because authorisation is covered by the Banking Act 1987 rather than the Financial Services Act 1986. The UK implemented a regulation covering the acquisition of the full 2BCD passport, which stated that any bank authorised under the Banking Act was ipso facto authorised to do everything covered by the 2BCD passport. That was before the ISD and was a neat way of doing it. However, if banks could be excluded from the provision on ISD core investment services, the necessary authorisation under the Financial Services Act would entitle them to the ISD passport.
<P>
I look forward to hearing the Government's response. We are not convinced that the present drafting on this territory cannot be improved.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): Unless the Minister has good brief, I sympathise with him because this is a complex area into which I tiptoe somewhat hesitantly. The key issue is whether authorisation for core investment services is extended to banks because they are banks or whether they should have to apply for authorisations separately. Are the banks sufficiently covered simply by their banking licence under the second banking directive or do they need to apply for cover under the investment services directive as well? Those are the questions on which we seek clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 160 is grouped with amendment No. 174. Our proposal is to avoid double regulation. For example, if a United Kingdom firm's branch in France is to be regulated under the investment services directive by the French regulators it should not also be regulated by the Financial Services Agency, which could typically impose uncompetitive disadvantages on it as against other businesses in France. We have cited this main theme and will do so in other parts of the Bill because we do not think it appropriate to have double regulation, especially where passporting applies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This is complicated, but, in our view, amendment No. 174 is unnecessary. There is nothing to prevent the notice giving whatever details about authorisation are helpful. Paragraph 18(3) refers to specified terms that would enable that to be required by the FSA, if it were thought necessary. So the amendment adds nothing to what can already be achieved.
<P>
The important aspect of the specified terms is that they guarantee that regulations contain the information necessary to ensure their acceptance as proper passport notifications by the host state, and, to the extent that specifying the relevant directive is necessary for that, we may well include it among the specified terms.
<P>
I understand and sympathise with the intention of amendment No. 160, but it is yet another unnecessary amendment. The power to make the regulations governing the continuing regulation of UK passporting firms will lie with the Treasury and, to the extent that the directives restrict the UK's power as home state to impose requirements--it is worth noting that their thrust is generally to restrict the host state rather than the home state to avoid unnecessary overlap--the Government are bound directly to observe those requirements, and liable in infraction proceedings if they fail to do so.
<P>
It is relevant also to note that the proportionality principle in clause 2(3)(c) will apply to the FSA's general rule-making functions and to the general policies and principles that it applies in regulating passporting firms.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Are there any real areas where the Government are afraid of infraction proceedings here? Can the Minister put a little flesh on the bones?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not aware of any immediate threat of such proceedings but there would be that possibility and we prefer not to open ourselves to any risk. Avoiding unnecessary regulatory overlap will, however, be part of meeting the requirements of the principle of clause 2(3)(c).
<P>
I may not have entirely grasped hon. Members' argument about banks and building societies, so I apologise if what I am about to say is not wholly correct. We do not see how the amendment could enable UK banks and building societies to use the passport under the investment services directive rather than the second banking directive for their usual core banking activities because it could not and would not alter the position clearly established under article 2(1) of the ISD, which has the effect that a credit institution--bank or building society--whose authorisation under the first and second banking directives covers ``any one or more'' of the activities in the annexe to the ISD does not obtain a passport under the ISD but instead does so under the banking directives. If I understood hon. Members' argument, its main theme was that the amendment would open up that path. I do not believe that it would. I hope that I have responded adequately to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are willing to withdraw the amendment. There may be some subsequent discussion among the legal advisers on the issue and it may be possible to return to it. The Government have suggested that they understand the issues and if those do not need to be addressed, clearly the argument is for them. For the time being I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Are schedule 3 and clause 28 to be considered together?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We dealt with clause 28 without a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise. My remarks are relevant to schedule 3, but they would have been equally relevant to clause 28.
<P>
A vital part of the Bill is obviously that it accepts and promotes passporting from other member states. By member states I refer to not only the European Union, but the European Economic Area, which includes countries such as Denmark that will have equivalent privileges in regard to this matter. Under the investment services directive and several other provisions, we accept banks and other institutions over here even though they are primarily regulated in their home states.
<P>
Is the Minister satisfied that that is genuinely reciprocal? There are reports that the investment services directive does not completely work throughout the EEA, and that Italy especially is often reluctant to accept our institutions wanting to set up there. I understand that there have also been problems in France and Germany. Therefore we could pass a law that gives an unqualified right for other banks and institutions to set up over here even though that does not flow so readily in the opposite direction. Is the Minister satisfied that we are not taking on a rather one-sided obligation?
<P>
Does the Minister believe that the FSA has an obligation in the Bill to help firms that may find themselves disadvantaged under the passporting arrangements? He knows that clause 2(3)(e) states that the FSA, in discharging its general functions, must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the international character of financial services and markets and the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would be undermined if it were discovered that any of our institutions did not receive the passporting right that is their due in law. In considering the schedule, it might be appropriate to stiffen it in some respects and make it dependent on there genuinely being a two-way street. If the Minister is sympathetic to that aim, he might consider returning at a later date with an amendment that welcomes passporting inward, but only to the extent that the states in question accept the obligations to allow British institutions on their territory.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> To follow the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), a separate amendment to clause 28 did not appear, I think by my own fault. It was submitted to the Treasury with regard to reciprocity, and the Treasury has responded constructively. The intention is that the forthcoming passport provisions relating to schedules 3 and 4 should be subject to the condition of reciprocity, as the industry argued is necessary in our consultations with it; hon. Members may have read the APCIMS report on the matter
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our fallback position is that we want required reciprocity for UK firms that are entitled to passports under the single market directives, at least. Because directors' passports do not apply, reciprocity is necessary in order to provide cross-border services in other member states through remote communications such as screen, fax and telephone. I hope that the Financial Secretary will have some constructive words to say about reciprocity in relation to the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Member for Wells is absolutely right to draw our attention to the fact that we are discussing firms in the full European Economic Area, not just in the European Union. He gave the example of Denmark, which may have been a slip of the tongue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That was an odd slip for me to make; I meant Norway--or Liechtenstein, or Iceland. As we know, Denmark is a member of the European Union.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> A rather wider group of countries is involved than we normally consider in the EU. The schedule enshrines in the Bill the passport rights given to firms operating throughout the EEA under the single market directives to establish a single market in financial services--the second banking directive, which took effect in 1993, the investment services directive of 1995, and the third life and third non-life insurance directives, which took effect in 1994.
<P>
The single market in financial services provides excellent opportunities for UK financial services, because our financial services industry is the foremost in Europe. The single market enables UK firms to operate throughout the EEA on the basis of the single authorisation that they hold under the Bill. The Bill is therefore an important step for our financial services industry. It is important that we embrace it wholeheartedly, because the balance of interests for our industry is undoubtedly that we should do so.
<P>
I am aware that issues about the implementation of the ISD in other countries have been raised. The Commission may instigate infraction proceedings against states that do not correctly implement the directives. It has already acted against Italy, although for contravention of the treaty itself, rather than the directive, in the area that the Bill covers. We can therefore be reassured that the Commission is up to the task of ensuring that the requirements are implemented equally throughout the EEA, as is, I repeat, in the balance of interests of the UK industry because of its strength.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman is unduly worried that the schedule will disadvantage our financial services industry; in fact, the reverse is true. I hope that that gives Opposition Members some reassurance.
<P>
I could make many other observations about the schedule, but Opposition Members focused on the question of reciprocity. We are satisfied that the enforcement processes will be effective and will be exercised.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 3 agreed to.
<H4><center>Schedule 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>TREATY RIGHTS</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 161, in page 203, line 12, after `right', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``, or is not able to use the EEA right it has,''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would allow an EEA firm that merely provides outside services into the UK by means of remote communications--telephone, fax or screen--to have a treaty right under the schedule. Such a firm will have an EEA right because it will be entitled to use its passport under 2BCD or ISD; however, under guidance given by the Commission in July 1997, it cannot use that passport unless it goes into the client state to provide the relevant service. In today's world, it is appropriate that that extension should be made. We also want to enable EEA or other firms to access the UK so that their home member states allow UK firms to access them; that is therefore another area where we feel that reciprocity would be appropriate. As of May this year, what was article 59 of the treaty of Rome, the right to provide cross-border services throughout the EEA, changed to article 49. That was not realised until recently and it was brought about by the change in numbering resulting from the treaty of Amsterdam. That is relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This is another tricky area. It is an established principle that the single market directives are the exclusive means by which the firms covered by the directives may exercise the rights available under the directives to establish branches and to provide services within the territory of another member state. So if the EEA firm has an EEA right under one of the directives to provide a particular service within the territory of the UK without a UK branch, the firm will he able to do so under schedule 3. Moreover, we would be in breach of Community law if we provided an alternative mechanism. However, the thrust of the Commission's guidance is that where certain services are provided by remote means, they are not provided 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``within the territory of another member state'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but are provided within the territory of the state of the service provider. If that is correct--I think that this is the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs--the directives confer no right to provide such services, so the firm will not have an EEA right in the terms of the Bill. It seems highly unlikely that a firm that is not providing any services within the territory of the UK would nevertheless be regarded as carrying on a business here--it is unlikely but conceivable, given the internet era into which we are entering. If that occurred, the firm would he able to exercise a treaty right to provide the service under paragraph 3 of schedule 4.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. If the remote services are not regarded as taking place ``within the territory'' of the host state for directive purposes, but the firm is carrying on a business in the UK for the purposes of the Bill, it could rely on schedule 4 or part IV. There is also a risk that the amendment could he interpreted as being in conflict with the exclusivity principle in regard to the directives and thereby open the UK to possible infraction proceedings.
<P>
We are confident that there is no gap between schedules 3 and 4, and so the amendment, which seeks to plug that gap, is not necessary.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I agree that this is a complex matter and I should be interested to know whether my question focuses on the right issues. Let us suppose that there is an investment adviser outside the EU but in the EEA, say in Oslo, who provides investment services on pensions, for example, through the internet, and that such services are paid for regularly by a Visa card. The internet is plainly directed to the world at large, and to Europe in particular, so the advertisements are attractive to potential investors in the United Kingdom who do business with that provider in Oslo. Will such providers be operating under schedule 3 or schedule 4 and will they operate under the investment services directive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman poses an interesting question and the answer will depend on whether the firm is deemed to be carrying on a business in the UK. The way in which a firm operates will determine the answer to that question. I do not think that the firm being in Oslo makes any difference because the entire EEA is treated in the same way. It is conceivable that a firm with the characteristics that the right hon. and learned Gentleman described could come under schedule 4 rather than schedule 3, which is the one that we would normally expect.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Will the Minister tell us a bit more about when a firm is likely to be deemed to be carrying on business in the UK? A firm that directs its advertisements inter alia to people in this country, and which attracts business from them, must be carrying on business in this country. The Minister will have other guidance and legal backing, so I should be interested to hear what he has to say about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It depends on what the business does. If all it does is place information on the internet on a server in Oslo, but it does not produce advertising or employ staff in the UK, it is conceivable that it might be a schedule 4 rather than a schedule 3 operation. We cannot say now what the demarcations will be. I am not sure that we can answer all those questions ahead of testing them.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> People who are trying to do practical business will be reading our debates. I agree that some survey on the internet from a country outside the EU is one thing, but if the firm is offering to do business with the world at large, and it does business with someone in this country by attracting moneys that are paid through a Visa card into a pension investment operated from an EEA country, is that not doing business here?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Normally the answer would be yes. My caveat is that it may be possible to conceive of other circumstances for such a company. I was referring to a ``server'' rather than a ``survey''. If there was a server--a computer--where all the information was held and where the only advertising was on the company's website in Oslo, there might be an argument, depending on what else the company did, for it to be deemed not to be conducting business in the UK. That would be very much the exception rather than the rule.
<P>
My response to the amendment, which aims to plug a gap between the coverage of schedule 3 and that of schedule 4, is that it is unnecessary because there is no gap.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister is right that the amendment aims to plug a gap. The Government are currently of the opinion that there is no gap. If they conclude during subsequent discussions that we are right and that a gap exists, I assume that they will address the issue in a similar manner to that proposed. On that understanding, and having made clear our feeling that an important issue is at stake, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 175, in page 203, line 22, after `Schedule', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and subject to paragraph 5 below'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is intended to make clear that permission to carry on the passported activity dealt with in the schedule does not apply unless the firm involved has given notice to the FSA where required. Such notice has to be given only when the activity is to be carried on in the UK, and therefore does not apply to cross-border services from outside. However, the 2BCD or ISD firm will not need to give notice under paragraph 5 in such circumstances, because it will carry on permitted business in the United Kingdom and will accordingly be able to use its passport under schedule 3.
<P>
I understand that the Treasury's line is that the amendment is not necessary as paragraph 5 clearly requires the treaty firm to notify the FSA if it is to benefit from a permission under the schedule. The purpose of the amendment is not just to make clear that permission has to be obtained, but to plug a gap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Again, I hope that there is no gap, and I believe that the amendment is unnecessary. Paragraph 5 spells out the requirement for the treaty firm to notify if it is to benefit from permission under the schedule. I do not think that adding the proposed words would change anything, as paragraph 5 already applies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> indicated assent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I see that the hon. Gentleman agrees. I think that the Treasury line is as he suggested, and that it is correct.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> To take up my hypothetical example, am I to understand that somebody operating out of Oslo--or anywhere in EEA--and offering investment services over the internet in a manner designed to attract business from British citizens will have to give notice under paragraph 5? It seems sensible that such a person should have to do so, as such provision would at least give British citizens the protection of knowing that the FSA knows what is going on and will be able to liaise with its counterparts in other parts of the EEA or the European Union, as would be the case if the marketing were coming from, say, France or Greece. That would make sense; will the Minister confirm that that is the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, that will be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As previously, we are happy to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. I do so on the understanding that if Treasury lawyers agree that a possible gap exists, the Government will address it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): As I understand it, a firm can qualify to operate either under the investment services directive, the second banking co-ordination directive or the two insurance directives--one for life and one for non-life insurance. <P>
However, those directives cover only some financial services and financial service providers. Some are left out; but those services and providers may qualify under article 49 of the treaty of Rome--an umbrella clause that says that a firm can provide a service anywhere in the treaty area provided, at least in principal, that it satisfies home conditions.
<P>
As I understand it, a country can avoid the provisions of article 49 by invoking the argument that allowing a firm to operate would be against the general good of that country. From what I can tell, the schedule indirectly defines the limits of the general good. It would allow the United Kingdom to waive its right to invoke that argument,  provided that certain conditions were met. Those conditions are set out in the schedule.
<P>
The first condition is to be found in paragraph 3, which states that the entrant must be authorised in the home member state and, in paragraph 3(1)(b)(i), that the home member state's regulations must ``afford equivalent protection''. That surprised me a little, so I turned to the explanatory notes, which state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the directives do not cover the full range of financial services or financial service providers. It is necessary, therefore, to provide an equivalent mechanism to permit persons from other EU member States to exercise their Treaty rights in the absence of formal directive passporting arrangements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My first group of questions is about the necessity of the UK unilaterally waiving its rights. There may be benefits, but what are they? For example, are other countries expected to do something similar? What is the Government's reasonable expectation of obtaining such reciprocity from other member states? Are other countries busy drafting an equivalent of schedule 4 into their domestic legislation?
<P>
I ask those questions not as a paid-up member of the Empire loyalists--I am not. I ask them simply to find out what the UK will obtain by setting out something as detailed as schedule 4, which seems to go a good deal further than required. As far as I can tell, nothing like schedule 4 exists in previous legislation. A high proportion of the Bill, with which we shall be saddled for some months, replicates or amends existing legislation, but the provisions of schedule 4 do not exist--at least not in the present form.
<P>
My second group of questions is about the application of the schedule. So often in the Bill--indeed, virtually everywhere--if one looks carefully enough one can find the words: ``Don't worry. Fly me. The Treasury is in charge.'' It can be seen in paragraph 3(4), which states that the certificate will be issued by the Treasury. In other words, it is open to the Treasury to form a judgment about the interpretation of paragraph 3(1)(b). I think that I am right about that, but the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.
<P>
How will the Treasury go about forming that judgment and what criteria will it use? Will it be persuaded by a lawyer's opinion? Is it expecting someone to come to it with such an opinion? Will it be persuaded by the recommendation of another member state that is acting on behalf of a firm that seeks to obtain rights to enter the UK market under article 49? As part of the criteria relates to affording equivalent protection, how does the Treasury intend to find out whether the protection that another member state provides is indeed adequate? Will it, for example, go to the FSA and say, ``Go abroad and find out what protection is afforded by these other countries''? Will the FSA compile a report on the level of protection that is afforded by other countries and then report back to the Treasury? If so, could such a report be placed in the public domain?
<P>
If we do not deal with the issue at an institutional-cum-Government-to-Government level, the alternative is to leave firms to deal with it. Representatives of a foreign firm would be required to make their case and to say, ``We want to operate in the UK. Here is the system of regulation in our home country. We think that it satisfies the provision in schedule 4, so we would like to come into your country and have a passport.'' That is asking a heck of a lot of the first firm that would come into the UK because it would foot the bill. It would have to do all the work and research. It would have to fight the case and get the lawyers in. Once it had done the work and opened the door, the test of affording equivalent protection would have been satisfied and everybody else from that country would be able to pile in behind without having paid the huge entry fee. I am not sure that that is the right way to go about implementing the provision. I would like some guidance from the Minister on exactly how the Treasury intends to implement it.
<P>
Finally, I would like to know whether the Treasury intends to make its decisions--however they are implemented and however it intends to implement the provisions--known case by case. Will it always make its decisions public so that other operators in the market can see what is going on? Will it provide a full explanation of its decision in each case, be it yes or no?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I want to ask a rather ignorant question. Am I right in thinking that, within the EU, the investment services directive or the second banking co-„ordination directive, if that is more relevant, will apply? Will they be regarded as the equivalent protection? Would those directives apply within the EEA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That answers my question. Would I, therefore, be right in thinking that, in most cases, the answer to my hon. Friend's question is likely to be that those involved have to apply those two directives or does it go deeper than that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Chichester asked about the purpose of the schedule so I set it out at the outset. The aim is to give effect in UK law to rights of establishment and to provide services that extend beyond those covered by the single market directives.
<P>
A person who is established in another member state of the European Economic Area and who is authorised to carry on a regulated activity under the law of that state has a right to be authorised to carry on that activity in the other states as well. <P>
However, that right applies only as long as the relevant law of the home state provides equivalent protection to the provisions that apply in the host state or meets minimum European Economic Area requirements that may apply in that area of law.
<P>
In cases in which the activity and the person are covered by passport directives, the mechanisms for the home state to approve the passport and the split of responsibilities between the home and host states are the same as those in the directives. However, the passport directives do not cover the full range of financial services or financial service providers that currently fall within the scope of UK regulation or might fall within it in future.
<P>
<H5>5 30pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Schedule 4 therefore applies in cases in which a person has rights that cannot be exercised through the directives because they do not fall within one of the classes of person covered by the directives or because the regulated activity concerned does not fall within the scope of the directives.
<P>
A mortgage provider would be a good example of that, if, as a result of consultation, we decided--hypothetically--that mortgage provision should be regulated. A mortgage provider that did not finance its business by accepting deposits from the public would not be a credit institution as defined by the second banking directive.
<P>
Lending on property is an activity that is passportable under the second banking directive, but not under the investment services directive. An investment services directive investment firm that was authorised for mortgage lending in its home state might therefore have treaty rights that extended beyond its directive rights.
<P>
We must provide an equivalent mechanism to permit persons from EEA member states to exercise their treaty rights. The schedule provides for that mechanism.
<P>
It is not right to regard the schedule as waiving our rights, to borrow the phrase used by the hon. Member for Chichester. We are giving effect to the jurisprudence of the European Court in relation to circumstances in which the general good may not be invoked. Schedule 4 follows the precedent set by sections 31 and 32 of the 1986 Act, which deal with such matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester asked about paragraph 3(4), which also reflects another provision in the 1986 Act. However, no certificate has been issued or sought under that Act provision.

<P>

<B>Mr.  Tyrie:</B>  Might  that  be  a  result  of  the  huge one-off entry cost for someone seeking such a certificate? Therefore, it would be relevant for the Government to give the industry a view on how they will interpret paragraph 3(1)(b)(i).
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not aware of such a barrier confronting someone who wishes to operate in such a way. However, I would be happy to examine any examples that the hon. Gentleman may give of such a problem arising.
<P>
Given that provisions have been enacted since 1986 and that no one has sought to obtain such a certificate, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for not going into too much detail about what we would do, were such a document to be sought. However, he is probably right to suggest that we would seek the assistance of the FSA, were such an eventuality to arise.
<P>
Schedule 4 does not seek to define the extent of treaty rights, which are the subject of extensive and developing case law in the European Economic Area. However, it sets the conditions that must be met for authorisation by such a route in terms of the general principles that I have described.
<P>
Schedule 4 requires confirmation from the appropriate home state authority of the person's home state authorisation. It requires that home state arrangements provide equivalent protection for United Kingdom consumers and provides for the Treasury to determine whether the laws of a member state afford that protection.
<P>
The schedule provides a statutory mechanism for fulfilling our obligations under the treaty but it maintains the necessary protections and safeguards for UK consumers. It has received a warm welcome from industry bodies such as the London Investment Bankers Association and I hope that it will find equal favour with the Committee.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am very interested in what the Minister says and I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester for raising this. I apologise if I seemed to denigrate what he said in any way; I did not intend to do so.
<P>
The Minister's answer and use of the mortgage example seems highly pertinent. It raises the following questions in my mind and I should be grateful if he could answer them.
<P>
It is likely--indeed, it is almost happening at the moment--that mortgage providers in the EU will offer mortgages in this country. Mortgage lenders in this country have been borrowing money from banks in the EU this year at favourable exchange rates. There is no reason why those EU banks should not cut out the middle man and perhaps lend directly to people in this country. What will be the position of a bank in, for example, Hamburg, which enters into a mortgage transaction with a house purchaser in this country if it has not obtained a certificate or if the Treasury has not issued a certificate concerning German law? Will that become an unauthorised transaction, and consequently a criminal offence? As it will be a criminal offence, will the provisions of the clauses that we dealt with this morning, when I unfortunately could not be present, apply so that those mortgage transactions will be unenforceable by that lending bank in Hamburg? If so, we should know and it ought to know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The certificate is not a prerequisite to the exercise of rights under schedule 4. If a firm is confident that the law under which it is authorised in its home state meets the necessary condition, it could rely on that confidence. It would then be for the FSA to take action if it did not agree. That would allow firms to operate in the way that the right hon. and learned Member describes.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That is one of the things that troubles me about the structure of this part of the Bill. I looked at the letter of 13 October from the Economic Secretary, which was sent in answer to the question of enforceability. It laid much emphasis on the fact that any transgression was a criminal offence and that any transgressor should not therefore be able to enforce his contract. It is a criminal offence only because it has been made a technical criminal offence by the structure of the Bill. Although some very criminal activities might be caught by that criminal offence, a lot of thoroughly technical, but otherwise wholly innocent activities, will also be caught by an innocent transgression.
<P>
The Minister's answer certainly gives me the impression that this is highly complex. In theory at least, though I doubt whether it would happen in practice, a bank in Hamburg could be prosecuted in this country for conducting mortgage business with someone here because the FSA had decided, contrary to the view taken by the Hamburg bank, that the equivalent German protections were not equivalent and sufficient. That highly arcane issue could be central to a criminal offence in this country. I raise this simply to urge the Treasury to examine the matter carefully because it does not seem to be a very good way to legislate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes an interesting point that takes us back to some of the issues that we dealt with this morning. As he says, it is an arcane area. I should like to reflect on it and write to him, copying the letter for other members of the Committee, to explain how we envisage that being dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister extend his reply and reflect on whether the Government might make public how they intend to apply paragraph 3(4) more generally? He said that there has not been an application since the law was introduced in 1986; that might be because there are built-in obstacles to making an application, among which are the costs involved. Some people have told me that that is the case; no doubt they will write to the Minister in response to the point. People do not want to get involved in expensive legal battles about whether equivalent protection is afforded. If we are to codify the law--there is already a basis, in the Financial Services Act, for enacting such legislation--it would be sensible for the Treasury to give greater clarity on how it will implement it, in particular in regard to what definition will be used for equivalent protection.
<P>
We have a set of partner states that have different levels of protection and someone somewhere will have to make a judgment, generically, or on a case-by-case basis--in other words, not by reference to a document compiled by the Treasury or the FSA. If we do not use a document--I understand that it might be extremely expensive to compile and to keep up to date and that the Government do not want to do that--a case-by-case approach will be taken. In which case, I would be grateful if the Minister made the commitment that any such decisions will henceforth be published with an explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B>  On  the  point  made  by  my  right  hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire, the FSA has on several public occasions made it clear that it does not view standards of regulation within the EU as equivalent to those within the UK. Therefore, in the situation to which he referred, the FSA would in many cases adjudge that there was not equivalence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Chichester asked me to extend my reply to provide an explanation of how we envisage paragraph 3(4) operating. I am willing to do that, but would he help me by telling me where the problems that have been drawn to his attention arise? If I had that input from him, I would be glad to respond to him in the reply that I shall send to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The matter is probably better covered in correspondence, but I was told today that a large firm--I believe in Germany--that was considering coming to the UK to operate has examined with lawyers the risks of making an unsustained application and has decided that it does not want the hassle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman wrote to me about that.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Are we likely to have a short stand part debate on the schedule?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are having that debate now.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I therefore seek your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, to make a further short explanatory contribution. I return to the letter that I received from the Economic Secretary which dealt with the whole area of enforcement; that matter was covered this morning but, as I made clear in my recent brief contribution, it is important also in the context of the schedule. I wish to put down a marker for the Minister that I remain unhappy about the concept of inability to enforce that was raised in this morning's debates; indeed, I suspect that the matter was not pushed to a vote. I ask the Treasury to continue to look carefully at the matter.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I tie that request in with my earlier illustration of the bank in Hamburg or Frankfurt that provides mortgage business. I am talking about a highly technical area, in which the vast majority of business will be totally bona fide and often very much to the benefit of the citizens of our country wherever it comes from--from this country, from overseas or from other parts of the EU. My personal view is that using unenforceability as a method of market discipline is to use far too blunt an instrument unless it can be tempered by enforcement being permitted with the leave of the court.
<P>
Since the Financial Services Act 1986, the precedent has been more restrictive than that, but I believe that the proposal is dangerous and that, sooner or later, we shall see some serious injustice. It would be wise to leave the ultimate discretion to the courts. I do not see it damaging the SFA or the Government. In her letter to me, the Economic Secretary specifically said that the provision was not being enacted as a matter of market discipline. If it is not, I believe that there is a strong argument for taking it out. I should be grateful if the Minister would consider the matter further.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 13, line 32, after `firm', insert `or other person'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 177, in page 13, line 34, after `firm', insert `or other person'.
<P>
No. 178, in page 13, line 36, after `firm', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or the members of that person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The three amendments cover essentially the same point: that if a partner leaves a partnership or if a new partner joins, the resulting partnership constitutes a different firm. Clause 29 allows the partnership authorisation to continue in those circumstances, avoiding the cost and hassle of requiring a new application. That has been allowed under the Financial Services Act 1986. However, a partnership may wish to incorporate for tax or other <P>
organisational reasons, or because of a takeover. The amendments are designed to permit a similar rollover in such circumstances if a partnership wants to incorporate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The purpose of clause 29 is, as the hon. Gentleman said, to ensure that a partnership, or some other form of unincorporated body that is an authorised person, does not need to reapply for authorisation simply because the association has reformed as a matter of law following certain changes--for example, a change in membership. In effect, the clause reproduces the provisions of section 29 of the Financial Services Act 1986. That is not a problem for a body corporate, such as a company or building society, because it is a separate legal person from its members. However, the question does arise in the case of partnerships.
<P>
The Government's view is that the definition of a firm in subsection (4) is sufficiently wide to encompass any authorised person to which clause 29 applies, and we see no need to add to that or to include references to ``other persons''. It is an approach that was adopted in section 26 of the Companies Act 1989, which addressed a similar issue and which has worked well.
<P>
There is a danger about the formulation proposed by the hon. Gentleman, as it almost certainly would be deemed to refer to an individual. We would not want that to be the case. We would want to seek authorisation afresh if a new individual came along. I do not think that the amendment is needed to achieve the aim that we all agree is desirable, and it has a problem attached to it as well. I hope on that basis that the hon. Gentleman is able to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> For the sake of clarity, will the Minister confirm that the Government understand that, under clause 29, a partnership that becomes a corporate structure is not required to re-apply for authorisation? The amendment's purpose is to make the position clear vis-a-vis a partnership, and the crucial point is whether a partnership has to re-apply simply because it changes its legal structure and becomes a corporate structure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> In that instance, I understand that it will need to apply afresh. It is only if the members of the partnership change, or something of that sort, that application is not necessary. If there is a change in legal status, a new application will be needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That is the point of the amendment. If individuals' legal status merely changes from their being members of a partnership to a company, the hassle of re-applying is unnecessary and inappropriate. The wording that we suggest is designed to prevent that from being the case. If there is a genuine problem with the meaning of the word ``person'' in context, which I do not think that there is, will the Government consider an alternative mechanism? If they do not, it seems as though there is an unnecessary amount of bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is a helpful clarification of the amendment's intention. Having understood that aim, I will take the issue away, reflect on it and return to it at a later stage. My initial reaction is that, given a change of status such as that described by the hon. Gentleman it would be appropriate for people to seek authorisation afresh. However, I take his point that that might not always be the best way to proceed.
<P>
There is a difficulty about the wording, because to refer to ``other person'' brings in individuals. However, there would be a way round that if we wanted to go down the road urged by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I will reflect on whether that would be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the basis of that undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It seems that a firm would lose its authorisation if it was withdrawn by the home state. What would happen if the home state ceased to be a member of the European Economic Area? It has happened. I am not sure whether Greenland used to be a member of the EEA--I do not know whether it existed then--but it was certainly in the European Economic Community. It is conceivable that one of the present non-European Union members of the EEA might cease to be a member. I was in Iceland this summer when there was loose talk of it joining the north American free trade area. If that were incompatible with being a member of the EEA, it is just possible that at some future point it might withdraw. Icelandic banks or financial institutions passported here might subsequently claim that they were and continue to be duly authorised by Iceland. The clause does not provide for that eventuality. Given that we are legislating for the long term, has that occurred to the Treasury, and is such a contingency adequately catered for?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am, of course, intrigued to know which countries that might be about to leave the EEA the right hon. Gentleman had in mind. I am informed that for this purpose Greenland is part of Denmark and therefore continues to benefit from the arrangements that we have been debating.
<P>
If a country were to leave the EU or the EEA, it would cease to benefit from participating in the single market. No doubt transitional arrangements would be made in the treaty of secession to determine how the withdrawal would take place and how the country involved would lose the benefits that it currently enjoys, but it would lose them.

Question put and agreed to.
