(</i><i class="I">this day</i><i class="I">) again proposed, </i>That the clause stand part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="09021356000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021356000466"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): We had just made a start
on clause 30, which includes a new provision relating to directions to
individuals who represent a risk of disorder. The clause will amend
section 27 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. Currently, an
individual aged 16 or over who is in a public place can be given a
direction to leave that locality and be prohibited from returning
within 48 hours. There are two trigger requirements: first, that the
presence of the individual in that locality is likely, in all the
circumstances, to cause or to contribute to the occurrence of
alcohol-related crime or disorder, and secondly, that the giving of a
direction is necessary for the purpose of removing or reducing the
likelihood of there being crime or disorder in that locality. Clause 30
will reduce the minimum age from 16 to 10.</div>
<a name="09021356000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the concept behind what the Government are trying to do. We heard from
the police during the Committee&#146;s evidence sessions why they
felt that the power would be helpful. However, it was interesting that
they felt that it was at the top end of that age range&#151;I think
they mentioned 14 and 15-year-olds&#151;that the power was most
likely to be used. In all genuineness, because it will extend to
10-year-olds, the provision makes me feel somewhat uncomfortable
because of the clear relationship between criminal law and
child protection issues.</div>
<a name="09021356000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause as
it stands speaks only of the requirement to prohibit someone from being
within an area for 48 hours and the removal of that person from the
area, but we know that the police have other powers to take children to
a place of safety, their home or where their parent or guardian might
be. I want to understand properly how the provisions are intended to
fit together. For example, in clause 28, the Government give the police
an additional power to take a child home in circumstances where alcohol
has been confiscated. I accept that alcohol may not be confiscated in
the circumstances contemplated in clause 30, although there may be some
overlap, and that the police have other, general powers to take
children back home if they feel that they are at risk or in danger. I
am still trying to understand clearly why there is a power in the Bill
to move children on, particularly young children, rather 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>than a requirement to take them to a place of safety or ensure that
appropriate child protection arrangements are being followed
through.</div><a name="09021356000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of 10-year-olds, if there is a risk to their
safety&#151;section 27 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006
specifically contemplates a risk of crime or disorder&#151;do we
think that it is acceptable simply to move the child on and displace
them in those circumstances? It is important that we hear from the
Minister how the power is intended to relate to other police powers as
well as to social services and everything that goes with them. Certain
agencies have picked up on the issue. The YWCA said in its briefing
notes to the Committee that it</div>
<a name="09021356000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has serious
concerns about reports from some young women that they have been
&#145;moved on&#146; by the police under existing legislation, but
not always to an established place of safety. This has meant in some
circumstances that young women have been put at risk by being moved to
unsafe places like unlit parks or by having to find their own way home.
This can put young women into extremely vulnerable positions.</div>
<a name="09021356000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">We believe that an
approach of providing a package of support for young people is the best
way to ensure that they do not get locked into a cycle of offending.
Any &#145;Direction to Leave&#146; to young people that does enter
legislation must include a requirement for young people to be taken to
an agreed place of
safety.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously
the YWCA is highlighting its specific concerns, but there is something
worrying about the extension from 16 to 10. It is horrifying to think
that a 10-year-old would be out late at night at risk of offending and
getting into disorder. Sadly, that reflects some of the difficulties,
problems and challenges faced by many of our communities up down the
country, which is why I understand the Government&#146;s belief that
a simple power of removal may not necessarily be appropriate in
isolation. The police may feel that they are constantly taking children
back to their home or elsewhere. In those circumstances, as we
discussed this morning, some parents simply let the child back out
again. There is no parental responsibility. The Government are trying
to say that we need an additional trigger or lever to get parents to
take their responsibilities seriously, albeit that it is now through
something that is almost a criminal process.</div>
<a name="09021356000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real
question underlying all of this is what options have the Government
explored to avoid going down the criminalisation route? Clearly they
must have examined other options, some of which we touched on this
morning. The Government have formed the view that it is necessary to go
down a criminal justice route. It would be helpful to know what their
rationale was, what the evidence was and what their thoughts were in
trying to balance the issue of child protection and parenting with the
issue of criminal justice. Why do they think it appropriate to take
this approach rather than seeking to trigger support from social
services or child welfare, which I wholly accept are not mutually
exclusive? Clearly something has gone on for the Government to feel
that escalation to this level is
required.</div><a name="09021356000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that context, and because I think there is a need for interlinkage,
will the Minister explain why, according to my reading of clause 3,
there is no requirement to notify the parent or guardian of a child
issued with a notice under section 27 of the Violent Crime Reduction
Act? That may happen, but I should be grateful if the Minister
considered that. If a child is at risk of offending and is in a
situation where the police feel strongly that this power needs to be
invoked, there should be a requirement for notification to go to the
parents or the guardian.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div><a name="09021356000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
interesting to understand what protocols and procedures are envisaged.
If a child is in receipt of that notice, would the police notify
children&#146;s social services in the local authority concerned?
There are child welfare issues and risk and danger issues if a child as
young as 10 is issued with this sort of notice. As we know, some of the
problems that many young children face are linked to their home
environment, behavioural issues, mental health issues and drug
addiction. Their parents may have similar issues too. We need to ensure
a more co-ordinated and strategic approach once an at-risk child has
been identified through this mechanism and a notice has been issued. I
understand some of the rationale behind the direction that the
Government are taking, but in isolation, it is difficult to understand
and appreciate how the provision is intended to operate in practice.
This is a sensitive clause, because of the age of the children
concerned.</div>
<a name="09021356000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
question for the Minister arising from the youth alcohol action plan,
which includes in its summary of actions the issuing
of</div><a name="09021356000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;guidance
to the police, health and children&#146;s services to strengthen
their approach to dealing with young people drinking in public
places.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
relates to our previous debate, and the action plan says that the
timing of the provision is subject to the parliamentary timetable. The
Bill deals with a number of the aspects of the action plan. If we are
to gain a better understanding what sort of response is intended to
deal with children in such situations, what has happened to the
guidance contemplated in annexe A of the action plan? If parliamentary
approval is required, or if it is still envisaged that it will be
required, why is such a measure not included in part 3, which seems to
encompass the main aspects of the guidance? Perhaps it has been
published already or dealt with in another way. However, it would be
helpful to understand clause 30 better, because of the significant and
sensitive nature of the additional powers that the Government seek to
give to the police.</div>
<a name="09021356000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021356000467"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): I have three brief points to
make. First, I am sure that the police would say that the existing
powers are too limited. However, it can be argued that there is a
battery of existing powers that could be used in the situations
envisaged in clause 30. Under section 46 of the Children Act 1989, the
police can, under certain circumstances, remove children for their own
safety. Under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, under certain
circumstances, children under 16 can be removed to their place of
residence. Under sections 4 and 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, action
can be taken if anyone&#151;children, in this case&#151;is
using</div>
<a name="09021356000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;threatening,
abusive or insulting words or
behaviour&#148;.</div><a name="09021356000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
group of 10, 13 or 15-year-olds under the influence of alcohol might
well fall under the provisions in the Public Order Act in respect of
their language, behaviour and so on. Why are all those existing powers
in legislation deemed so inappropriate that we need a blanket provision
or catch-all so that all children between the ages of 10 and 18 can be
dealt with as stated in the
Bill?</div><a name="09021356000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point concerns a matter that we have already touched on. Is it
suitable simply to say that we can move people on? Let us imagine a
group of 10, 11 or 13-year-olds in a public place, perhaps on a dark
winter&#146;s evening: the police believe that there is a problem 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>and that they need moving on. Is it really appropriate simply to move a
group of 10-year-olds from one spot to another, rather than taking them
back home, for example, or taking some other action? There is a
question about the suitability of moving very young children around and
whether we are simply displacing their behaviour.</div>
<a name="09021356000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The police
will say that in some cases the issue is not clear-cut. A group of
children might well be causing what the neighbours perceive as a public
order problem, but are not actually breaking the law. At 9.30 pm one
evening, I was with a police community support officer in Duckmanton, a
pit village on the edge of my constituency. Three 13 and 14-year-old
lads were riding around on their bikes, hitting each other over the
head with a huge lump of polystyrene. No offence was being committed,
although some litter might have resulted and they were shouting very
loudly. However, the neighbours would certainly have been unhappy about
it. If the police had a word with them and they would move to another
area and repeat the performance. In what way is existing legislation
inadequate and why is it suitable simply to move the problem around,
especially when dealing with particularly young children&#151;the
Bill proposes to amend legislation to cover children as young as age
10?</div><a name="09021356000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
third point concerns the attitude in this country towards age and
criminality and the way in which we treat children. Rod Morgan, former
chairman of the Youth Justice Board, said about eight days ago that we
have one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in Europe,
although it is even lower in Scotland at eight years old. However, we
lock up twice as many young people as we did in the early 1990s, and we
are criminalising many more. When we lock them up, it costs
&#163;200,000 a head to keep them in secure accommodation: money
which might be better spent on adopting&#151;the Government are fond
of this&#151;the Finnish example of strict
liability.</div><a name="09021356000431"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09021356000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Finland, the age of criminal responsibility is 15, and the emphasis is
on trying to rehabilitate young children aged 10 to 15, working with
them through psychological approaches or rehabilitation
programmes&#151;whatever is appropriate for them and their families.
That would cost much less than &#163;200,000 to lock them up, as we
tend to do. In Finland, only three children in the 10 to 18 age range
are in confinement, as opposed to the 3,000 here. Statute that allows
us to experiment with the Scandinavian route already exists, but with
clause 30, we seem to be looking more at a punitive approach rather
than tackling the problem at its
source.</div><a name="09021356000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021356000468"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): I shall make a brief
contribution to raise a specific point. I agree wholeheartedly with my
hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch, that it is incredible that
children as young as 10 should roam the streets of our towns and
villages, particularly at night, unsupervised by their parents. Sadly,
as he alluded in his contribution, in certain circumstances that is a
sad reflection of society but it is a fact of life at
present.</div><a name="09021356000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue that puzzles me, which is connected to the clause, is the reverse
of that situation. Notwithstanding what the Government are seeking to
do, which basically is to grant powers to be used on the streets
against groups of young people who need to be moved on, why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>are they not also looking at the other side of the coin? It came as a
considerable surprise to learn, as a parent of teenage children, that
in most cases in law, if a young person in that age group wishes to
leave their home at night, and their parents say no, the parents have
no legal right to stop their children from disobeying, except in
certain narrow circumstances. If parents seek to bar the exit of the
home for that young person because they do not think that it is
appropriate for their children to go out on their own at night, and if
they take action forcibly&#151;in the peaceful meaning of that
word&#151;to stop their children, they are liable for prosecution. As
a parent, that case came as a surprise to me&#151;it is staggering.
Why have the Government not looked at the problem from that angle to
deal with what they are seeking to achieve in the
clause?</div><a name="09021356000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09021356000038"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000469"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell):</b> It is a rare occasion when
I hope that no young people read the record of the Committee and
discover the power that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford tells us
that they have; I will return to that point in a
moment.</div><a name="09021356000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Chesterfield asked whether the power is necessary,
because all existing powers are&#151;I think he
said&#151;superfluous, but that is certainly not the case. The power
should be seen for what it is, which is a power to plug a particular
gap that has been flagged up to the Committee during the evidence
sessions by the police, who complain of a situation where a mixed group
of young people might be having alcohol and causing trouble, or have
the potential to cause trouble. There is a clear power for those aged
16 and over, but it might be a mixed group we are talking about, so
what do we do with the younger members of that group? Just because they
might be younger, it does not mean that they might not be the most
serious perpetrators of disorder or trouble among that
group&#151;that is what the clause is
about.</div><a name="09021356000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman states that it might be more suitable just to move
children on, and there is nothing in the Bill that would prevent a
police officer from doing that. It takes us back to the point raised
throughout our deliberations in this part of the Bill about allowing
the police to use their discretion and ensuring that they have the
power that they need. In their view&#151;a view that we
share&#151;it is a power that they may need to use in some
circumstances, but it is a power that they do not yet
have.</div><a name="09021356000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000470"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I was in fact asking whether it is suitable just
to move the children on, or move the problem round the corner, rather
than tackling it as a wider issue. On the previous point, if there are
children aged 10 to 16 with a group of older children and they are
intoxicated on the street, why are the existing powers not allowing
them to be taken back home or referred to social services? If the
children are on the street with a gang of intoxicated youths, what
exactly is the gap that this is
filling?</div><a name="09021356000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000471"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I had written down the point and then
misinterpreted it, so it is my fault and not the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s. The point that I am trying to make is that it might
be entirely suitable for a police officer simply to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>move children on. In other circumstances it might be suitable for the
officer to take the child to a place of safety. The police must have
the ability to make that judgment. We must not be too restrictive and
second-guess what they must do in every circumstance. We had little, if
any, debate on clause 28. Clause 30 should be seen only in the context
of clause 28 because that clause deals with the issue of child safety.
Again, it depends on the
circumstances.</div><a name="09021356000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Chesterfield went on to argue a point about the age of
criminality. That is a bigger debate than this particular measure has
the time or inclination to deal with. But it is not about criminalising
young people. It is a preventive measure to be used when the police
officer thinks that it is proportionate and useful to do so. It is not
about a quick
escalation.</div><a name="09021356000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021356000472"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Does my hon.
Friend agree that the measure is a response to the common-sense
observation that a lot of people make, which is that when the younger
kids cause a nuisance the police do not have any powers to do anything?
They can get social services and do all kinds of things, but simply
getting them to go home, which might be some distance or just round the
corner on the same estate, is a useful power to deal with a problem
that everybody knows exists with the younger kids on their
estates.</div><a name="09021356000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000473"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That reminds me of a recent visit to South
Tyneside where very good work by the local partnership has been
successful in tackling youth disorder, and problems with alcohol too.
One part of the solution was to build a shelter for young people on the
other side of a field rather than at the side where they were
congregating. It certainly moved the children on, but in the view of
residents it helped to tackle the problem. It was not a case of out of
sight, out of mind. As far as the residents were concerned, the problem
was
removed.</div><a name="09021356000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not underplay, however, the point about child safety that the hon.
Members for Hornchurch and for Chesterfield raised. In an emergency the
police have the powers to bring in social services and other agencies
that the hon. Member for Hornchurch was talking about. But that is not
what this is about. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North
said, it is about giving the police a particular power to move children
on, and if used in conjunction with clause 28, the opportunity to take
them to a place of safety
too.</div><a name="09021356000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
example of a young woman complaining that she may be put into a more
dangerous situation by being moved on is something that a police
officer would need to consider. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford
made a point about 10-year-olds in the dark at night. I do not think
that that is incredible. It is incredibly sad that that should happen,
but we acknowledge and the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that in some
circumstances that can happen. Of course, the existing legislation
applying to 16-year-olds has a time scale on it. We are not talking
only about tackling problems in the dark of night. If we do not put a
time scale on the measure, we could be talking about situations that
the police might encounter at 5 pm or earlier, say on a school holiday
or weekend. I hope that that helps to explain
things.</div><a name="09021356000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
are parents not notified of the powers? We have to be proportionate. We
have a very good scheme in my constituency called Child Safe to take
children back to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>their parents. That is how to notify the parents. We must be careful not
to make the measure too burdensome. The police want a power
specifically to move children that are younger than those that they are
currently able to move on. I am not sure whether a detailed recording
mechanism or having conditions applied would be helpful, particularly
when we are conscious of the time and energy that the police already
have to spend on such
matters.</div><a name="09021356000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hornchurch asked where the measure fits in the overall
scheme of things and in particular why parents are not involved. This
measure is part of a range of measures. There is an element of
escalation, so we could be talking&#151;at some point in relation to
the same child&#151;acceptable behaviour contracts and ASBOs.
However, we could also be talking about parenting contracts and
parenting orders. We have to see the measure for what it is, but we
must also put it into the context of the measures that are available at
the discretion of the
police.</div><a name="09021356000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000474"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise to remind the Minister&#151;this may
be in his pile of papers&#151;that I asked a specific question on the
youth alcohol action plan and the proposal for a more partnership-based
or collegiate toolkit. I do not think that he has addressed
that.</div><a name="09021356000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000475"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Forgive me; I do indeed have a note on that. The
guidance that the hon. Gentleman mentioned has not yet been published.
The decision has been made not to do so until we have the new laws on
the statute book and see how they fit into the overall picture of what
needs to be done regarding young people. He may have a view on that.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>He looks
bemused.</div><a name="09021356000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000476"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am bemused only about the parliamentary
timetable. I suppose the Minister is saying that he needs the Bill to
be on the statute book before the guidance for all the agencies can be
issued, and no more than that. However, I am sure he appreciates that
the guidance that is referred to is quite important in the context of
fitting all the different aspects and tools together to ensure that we
get the necessary cohesive approach.</div>
<a name="09021356000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000477"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The guidance is important, and I do not by any
means underestimate its importance. The hon. Gentleman is exactly right
on why we have taken the decision.</div>
<a name="09021356000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000478"></a>Mr.

in the debate?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000479"></a>Mr.

was?</div>
<a name="09021356000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000480"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> My point was that parents have no legal powers to
prevent their children leaving home if they want to go
out.</div>
<a name="09021356000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000481"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Again, I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. That
is an interesting point, which I suppose touches on the measure we are
discussing. However, if a child leaves home, the parents can call the
police if they think that they are not safe. In that case, presumably,
the child could be taken to a place of
safety.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000482"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, but that is not what
I was asking. I was asking this: as part of solving or minimising the
problem, are the Government going to consider taking such an approach,
and why have they not already done
so?</div><a name="09021356000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000483"></a>Mr.

on it and perhaps write to the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000485"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before the hon. Lady intervenes I should say
that the question of parental controls goes rather wider than the
clause itself. The Minister said that he will respond to Mr.
Burns, and I am sure that he will circulate the letter to other
Members. The hon. Lady should therefore seek to ask him about another
matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000486"></a>Ms

power&#151;I hope nobody tells my son. If the Minister is going to
respond, perhaps he would also say how any such measure could be
enforced. It seems difficult to do.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000488"></a>Mr.

is seeking not simply the enforcement of the power, but a clarification
of the situation now. Parents do have the power of reasonable
chastisement, and I am confident that if they took reasonable steps to
prevent the situation that the hon. Gentleman talked about, no court
would prosecute them.</div>

<a name="09021356000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000493"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> In the consultation, before the Bill was in its
final form, Rob Hayward, the chief executive of the British Beer and
Pub Association, expressed a fear that a mandatory code would
disadvantage already struggling pubs. He said:</div>
<a name="09021356000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government has the weapons it needs to tackle irresponsible retailers
by rigorously enforcing the Licensing
Act&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09021356000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
existing
laws&#151;</div><a name="09021356000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
don&#146;t need new laws and regulations, just better enforcement of
existing
laws.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not go the whole way along with him on that, but the general
point is good. The vast majority of licensed premises are not a
problem. With proposed new section 19A the Minister is creating a
series of mandatory offences; and a blanket roll-out across every
licensed premises, regardless of whether the measures are needed in
nine out of 10 cases, is overkill. From working with the Local
Government Association&#151;I declare an interest as a former
councillor for 12 years &#151;I know that local authorities
would rather not see blanket requirements produced from the centre, and
would rather have the flexibility to act as they see fit. They know
best because they are on the spot, are elected by and live in the local
community, and know where the trouble spots are and what is needed to
tackle them.</div>
<a name="09021356000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already debated the concept of decentralising power on police
collaboration and direction from the centre, and the same principle
applies here. We are one of the most centralised democracies in western
Europe. If we really believe in decentralisation and localism, why not
give democratically elected local authorities more flexibility and
power to operate as they see fit in their localities?</div>
<a name="09021356000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 4
amends the Licensing Act 2003 to create the enabling power to impose
mandatory licence conditions on all existing and new pubs through
secondary legislation. Surely that is a retrograde step. Do we believe
what all three parties have been saying recently, and the Liberal
Democrats for a very long time, about decentralisation, devolution and
localism? The Licensing Act 2003 introduced greater local flexibility
and democratic influence in the licensing regime and this measure
reverses that completely.</div>
<a name="09021356000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
interesting to hear from the Minister on the mandatory code and
Conservative amendment 39. Out of interest, I should like to know how
the Government have arrived at the figure nine in this measure. Why not
five, six, a dozen, 10 or 20? It seems a strange figure to arrive at,
but that is a side issue. Local authorities know which premises cause
concern, and they can focus licence conditions on them, so why impose
restrictions and requirements on staffing and so on that might be
expensive and that will affect everyone, including many pubs that are
struggling to survive in the present climate, with taxation and the
economy?</div>
<a name="09021356000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Removing
subsection (2) would remove a swathe of over-regulation that many
well-run pubs and restaurants cannot really afford in the current
climate. For example, the Licensing Act 2003 requires premises to have
a designated premises supervisor, in the form of a personal licensee,
in place whenever alcohol is sold. The unforeseen consequence of that
blanket condition has been an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>excessive burden on community groups when organising events at which
alcohol is sold on a relatively ad hoc and irregular basis. As a
result, only 30 per cent. of such groups have carried on applying for
licences to sell alcohol at such events, and the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport has since undertaken a costly, retrospective
legislative reform order to try to undo the damage done by that
legislation. We are in danger of going down the same road and making a
similar mistake that we might want to reverse in a few years&#146;
time.</div>
<a name="09021356000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
licensing authorities are best placed to know and recognise the
diversity of premises, or groups of premises, in each community and the
problems that do or do not arise from them, depending on the area.
Surely, the Government&#146;s licensing objectives could be better
met through local conditions and flexibility for local authorities.
Where regulations need to be consistent across the country, the
Government should provide guidance to that effect, rather than having
automatic, stifling legislation and a blanket, mandatory
process.</div>
<a name="09021356000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some people
in the trade have said that the danger of letting local authorities
have greater freedom and flexibility is that there will be different
conditions in different local authority areas, but so what? We get that
in varying degrees now in different areas of local authority activity,
as there are different licensing regulations on taxis and minicabs in
different parts of the country. That is why we have democratically
elected local authorities. There are also different educational regimes
in different parts of the country, in so far as the Government allow
that, because that is what locally elected authorities want, but so
what?</div><a name="09021356000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Home Office has indicated that the mandatory conditions are likely to
be totemic and concerning activities that no premises should be
carrying out. In reality, they are likely to include many things that
the vast majority of premises simply do not do, so why take a
sledgehammer to crack a nut by imposing blanket regulations across the
board? One example that comes to mind is an &#147;all you can drink
for x pounds&#148; promotion. A mandatory list is likely to be a list
of &#147;do nots&#148; rather than &#147;dos&#148;, and staff
training would be affected when licensed premises moved from one
category to another.</div>
<a name="09021356000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elsewhere,
the Government follow the logic that mandatory conditions apply to
responsible retailers as well as to irresponsible ones, and that there
should be some variation in local conditions. In defending the new cost
of the code, the Government say in the impact assessment:</div>
<a name="09021356000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Allowing
local authorities the discretion to apply some of these conditions will
ensure that, to a large extent, these costs will be targeted at those
premises which pose a real threat to the four licensing objectives.
This is in accordance with the principals of Better
Regulation.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that logic applies to other provisions in the Bill involving local
conditions, why does it not apply to this measure? Why not allow all
nine mandatory conditions&#151;I still do not understand why it is
nine&#151;to be within the gift and control of local authorities,
which are locally elected and locally accountable, and know local
circumstances far better than any Minister sitting here in
London?</div><a name="09021356000087"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000494"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Amendment 244 would delete paragraph 2 of
schedule 4, which sets out the main thrust of the mandatory code. In
many ways I sympathise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>with the hon. Member for Chesterfield, who tabled the amendment, because
we are having to debate the issue in isolation&#151;in a
void&#151;and we are second-guessing what the proposal is actually
about. As he rightly identified, the provision in paragraph 2 is
effectively only an enabling power&#151;it enables the code to be
created and the provisions to be adopted.</div>
<a name="09021356000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
have been given a hint and some suggestions, we do not know what the
mandatory code will contain. The Government are saying,
&#147;Don&#146;t worry. We cannot really do this until the Bill has
been enacted and then we will tell you what we propose,&#148; but
that makes it extremely difficult to understand properly the likely
impact of the schedule and the operation of the system.</div>
<a name="09021356000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair to
the Minister, there have been a few signposts, directions and hints,
but we do not have the code, so we do not know whether the proposal is
appropriate. I accept that we need to face up to the concept of
irresponsible promotion. We can debate it in more detail during the
stand part debate, along with the other procedures and steps that could
be taken and the way in which they would interact with the good
practice that already exist in some parts of the country to try to
manage the night-time economy, deal with promotions and address other
factors. I have some sympathy with that approach, and I am trying to
understand the issue, but we struggle to do so without the
code.</div>
<a name="09021356000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds and
I are testing and probing. The Government tabled a series of
significant amendments last week to clarify their intention to create a
new mandatory code for licensees, so for the Committee&#146;s
convenience, I will comment first on our amendments and then on those
Government
amendments.</div><a name="09021356000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
4 provides for detailed arrangements to establish the proposed code
through the addition to the Licensing Act 2003 of new subsection (4) to
section 19 and new sections 19A and 21A. Proposed new
section 19A(1) states that the Secretary of State can impose
mandatory conditions on</div>
<a name="09021356000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all relevant
premises licences or relevant premises licences of a particular
description if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate to do so
for the promotion of the licensing
objectives.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
objectives are obviously the prevention of crime and disorder, the
protection of children from harm, the prevention of public nuisance and
public
safety.</div><a name="09021356000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
37 would replace the word &#147;appropriate&#148; with the words
&#147;necessary and proportionate&#148;. In part, this touches on
issues of consistency. Under section 18(4) of the 2003 Act, a local
authority, when considering applications for licenses, may grant the
licence, subject to such
conditions</div><a name="09021356000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
the authority considers necessary for the promotion of the licensing
objectives&#148;.</div><a name="09021356000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that defining what is necessary and appropriate might be a
slightly legalistic point, but there is a distinction to be made. What
one person considers to be appropriate might not be considered
necessary by another. I am trying to drill down on the
Government&#146;s
intentions.</div><a name="09021356000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
parliamentary counsel have opted for a different formulation in
schedule 4, presumably to grant the Secretary of State wider
discretion. I assume that that is why the different language is used
here, but it would be useful to know whether I am picking up on a point
that has not been contemplated. Will the Minister confirm 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>whether or not the use of the word &#147;appropriate&#148; is
intended to grant the Secretary of State a much wider discretion on the
setting of conditions than would otherwise be available to local
authorities through the 2003 Act&#146;s provisions? If that is the
case, it seems somewhat odd. Can the Minister explain the rationale? In
the light of that discretion, amendment 38 would make it clear that the
provision could not be used to raise, through secondary legislation,
the statutory age at which alcohol could be
purchased.</div><a name="09021356000433"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="09021356000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, we do not know what the mandatory code looks like, or what it
may look like in the future. I am sure that the intention is not to put
through something that could be considered a significant change to the
law. We could debate at length, although not in this sitting, what the
appropriate age might be, but it ought to be set out in primary
legislation for the whole House to debate. It should not, in essence,
be implied through a licensing condition so that the Government could
seek to impose through the mandatory code a requirement that the age
limit be higher than 18 as a term of the licence. In certain local
circumstances, there might be individual factors for a local authority
to consider within the context of a licensing review, such as whether
there has been disorder. Although that could be appropriate
individually, a blanket approach would not be right. Such a thing
should be introduced through primary legislation to enable proper
debate and scrutiny. The amendment would preserve that position and
clarify what the situation ought to
be.</div><a name="09021356000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we have heard, proposed new section 19A(2) of the 2003 Act rather
strangely provides that the maximum number of mandatory conditions in
effect at any one time should not exceed nine&#151;nine is the magic
number, for some reason. The hon. Member for Chesterfield was curious
about how that number had been alighted upon. My best guess&#151;I am
sure that the Minister will be able to give us a definitive
answer&#151;is that it relates to the alcohol social responsibility
principles set out in the youth alcohol action plan, which number nine
in total. Again, we do not know how that number was arrived at. It was
slightly odd that the Government sought to make that requirement, even
though the social responsibility principles talk about
promoting</div><a name="09021356000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;responsible
drinking and the &#145;Sensible Drinking Message&#146;...To
avoid any actions that encourage or condone illegal, irresponsible or
immoderate drinking such as drunkenness, drink driving or drinking in
inappropriate
circumstances&#148;</div><a name="09021356000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
addition to various other
things.</div><a name="09021356000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
aspects of that principle are understood and not contentious. I may
have the wrong end of the stick, because we are slightly bemused as to
how the number nine was arrived at, but perhaps the Minister can
indicate why that particular aspect has been fastened upon. Does it
relate to the alcohol social responsibility principles, or does it
touch on something completely different? The Minister might be trying
to reassure the industry that there would not be a huge shopping list
of issues&#151;I have some sympathy with that&#151;but that there
would be a focus on a small number of things. The Minister might be
giving assurance to local authorities given that, as we have heard,
almost all their discretion could be taken away in one sweep&#151;if
that is the case, why bother having local authorities at all? If all
the mandatory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>conditions are set out by the Secretary of State from the centre, it
undermines the ability of local authorities to judge what is
appropriate for their particular
area.</div><a name="09021356000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
were told at the outset that the approach on licensing was about
letting local communities decide which licences should be granted in
their area and on what terms. I have concerns about rowing back from
that, because circumstances&#151;we have confronted them&#151;where
the national guidance did not necessarily give local authorities the
discretion that they thought that they had meant restrictions on things
such as saturation and various other aspects that needed to be
addressed locally. Those issues were quite problematic when the
legislation was introduced, because local authorities felt that their
hands were tied, despite some of the promises made about the intention
behind the Act in the first place. That is why what is hidden in the
detail&#151;the statutory instruments or the guidance&#151;is quite
important for how the provisions will
operate.</div><a name="09021356000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to understand the Government&#146;s approach to ensure that the
Bill does not give some sort of carte blanche discretion to license
from the centre. To be fair, from what the Government have said, that
is not the intention. The question is not about the intention now, but
that in the future, in x years&#146; time, once the powers have been
granted. They appear to give wide-ranging discretion to make changes or
proposals that could erode a lot of what was originally set out in the
2003 Act. Some aspects of the agenda seek, understandably, to ensure
that local communities have the powers they need to control excessive
consumption of alcohol and to regulate licensed premises in their
area.</div>
<a name="09021356000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 40
would set out some statutory basis for consultation. Because everything
is left somewhat up in the air, we are almost reliant on statutory
instrument for a definition. The schedule seems to suggest that the
issue of how this would operate in practice would be addressed and the
guidance would come through in secondary legislation.</div>
<a name="09021356000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that the Bill states the need for consultation on this matter
with local authorities, local communities and bodies that might be
affected. I know that a consultation on the mandatory code is ongoing,
although we do not know what it looks like. However, for purposes of
reassurance, it is necessary to have a statement in the Bill requiring
consultation, instead of a reliance on secondary legislation.</div>
<a name="09021356000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
ensure that there are rights of appeal, challenge and consideration. If
the Secretary of State came up with a proposal that was wholly
unreasonable, irrational and disproportionate, and somebody had an
issue with something in the mandatory code, I assume that the only
redress would be judicial review. Perhaps the Minister can confirm
whether that is the intention, or whether there will be a way of
ensuring the right to challenge or appeal through the process outlined
in the Bill. We need some way of considering the Government&#146;s
approach to the mandatory code. That approach might be laudable. It
might deal with some of the appalling promotions that we have seen,
which are designed for and targeted at binge drinkers and young people
in particular. There is merit in addressing marketing, but I am trying
to understand better the structure and intention of the mandatory code
in isolation. We must ensure that it does not erode the important local
discretion that we need for communities properly to address problems of
alcohol, alcohol-related crime and
licensing.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000495"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I shall reply to some of those points and then
explain why we feel unable to accept the amendments. The first issue
raised by the hon. Member for Chesterfield goes to the heart of the
debate: why have a mandatory code and not just a local code? I hope
that he accepts that there is almost universal concern about some of
these issues in every part of the country. It would not necessarily be
appropriate to leave it up to local licensing authorities to ensure
that that concern is addressed in their own areas. We could end up with
a postcode lottery of conditions that a sufficient number of people
felt were important.</div>
<a name="09021356000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There were
2,000 responses to the Department of Health consultation, 90 per cent.
of which were in favour of a mandatory code. There is common ground
across the country and across groups. Certainly, with the support of
the Association of Chief Police Officers and Alcohol Concern, there is
enough anxiety around issues such as &#147;Drink as much as you can
for &#163;10&#148;, to warrant the application of the code across
the whole country. That does not mean that we ignore local
considerations, which is why there will be conditions that can be
applied locally as well as mandatory conditions.</div>
<a name="09021356000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Chesterfield and for Hornchurch both asked why there were
nine conditions. That is a good question&#151;I asked it
myself&#151;but it has nothing to do with the reference made by the
hon. Member for Hornchurch to the youth plan, and much more to do with
what he called the &#147;huge shopping list&#148; in our desire to
be reasonable. He asked why not have five or 20 conditions. There will
be nine because five would probably be too few and 20 would be too
many. That is not a scientific answer, but I am saying that we are
trying to be proportionate and to ensure that there are sufficient
conditions, while leaving headroom for a future Home Secretary who
might, with public support, bring forward further proposals. The number
nine has not simply been plucked from the air. The other effect of
having that number in the Bill is that it puts a statutory limit on
mandatory sanctions so that they are limited as well as being
imposed.</div>
<a name="09021356000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000496"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> If the Department has already done enough work to
say that nine will be a reasonable figure giving some headroom for
further expansion, it must have quite a clear idea about what people
are suggesting and what it is likely to reject and accept. It is a
shame that the Department has not published some of its thinking
because, as is so often the case, we will not see much of the detail,
which is the crucial part, until the Bill is passed. The detail then
comes out in statutory instruments and all sorts of other backstairs
methods that we cannot really discuss or
reject.</div>
<a name="09021356000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000497"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I shall return to that point shortly. The hon.
Gentleman talked about expensive conditions. I assure him that we have
gone to great lengths to ensure that the kind of burdens that the
industry has said&#151;quite rightly&#151;that it is most concerned
about are not in the mandatory conditions. I will come back to what
might and might not be in there. The hon. Gentleman will see from
Government amendments that defining locality better and being able to
target is an important part of proportionality.</div>
<a name="09021356000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard
about the cost of regulations, and it was rightly pointed out that it
would be quite possible that many, if not all, of these mandatory
regulations will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>&#147;don&#146;t dos&#148;. Most of the &#147;don&#146;t
dos&#148; that I can think of will not cost the industry, or at least
they will not cost the legitimate side of the industry. For example, if
&#147;Drink as much as you want for &#163;10&#148;, the purpose
of which is to get people drunk, was not allowed, and if women were not
allowed into pubs for free to attract men in to drink more, I fail to
see how that would be an undue burden and where the financial cost
would be. We will have to wait to see what the code looks like, but
that is the principle upon which we are moving.</div>
<a name="09021356000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman referred to the number of pubs that had closed. I raised
that point during the evidence sessions. I agree that we have to be
very careful about burdens, but the evidence sessions showed that there
was a whole range of reasons why pubs closed, not least the social
changes that are taking place. I am trying to think of the last time
that I was in a pub. It is probably easier for MPs not go to into pubs
because we have work to do when we go in there&#151;I do not mean bar
work. There have been significant social changes, so while we need to
be wary of burdens, we also need to put that into context. We will be
providing guidance as part of the ongoing process, and there will be a
mixture of national and local means through which to address the local
issues that the hon. Gentleman is talking
about.</div><a name="09021356000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are working hard with a range of people about what should be in the
mandatory code. I do not want to read everyone into the record, but we
are talking&#151;and have talked&#151;to enforcement and local
government agencies, the on-trade and off-trade, the third and health
sectors, the Tourism Alliance, and the civic trust. We are also talking
to the alcohol industry. The list is long, and I am happy to put it in
writing for members of the Committee, or to put it in the Library, so
that people can see who we have been talking
to.</div>
<a name="09021356000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000498"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Is my hon. Friend talking to any community group
organisations? The public who have to put up with the menace of
alcohol-related crime are the people who, above all, want to see
proportionate measures to manage it. That is not about the third
sector, but specifically about tenants, residents, community groups and
suchlike. It is not about local authorities either; it is about local
people.</div><a name="09021356000434"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="09021356000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000499"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I understand the point well. We are consulting
those groups about what might go into the code. The Home Secretary has
made it clear that we shall have the most extensive consultation
process possible, so we are looking at what further measures we can
take. I am not willing to say to my hon. Friend the Member for
Northampton, North that that process will be in a particular form, of a
particular length on a particular day because issues will depend not
only on our progress in Committee, but the progress of the Bill. We are
keen for the code to be in place when the Bill receives Royal Assent.
Our ambition in respect of consultation will be shaped to some extent
by what progress has been
made.</div><a name="09021356000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and
Policing referred on Second Reading to extensive consultation. No one
can accuse us of having been shy in that regard. We have talked to a
lot of people and have taken many views into consideration. If my hon.
Friend the Member for Northampton, North is saying that we need to go
wider, I will certainly bear that in mind. I am not closing my door to
that proposal.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div><a name="09021356000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the draft
code is in place, I will be happy to share it with the Committee and I
give a commitment  to do that as soon as possible. The hon.
Member for Hornchurch talked about saying something about it before the
Bill is enacted, and it is certainly my intention to do that. As he
knows, however, the schedule is an enabling measure because the
mandatory code will be enacted through a statutory instrument. I am not
saying that there are, but if there were nine elements to the code we
could enact it through nine statutory instruments&#151;if we wanted
to&#151;or through one statutory instrument and treat it as a basket
of measures. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Whips and Ministers
are terrified at that prospect, but as members of the Committee know,
statutory instruments cannot be amended. We therefore want to consult
widely and have as much sign-up to the measure as possible, which
includes considering how much the parliamentary process reflects it. I
am happy to put the list of consultees in writing and to share the
draft code with members of the
Committee.</div><a name="09021356000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to explain some of our problems with specific amendments.
Amendment 37 tabled by the hon. Member for Hornchurch concerns
&#147;appropriate&#148; versus &#147;necessary and
proportionate&#148;. Any Government action must be necessary and
proportionate, and we believe that &#147;appropriate&#148; captures
that definition sufficiently. We are looking especially at the
targeting of the measures. I understand the mandatory code argument
about all pubs, but we must remember that a series of other measures
can be applied locally to particular pubs. We are conscious of that,
and believe that targeting is part of the appropriateness of such
matters.</div><a name="09021356000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
licence could constitute a possession under article 1 of
protocol 1 of the European convention on human rights, and we accept
that human rights may be in play. The Secretary of State, as a public
authority, is required to act compatibly with the rights of the
convention and, in practice, conditions must be necessary and
proportionate. When talking to amendment 38, the hon. Member for
Hornchurch referred to the legal age for purchasing alcohol in light of
the recent discussions in Scotland. I wish to place it on the record
that we do not believe that that would be an appropriate way to deal
with the matter. I agree entirely with him that such matters should be
dealt with under primary legislation, if we decided to go down that
route. However, it is entirely inappropriate that a young man or woman
can fight for their country in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet not be able to
buy a pint of beer or a bottle of wine to celebrate their being back
home with their family, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured
by the fact that we have no plans to increase or decrease the age at
which alcohol can be
purchased.</div><a name="09021356000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
40 would introduce a statutory requirement to consult before
introducing or changing the mandatory licensing conditions. I have
already talked about consultation, but the effect of that proposal
would be that whenever a condition was changed, there would have to be
a costly and lengthy consultation process. It would create an
unnecessary situation, and I hope that it will not be pressed to a
Division.</div><a name="09021356000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
244, which was moved by the hon. Member for Chesterfield, would prevent
the Secretary of State from imposing any national mandatory licensing
conditions on all licensed premises. It would, however, still
allow  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>mandatory licensing conditions to be imposed on premises that hold a
club premises certificate, so even if we went down that route, that
would not be a suitable
measure.</div><a name="09021356000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that there is strong and widespread public support for a
mandatory code. I have also given the Committee undertakings on sharing
information and on consulting as widely as possible, so, in the spirit
in which those undertakings were offered, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09021356000122"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000503"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I want to speak to Government amendments 131 and
137 first. The Bill as drafted would require a licensing authority to
define an area that is experiencing levels of alcohol-related crime and
disorder. The Bill can also be read as requiring general licensing
conditions to be applied to all premises, whether they are contributing
to the problem or not, in such an area. That was not our intention when
preparing the
Bill.</div><a name="09021356000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 131 therefore ensures that, when applying general licensing
conditions to licensed premises, a licensing authority no longer needs
to define a locality. That will allow the authority to impose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>licensing conditions on two or more premises that are contributing to
alcohol-related harm. By allowing licensing authorities to impose
conditions on groups of premises, the amendment will make it easier for
the authorities to deal with the problems that we see in town centres
up and down the country every weekend. Such problems are not caused by
single-problem premises, but are the cumulative result of several
premises contributing to alcohol-related crime and disorder. While the
Licensing Act 2003 deals effectively with individual premises, it can
be difficult to take action against several premises because it is much
harder to demonstrate which ones specifically contribute to a
particular
problem.</div><a name="09021356000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are committed to ensuring that the action taken to tackle
alcohol-related crime and disorder must be proportionate and targeted
at businesses that sell alcohol irresponsibly. We recognise that the
majority of businesses do sell alcohol responsibly, and we certainly do
not want to impose unfair burdens upon them, particularly in the
difficult economic
climate.</div><a name="09021356000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000504"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Will my hon. Friend explain what he means by
&#147;responsible&#148;? Some of the public will have a different
opinion on what he regards as the responsible or irresponsible selling
of
alcohol.</div><a name="09021356000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000505"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That is a wide-ranging area of discussion. By
&#147;responsible,&#148; I am certainly referring to pubs and clubs
that do not fall foul of the legislation or the conditions of the
licensing committee. Of course, residents will always be concerned,
especially when they live near pubs, but a large number of pubs and
clubs do run respectable establishments. They do take precautions in
order not to add to difficulties and dangers in either their
establishment or their locality. I am not sure that I share my hon.
Friend&#146;s pessimism or, perhaps, scepticism about the majority of
pubs and clubs. We need to ensure that, where we need to take further
action and further conditions need to be applied to those pubs that are
not respectable, the measures that we take are targeted and
proportionate.</div><a name="09021356000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a licensing authority wants to impose general licensing conditions, the
Bill requires that it first identify a locality. Once a licensing
authority has defined a locality, the Bill could be read as requiring
it to impose general licensing conditions on every licensed premises
within that locality, irrespective of whether each individual premises
was contributing to the
problem.</div><a name="09021356000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
42, tabled by my hon. Friend, would make that requirement even more
explicit. Clearly, that could result in some businesses having
disproportionate and, frankly, unfair burdens imposed on them just
because they happen to be in an area that has experienced problems. The
Government amendment allows the licensing authority to impose general
licensing conditions on particular licensed premises, which are thought
to be contributing to those
problems.</div><a name="09021356000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000506"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister made an interesting point,
saying that it would be unfair to impose those conditions on other
licensees in the area. Does that mean that the Government are now in
full retreat over their alcohol disorder zones, because that was
precisely what that regulation was intended to
do?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div><a name="09021356000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000507"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> No, we are not in full retreat at all. Guidance
was issued, as the hon. Gentleman knows, at the end of last year in
order to make it easier for local authorities to bring forward
proposals for alcohol disorder zones. He will know that they were
always intended as a tool of last resort and there are many other
measures that can be applied locally.</div>
<a name="09021356000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me tell
him a difference between alcohol disorder zones and what we are
proposing here. He will know that one of the reasons for setting up
alcohol disorder zones was to allow a levy to be applied on licensed
premises&#151;all licensed premises&#151;to go towards the cost of
policing in an area where there was alcohol disorder. I am not sure
whether he is suggesting that that is a better way of approaching the
problem than the one that we are bringing forward now, because we would
share his scepticism of that. A key difference is about raising money
for enforcement. This is a much more targeted approach, but that does
not mean that if a licensing authority went down that particular route
and was unable to tackle a problem, they could not introduce an alcohol
disorder zone. We would welcome local authorities bringing forward such
proposals if they felt that it was
necessary.</div><a name="09021356000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the amendment that we are proposing removes annoyance as a
reason for imposing general licensing conditions on licensed premises.
That is because annoyance is not defined in the Licensing Act and is
not one of the four licensing objectives. Removing it therefore removes
any possibility of potential confusion with nuisance. Licensing
authorities can therefore impose general licensing conditions on a
group of premises if there is an alcohol-related nuisance or disorder.
Government amendment 137 is identical to Government amendment 131,
except that it allows licensing authorities to impose general licensing
conditions on just those particular club premises&#151;for example, a
members&#146; club that might be contributing to the
problem&#151;rather than a blanket provision for all clubs in a
locality, and I invite hon. Members to accept both of those
amendments.</div><a name="09021356000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 130, 132, 133, 135, 142, 143 and 144, are consequential
amendments as a result of Government amendment 131, which removes the
reference to locality. If Government amendment 131 is accepted, the
licensing authority would no longer need to define a locality. Again, I
invite hon. Members to accept the
amendments.</div>
<a name="09021356000435"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09021356000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 134 is a technical amendment to remove what is clearly an
unnecessary subsection from the Bill. Under section 182 of the
Licensing Act 2003, the Secretary of State must issue guidance to
licensing authorities and under section 4 of that Act, licensing
authorities must have regard to that guidance when carrying out all of
their licensing functions. The Bill amends the Licensing Act so that
that requirement will automatically extend to the new powers to impose
general licensing conditions on a group of premises. The Bill inserts
into the Licensing Act new section 21A(4), which states
that</div><a name="09021356000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;licensing
authorities must have regard to any
guidance&#148;</div><a name="09021356000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">when
imposing general licensing conditions on licensed premises. Clearly,
that section is unnecessary and the amendment will remove it to prevent
any confusion.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div><a name="09021356000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 140 is identical to amendment 134, except that it removes new
section 74A(4), which relates to club premises, rather than licensed
premises. Amendments 136, 138, 139, 141, 146, 147 and 149 are
consequential amendments as a result of amendment 137 to remove
references to locality and, again, if amendment 137 is accepted, the
licensing authority will no longer need to define a
locality.</div><a name="09021356000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 145 will remove the provision requiring licensing premises to
display on the premises a list of all mandatory and general conditions
imposed upon them. Instead, it will require licensees to keep a list of
those conditions on the premises and to make the list available to the
police and other authorities. When inspecting premises, it is essential
that the police and local authorities can find out exactly what
licensing conditions a premises has to comply with in order to enforce
them effectively. Currently, the Licensing Act requires licensees to
keep a certified copy of their licence on the premises and to allow the
authorities to view it if they so wish.</div>
<a name="09021356000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also
requires licensees to display a list of all mandatory and generally
locally applied conditions that have been imposed upon them. However,
licensees currently have to display only a summary of their licence,
which does not include any conditions. The requirement to do so could
impose an additional burden on some licensees. The amendment removes
that requirement and therefore removes the potential burden. As I have
mentioned, it is important that local authorities can check easily what
the licensing conditions are and therefore the amendment requires the
licensee to keep a list of the mandatory and general licensing
conditions. Again, amendment 148 is identical to amendment 145 except
that it relates to club premises certificates. With that, I invite hon.
Members to accept these
conditions.</div><a name="09021356000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000508"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for some of the
Minister&#146;s explanation of the further changes being proposed
through the amendments to the provisions of schedule 4. Certainly, the
modification to existing licences rather than particular localities
implies that there might be a widening of the scope, but from what the
Minister has said, I think he is intending to narrow down the
scope&#151;particularly through Government amendment 131, which we
will come on to&#151;in terms of those licensed premises that might
be contributing specifically to problems of disorder.</div>
<a name="09021356000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, I
heard what the Minister said about the deletion of the word
&#147;annoyance&#148; from the list of factors in respect of which
the local authority can trigger the application of one of the localised
conditions from the Secretary of State&#146;s approved list. However,
as the Minister has explained, Government amendment 131 in essence
allows a local authority to impose one of those blessed conditions on
to two or more existing licences if certain factors have been
triggered&#151;in other words, nuisance or disorder is the
fundamental aspect. The condition is appropriate for the purposes of
mitigating or preventing that nuisance from taking
place.</div><a name="09021356000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue about which I am still not entirely sure is the relationship
between the requirements that could be imposed through the localised
conditions and the review process itself. Normally, if the local
authority has to demonstrate that there has been a nuisance to members
of the public in relation to an individual licence, there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>would have to be a hearing, and the evidence would be presented by the
police or the local authority&#151;as the case may be&#151;to
justify that the licence should be reviewed and that potentially
additional conditions be imposed or certain other changes be made in
respect of that already-granted
licence.</div><a name="09021356000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister envisage, given this requirement to show that there has
been nuisance to the public, that there would be some form of hearing
in respect of that evidence? Or would it be accepted on the nod that
this nuisance had occurred? It seems to take a different approach from
that of the licence review&#151;which I accept is only about
individual licences&#151;but equally it seems there is some overlap
in that there could be conditions imposed and a licence review. Does
the Minister consider that is appropriate, given that they touch upon
similar themes and issues? He has made the point that it might be
difficult to say whether disorder relates to particular licensed
premises. Government amendment 131 states that the relevant activities
need to have taken place</div>
<a name="09021356000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on or near the
premises&#148;.</div><a name="09021356000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not necessarily mean that they have been caused by those premises.
He will be aware of the relationship between on-sales and off-sales,
with pre-loading before people go out, consumption of alcohol while
they are out and post-loading when they get home. It is a complicated
picture to work out where the responsibility lies. This was a topic of
debate during consideration of the original construction of alcohol
disorder zones. I welcome the fact that the Government&#146;s
amendments have rowed back from the alcohol disorder zone type of
structure, which on its original drafting this schedule strongly
echoed. I tabled amendment 42, not because I wanted to put all in
there, but as a probing amendment, to clarify whether this was an
alcohol disorder zone by another name. Amendment 44 was tabled on the
basis that conditions should not impose a requirement of a specific
financial payment. If local authorities wanted to go down that route
the ADZ approach would be the way to do it, albeit that no local
authority has in fact applied for an ADZ. I have described the ADZ as a
policy disaster zone because of the complexity and nature of the issue
and the fact that one does not know how to charge or cost it or which
licensed premises would be caught by the ADZ regime. That is one for
another day when a local authority does decide to dip its toe in the
water and embark on an ADZ approach.</div>
<a name="09021356000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister also clarify, even in that context, whether he considers this
to be mutually exclusive of an ADZ application? When a nuisance or
disorder has been experienced, could these additional conditions be
levied as well an alcohol disorder zone applied for? In other words,
there could be financial payment under an ADZ process plus additional
conditions on certain licences under the localised mandatory conditions
that could be imposed on two or more licences. It does not seem to
suggest that they are mutually exclusive so I am assuming that one
could go down that potentially triple-track approach of review,
mandatory conditions and an ADZ. I am assuming that is the process and
is in the toolbox for local authorities potentially to adapt and take.
It would be useful to have clarification. The point of amendment 44 is
important to understand properly&#151;
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>whether financial payment could be obliged in pursuant to this. That
would be inappropriate. If a financial condition is to be imposed it
should be through an ADZ approach. This localised condition approach
should not be seen as a back-door way of imposing additional licence
fees.</div>
<a name="09021356000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other,
more general, point about the principle of the issue is how the
arrangement might hamper the ability of local authorities to take a
licence review approach, anyway. If the conditions are designed to
address nuisance and disorder, which is one of the licensing principles
and therefore relevant if a local authority decides to take a licensing
review approach, why should the Secretary of State restrict and
prescribe certain conditions when the authority sets a licence if they
are necessary and appropriate to address nuisance and disorder? It will
be a fetter on some of the conditions that the authority might
otherwise be able to apply through a licence review if, at that stage,
someone says, &#147;This condition that a local authority is trying
to invoke on a licence review is unreasonable and unnecessary, because
it is not within the mandatory or prescribed list of conditions that
the Secretary of State has imposed from the centre.&#148;</div>
<a name="09021356000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned about the relationship between the two regimes, and anxious
that there are no unintended consequences of the Government&#146;s
proposals to introduce mandatory conditions that local authorities may
impose when nuisance and public disorder has been triggered. I
recognise some of the issues that the Minister seeks to address, but
the situation may be more complicated than it
appears.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000509"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Amendment 245 would tackle the same issue to which
the hon. Member for Hornchurch just referred: permitted conditions and
the restrictions that they impose on the flexibility&#151;the
democratic, local accountability&#151;of a local authority. Why
should the Bill state that the only conditions applicable are those
permitted by the Government in London, rather than those that the local
authority believes to be appropriate? In the vast majority of cases,
local licensing authorities will work from the same hymn sheet, from
good practice nationally and from guidelines produced by the
Government; but local circumstances and views could well differ. By
removing &#147;permitted,&#148; the amendment would give local
authorities the flexibility to represent their communities and to do
what they think is best for their local
areas.</div>
<a name="09021356000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000510"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The hon. Member for Hornchurch asked how the
proposals would fit with alcohol disorder zones, and, as I tried to
point out earlier, they are significantly different from those zones.
We do not rule out the possibility of an authority considering both
measures, but I cannot understand why they would want to do so. They
will want to choose one or the other or, indeed, one of the other
powers that are available to target the problem. Alcohol disorder zones
apply to a whole area, but that goes against the principle that we set
out in the Government amendments that would target particular premises
in a particular area by redefining locality. One of the main reasons to
set up alcohol disorder zones is to raise money for enforcement in that
area, and the Government do not believe that general licensing
conditions should be a way of raising money 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>in an area, so we are talking about two different situations. I should
be surprised if anyone found a way or, indeed, a reason for introducing
alcohol disorder zones along with the measures under
discussion.</div>
<a name="09021356000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also raised the question of evidence of nuisance. Let me be
honest with him: we will introduce in secondary legislation proposals
setting out the process to which he referred, and we will consult on
it. But, in any regard, a licensing authority would have to be
convinced of the evidence that was put before it&#151;whether it
would allow the legislation to be enacted in that way; and we have
already said that there will be an appeals procedure, so if the
evidence does not exist it will become abundantly clear. Again, the
procedure will be set out in legislation, and we are working on
it.</div>
<a name="09021356000404"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000511"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I accept what the Minister is saying about
working through the detail, and I appreciate that his views may not be
finalised, but would he envisage that in circumstances in which certain
conditions would be imposed through this route, the matter would be
referred to, for example, the licensing panel of the local authority?
It would normally decide on licences, reviews and conditions, and it
would be for it to judge, on the basis of evidence provided and any
other representations, whether the imposition of such conditions would
be
appropriate.</div><a name="09021356000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000512"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Those are precisely the issues that we will be
considering, because we want the legislation to be used properly and
effectively. I do not have answers to those questions for the hon.
Gentleman today, but I assure him that we are looking at them and want
to bring forward measures as soon as
possible.</div><a name="09021356000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have dealt with amendment 44, which concerns financial
payments, by saying that this is not a revenue-generating measure. The
hon. Member for Chesterfield spoke about the balance between the local
and what looks like imposition from the centre. Yes, individual town
centres may have particular premises that are causing problems, but we
believe that there can be a cumulative effect in an area, and there is
also concern across the whole country about such premises and town
centres.</div><a name="09021356000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not unusual for particular towns to have these problems, so it is
important that we allow premises and groups of premises to be targeted,
but it is also important that we do not get variation across the
country. That would be the danger if we left this purely to
localities.</div><a name="09021356000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are 377 licensing authorities. They operate significantly differently
and allow local application, but that can be a weakness when tackling
the issue across the country as a whole. There is a trade-off between
the locality and what we want to achieve across the country, which is
at the heart of the
argument.</div><a name="09021356000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not allowing licensing authorities to have an entirely free hand in
deciding which conditions they may impose on a group of premises.
Instead, they should choose from a nationally set list which will focus
on certain activities and help licensing authorities deal in a more
consistent way than at present with the cumulative effect of a number
of premises contributing to
harm.</div><a name="09021356000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is a particular problem in an area that would benefit from a
licensing condition that is not on the list that the Secretary of State
prescribes, the licensing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>authority can impose a condition on an individual premises under
existing powers in the Licensing Act
2003.</div><a name="09021356000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
ensure that the licensing conditions that we allow licensing
authorities to use will be effective in dealing with groups of
premises, we are currently consulting with a wide range of stakeholders
and will conduct a wider consultation later this year. I hope that in
those brief and rushed remarks I have addressed the key parts of the
amendments.</div><a name="09021356000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000513"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I assumed that it would be possible for a
condition to be imposed on either a shop or a shopping centre, for
example, bearing in mind that alcohol-related disorders do not have to
occur in a big area. There can be a big nuisance in a small area, even
a little shopping centre on an estate that has only a betting shop, an
off-licence, a post office&#151;well, no longer&#151;and a
newsagent.</div><a name="09021356000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
a local authority be able to use the kind of powers that are set out
here to impose conditions on that type of off-licence or on-licence to
deal with alcohol-related
disorders?</div><a name="09021356000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000514"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> My understanding is that they can already use
the 2003 Act to deal with one premises. We need to introduce these
measures to deal with groups of premises. Local authorities will be
able to identify a group of premises&#151;they might not be next to
each other but in different parts of a locality, and contributing to a
perceived problem in the area&#151;and impose a condition on them.
Currently, they are unable to impose a condition on a group basis under
the
Act.</div><a name="09021356000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000516"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Looking at the schedule in the
round&#151;the desire to move to a mandatory condition requirement,
and the more localised conditions&#151;the main issue that it seeks
to address is irresponsible drinking linked to irresponsible promotions
and certain other activities. I sympathise with the Government on the
need to address that issue, but the question is whether these
provisions are the most appropriate way to do that, and what
alternatives the Government explored before deciding on this route.
Before I get into that, I am interested to know how the proposals will
interlink and interrelate with the interesting partnership-based
approaches taking place around the
country.</div><a name="09021356000436"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="09021356000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will draw on two models that are being developed, which seem to be
making some ground and are being effective in the communities where
they are operating. They are dealing with irresponsible drinking and
cutting sales to those under age, and certainly one of them is
addressing the longer-term social and educational issues. The first is
the community alcohol project, which I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>sure the Minister knows. It was first piloted in St. Neots and is now
being piloted in other parts of the country, around Cambridgeshire and
elsewhere. It draws together trading standards, the police, the
education sector, and the on and off-trade to ensure consistent
messages for young people, and consistent enforcement and a greater
understanding of how the law should
operate.</div><a name="09021356000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second model being put forward on a partnership or voluntary basis is
the use of business improvement districts in areas with many pubs,
clubs and off-licences&#151;night-time economy&#151;Broad street in
Birmingham, for example. I went to Kingston the other day to see the
BID in operation there. That model is very much part of trying to draw
together the responsible retailers&#151;if I can put it like
that&#151;and using them to put greater pressure on those that do not
act responsibly. It is not being developed in a rigid, regulatory
framework, but it is being used constructively. Some of the funding
that is being raised through the BID structure is being invested in
safety and the night-time economy&#151;wardens, for
example.</div><a name="09021356000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested to hear what the Minister thinks about his proposed
provisions, in the context of that very good work and those very good
ideas that are being developed around the country. I am concerned that
a rigid approach to licensing conditions could upset or undo some of
the good practice in certain parts of the country&#151;I accept that
some of my examples are localised. I am concerned that such an approach
could undermine some of the good partnership working that has been
established and which certainly appears from initial evidence to be
making a difference by making some of those communities safer. It is
also addressing responsibility among retailers and getting to young
people and making them appreciate the volume of alcohol that they are
consuming and starting to deal with some of the other issues that we
touched on in previous debates. It would certainly be a retrograde step
if those initiatives and approaches were dissipated as a result of the
proposed change.</div>
<a name="09021356000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">But why have
a mandatory code? The Minister will be aware that an alternative
proposal was set out which was the concept of co-regulation. In other
words, there would be a code of practice which off-licences and
on-licence holders would abide by and which would effectively become
part of the licence conditions. The licence conditions would state that
a licensee would undertake to abide by the terms of that code drawn up
between the industry and Government. It is a variant of what is
proposed here, but it certainly appears to give greater flexibility and
that stronger partnership working between business, Government and
local authorities by an alternative means.</div>
<a name="09021356000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because it is
not statutory, such a code has certain flexibilities of modification
and involvement. Once we have certain statutory requirements in place
they are set in stone: we have to come back with statutory instruments
and changing it becomes quite formalistic. There are arguments about
whether that is appropriate, but it is an alternative model that has
been suggested as a means of setting the bar and the standards. Equally
it would ensure that compliance is operated and maintained by local
authorities, for example by way of licence review if the conditions or
the relevant code of practice or code of conduct are not complied
with.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div><a name="09021356000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sense of
flexibility is what one gets as a driving force behind the proposals
before us today. The regulatory impact assessment states on page
10:</div><a name="09021356000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
advantage of introducing a code of practice through this mechanism
rather than as a standalone Act of Parliament is
flexibility.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well,
if flexibility is one of the driving forces behind one of the proposals
in the schedule, it would be interesting to hear why the Government
decided to reject the concept of co-regulation. It could be structured
in a way to provide flexibility, while setting appropriate standards
for the way that alcohol is marketed and promoted and the approach
taken by
licensees.</div><a name="09021356000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other issue that I am still not certain about is why the conditions the
Government are suggesting, and the conditions that the regulatory
impact assessment seems to suggest may be introduced, are so focused on
the on-trade. It is all about the size of glasses that may be used in a
pub or a club. The provisions seem to be about the control of an
on-licence, but as we recognised, many of the problems also come from
the off-trade and the volume of alcohol that may be sold at one
particular time or how it is marketed. When we say that licensees will
comply with the terms of these conditions, is a balance being thought
through about the conditions that should apply to off-licences as well
as to on-licences?</div>
<a name="09021356000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
recognise that the problems of alcohol-related disorder and alcohol
consumption are part of a more complex picture. We have this increasing
mix of alcohol consumed at home and alcohol consumed on licensed
premises such as a pub or a club. A lot of alcohol may be consumed even
before people reach the pub&#151;the concept of pre-loading, and
increasingly post-loading when they get home. The Minister needs to be
cognisant of the fact that this is not simply about licensed premises
such as pubs and clubs. That may be where some of the problems exhibit
themselves, but the problems may be a consequence of indirect
activities linked to the off-trade rather than specifically the
on-trade. How does he envisage that this code of practice will operate
to ensure that an appropriate balance is
struck?</div>
<a name="09021356000437"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="09021356000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
there has been some suggestion&#151;I hinted at this during the
evidence session when I put a question to the Minister&#151;regarding
what I think are good schemes: the Think 21 and, increasingly, the
Think 25 that the industry are now adopting. To ensure compliance on
under-age sales, businesses are saying that if someone looked younger
than a certain age, that person would need to provide some sort of
identification to assure that he or she was indeed over 18. That has
been developed by the industry, and is being rolled out more widely. I
support its adoption because it provides certain means, a safety net,
of ensuring that the 18 age requirement is met.</div>
<a name="09021356000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister was tempted to mandate a condition on the industry to adopt a
Think 25 or Think 21 strategy, it would probably be incumbent on
trading standards departments to send people around who are 21 or
20&#151;or look 20&#151;to test that that approach is being taken.
If he did that, he would almost be indirectly setting a further age
verification requirement by the back door, so that if a business sold
alcohol to somebody who was over the statutory age of 18, but looked
under 21 or 25, it would be effectively breaking the law, the licensing
conditions and everything that go with it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div><a name="09021356000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">That approach
had been developed as a way of ensuring compliance with the 18 age
requirement. By seeking to set the approach as a condition, there is
more to it than appears at face value: whether mandating that age is
setting a further regulatory hurdle that will have to be tested and
complied with, and whether that is intended by virtue of putting good
practice as best practice. Mandating the approach as a condition would
bring some potential issues and
problems.</div><a name="09021356000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
we thinking of just micro-managing the size of glasses? Is that what it
is all about? One gets a sense that that is the case when looking at
the regulatory impact assessment. I am not sure about the extent to
which a mandatory code would represent an intention to try to
micro-manage operations in that way, and I am interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s view on that
issue.</div><a name="09021356000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
there is the issue of the application to licensees more generally. One
concern that the Mayor of London has put forward in his briefing note
for the clause is that</div>
<a name="09021356000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the mandatory
conditions will impose blanket regulations across the board, which will
not take account of local conditions. Mandatory conditions (without
exemption) that apply to village halls, or sports and members clubs
could impose a significant burden on
them.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has introduced certain changes in other parts of the Bill to
deal with private premises, as they may be described, but the possible
unintended consequence of that is that he might set additional high
hurdles or restrictions on those sorts of outlets that may not be
appropriate. While I note that he is trying to reserve the approach of
saying that the conditions may apply to a specific class of licensees,
is that what he intends by that language, that certain places, such as
community halls, might fall outside the mandatory conditions in certain
circumstances? I do not know, and it will be interesting to hear from
him whether the language that has been adopted addresses
that.</div><a name="09021356000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
we have the potential regulatory burden, and one issue that was clearly
highlighted in the regulatory impact assessment is the potential costs
on businesses. I return to the statement in paragraph 19 of the
assessment:</div>
<a name="09021356000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
we recognise that in the short run, there is the potential for
significant transitional costs including job losses and the closure of
small
businesses.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is absolutely right that the statement that we had from the
British Beer and Pub Association during our evidence session was that
they could not say that the regulatory impact would close down all the
pubs, and that it was a more complex situation, but it is relevant that
even the regulatory impact assessment contemplates that businesses will
shut as a consequence of the legislation. That may not be about driving
out bad businesses, but about the regulatory position that has been put
in there. Good businesses that are complying with the law, being
responsible, and trying to adhere to what might be regarded as good
social responsibility practice, may be forced out because of the costs
and burdens being applied.</div>
<a name="09021356000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
discussions has the Minister had with the Department for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform on the proposals? Has it expressed any
concerns about the application of the provisions? Equally, what
discussions has he had on licensing more generally with the Department
for&#151;what is it called?&#151;Communities
and&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;DCLG.&#148;]
Yes, DCLG&#151;but in fact the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>the Department I was looking for; there are so many different acronyms
for Departments now. DCMS&#146;s review of the Licensing Act noted
concerns about the regulatory burdens and the flexibility within the
licensing arrangements, and said that more flexibility within the
existing licensing regime may be more appropriate. How is this
consistent with that and how does it fit
in?</div>
<a name="09021356000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
touched in detail on the fettered discretion of local authorities
regarding the nature of the conditions and how the licensing review
fits into that. It is difficult to understand properly how it fits
together until the code is published, so our comments have to be
reserved until the final code is revealed and the consultation has been
completed. I still feel that we are debating in a vacuum,
notwithstanding the Minister&#146;s assurance on the consultation,
because we do not know the end result&#151;so we can debate some of
the principles, but as always the devil is in the detail.</div>
<a name="09021356000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
genuinely sorry that the hon. Member for Stourbridge cannot be here
this afternoon, and I understand why. Her proposal, new clause 6, has
merit and I am happy to speak in support of it. My understanding of the
new clause is that it would add councillors in local authorities to the
list of interested parties pursuant to the licensing regime. One real
frustration over the Licensing Act has been that local councillors have
not been able to object or make representations directly, because they
lived more than 100 m away from the relevant premises. The approach to
who can make representations in relation to a licence is restrictive,
which has been a problem.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000517"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I agree with the issues about representations, but
it is possible for elected representatives to make representations,
provided they have the agreement of a local resident. Therefore, it is
possible, but there is a process.</div>
<a name="09021356000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000518"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I agree that, in essence, councillors, and
indeed Members of Parliament, can do that. I have had to say that I was
appointed by a particular resident to make representations on their
behalf as their agent. It seems so perverse and peculiar that we have
to go through that formal process of ensuring that we have someone who
lives within 100 m of the licensed premises. It would be sensible,
particularly for ward councillors, to be able to have an interest in
applications and in making representations, given that they are
supposed to be the representatives of the people living within that
area. Therefore, I sympathise with the purpose of new clause 6, which
appears to embody those points and add them into the Licensing Act. It
avoids the formulaic and unnecessary process the local councillors need
to go through to participate in something that directly affects their
ward. After all, they would be able to get involved on issues such as
planning.</div><a name="09021356000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to new
clause 6, because it touches on a relevant and serious point. I hope
that it will be given some consideration and that this debate about the
amendments and the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Stourbridge
will be reported to her.</div>
<a name="09021356000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000519"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> On that last point, I must say that I was taken
aback at having to produce a signed consent form from a local resident
agreeing to my representing them in a licensing application. I, like
the hon. Gentleman, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 433</div>thought it a bit odd, given how it is normally accepted that when we, as
elected representatives, speak on behalf of our constituents, we do
just that. The only justification I can find for the provision is that
the situation under discussion involves a quasi-legal process, so we
also perform a function that has a direct financial bearing on local
businesses. Although I agree that the measure goes strongly against a
particular principle, it will add rigour to our thinking and
representations. Like the hon. Gentleman, I shall be interested to hear
my hon. Friend&#146;s response.</div>
<a name="09021356000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 4
goes to the heart of the Bill, which is why it is infuriating that we
will have so little information about the proposed code and so little
access to the process until the code is published. It is also why I ask
my hon. Friend the Minister for the definition of reasonableness. We
all say that, by and large, drinking in pubs is reasonable. Indeed,
many of us think it reasonable to go to the corner shop to buy some
alcohol, and to do so outside our former licensing hours. We accept
that, but we then end up with the current binge drinking problem among
young people, and everyone says, &#147;How did we get here?&#148; I
am concerned that, unless we are clear about what society considers to
be the reasonable drinking and selling of alcohol, we will end up with
a mandatory code that does either too much or too little.</div>
<a name="09021356000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned also because the opportunities to legislate on this matter
are extremely rare. I first became interested in the happy hour issue
when a constituent&#146;s son died after following a happy hour
promotion at a pub. He got very drunk and behaved in what was thought
to be a threatening way to a man, who thumped him quite heftily.
Unfortunately, the man was a doorkeeper at a pub in town, and my
constituent&#146;s son fell over, hit his head on a kerb and died a
couple of days later. He was not remotely threatening, but his
behaviour was read as such, and if he had not been drinking, he would
not have behaved in that way. He was a student, did not have much
money, was in a pub with a special promotion, and that is what
happened. Moving from that day to this, we reach the point where
regulations might have to be put in place. However, we must get them
right, because, if it is another 10 years before such an opportunity
comes along again, a lot of mischief will be done, the public will have
to live with the consequences of it and it will be impossible for us to
regulate.</div>
<a name="09021356000438"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="09021356000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not so concerned about the question, &#147;Why nine?&#148; There
are fewer than 10 commandments, and that is the only significance I can
see in the figure. I am, however, extremely concerned about what the
nine conditions will be. It is important that they are seen, not just
by the industry but by the public, as the nine key things that can be
used to manage one of the public malaises of the present
time&#151;the chronic rise in binge drinking, particularly among
young people. This is a Public Bill Committee, not a policy debate, so
I will not go into all the statistics; those are on the record not only
on crime but also on health consequences for young people.</div>
<a name="09021356000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
extremely important that we know what the nine proposed conditions are.
I agree with the hon. Member for Hornchurch; if they concern types of
glasses and similar matters, people will think that we have taken 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>leave of our senses. Everybody will accept that there are much bigger
fish to fry than the issue about glasses, important though that
is.</div>
<a name="09021356000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I completely
accept the point made by the hon. Member for Hornchurch, my hon. Friend
the Minister and others that the bulk of the industry is perfectly
reasonable, operates properly and wants to help people live and work in
a decent society. There are many other ways in which local authorities,
pubwatches and other bodies&#151;I have a very good pubwatch in
Northampton&#151;can work to mitigate some of the downsides of the
night-time economy and drinking generally. However, those are special
interest groups; some are in industry, some in local government and
some are law enforcement agencies. They are not generally collective
upholders of the public interest and do not have powers to regulate
within it. That power rests with the Government, and that is why this
legislation is so important.</div>
<a name="09021356000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
discussions so far, the lists and names that I have heard are all
honourable organisations and I would not question their motives or
integrity. Some, such as Alcohol Concern, are outstanding. I have deep
respect for the retailers and know that some do outstanding work in
managing their businesses properly. However, such groups have
particular interests at heart. I am concerned that I have not heard the
list of those representatives of the public interest with whom my hon.
Friend has spoken. Secondly, I have not heard what might be in the
code. It is clear that discussions have been going on and that people
in industry know what the discussions are about. It is wrong that
certain sectoral interests should have access to that information while
MPs who are debating this matter and making decisions on it do
not.</div>
<a name="09021356000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend is shaking his head. Maybe no one has seen a list, but there
will have been discussions on different issues and points of concern
for the industry. We are looking at a matter that is of great concern
to our constituents, and MPs should know roughly the content of those
discussions and which general areas are being considered. I hope that
my hon. Friend will say what those areas are in his reply, but in case
he does not, I have a few suggestions.</div>
<a name="09021356000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
suggestion is about minimum pricing. That issue is deeply
controversial&#151;I introduced a ten-minute Bill on the subject.
Whenever I ask about it people say, &#147;Don&#146;t worry; we are
not doing that but we are doing something about happy hours.&#148; I
do not accept that doing something about happy hours is compensation
for not doing something about minimum pricing or pricing more
generally. The general consensus is that happy hours are not a good
idea. It is accepted that they should be regulated against.</div>
<a name="09021356000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch has repeatedly mentioned a change in drinking
patterns. I cannot conceive why anyone would want to stop people buying
a pint of beer for 89p or 99p, as in some of the special pub
promotions, when they are not being stopped from going to a supermarket
and buying 3 litres of a much stronger cider&#151;White Lightning,
say&#151;for something over &#163;1. A Department of Health study
reveals that price and availability are factors in leading to people
drinking too much and causing antisocial behaviour. If price is a
factor, then one has to hit both the happy hours and the White
Lightnings, especially since White  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>Lightning benefits from the lower tax rates that apply to ciders. It
seems the tax system rewards the drinks industry for producing a
noxious drink that makes people very drunk very cheaply. I therefore
want to know that there will be a level playing field between the on
and off-licence. We have not had much discussion about the off-licence.
On the pricing issues, the regulatory framework is roughly the same.
One can take the same attitude to price, whether people are drinking in
a pub, or going to the supermarket and then going to the pub, provided
they are over 18, to get blind drunk there.</div>
<a name="09021356000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
suggestion concerns labelling, which goes back to the issue of
responsibility and what is reasonable in the sale of alcohol. Do people
actually know what they are drinking? If I go to a pub or buy something
from an off-licence, I normally have no idea how many units I am
drinking. I very much hope that one of the mandatory conditions will
stipulate that drinks are labelled or that people are told how many
units they are drinking. Again, it would have to apply to an on and
off-licence.</div><a name="09021356000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I introduced my ten-minute Bill and I talked about this to the
industry, they said, &#147;Well, that&#146;s very stupid. The kids
would look at the strength of the drink and the price, and then work
out how they could get really drunk cheaply.&#148; But it is
important for the ordinary, reasonable drinker to know how much they
are drinking, so that they know whether they will get into trouble if
they drive, or to limit their intake for health reasons. I wonder,
therefore, whether the code will deal with labelling and whether that
will include on and off-licences.</div>
<a name="09021356000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
suggestion concerns alcohol displays and whether they will be in the
code. We know that to protect children from the evil consequences of
smoking, cigarettes must be hidden under the counter and not even
displayed behind the counter. But the same child going into the corner
shop can trip over a whole shedload of super-strength lager right in
the middle of the shop on their way to buy the bread for tea. If we
think that exposure to something that is damaging to health should be
managed, we ought to look at the issue of alcohol
displays.</div><a name="09021356000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case of convenience store displays, the store is also the place
where people buy alcohol. In Scotland, they have taken quite an extreme
approach. I understand that parts of Australia have adopted a similar
approach and I personally think that they are rather severe given the
size of some corner shops. I would want the code to cover such aspects
as what is thought to be appropriate for a corner shop whose primary
purpose is to sell food, or for a supermarket, where there are issues
about whether the alcohol is in one place or pepperminted around the
shop. How does that relate to displays of drinks in pubs and clubs? It
is really important, again, that the code deals with off-licence as
well as
on-licence.</div><a name="09021356000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
reason why it is important to know what the thinking is and what the
possibilities are for the code is that consultation with the public,
who are concerned about the issues, takes much longer than Departments
give credit for. Three months, which is the usual time given, is just
about enough to get through the cycle of local community meetings. If
there is to be a proper consultation, there needs to be the opportunity
to take the issues out and look at them carefully. Being given a list
of nine and asked, &#147;This is a proposal, what do
you  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>think of it?&#148; is not quite the same as having real discussions to
identify the public&#146;s priorities and looking to codify them in
an organised fashion. I hope that my hon. Friend will say what
timetable he is proposing. If the list of nine is to be drawn up, or if
the draft code is to be ready by the time of Royal Assent, what will be
the options for change? At what point will we as Members, or the
public, get to see
it?</div><a name="09021356000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
reason why it is of such concern is that some of the decisions that
have to be made might seem small to the people drawing up the code or
to the industry, but are massive to the people out there living with
the consequences. I shall provide my hon. Friend with one example.
Convenience stores&#151;corner shops&#151;rely on alcohol sales for
14 per cent. of their turnover. Anything that affects their
viability&#151;such as a code that set the wrong standards for
in-store promotions or the amount of space devoted to alcohol
sales&#151;could put a corner shop out of business. The impact on
some estates&#151;we all know them: the post office is gone, the
newsagent is struggling&#151;would be profound indeed. There needs to
be a discussion with the public about their concerns and priorities. Do
they want to see the sale of alcohol managed to prevent the antisocial
behaviour that sometimes occurs after youths have been out buying tins
of alcohol in the local shop? Or would they prefer to find some other
way to manage drinking? There may be a risk to the future of the shop.
There are some major issues, which it is important for the public to be
in a position to discuss. As I said, the schedule is probably the only
chance that we have to deal with the issues, and may well be the only
chance for a long
time.</div><a name="09021356000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
others have said, the pattern of drinking is shifting. It has shifted
from going down to the pub, having a few drinks and going home, to
getting cheap alcohol from off-licences, going home to drink it, then
going out and drinking again afterwards. Another issue is access to
different types of drinks. I am concerned that we might end up with a
code that is driven by yesterday&#146;s agenda and which does not
catch up, anticipate and deal properly with the current patterns of
drinking and their impact on the well-being of our constituents and
their community.</div>
<a name="09021356000439"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="09021356000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everything
that I have seen, and the input from my constituents, shows that this
is a major area of concern. I receive much fewer complaints about pubs
and clubs than about the drunken antisocial behaviour of people who
have had drink elsewhere. I would hate it if we had a code that was
toothless, or had the wrong teeth, and we then had to wait another 10
years for another real opportunity to deal with the problem again. It
is important that we get this code and I ask my hon. Friend to tell us
in exactly which areas thinking is going on that will lead to the
choice of the nine items.</div>
<a name="09021356000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can my hon.
Friend also bring forward the publication of the draft? I am hoping to
do an online consultation&#151;I have already written to ask if he
will come to launch it. I want to be absolutely sure that all the
different interest groups that have expressed concern&#151;the
police, doctors, head teachers, the National Union of
Students&#151;get a really good chance to have their input as to how
they want to see drink managed and regulated in our society so that it
can be a source of pleasure and we can reduce the incidence of
antisocial behaviour and health and other problems linked with
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000520"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I will address my points mainly to new clause 6.
It was tabled by the hon. Member for Stourbridge. Unfortunately she
cannot be here today, so I have added my name to it so that I can also
speak to it. The initial arguments for the new clause could be taken as
part of all the issues we have been repeating throughout these debates
about the need for devolution and decentralisation, but let us park all
that on one side on this occasion, because it is a new clause that has
been submitted by a Labour Member. Those on the Conservative Front
Bench have also expressed their support for it and we also support it,
so it has a remarkable degree of cross-party
support.</div>
<a name="09021356000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
not asking the Government to reverse the whole thrust of central
direction and give local government more power; it is asking for a
simple, logical amendment or extension of a power that is already in
the Licensing Act 2003. The issue is that, at the moment, a ward
councillor can only make objections to the licensing authority if they
are acting directly on behalf of a resident of the ward. The hon.
Member for Northampton, North said that that is not a problem because
members of the ward can approach the ward councillor and take the issue
up. It seems strange that the councillor cannot do so directly and it
raises particular problems if they can act only on the open public
instruction of one of their ward members. There is the basic,
democratic principle that an elected ward councillor should surely be
able to make representations about something that happens in their
ward, but particular problems can arise.</div>
<a name="09021356000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
give an example, from a London councillor whom I know personally. In
2007 a nightclub in inner London was raided by the police. As a result,
a premises licence review was instigated. Local residents who were
concerned about the club and had sensitive, confidential information
about drug dealing on the premises went to their ward councillor and
asked if the councillor would raise their concerns in the licence
committee hearing. However, under the present licensing regime from the
2003 Act that can only be done if the residents will publicly declare
who they are. As we were dealing with local residents living near a
club, where drug dealing was taking place, the residents were too
frightened and were not prepared to go public. The council would have
done so but could not, because the provisions of the Licensing Act 2003
state that council can do only so when acting in the name of publicly
declared local residents. The licence holder&#146;s lawyers were
therefore able to effectively gag the elected representative, thus
requiring the councillor to leave the committee hearing without putting
forward the concerns about drug dealing on the
premises.</div><a name="09021356000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems strange that although the 2003 Act makes provision for licence
reviews and for local voters to make objections, it does not
automatically allow an elected local councillor to do exactly the same.
As a general democratic principle, I urge the Government to look at new
clause 6, since it has obvious cross-party support in most cases. It is
not only a democratic principle, however, but a practical issue of
residents who live above premises that cause problems being simply too
scared to go public and give evidence, whereas their ward council could
do
so.</div><a name="09021356000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
temporary events notice works on the same principle, in that the police
can object, but local councillors, the local council as a whole, and
the environmental health 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div>authority cannot, so they have to lobby the police to raise an
objection. A new schedule that I tabled on the matter was not selected
for debate, but the subject follows the same principle as the issue of
a ward councillor on a licence review. Why not simply allow a local
authority&#146;s ward councillors to make objections, rather than
have them follow a circuitous route that does not always lead anywhere?
The argument can be seen as being about devolving power, but if we
leave that to one side, it is actually about making a simple change to
legislation introduced by the Government in 2003 that would allow it to
work much more effectively and allow local elected representatives to
do their job
properly.</div><a name="09021356000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill and the schedule aim to deal with the problem of sales of alcohol
to under-age people from on-premises as well as off-premises. The Bill
also aims to deal with the issue of premises selling cheap alcohol in
happy hour deals and all you can drink deals. However, it misses the
opportunity to deal with the much greater problem of the sale of cheap
alcohol from off-premises. While some pubs and clubs have happy hours,
all you can drink deals and so on, the vast majority of supermarkets
take part in loss-leader sales of alcohol at very cheap prices, and
some of the larger off-licence chains do so, too, on a regular basis.
In my experience, the majority of complaints that I receive from my
constituents relate to the problem of cheap alcohol getting into the
hands of people, both under and over age, who then drink it in public
places. I obviously receive complaints about Chesterfield town centre,
where the central pubs and clubs are located, and some complaints about
Brimington and Staveley town centre, but the vast majority of
complaints that come to me, and as far as I can see from talking to the
police, that go to them, concern young people, some over age, many
under age, drinking  cheap alcohol that they bought from
off-licence premises, in the parks, children&#146;s play areas,
cemeteries, bus  shelters, and all the other public areas where
they can gather. They pose much the greater problem, yet the Bill,
despite have some welcome measures, seems to 
sidestep that.</div>
<a name="09021356000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
countries, supermarket customers who wish to buy alcohol must go into a
separate, sectioned-off part of the store rather than finding it while
walking through the aisles containing food, sweets and frozen goods.
The alcohol is not just placed in two or three separate aisles on the
premises: the customers actually have to go through a door into a
separate section. Why can such simple measures not be considered? When
will the next Bill in which we could take those steps come along and
how big a missed opportunity will this be if the Government do not
respond to
that?</div><a name="09021356000237"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000521"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> We have had a wide-ranging and useful debate. I
will begin with the comments made by the hon. Member for Hornchurch on
community alcohol projects and the work done by St. Neots, and business
improvement districts. I welcome both projects, which play an important
part in helping to address the issue, and hope that they do well. The
hon. Gentleman mentioned the importance of putting pressure on bad
premises, particularly in business improvement districts. That is in
the interests of not only the wider community, but good premises. He
also made a point about problems in parts of the country, as he
described it, but unfortunately few parts of the country are not
touched by the issues we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>are talking about, and we believe that we need to do more about the bad
premises to which he referred, using a combined mandatory and local
approach.</div>
<a name="09021356000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether we have had discussions with the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and other Departments, and
the answer is yes, there have been wide-ranging discussions and sign-up
by the Departments, which bring a slightly different perspective to the
issue, but we share a view across Government and acknowledge the
importance of flexibility in what we are doing. There ought to be and
is concern across Government about the impact of regulation. We believe
that the Bill&#146;s measures allow flexibility but are not
over-burdensome.</div>
<a name="09021356000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned village halls. Proposed new section 19A(1)
states:</div><a name="09021356000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by order specify conditions relating to the
supply of alcohol and applicable to all relevant premises licences or
relevant premises licences of a particular description if the Secretary
of State considers it appropriate to do
so&#148;.</div><a name="09021356000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
gives us an opportunity to look at how wide ranging the mandatory part
of that should be. Of course, that will depend on what the code will
look like. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North has been a
stout campaigner on that issue and raised some important points. I
refer again to the commitments I made earlier to send her and other
members of the Committee a list of all the bodies we have talked to and
to send a copy of the draft code as soon as possible, although I cannot
give a firm date. I remind my hon. Friend that we are looking at wider,
extensive consultation, to use the Home Secretary&#146;s word, and
that there is a further parliamentary process before those measures can
be brought in and at each stage they will be open to
influence.</div><a name="09021356000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend asked what will be in the code, but I cannot give her
specifics because we are trying to determine the extent of and obtain
sign-up to what will be in the code. The number of conditions will not
have to be nine, because the Bill stipulates nine as a maximum figure.
We would not want to start with a blank sheet of paper in any
consultation. There has already been wide discussion of many of the
issues. Committee members could already agree on areas that are
commonly of concern, such as irresponsible promotions, whether on or
off-sales. She said, and to some extent I agree with her, that if it is
just about matters such as glass size it will not be enough. Of course
it will not be enough, but nevertheless there is concern about consumer
choice and the size of glasses or whether free tap water is available
in pubs. We do not have to consume alcohol in a pub, so why do pubs not
supply free tap water?</div>
<a name="09021356000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The licensing
provisions are not concerned primarily with reducing consumption, as my
hon. Friend acknowledged in her remarks, but with reducing crime and
disorder. It is important, of course, that we discuss widely and look
at matters such as labelling, units and all of those health-related
issues. That is not the specific focus of this
legislation.</div>
<a name="09021356000440"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="09021356000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of hon. Members have talked about pricing. The price in pubs has
never been the same as in supermarkets. There has always been that
difference and we can argue about how great a one it is. I take
seriously the comments made by my hon. Friend about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>White Lightning. She also talked about displays and loss-leaders, and I
acknowledge that those are areas of concern. Whether they are addressed
through this particular measure or others, they are nevertheless areas
of concern and include the issue around
units.</div><a name="09021356000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hornchurch asked why we need to go down this route if
one has the community alcohol project, the good work with industry and
all of those things. The simple answer is that when we asked KPMG to
conduct an independent review into how standards were operating based
on the voluntary sign-up to the social responsibility standards, it
concluded that there was not widespread recognition of those among
alcohol retailers, and that they had little or no effect on reducing
crime and disorder. We welcome the work being done by industry and the
voluntary sector but that voluntary approach has not worked
sufficiently, and in some cases it simply has not worked. Therefore, we
need to go further by introducing a mandatory code to make people step
up to the mark in those areas where there is considerable
concern.</div><a name="09021356000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
keep going back to the enabling power, which is what we are discussing
here. It is an enabling power and the mandatory conditions will come
later. The whole point is to attack the binge drinking culture, not to
attack responsible drinkers. Pre-loading has been mentioned on a number
of occasions. The off-sales sector needs to take that issue very
seriously. Whether it could be addressed by the approach we are talking
about is difficult. How could that be put into the legislation? If,
having pre-loaded, a person then goes out, drinks more and gets into
trouble in a pub or club, that is an enforcement matter. We have to be
careful about what we can or cannot do. We are aiming at the binge
drinking culture and its effects. We are not aiming at the people who
go out day after day, work hard, come home and go to the supermarket at
the weekend to buy something for a decent meal and a bottle of wine.
They are not the people this legislation is meant to focus on. Of
course, they need to drink their wine with knowledge about the possible
health effects, but they are not the ones who by and large cause the
trouble. It is the ones who do cause trouble that we need to get
at.</div><a name="09021356000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000522"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Does the Minister accept that the same principle
applies to people who go to pubs? Most people go to pubs and drink
responsibly but the legislation is looking to impose a sort of minimum
pricing system by apparently preventing happy hours and all you can
drink offers. We do not want to penalise responsible drinkers in
pubs&#151;I would judge myself as one&#151;but with the off-licence
trade, why not look at applying minimum pricing, without penalising the
sensible
drinkers?</div><a name="09021356000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000523"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The minimum pricing argument is very
interesting. We have ruled out, as far as the mandatory code is
concerned, minimum pricing, partly because of the reasons we discussed
earlier. The evidence we have suggests there would have to be a
dramatic increase in pricing in order to have a significant effect on
people&#146;s drinking habits. That is a clear message. Rather than
the one or two pence in tax on alcohol having an effect, to be honest
if someone is going out and spending &#163;50 or &#163;60 in an
evening a small increase in price will not make much
difference.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div><a name="09021356000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000524"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The awful killing of the young goth girl was by a
young man who had drunk so much. To get drunk cost him only a fiver,
not &#163;50. If it cost &#163;50 to  get drunk, I would
say, well fine, not many people get drunk. However, it is a fact that
you can get plastered for a fiver on very cheap alcohol that has had a
tax concession or is a loss-leader. Very cheap alcohol is lethal,
relates directly to crime and needs to be
tackled.</div><a name="09021356000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000525"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I do not disagree with my hon. Friend that there
is an issue around loss-leaders, nor do I disagree with her when she
says that there is an issue about the level of taxation. For example,
it is true to say that in the Scotch whisky industry the levels of
taxation have been varied in the past predominately to protect the jobs
of that industry. Someone could make the argument, with the price of a
bottle of Scotch whisky now compared with what it was, and compare it
with the price of beer or wine, and there may well be an issue there.
However, what we are talking about here is whether we have minimum
pricing. The Government have taken the decision, particularly at this
time, not to make it a mandatory condition. If, however, anyone wants
to take it up as a local condition, the same difficulties with minimum
pricing would actually apply. Minimum pricing in one local area and not
in another area would presumably breach competition law. Minimum
pricing&#151;I am not saying that we are not prepared to look at
minimum pricing and I am not saying that there is still not a
discussion to be had&#151;is a complex issue and our present position
is that we do not want it to be a mandatory
condition.</div><a name="09021356000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to new clause 6, I am slightly bemused by the idea that, by
virtue of the Licensing Act, a local councillor has been prevented from
doing the job that we want that councillor to do. There are two ways,
of course, in which a councillor can act. They can act if they are a
resident in that particular area. Reference was made to a club that was
associated with drugs. There is an issue far beyond licensing if there
is a drug problem that needs to be addressed, but if the councillor is
a resident in that area, why can he or she not, even if all the other
residents are scared, begin to take up that issue themselves, not as a
councillor but as a resident? They can do
that.</div><a name="09021356000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000526"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Obviously, where the ward councillor lives in the
ward, they can do that, but of course not all live in their ward.
Sometimes they live a yard over the boundary, sometimes they live quite
a way away, especially in urban and city areas. It is an issue and the
Local Government Association, which obviously deals with many such
issues, feels strongly that this is an obstacle, and I gave one
particular example from the inner London
borough.</div><a name="09021356000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000527"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> It is a long-running argument and I understand
that. I sometimes believe that there is some misinformation or
misunderstanding about the true powers that a councillor would have as
a resident in an area. But of course, they also have influence in an
area provided someone brings that issue to them. I would&#151;this is
my reply on new clause 6&#151;be very careful about putting a
councillor in a position where for example they became an interested
party themselves. If they are part of the licensing authority, there is
the issue of them wearing two hats. We have to be conscious of
that.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div><a name="09021356000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000528"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I had thought about raising that issue, but
perhaps we should not go down that track because there is the whole
issue of the restrictions on councillors and how, if they are part of
the planning authority and the licensing authority as well, they are
hamstrung. They cannot represent their ward because they cannot speak
out on something in their ward because they are then banned from voting
when it comes to planning committee or licensing. That is a different
area and not specifically for us, but the Government need to look at
the issue. It seems strange that a councillor is elected to represent
an area but then banned from actually saying anything on planning or
licensing issues that are really getting local people wound
up.</div><a name="09021356000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the intimidation point in the example that was given, local
residents who live next to a club or pub, or wherever the problems
might be, are scared, whereas an elected representative might still be
scared but is less likely to be. They took on the job of being the
elected representative so that they could take up such issues, but they
are not allowed to under the 2004 Act in those
circumstances.</div><a name="09021356000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000529"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We will have to leave planning issues out of the
discussion.</div><a name="09021356000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000530"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bayley. We are
defining circumstances in which an individual might believe that they
are not able to do the job that they thought they were being elected to
do. In the example described, I am not sure that it is only the
residents who are concerned about that club. The police will have
concerns and they can play their full part in that process too. I am
not quite sure that I would agree with the hon. Gentleman on
that.</div>
<a name="09021356000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman could say that one of the reasons why councillors need to be
seen in a particular way in the light of the legislation is the fact
that any attempt to change a licence would be the basis, heaven forbid,
for a &#147;Focus&#148; leaflet and a campaign. We need to make
sure that it is part of the political process but we need to make sure
that there is not a party political knockabout every time that anyone
wants to change their licence in a particular
area.</div><a name="09021356000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned temporary event notices. We have discussed
that before in the context of lap dancing, and I told him that we are
concerned about this. Officials in my Department are looking into the
matter. It has been drawn to the attention of the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport and it has agreed to consider it too, not just
in the context of lap dancing but in the context to which the hon.
Gentleman referred. If we are talking about community empowerment,
whether it is for licensing or lap dancing, we have to make sure that
as far as possible that extends not just to the
police.</div><a name="09021356000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are issues about members of licensing authorities and licensing
authorities and what role they would play if they were in a different
scenario. At the end of the day the licensing authority must be the
adjudicator between a responsible authority and an interested party. We
have to maintain that gap between the role of the authority, the
interested parties and the licensee. Our fear is that if the new clause
was accepted, that distinction would be blurred. One of the effects
might be that the impartiality of the authority could be called into
question. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>It is not about weakening the powers of licensing committees. To be
honest, I wish that they would make more use of their powers. They need
to be more robust. People need to have more confidence in licensing
committees. I am not absolutely sure that his proposal would do very
much to address that
impartiality.</div><a name="09021356000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the Local Government Association supports the new
clause. I hope that I have not given the impression that we are not
sympathetic to it. We are. My officials met recently with
representatives from the LGA and other stakeholders to discuss
mandatory and general licensing conditions, and we will continue to
work with them both in both this regard and to consider the issues
raised by the new clause. I hope that the new clause will not be
pressed to a
vote.</div><a name="09021356000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="09021356000533"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Good afternoon Mr. Bayley. A new voice
needs to be injected into the proceedings. This is a very important
clause. I know that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have
important points to make, but they also want to make some progress. It
would be right for me to put on the record the fact that the hon.
Members for Hornchurch, for Bury St. Edmunds and for Chesterfield, as
well as other Opposition and Labour Members&#151;indeed, all members
of the Committee&#151;support the need to try to take from criminals
more of their ill-gotten gains. There is no divide between us on that
point. I hope that it is helpful to put that on the record,
notwithstanding some of the discussion that will take place on part
4.</div><a name="09021356000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
hon. Members are tracking these amendments very carefully, because the
issue is a little complicated. I found it complicated; I am sure that
those who grouped the amendments found it the same, too, and I thank
them for their efforts. Government amendment 191 is a minor and
technical amendment to the new power under the Proceeds of Crime Act
2002 to seize and retain property in anticipation of having to sell it
to raise the sum for an outstanding confiscation order in future. Once
property has been seized, the new powers will provide for continued
detention. An officer may initially detain seized property for 48
hours. In Scotland, if there is no restraint order or the officer
decides not to apply for one, he must obtain a detention order from the
sheriff. This amendment provides that an appeal not to make the order
or an appeal against a decision on discharge or the variation of such
an order must be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>made in 21 days. That is the standard time limit for an appeal in
Scottish law, rather than 30 days, as currently drafted. I apologise
for that initial error, and I thank Scottish officials for advising us
accordingly.</div><a name="09021356000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 266 to 269, 273 to 278, 282, and 284 to 286 will add to the
new provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act that relate to seizing,
detaining and selling property to meet the value of an outstanding
confiscation order. They merely provide that, from the amount paid in
settlement of a confiscation order, the police and other law
enforcement agencies can claim back their reasonable costs in having to
store and sell the property. It is entirely reasonable that the
additional cost that falls on the police and others is reimbursed, much
as it is at the moment under the 2002 Act in respect of receivers. On a
matter of budgeting, they receive their costs after the event, rather
than being funded up front.</div>
<a name="09021356000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to note that the amount is paid from the settled amount, so
no additional burden of payment falls on the defendant. This is simply
to do with the distribution of the money that has been collected. It is
also a safeguard, as the magistrates court determines what the
reasonable costs are, thus ensuring open and independent oversight of
the costs that are incurred. Government amendments 259, 260, 270, 272,
279, 281, 283, 287 and 289 will add to the new provisions in the 2002
Act. They simply amend the provisions on distributing sums received in
consequence of payment of a confiscation order. Notably, they provide
that, where a court has determined the reasonable costs that the police
or another law enforcement agency have incurred, those costs are paid
from the recovered amount. They also provide for the court to make
directions on any payment. Therefore, any third-party interests in the
property can be paid
back.</div><a name="09021356000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 271, 280 and 288 are merely technical. They will remove from
the Bill proposed changes to the 2002 Act, and those changes will be
made in schedule 6. Nothing is changing; it is just tidier, I am
advised, to make all the consequential amendments that flow from the
changes to the 2002 Act in one place. The amendments to schedule 6 will
be tabled in due
course.</div><a name="09021356000271"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000534"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s introductory
remarks in relation to part 4, as Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition
support powers to ensure that the ill-gotten gains of criminals and
organised crime are seized and returned where appropriate. Our
difficulty with part 4 is its extent and nature, the protections that
it affords and the judicial oversight that may apply&#151;in other
words, its practical import. The Minister will be aware of the comments
made by the Bar Council during the evidence session, when it noted that
this was a significant change, rather than merely a tidying-up
exercise. We will come to some of those revisions as we work through
part
4.</div><a name="09021356000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s explanation of some of the amendments in this group
was helpful. I would appreciate further clarification on amendment 267,
which allows the new right to charge. The Minister said that the
amendment was not adding a extra cost but was setting out the
regulation and the approach to be taken on payment. Proposed new
section 67AA(3) states:</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div><a name="09021356000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
court makes a determination under this section the appropriate officer
is entitled to payment of the amount under section
55(4)&#148;</div><a name="09021356000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
the Proceeds of Crime Act. However, yet section 55(4) of
that Act does not provide for an amount. It makes provision for the
order in which certain payments are to be made. Am I missing something?
I appreciate that we are considering Government amendments to a
provision that amends another measure, so it is not necessarily easy to
follow this, and the Minister may not be able to give me a straight
answer to my question and may need some assistance. Some of these
technical issues are a little difficult to follow. Proposed new section
67AA(3) seems to be about a payment, but the section to which it refers
does not appear to mention payment. Perhaps I have misunderstood
something. The Minister, or a note passed to him, may be able to
elucidate that
point.</div><a name="09021356000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000535"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am advised that it is the payment of costs. I
wish to reiterate that the purpose of the amendment is simply to ensure
that the amount paid is the reasonable cost as determined by the
magistrates court. It will be for the court to determine what those
reasonable costs are; it is not about trying to ensure that somebody
profits from the exercise. That judicial oversight is built into the
Bill. The provision refers to the payment of an amount that the court
will determine as the costs incurred by the law enforcement body in
storing the detained property, and as such will encourage that body to
do more of this work, knowing that it does not have to incur a
cost.</div><a name="09021356000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000538"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> These amendments relate to the application of
the power of confiscation and the power to retain seized property so
that it is available to accredited financial investigators. My first
question is whether it is appropriate to grant those significant powers
to people who are not warranted police officers or officers of the
Serious Organised Crime Agency or Revenue and Customs. Accredited
financial investigators are simply defined as such by order of the
Secretary of State. Will the Minister confirm who is considered to be
an accredited financial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>investigator and what plans he has to extend that definition, if at all?
I acknowledge that this has been a steady move by the Government over a
period of time. In their 2006 consultation document, &#147;New powers
against organised and financial crime&#148;, they
said:</div><a name="09021356000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Financial
investigators are becoming more independent from police in their work
and therefore to give them the full range of powers would be
beneficial.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
example given to support that was police staff designated by chief
constables to have certain powers under the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act
1984.</div><a name="09021356000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
controls and standards are expected of such financial investigators?
How independent are they and what checks exist to ensure that they use
the powers appropriately? In its report on the Assets Recovery Agency
published in 2007, the Public Accounts Committee was highly critical of
the agency&#146;s role in supervising the financial
investigators&#146; regime:</div>
<a name="09021356000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
agency has not been adequately monitoring the accreditation of trained
Financial Investigators, despite its obligation under the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002. It did not know, for example, how many active Financial
Investigators should have been completing Continuing Professional
Development activities in order to retain their accreditation and it
was not monitoring completion of these
activities.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
assurances can the Minister provide that the situation has improved?
Given the complexity and nature of the powers that are at issue, it is
pretty significant if we are not sure how many financial investigators
have retained the qualifications to fulfil the job. Given the
PAC&#146;s comments, is it appropriate to grant further powers to
financial investigators in the light of this, and what steps have been
taken to ensure that the accreditation process is robust and
reliable?</div><a name="09021356000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
are the powers to retain seized property that are proposed to be
granted to accredited financial investigators in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland not intended to apply to Scotland? The reference to
accredited financial investigators is conspicuous by its absence from
proposed new section 120A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Why or how
will this impact on operations across the whole of the United
Kingdom?</div><a name="09021356000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000539"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Let me deal first with my response to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment, while I receive advice about
Scotland.</div><a name="09021356000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Policing Improvement Agency trains the accredited financial
investigators. My understanding from the people there is that they take
this area of work seriously, putting a great deal of credence in it,
because they understand, with the additional powers given to accredited
financial investigators, how important is the need to ensure that they
are accredited properly. It is something that the NPIA has been working
extremely hard on over the past period of
time.</div><a name="09021356000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked me about monitoring. The monitoring takes the form
of monthly activities and work-based evidence submissions, via the
NPIA&#146;s financial investigation professional register. There is a
dip sample of evidence submitted in support of continued correct use of
those powers. If they see in that dip sample that there is
inappropriate or incorrect use of the powers, the NPIA has the power to
withdraw that accredited status. From that point of view, that is a
significant step forward.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div><a name="09021356000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about numbers and, it might be of interest to the
Committee, to learn that the latest total, from February 2009, is
2,135. Of those, the majority&#151;1,311&#151;are warranted police
officers, the remainder civilian investigators. I shall answer his
point about Scotland later, when I receive advice. We see the role of
accredited financial investigators as a particularly important part of
this whole area of work. I hope that the assurances that I have given
him about the importance of training are
helpful.</div><a name="09021356000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are no accredited financial investigators in Scotland. Scotland has no
need for accredited financial investigators according to the law
enforcement agencies there&#151;only police are used. Given that that
is the case, it would not be appropriate to include anything with
respect to Scotland in the amendments. With that, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will see fit to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09021356000295"></a>

amendments 151 to 155, 164 to 166, 172, 183 to 185, 192 to 200, 202 to
204, 210, 211, and 239 to
241.</div><a name="09021356000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000543"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b><b class="B"> </b>I have spoken to the hon. Members for
Hornchurch and for Chesterfield, and I will move some of the Government
amendments formally. On others, however, I will read into the record
the facts, which may be of help not only to the Committee, but also to
other hon. Members.</div>
<a name="09021356000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments add to the new provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act, as
set out in clauses 33 to 38. Clauses 33 to 35 introduce a new power to
continue to detain property seized under other powers where the
relevant property is subject to an existing restraint order. As the
Committee knows, a restraint order is an interim measure under the
Proceeds of Crime Act, which prohibits persons from dealing with or
disposing of specified property. A restraint order does not, however,
provide for a general power to retain property. Although restraint
orders effectively freeze property, that property may remain in the
hands of a defendant. That obviously carries the risk that the
defendant may dispose of, hide or devalue it to frustrate a subsequent
confiscation order. That is particularly true of moveable property such
as cars, jewellery and electronic equipment.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div><a name="09021356000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is, of
course, provision for those affected by the restraint order, and
therefore the detention of the property, to challenge the order. If a
decision discharges or varies the restraint order and releases the said
property from detention, the prosecutors or others have the right of
appeal. Clause 33 provides that in England and Wales, such property can
continue to be retained by law enforcement with a view to it still
being available for sale to meet a future confiscation order. That will
ensure that items from which the defendant benefits as a result of
criminal conduct are available for confiscation, which is only right,
just and proper. The powers under which property has been seized and
can be detained are certain powers of the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. For example, property
seized as evidence under PACE, and also subject to a restraint order
may continue to be retained even when the evidential purpose for
retention no longer
exists.</div><a name="09021356000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
explain why there seem to be so many amendments, clauses 34 and 35
provide equivalent provisions for the equivalent schemes in Scotland
and Northern Ireland. The amendments are parallel amendments to those
provisions. Clause 36 inserts several new sections&#151;47A to
47P&#151;into the Proceeds of Crime Act. It provides for specific
search and seizure powers in England and Wales to prevent the dispersal
or devaluation of personal property in anticipation of a confiscation
order being made. Therefore, it differs from clauses 33 to 35, which
provide for detention powers only. The powers are subject to judicial
oversight and various other safeguards. Clauses 37 and 38 provide
equivalent provisions for the equivalent schemes in Scotland and
Northern Ireland. Once property has been seized under clauses 36 to 38,
the seizing officer can initially detain it for 48 hours. He then needs
to obtain judicial approval for continued detention. That will ensure,
along with other safeguards, that the detention of the property is
proportionate. Depending on the facts of the case, the judicial
approval may be from a magistrates court making a detention order or a
Crown court making a restraint order or varying an existing order to
authorise the continued detention. Restraint orders are, and will be,
used in more complex and high-value
cases.</div><a name="09021356000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments provide that if a decision is made by the courts relating to
the detention of property, which is then appealed, the property remains
detained until the appeal is concluded. That also applies in cases
where there is an outstanding application before the courts. That is
necessary as the circumstances by which the property is detained may
cease while the appeal or application is pending, if, for example,
under proposed new section 47K of the Proceeds of Crime Act, the
initial 48 hours of detention expires and an application to the Crown
court for a restraint order, which would authorise the continuing
detention of that property, has been made but awaits a decision. In
those circumstances, as the provisions are currently drafted, the
property would have to be
returned.</div><a name="09021356000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
172 provides that during an appeal the property remains detained until
that appeal is concluded. That is necessary as the provisions, as
currently drafted, require the property to be returned. Other
amendments in the group achieve the same in other applications and
appeals where otherwise have to be returned. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div>amendments ensure that property continues to be detained until there is
no further possibility of an appeal. If the property were returned, it
would be to those who are likely to dissipate it, thwarting the
original reason for the seizure and detention and thereby undermining
the policy intention. The property could be unavailable when a
confiscation is made and needs to be paid, which would undermine the
purpose of the
clause.</div><a name="09021356000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">        In
the clauses, the powers to detain are made with the view that when a
confiscation order is made and requires payment, the property retained
under the order can be sold to meet that confiscation order. The power
of the magistrates courts to authorise sale of seized property is
provided in clause 39. The amendments plug a gap to ensure the ongoing
detention of property when that continuing detention is being
contested.</div><a name="09021356000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">        Amendments
194 to 200 add to the new search and seizure provisions in clauses 36
to 38 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The three clauses are
necessary for each of the three jurisdictions of the UK.  They
provide powers for the search and seizure of property to prevent its
being made unavailable for satisfying a confiscation that has been, or
might be, made.  It also provides for the seizure of property
that might otherwise be diminished in value by the conduct of a
defendant or anyone else. That is an important addition to ensure that
confiscation orders are paid when they are
made.</div><a name="09021356000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">        As
background to the amendments, the existing confiscation provisions in
the Proceeds of Crime Act relate not only to the property held by a
defendant but to certain gifts made by them to third parties, such as
family and friends. That is an important provision as it stops
offenders circumventing confiscation by placing their proceeds into the
hands of other people, notably immediate family. The legislation calls
such property &#147;tainted gifts&#148;, and it is an established
and accepted law that in calculating a confiscation order, the court
also considers the value of the property that the defendant has given
away. &#147;Tainted gifts&#148; includes outright gifts, as well as
under-value transactions.   It is of note that criminals
often reside in houses registered in another family member&#146;s
name.</div>
<a name="09021356000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">        Regarding
the amendments, although aware of the tainted gift aspect of
confiscation, our initial thinking was that the new powers of search
and seize should be limited to the suspect.  Practitioners have
since voiced concerns that that would be a significant loophole.
Defendants could engineer the exclusion of their property by making
gifts; an extreme example being a defendant handing over his jewellery
and other expensive moveable goods to family members present at a
search. Accordingly, the amendments introduce the ability to search for
and seize not only property directly held by the defendant, but those
tainted gifts made by him or her.</div>
<a name="09021356000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">        I
have tried to answer the point that the hon. Member for Hornchurch made
at the beginning, and to look at such matters during the development of
the Bill. It is significant that the same stringent safeguards will
apply to such searches and seizures. For example, an officer would need
reasonable grounds of suspicion before carrying out a search and
seizure, and either a warrant or consent to be on the premises would be
required for a premises search.</div>
<a name="09021356000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The code of
practice will deal with the point of search and seizure from third
parties suspected of being recipients of tainted gifts. Under the
Proceeds of Crime 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>Act, restraint orders can refer to third parties if they are recipients
of tainted gifts. It is also of note that under that Act a search and
seizure of cash under Part 5, and the execution of an investigation
search and seizure warrant under Part 8 do not have to be against a
person suspected of crime. As with this new power, both those measures
are subject to a code of practice and have been operating successfully
for six
years.</div><a name="09021356000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
193 and 211 repeal the existing seizure power in the confiscation
provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act. Section 126 in Scotland and
the Northern Ireland equivalent provide that property subject to an
interim restraint order may be seized in the one circumstance of
preventing its removal from the country. Clauses 37 and 38 of the Bill
make provision for more extensive search and seizure powers that
subsume those existing powers. Their continued existence is therefore
not justified and the powers are
repealed.</div><a name="09021356000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
239 to 241 are consequential on those made in respect of the powers to
detain property under clauses 36 to 38. Those clauses specify that
property may continue to be detained until there is no further
possibility of an appeal. The amendments clarify the meaning of that.
There are three amendments for the three separate UK
jurisdictions.</div>
<a name="09021356000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise
to the Committee for the length of that, but sometimes that is
necessary, because we must ensure that accurate information is read
into the record, so that our legislators can refer back to it. Many of
the provisions in this part of the Bill will have to be dealt with that
way, and I apologise in
advance.</div><a name="09021356000316"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000544"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I will compile my comments to amendments 153,
155, 172, 192 and 210, which all cover the same point, but one that is
reflected in different parts of the Bill. The current provisions
provide for the continuing detention of seized assets where a restraint
order has been recalled or varied and detention is no longer applied.
In the case of amendment 153, and as reflected in the other similar
amendments that I referred to, and notwithstanding the decision of
judicial authorities, the assets can continue to be detained until the
time when there is no further possibility of an appeal or a review of
the court&#146;s decision. I question how that can be appropriate,
proportionate or reasonable. It is not even a requirement that the
relevant authorities have to intend to appeal or seek a review. As I
read it, they can simply hold on to the assets until whatever time
they  see
fit.</div><a name="09021356000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
question the need for such a measure, particularly if a legal authority
has taken the view that the order should no longer apply. Why then
should the assets be, or seemingly be, retained until the right of
appeal has lapsed? It almost seems to allow authorities to invoke the
power simply at will, if they do not like a decision that has been
reached. That does not seem to be right, and I cannot see how it can be
compatible with convention rights. It is a serious issue, and one of
the points that we have reached where the boundaries that are being
pushed are starting to reach the edge of acceptability. The judicial
authorities would have reached a conclusion at that point, which may
well be subject to appeal, but it seems fundamentally wrong that the
local authority can sit on the assets, notwithstanding that a court has
effectively said that they no longer need to be detained. Why is that
appropriate or necessary? Why should we accept the
amendments?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000545"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I hesitate to say that we disagree with the hon.
Gentleman, but we believe that the amendment is appropriate,
proportionate and reasonable. Every piece of legislation conforms to
the Human Rights Act 1998, and the assets will have to be released if
it is not proportionate to detain them. We are trying to close a
loophole, meaning that we can detain the property while an appeal has
been applied for or is pending. What we are trying to prevent all along
is a case that if a restraint order was overturned and an appeal was
made, a person in that case might, in that gap, get rid of the assets
and the various goods that they have, to try to circumvent a subsequent
confiscation order.</div>
<a name="09021356000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
point of difference between us: I believe that the clause is
proportionate, while the hon. Member for Hornchurch believes that it is
not. I think that it is, because there have been far too many occasions
when the appeal process has been used as a way of circumventing the due
process of law. In the end, if an appeal is successful, the defendant
will be able to get their goods back. It is merely detaining them until
such time as we can ensure that, should a confiscation order be made,
those goods can be used towards the settlement of that
order.</div><a name="09021356000320"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000548"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The group gathers a number of different of
amendments to clause 33 and subsequent clauses. Amendment 93 would
delete subsection (5) of the proposed new section 41A of the Proceeds
of Crime Act 2002, which provides the powers in secondary legislation
to expand the list of relevant seizure powers to which the new
restraint order will apply. Given the nature of this proposed new
power, it seems inappropriate for its potential scope to be expanded,
rather than pursued into primary legislation. In any event, such new
powers would presumably be created by future primary legislation
anyway, so why is this provision needed? If not, what additional powers
under existing statutes does the Minister have in mind, to which this
may apply?</div>
<a name="09021356000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Remaining
amendments relate to new search and seizure powers in clause 36 in
circumstances where potentially no one has been charged with any
offence. Amendment 97 would ensure that the power was used only in
circumstances where it was proportionate to do so. This is quite a
blunt instrument in terms of how the clause is drafted. That may be
appropriate in cases of serious criminality, where significant assets
have been accrued because of such activity, but it is equally easy to
see that it could be open to misuse.</div>
<a name="09021356000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 98
is designed to make clear that for the trigger permitting the use of
the search and seizure powers to be operable in circumstances where
someone has been arrested but not charged, there must be reasonable
belief that the arrested person has benefited financially from the
suspected illegal conduct. It clarifies who may be subject to the
seizure powers. Are they be applied broadly, to virtually anyone, even
though they may be completely innocent and unaware that the assets that
they hold may have been financed by funds obtained directly, or
indirectly, through criminal activity? How far down the chain do the
Government intend to
go?</div><a name="09021356000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Bar Council points out in its briefing note, it must be remembered
that property that is detained under part 2 of the Proceeds of Crime
Act, need not form or be alleged to be proceeds of crime, and the
person from whom it is taken need not even be suspected of any crime,
let alone charged or convicted. For example, property could be taken
from the innocent recipient of a gift. Again, the need for
proportionality and reasonableness is relevant in this context, as well
as taking account of convention rights.</div>
<a name="09021356000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 99
to 101 would require the qualification that an appropriate officer can
exercise search and seizure powers where he believes that certain
applications by the prosecutor have been made. They either have or they
have not. It is interesting to note that the officer&#146;s belief
does not even have to be a reasonable one. There is seemingly no
obligation to check. This seems unacceptable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>and unreasonable&#151;it does not seem too much of a hardship or a
time constraint for the relevant application to have been
made.</div>
<a name="09021356000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
103, 104 and 107 would make a similar point by stating that approval
under proposed new section 47G should have been received. Suggesting
that the power should be capable of being exercised in circumstances
where it is said to be impracticable to obtain such approval seems to
drive a coach and horses through the protections. In whose judgment
would it be impracticable? Again, it is easy to see where this
provision might be misapplied.</div>
<a name="09021356000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 105
is particularly important, as it relates to powers to search
individuals. As the clause is currently drawn, it grants a general
power of search of anyone beyond even existing rights of search under
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Can the Minister explain the
reason behind the measure, as it seems difficult to understand why that
would be appropriate.</div>
<a name="09021356000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 102
would clarify the language around the use of the word
&#147;defendant&#148; in proposed new section 47C, given that there
will be no defendant if someone has simply been arrested. Amendments
105 and 106 make a similar point in different
contexts.</div>
<a name="09021356000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000549"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s desire for
proportionality and oversight with respect to all of the various powers
that we are discussing&#151;particularly in clauses 33 and 36. I also
understand that in his amendments about necessity and proportionality
that is what he trying to do. Having spent a long time helping
officials and others in law enforcement put this Bill together, we too
have been trying to do that. We all want to get more proceeds of crime
from criminals to ensure that more of the ill-gotten gains are not
enjoyed by people who break the law and do not conform to the
rules.</div>
<a name="09021356000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman will have read the Bill carefully and knows that all the way
through there is judicial oversight and the power to vary or discharge
an order, and an appeal to the Crown court is available if people feel
that a magistrate&#146;s decision, for example, is inappropriate. I
have argued all along for the need for that judicial oversight, which
the Bill allows for. That relates to search and seizure powers, because
obviously if we do not have powers of search and seizure we will have
no property to detain, and in clause 33 that is exactly what we have
tried to
do.</div><a name="09021356000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000550"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I accept what the Minister has said, but he
will recognise that the scope and ambit of the provisions do not
necessarily touch only those people who have undertaken criminal
activity, but extend to those who might be completely oblivious to the
fact that they are in receipt or possession of assets that are caught
within the regime he has set out. Indeed, search powers might equally
be applied to them&#151;a point to which I have alluded. He talks
about judicial oversight, but essentially that would take place after
the event, which is why my amendment would make it clearer from the
outset to anyone seeking to use the powers ab initio, regardless of
what appeal right or judicial oversight might arise thereafter, that
they should have regard to that initial action rather than what might
happen after the event.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div><a name="09021356000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000551"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The search powers are based on those used in cash
search and seizure. We know that criminal conduct is required on the
part of the person, but the property is the key concern to which the
provision relates, rather than the individual, who will be dealt with
through due process of the law. We are trying to stop significant
amounts of property being dispersed before the confiscation order is
made, and we have to address that as a public policy
issue.</div><a name="09021356000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000552"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I accept
that.</div><a name="09021356000348"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000553"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman does, and as I said
at the beginning of the debate, the difference between us is our view
of how to do that proportionately. That is why we have built in the
judicial oversight and not tried to extend the existing search and
seizure powers. No general power of entry is given to anyone dealing
with this and, as I have said, we believe that that is
proportionate.</div><a name="09021356000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
97 deals with the issue of proportionality and the exercise by officers
of the new seizure powers. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the
powers are potentially invasive and intrusive and that the police and
others must exercise restraint and caution when using them&#151;that
is a given. When giving evidence to the Committee, Mr.
Creedon, the chief constable of Derbyshire, gave assurances on behalf
of ACPO that the powers would be used in a proportionate way and only
when necessary. He
said:</div><a name="09021356000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;human
rights underpin what we do...Human rights are fundamentally
important.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Policing
and Crime Public Bill Committee, </i>27 January 2009; c. 74,
Q117.]</div><a name="09021356000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar
assurances were given by Paul Evans, a director of the Serious
Organised Crime Agency.</div>
<a name="09021356000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, we
would not, as a matter of course, put into statute a requirement on law
enforcement agencies to act in a way that was compatible with the
European convention on human rights because they are automatically
required to do so. Were we to include some express provision on
proportionality in clause 36, there is a risk that that might cast
doubt on whether law enforcement needed to ensure proportionality in
the use of other powers granted by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and
other legislation. For example, there is nothing specific in the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to require the police to exercise their
search and seizure powers proportionately. Rather, that is a general
requirement.</div>
<a name="09021356000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
pointed out, there are numerous safeguards in clause 36 to ensure that
the powers are used proportionately, including the preconditions set
out before the search and seizure powers can be exercised in proposed
new section 47B, which require a person to have been arrested, to be
already subject to criminal proceedings, or to be subject to an
application for a confiscation order or reconsideration of an existing
order. Threshold tests for the seizure power, which vary according to
the stage in the procedure at which it is proposed to seize the
property, are also found in proposed new section
47B.</div><a name="09021356000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000554"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I was going to raise this point in the stand
part debate, but I shall make it now to save time. The Minister
explained why the powers were necessary. However, the Bar
Council&#146;s briefing notes on this part of the Bill set out
various other powers that may be applicable. They say:</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div><a name="09021356000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
other words, the need for a new power of detention of property is
debatable in the first place, so it should only be invoked where at
least a real degree of necessity is
demonstrated.&#148;</div><a name="09021356000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
comes back to my point about necessity. The Bar Council clearly feels
that there is a debatable point. In the context of our debate, I am
asking the Minister to reflect on the matter, given that such views are
being espoused by not just me, but people who have more knowledge than
I could possibly
have.</div><a name="09021356000355"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000555"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Of course I shall reflect on that. To be fair, the
Bar Council also said that it saw a case for what the Government were
doing. It did not oppose it in principle. What it was worried
about&#151;again, this addresses the issue of necessity and
proportionality&#151;was the creation of what it called a lower tier,
de facto restraint order. The Bar Council did not oppose the provision
in principle, however, but wanted to ensure, as the hon. Gentleman has
argued, that we act proportionately. I shall consider his points and
see whether there are further measures that we should take to meet some
of the
concerns.</div><a name="09021356000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
seizure power is exercisable only if the officer has reasonable grounds
for suspecting either that the property may, unless seized, not be
available for satisfying any confiscation order, or that the value of
the property may be diminished. That is covered in proposed new section
47C. Certain property is exempt property and may not be seized. The
search powers also require reasonable grounds for suspicion before they
can be
exercised.</div><a name="09021356000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are further safeguards. For example, the value of property seized must
not exceed the value of the anticipated confiscation order. There is
judicial oversight of any seizure of property and there are rights for
the defendant and affected third parties to apply for variation or
discharge of the order. Furthermore, a code of practice will be issued
to provide further details on the exercise of the powers, with an
emphasis on the proportionality requirements. Although I am satisfied
that we have done all that we can to ensure that the powers are to be
used proportionately, I shall consider the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points.</div><a name="09021356000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to the issues of prior approval and the appropriate level of
approval in the exercise of the search and seizure powers. The search
and seizure powers in clause 36 require the prior approval of a justice
of the peace or, where not practicable, of a &#147;senior
officer&#148;. If the powers are exercised without prior judicial
approval and seized property is released within 48 hours, or no
property is seized, the Bill imposes additional requirements on law
enforcement to explain in writing to the independent &#147;appointed
person&#148; why it was not practicable to obtain judicial approval.
The appointed person must publish a report every year on the exercise
of the powers in cases where officers are required to report to him.
The appointed person is a distinguished criminal barrister,
Mr. Andrew
Clark.</div><a name="09021356000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
36 also requires judicial approval of the detention of the property
within 48 hours of it being seized. All the new powers are modelled on
similar powers already in chapter 3 of part 5 of the 2002 Act as
regards searches for, and the seizure of, cash that is suspected of
being the proceeds of crime or intended for use in unlawful conduct.
Those powers have been operating satisfactorily over the past six
years. Judicial oversight 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>in such cases is provided by the magistrates court or a justice of the
peace. The senior officer also has an important role in relation to the
matter of prior approval. We are, therefore, not venturing into new
territory with the search and seizure powers in clause 36. We see no
reason to depart from tried and tested approval procedures, or to
depart from the rule that appropriate judicial oversight is provided by
a justice of the peace or the magistrates court in those cases where
there is no restraint order in
place.</div><a name="09021356000444"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="09021356000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
our proposals, applications for a restraint order, or for a variation
of a restraint order to include the detention of seized property, will
have to be made to the Crown court. I repeat that we would expect
higher value or complex cases to be subject to a restraint order, and
therefore judicial authority for the further detention of property
would come from the Crown courts. In cases where no restraint order is
in place, the application to detain seized property is made to the
magistrates court. The magistrate must be satisfied that there are
reasonable grounds for suspecting that the seized property may be
disposed of or hidden, or that the value of the property may be
diminished.</div><a name="09021356000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to amendments 98 to 101. Amendment 98 would ensure that the
arrested person&#146;s benefit from the alleged criminal conduct was
financial. Our view is  that this amendment is unnecessary. The
part of the clause that the hon. Gentleman seeks to amend with
amendment 98 is based on existing provisions in the 2002
Act&#151;specifically in sections 6 and 40. They refer simply to
benefit, rather than financial benefit, and benefit is defined in
section 6. Neither the courts nor any law enforcement agencies have had
any difficulty with this
terminology.</div><a name="09021356000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly
the aspects of clause 36 that the hon. Gentleman wishes to amend with
amendments 99 to 101 are based on existing provisions in the 2002 Act,
specifically the restraint order provisions in section 40. The issue
that amendments 102, 105 and 106 would address, regarding references to
the defendant, is dealt with satisfactorily in proposed new section
47B(2). However these amendments have been overtaken by Government
amendments 161, 162 and 167, which we will debate
later.</div><a name="09021356000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 93, the order-making power proposed in the clause does no
more than enable the Secretary of State to add a reference to a
provision in an Act or to remove a reference to a provision. It does
not allow the Secretary of State to provide for exceptions or to
qualify a statutory provision. If a new piece of statute were to
provide a new power of seizure, the Secretary of State could, by order,
add that provision to the definition of a relevant seizure power. The
power to amend the definition of a relevant seizure power by order is
subject to the affirmative procedure, so there would be an opportunity
for parliamentary oversight and
scrutiny.</div><a name="09021356000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 178 clarifies that references to the accused in the search
and seizure powers under clause 37 are to the person arrested for the
relevant offence when there is a relevant precondition for triggering
the powers. The amendment relates to the Scottish 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div>provisions. Equivalent amendments to the England, Wales and Northern
Ireland provisions are being made
elsewhere.</div><a name="09021356000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say this again: these are very complicated provisions. I apologise
again to the Committee for reading some of this into the record, but it
is extremely important. The points made by the hon. Member for
Hornchurch were also extremely important. I regard this power as
necessary, but potentially invasive. I will consider the issues that he
has raised regarding whether further oversight is needed. We have tried
at every stage in the development of this to ensure that there is
judicial oversight and that there are safeguards built into the
legislation. It would be an arrogant Minister who, when asked to
reconsider, just said no. I will look at it again. However, on the
basis of my remarks, I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing
the
amendment.</div><a name="09021356000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021356000556"></a>James
