<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 6, in page 3, line 22, leave out `full-time'.&#151;[Mr. Robathan]
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 11, in page 3, line 22, leave out from `B' to end of line 23 and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) is receiving such education; and
<P>
(b) resides in that institution.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 10, in page 3, line 23, after `education', insert `from A'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): You will recall, Mr. Atkinson, that before our lunch break, I was speaking in support of amendment No. 6, tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan), and against amendments Nos. 11 and 10, tabled by the Liberal party.
<P>
<B>Dr. Evan Harris </B>(Oxford, West and Abingdon): Liberal Democrat party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I apologise; the Liberal Democrat party&#151;speaking as individuals on a free vote.
<P>
I should like to reinforce what I said about amendment No. 6, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby. In recent years, an explosion has taken place in the number of sixth-form colleges and in many different types of post-16 education. Many pupils attend college for only three or four days a week. I do not see the logical reason why the Bill deals only with full-time pupils when the fastest growing group of pupils in sixth-form and technical colleges between the ages of 16 and 18 is of those undertaking part-time courses.
<P>
Regrettably, the Minister seems to be saying that he cannot accept any amendment that we table because it would create new anomalies and exacerbate the confusion. How serious is the Minister about the Bill? We know from Home Office guidance that he envisages only 10 to 15 prosecutions a year.Why is he drafting the Bill so tightly and excluding huge classes of pupils in sixth-form colleges?
<P>
I should also like to say a few words about the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats. The Committee may recall that I said that it would be absurd to prosecute someone because he had abused his position of trust in relation to a boarder but not if he had done so in relation to a day boy. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) seemed to repeat the slur against boarding schools that such behaviour is more prevalent there than in day schools. I do not know whether he attended boarding school. I did for a time, and never encountered such behaviour whilst I was there. I must admit that I hated my boarding school, but that is because I am of a shy, retiring, artistic and spiritual nature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Robathan </B>(Blaby): Was it a Catholic school?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It was a Catholic school; there is nothing wrong with that, of course.
<P>
I do not know where the underlying message in debates on the matter that boarding schools are far more dangerous comes from.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> (New Forest, East): I am starting always to second-guess the Minister. I understand why the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) has tabled the amendment, although the reason for doing so bespeaks the wider nonsense of the Bill as a whole&#151;which I appreciate I am not allowed to discuss. If the offence is not confined to a definite, finite set of particular circumstances, such as the person's being in residence&#151;
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Department (Mr. Paul Boateng)&#151;indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> No, for once I have not second-guessed the Minister correctly; he shakes his head.&#151;[Interruption.] Well, if I were the Minister, to play devil's advocate, as Opposition Members who oppose the entire Bill must in addressing the amendments, I would suggest to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) that anomalies will ultimately result if the Bill does not specify clearly identifiable status such as residence or non-residence. Indeed, we shall find that the Bill in its entirety will result in anomalies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is an interesting point, but I think that my hon. Friend has misunderstood the Minister's position. I suspect that the Minister will oppose the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats. He is a robust politican and will accuse them of trying to wreck the Bill. Well, perhaps he will not do that; we know that the two parties hate criticising each other. I am speaking against the amendments in case the Minister is insufficiently robust in his rejection of them.
<P>
It may be true that those in residential education are more at risk than others, not because of the nature of the boarding principle, but because they are on the premises for longer. However, that is not a reason for narrowing the scope of the abuse of trust provisions. Those at greatest risk should be covered without neglecting those at a lesser risk, which is the purpose of amendment No. 6.
<P><b>Dr. Harris:</b> I wish to put the case for amendments Nos. 11 and 10, in addition to the points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam. They go to the heart of our criticism of the Bill. By that, I do not mean the idea behind it, its general provisions or the objectives of the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton). The amendments illustrate our concerns about the wide scope of the Bill.
<P>
I want to examine whether the Minister took a reasonable approach when forming his four principles. As the hon. Gentleman said at our first sitting, the first principle concerns the vulnerability of some young people, while the second concerns young people in the care of those in a position of trust&#151;hence the references to detention and care homes. I do not have a problem with those two principles, nor have I referred to them now to question whether the scope of the Bill is inappropriate.
<P>
However, if we examine the third principle, which concerns the special influence of the adult, we can narrow the scope of the Bill without losing what it is supposed to do. The Bill recognises that relationships such as those that we have discussed are inappropriate. They are wrong and they are generally covered already by professional codes&#151;as are relationships outside the Bill, such as those between doctors and their patients, including their young patients.
<P>
Is it appropriate to make some disciplinary offences into criminal offences? A fifth principle needs to be added. We must be proportionate and ensure that we do not create a criminal offence out of something that need not and should not be so covered, when it is already dealt with by professional codes. The provision based on the special influence of the adult need not apply to teachers who do not directly teach students of the ages of 16 and 17 years. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam would not drive a coach and horses through the Bill. It asks that, for the position of trust to exist, the supposed victim of the offence must be educated by person A.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): Under the hon. Gentleman's proposals, a deputy head or a head teacher of a school who may not directly teach a young person, but who obviously has influence or authority over that young person, will not be covered by the abuse of trust provision.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> No. If I were redesigning the Bill, I would ensure that those who had the ultimate responsibility for supervision and care and who were truly in loco parentis, with authority in the school, should be covered by the Bill. I am talking about teacher A, who has no educational contact with the 16 or 17-year-old B. If B is not having lessons from A, she may therefore feel in hock to A because of educational marks and so on.
<P>
I do not seek to remove from the Bill someone who has a pastoral role, as form teachers do, nor do I seek to remove headmasters or deputy head teachers, who clearly act in loco parentis, because authority within the school rests with them and the governors while the student is at the school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt (High Peak)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison (Hertsmere)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am delighted to be so popular. I shall give way first to the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison).
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The point made by the hon. Gentleman is important, but it leads to the question of who looks after a person for such purposes. Head teachers or deputy head teachers might not come within that ambit because they might not be regarded as looking after the person concerned.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> We would argue that the provisions for looking after are covered in a later clause, to which we have tabled amendments. We are attempting to be consistent. The important aspect is the caring for or looking after. Indeed, a letter written by the Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), when he was Minister of State, Home Office, stated that the Government were looking to strengthen legal protection for young people against an abuse of trust by someone who owed them a duty of care. That term is much used in the codes of practice relating to the medical profession, doctors having a clear duty of care to their patients.
<P>
I believe that a similar duty of care exists between head teachers, deputy head teachers, form teachers and teachers in the classroom and pupils of 16 and 17. The teachers' role is to look after their pupils, or the student may feel obliged to the teacher, perhaps because of marks or favouritism, which may cause some duress. However, if that normal relationship does not exist, perhaps in a sixth-form college between a pupil and a teacher who does not teach that pupil, the usual professional codes of discipline should apply. Our motives in seeking to create a criminal offence would not then apply so strongly, and our actions in trying to make a criminal offence out of such a relationship would be disproportionate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman is on dangerous ground in seeking to discriminate between what one teacher can do legally with a sixth-form pupil and what another can do. I speak as someone who taught sixth-form pupils for 20 years. I believe that the duty of care&#151;the in-loco-parentis role&#151;applies corporately to the school. Although the head teacher has the ultimate responsibility, its application is corporate.
<P>
For example, if a teacher in the school yard saw one pupil bullying another, he would have a greater obligation to sort out that problem than would a member of the public. He would be obliged to take a parental role, having a duty of care to the pupils, even though he had no professional connection with that pupil in the classroom. I believe that amendment No. 11 falls for the same reasons as would amendment No. 10&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member is making a long intervention.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I would be interested to hear the argument of the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt). He raises a reasonable point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Is it in order for hon. Members who support the Government to make speeches in a Standing Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. It is certainly not a point of order for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> The point made by the hon. Member for High Peak is significant. I do not suggest that only those relationships that I have mentioned are suitable to be covered by the criminal offence or are not disciplinary offences. They are disciplinary offences and should be subject to the sanctions of the disciplinary codes. However, merely saying that everything should be lumped together suggests that there is no raising of the stakes when it comes to the duty of care.
<P>
I understand that there might be circumstances in which a teacher with no educative or form-teacher role might be called on to provide that duty of care or to act in loco parentis, but that applies to many people.
<P><b>
Caroline Flint </b><i>rose&#151;</i>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Borrow (South Ribble)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I should like to finish making this point. I am happy to take interventions. The fact that such relationships exist does not necessarily mean that a criminal offence is needed. On that basis, such offences could be extended to many people in schools who are not included in the Bill. Anomalies already exist. It might be argued, if a position of trust exists, why choose the age of 18 as a cut-off? Difficult decisions about what should be covered must be taken when framing such legislation.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the hon. Member for High Peak believes that corporate responsibility applies to the duty of care, I should be interested to see how he reacts to the amendment, which I think has been tabled, that would make failing to report an inappropriate, potentially illegal relationship a criminal offence.
<P>
A line must be drawn when considering proportionality. It is reasonable to continue to have the professional offence under a disciplinary code, which includes sacking as a penalty. We should reserve the criminal offence for those relationships that greatly involve the special influence of the adult, as the Minister has said.
<P>
<b>Mr. Borrow:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise the need for clarity in drafting legislation and that, in an educational institution, individuals will have a range of roles, from those involving a relationship that is so close that everyone in this Room would be certain that it should fall within the scope of the Bill to others about which there is less certainty because of the degree of trust and authority involved? We must be clear because drawing a line between one extreme and the other is so hard. The relationships in any educational institution range from one extreme to the other. It is impossible to draw a clear line and to show which side of it individuals should fall.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> But lines are being drawn throughout the Bill; they have been drawn at the age of 18, between full-time and part-time education, and between schools and residential camps run by youth organisations for social and educational purposes. The review group that considered such powers aired the concern that the Bill's scope might be too wide. That valid concern is shared by the National Association of Head Teachers, which shares the role of enforcing the current codes of professional conduct.
<P>
There is no reason why lines cannot not be drawn concerning the residential nature and the direct educational or pastoral role of a teacher-student relationship, given that lines are being drawn elsewhere throughout the Bill.
<P>
On the Minister's third principle, the position of the adult in relation to the child&#151;the position of special influence&#151;is critical, not the adult's job contract. If a significant relationship of pastoral care or of education exists such that duress might be involved, it should be covered by a criminal offence&#151;if we are to have one&#151;regardless of whether the job contract states ``teacher'' or ``caretaker''.
<P>
If I have not dealt with the point made by the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), I should be happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that all the teaching staff in a school should be dealt with in the same way? They understand what the appropriate pupil-teacher relationship should be. By the same token, does he agree that all teaching staff in the school have a responsibility to behave appropriately towards all the pupils in their care, whether or not they teach them directly?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> Absolutely. Of course they have that responsibility. The amendment is not intended to suggest that a teacher who does not have a pastoral care role, or a direct educational relationship with a pupil has done nothing wrong. We have said that professional codes of conduct exist and should be applied. The question is whether it is right to equate different relationships. A relationship may exist between a 19-year-old student teacher or a 23-year-old teacher in a sixth-form college and a 17-year-old. It is wrong, but there may be no educational link, other than the corporate one, identified by the hon. Member for High Peak. Should that be treated and criminalised in the same way as the sort of relationship that we are all concerned about&#151;whether it takes place in a care home, boarding school or day school&#151;in which there is duress because the academic performance of a student may relate to how well he pleases, in all senses of the word, his teacher?
<P>
There is a danger of trivialising the criminal offence by catching everyone. The hon. Member for Don Valley should recognise that the Bill does not treat all vulnerable young people the same. The Bill does not include part-time students. If that can be justified on the basis of pragmatism, as I believe that it can&#151;which is why my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam and I oppose extending the Bill to cover part-time students&#151;pragmatically one could exclude people when there is no direct educational or pastoral link, a sense of looking after someone, or an authoritative role, such as that of a head teacher. It is much more appropriate to decide what should be a criminal offence on the basis of nature of the relationship than on the basis of what appears to be an arbitrary line applying to all teachers in a certain situation, when not all pupils are included.
<P>
I turn to the Minister's fourth principle, which is that the position of trust could be seen to be abusive because of the lack of easy access to other adults. Someone who is acting in loco parentis is understood to be caring for a youngster, who may be in residence and unable easily to access other adults to whom he can report duress, manipulation or an inappropriate relationship.
<P>
The most gross offences take place in closed communities, which is why such heinous offences have been able to continue for so long. There is a culture of silence and no inspection from the outside world. If one has to draw lines, it is appropriate to do so in terms of residence in institutions, rather than to include educational establishments but not establishments run by youth workers or, say, camps run by Churches. Access to other adults to report concerns or direct offences is a crucial factor, which is best demonstrated by restricting the criminal offence to residential settings. That is what my amendment seeks to do.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough said that such an amendment would significantly reduce the number of people to whom the Bill applies. I do not argue with that, but it would restrict the criminal offence to the areas where it takes place. There is a tiny number of prosecutions now, and I hope and expect the courts to clamp down on the sorts of abuses in care homes and residential settings to which the hon. Member for Bassetlaw drew attention so correctly in his contributions during the passage of the Bill that became the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>
We Liberal Democrats do not accept that restricting the provisions of the Bill to people in residential accommodation or to those who have a direct educational or looking-after type relationship is an attempt to wreck the Bill. It is sad that those of us who have made representations to make the Bill proportionate and who take it more seriously by homing in on the areas of greatest concern, are accused of trying to wreck the Bill by running a coach and horses through it. There are already anomalies in the Bill&#151;we shall come to others later&#151;and I do not believe that restricting it in the way suggested in the amendments will reduce its effect. Such amendments add to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments are interesting. Amendment No. 6 is a good proposal. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaby has done the Committee a service by highlighting whether youngsters in part-time education will be covered by the protection afforded by the Bill. Several good examples have already been cited and more spring to mind from my constituency. In at least one community, A-level teaching in local secondary schools is carried out in conjunction with the local college. When students receive A-level instruction at the local college, will they be covered by the Bill?
<P>
It seems to be an obvious anomaly that a teacher at, say, a secondary school who commences an affair with a 16 or 17-year-old on an A-level course will definitely be covered by the provisions, but a lecturer or a teacher at a college that the child might attend for part of his or her education may not be so covered. Will the Minister clarify whether children who attend colleges of education away from their schools for part of their courses will be covered by the Bill?
<P>
I listened carefully to the opening speech of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam in support of amendment No. 11, which was probably well intentioned. Far be it from me to quibble about the drafting of the amendment, given the confessions that I have made already, but I am curious about the rationale behind it. The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to deal with the problem of boarding schools. I cannot understand why he used that argument to support his amendment, because the amendment would take away the protection of the Bill from other people. It would restrict the provision to boarding schools. Such a problem may exist in boarding schools, but why take away protection from others who are not in boarding schools?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): The hon. Gentleman's argument reflects not only our concerns but those of the working group that said that such schools were a priority category. In a sense, it was saying that the other categories were incorporated only because it could not separate them. We felt that it was worth considering the issue in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is fair. Boarding schools may or may not be a priority category, but it does not follow that we should be taking away protection from those in other categories. Unless all categories are given protection, strange anomalies might arise between the protection of day pupils, boarding pupils and so on.
<P>
Amendment No. 10 is another interesting proposal. It would take away protection from a youngster when a teacher who is not involved directly in teaching the child commences a sexual relationship with him or her. I am not sure that that is something that we want to contemplate. Surely, if we are to avoid anomalies and inconsistencies, it should be our aim to give protection to all 16 and 17-year-olds from the attentions of all teachers who are responsible for them in the school, whether or not they teach the youngsters directly.
<P>
I look forward to hearing the remarks of the hon. Member for Don Valley about the meaning of ``looks after'', which we shall discuss when we reach a later amendment, and whether it should be extended to include head teachers and deputy head teachers. We have tabled an amendment to ensure that the Bill will do that. I shall look forward to the hon. Lady's support as it is something that her eagle eye has spotted. We shall also have points to make about people other than teachers who are involved in caring for youngsters in education. However, those arguments can be best advanced when we reach the next amendment.
<P>
We want to make the protection as comprehensive and watertight as possible. We are worried about some of the anomalies that have already arisen and it will not do the Bill any favours if we allow more loopholes to arise by accepting the Liberal Democrat amendments, well intentioned though they may be. We want to give protection and not create loopholes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The amendments all relate to the education category of the new offence. We make no apology for the particular emphasis that we place on education because of the nature of the relationship between the individual receiving education and the institution providing it.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)&#151;and the hon. Member for Blaby, whose contributions I have come to regard with some care&#151;may like to consider the case of a young person aged 16 who attends a pottery class at a local college of further education and forms an attachment with a pottery tutor aged 19. The hon. Member for Blaby is a man of the world. With his knowledge of the world, shaped as it is not only in this place but in the armed services, does he seriously suggest that such a relationship should be criminalised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> If the Minister suggests that it should be criminalised in the case of a similar child aged 16 but in full-time education, receiving a pottery class from a young pottery tutor aged 19, I see no reason why it should not be criminalised in the case of another 16-year-old. The Minister's logic seems flawed, not mine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman's reasoning is fatally flawed, because what is at issue is not whether the young person involved is a full-time or a part-time student, but the relationship between the young person and the institution. The young person in a school in receipt of full-time education has a particular relationship with that institution. That young person is registered at that institution, is expected to attend full time for a specified period at that institution and registers for that purpose. It is a totally different case from that of someone who attends the occasional evening class at a college of further education. Bearing in mind the four principles, the nature of the relationship is different. A young person who attends an institution full time is, day in and day out, present in that place, on the basis that his or her parents have entrusted him or her to that institution in a full-time capacity. Therefore the relationship of that young person is quite different from that of a young person who attends part time at a college of further education once a week for a pottery class.
<P>
<B>Mr. Joe Ashton </B>(Bassetlaw): Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> If my hon. Friend will excuse me, I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
The opportunity for an intervening, countervailing adult relationship is obviously infinitely greater when a person attends part time than when he or she attends full time. It is precisely the availability of other influences and the loosening of the relationship between a part-time student and the institution that that young person attends that makes all the difference between full-time and part-time education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Surely existing law recognises that in, for example, payment of child benefit, free school meals and other grants that distinguish between full-time and part-time education? Part-time education could mean two hours once a fortnight. It is nonsense and does not improve the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw for his observation that the law already treats full-time education very differently from part-time education. The nature of the relationship between the individual and the institution is fundamentally different in the two cases.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I am not trying to be unhelpful, but although the Minister's distinction between someone who spends all his time in an educational institution and someone who spends a couple of hours a week there is valid, what about intermediate situations? Are there not courses that involve people spending the vast majority of their time in an educational institution but being absent for, perhaps, one day a week? On which side of the barrier would such courses fall?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The distinction is between full-time and part-time education, and I should have thought that it was obvious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I hope that he will appreciate why I am probing on the matter, and I apologise if it is taking time to do so. To return to the point that I made earlier, is the Minister saying that, to use my constituency as an example, a German teacher at the local secondary school will be committing an offence if he starts a relationship with a 16 or 17-year-old A-level student&#151;girl or boy&#151;but that if, as happens in my constituency, that pupil goes to the local college of further education to learn Russian, the Russian teacher will not be committing an offence if he starts an affair with that child?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng: </b>Such a person would be attending an institution for the purpose of full-time education; I point the hon. Gentleman to subsection </B>(5):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The fourth condition is that A looks after persons under 18 who are receiving full-time education in an institution and B is receiving such education in that institution.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's example falls within that condition. It is stretching the interpretation of the Bill to claim otherwise, although it may well be that those whom the hon. Member for Hallam describes as clever lawyers will seek to make that distinction. If that happens, I shall leave it to the profound good sense of an English jury, properly directed by a judge, to arrive at its own conclusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I have been asked a detailed question; I intend to give a detailed answer.
<P>
If the concern of the hon. Member for Hertsmere is that the Russian teacher in the college of further education will escape the impact of the law as a result of the way in which it is drafted, I undertake to look into the matter and write back to the hon. Gentleman so that we can do all that we can to ensure that he does not. However, we are not prepared to countenance the suggestion that we should extend the criminal law to the pottery teacher who teaches half an hour or one hour a week. That would reduce the law to absurdity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I must not succumb to the temptation of giving way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It will lead me down a path that I fear will rapidly digress. [Interruption.] All right&#151;against my better judgment, I shall sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am very grateful to the Minister. I want to make a point about the Minister's comments on the clause and the subsection that he quoted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The fourth condition is that A looks after persons under 18 who are receiving full-time education in an institution, and B is receiving such education in that institution.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> And in another one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No.&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Only one member of the Committee should be speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but it is misguided to suggest that, because B is receiving education in two institutions, A, who is looking after a person receiving full-time education in ``an'' institution, is relieved from his responsibility under the law. B is receiving full-time education in an institution. A looks after B for the purposes of giving Russian lessons. If A abuses that trust in relation to B, I submit that A is covered by the criminal law and that B is entitled to protection.
<P>
If my interpretation is wrong, I intend&#151;[Interruption.] I am exploring a matter of considerable interest. If my interpretation is wrong, we shall certainly look into the matter.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Or at a different institution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Yes, at a different institution. Such a person should not escape the impact of the law. Let us suppose that, on Saturdays, that person was also receiving lessons in the same college of further education in mah-jongg. If that teacher was to abuse his relationship with the pupil, and bearing in mind that it was not part of the full-time education of the pupil B but was ancillary to it, the abuse ought not to be covered by the criminal law. Mah-jongg lessons would be clearly ancillary to the pupil's full-time education, regardless of where they took place. We are prepared to concede that, but the question is whether or not the person is in receipt of full-time education. Anything given under the auspices of full-time education ought to be covered by the criminal law. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman if my interpretation is not correct, and we shall do our very best to ensure that the law does cover the hon. Gentleman's example.
<P>
<b>Mr. Clappison:</b> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, I will not be had twice&#151;[Interruption.] I shall certainly write to the hon. Gentleman. I shall be happy to explore the matter in correspondence with him.
<P>
I now turn to the Liberal Democrats' concern about boarding schools. I do not accept the fundamental premise of that amendment. Whether abuse of trust occurs at a day school or a boarding school is neither here nor there. It is wrong wherever it occurs. I question the judgment of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), and of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam, insofar as he takes the same view.
<P>
Why make such a distinction? If someone is subject to an abuse of trust, it is wrong. Even if it happens in a boarding or residential school, it should come within the context of the criminal law and it ought to be punished in a condign manner. I see no justification for the distinction made by the two hon. Gentlemen. We do not intend to accept that amendment. We could not possibly accept an amendment that would limit the offence to relationships between teachers and the pupils whom they personally educate. That would be quite wrong. Again, it flies in the face of the experience of education of all members of the Committee.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When at school, a teacher is a teacher. Pupils do not ask, ``Am I getting a couple of lessons in algebra from Mr. Y? Will I be taught by him in the second term?'' If a pupil is taught by Mr. Y in the first term and by Mr. X in the second term, is one relationship to be criminalised, not the other? Opposition Members must realise that the amendment is nonsense. I would understand the amendment if it had been moved for a probing purpose, but I do not understand it if it has been moved as a serious suggestion that somehow, unless a pupil is personally taught by a teacher, it is perfectly okay for teachers and pupils to have a relationship and that such relationships should not be touched by the criminal law.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made his speech at some length. We are not prepared to accept such a suggestion. The reality is that the abuse of trust is wrong whether in a boarding or day school or, as is sometimes the case, in a mixed context. We are simply not prepared to go down the path of differentiating between boarders and day pupils.
<P>
We have included the defence that a person did not know, or could not reasonably have known, that the younger party was under 18 or in a relationship of trust. Clever lawyers would argue that, in a large institution, one person could not possibly know who the other was. It is right that such a defence will be available.
<P>
For all those reasons, the distinctions that Opposition Members invite us to draw between various groups are not sustainable or workable. They are profoundly unhelpful to the purpose that we want to achieve in the Bill and, therefore, we shall oppose each and every one of them robustly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I said earlier that it would be helpful to be a lawyer in this Committee, but, having heard the Minister's response, I realise that the law allows the Minister only to introduce much tautology. The phrase ``in an institution'' is clear, and he seems to be using words erroneously. Common sense and a little education have led me to think that the use of the term ``full-time'' is unnecessary. Furthermore, the logic of what he has said throughout has been that it would be better to scrap the Bill completely, listen to his review and introduce a rather better Bill&#151;one with fewer anomalies shot through it. Those anomalies have been exposed in this debate.
<P>
It is a mistake to include the phrase ``full-time'' in the clause and, therefore, I intend to press the amendment to a Division. Surely the pottery teacher aged 19&#151;if he or she exists&#151;will be protected by the discretion of the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts and the good English juries and judges, to whom the Minister referred not so long ago. He has not made a convincing argument against the fair treatment of young people in part-time or full-time education who are otherwise in the same circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall try to refrain from making any further complimentary remarks about lawyers as the Minister might return them to me. We are trying to probe with these amendments. As I have said, they are intended to explore the genuine concerns of organisations such as the National Association of Head Teachers which are not known for their radicalism in most respects.
<P>
The matter of boarding schools reflects one of the four basic principles to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks&#151;access to other people. It was legitimate to discuss that issue on those grounds although, as I said, our amendments are probing amendments and we do not intend to press them to a Division.
<P>
As for direct tuition, we are left with the fabled 19-year-old pottery teacher whom we are all growing fond of, who offered two hours' tuition to any pupil in an institution. Irrespective of whether or not he gave tuition to the pupil concerned, he would be caught by the law if he had a relationship with that pupil. I reiterate that, when talking about the scope of the law in respect of those working in education, we are not condoning such relationships; not do we want to take away protection.
<P>
Unlike the hon. Member for Blaby, we welcome the new law, which is about giving new protection. All that we are asking is where to draw the line between the new protections and the removal of what is currently a consensual act. Where do we bring the criminal law into play and where do we rely on professional codes? It is appropriate to discuss that because of the real worries that have been raised. We have enjoyed the debate and believe that important points have been made, especially about the relationship between colleges of further education and schools. Those points apply to my constituents, many of whom attend FE college on a Friday and spend the other four days at their school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is important that the provision is made absolutely clear. Person A teaches English in a sixth-form college and B is his pupil. If A abuses the trust of B, he can be prosecuted. That is clear under the Bill. However, C is a member of another secondary school and attends part-time English classes in A's sixth-form college. Person A cannot be prosecuted under the Bill for abusing his position of trust with C. The Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The fourth condition is that A looks after persons under 18 who are receiving full-time education in an institution, and B is receiving such education''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, full-time education&#151;``in that institution''. That is the legal position and I beg the Minister to reconsider the provision.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I have two points to make in response to the Minister. First, let us continue the analogy. Does the Minister consider it appropriate for a teacher who gives one-hour lessons in pottery or mah-jongg not to be prosecuted, even though there is an educational relationship between him and that pupil? We should not demean pottery or metal work because they are not academic. It seems strange that, whether unintentionally or intentionally, the Bill does not cover such people.
<P>
Let us suppose that teacher A knows that person D is a pupil at the school, but has nothing to do with that person in school because he has never nor will he ever teach that person. If he happens to have a relationship with that person outside the school, he will be covered by the Bill. That is a large anomaly. Under the Bill, person D would be the same as person B who was receiving education in that institution, while A was teaching other people.
<P>
It must be remembered that certain relationships, wrong though they are, that may be covered may be those that lead to marriage and children. Such relationships in which the age difference is not so great are formed at school throughout society. We read about them in works of non-fiction, biographies and fiction. Although such relationships must be disapproved of and are covered by the professional code, it is disproportionate to make them a criminal offence.
<P>
The second point concerns my constituents who are 17 years old and in their first year at university. In Scotland, most students in their first year at university are 17. Universities are large institutions. A lecturer or graduate student may or may not be aware that a person whom he does not teach, but whom he meets in that university or college, is a member of that institution. Are such people not allowed to have a relationship because of the fear of criminal sanctions, when others in that institution, of a slightly greater age or over the border&#151;a first-year student in Durham but perhaps not in Edinburgh&#151;are not subject to such sanctions? That is a significant point.
<P>
I believe that graduate students who teach do not have a professional code of conduct to cover other undergraduates whom they do not teach. A code is certainly needed to cover the teaching relationship. However, in large institutions, and even with the knowledge that the other person is a member of that institution and therefore does not qualify for the exemption mentioned by the Minister, it seems inappropriate that such relationships should be covered. A huge number of relationships, permanent, serious and marital, start in that way. I am not talking about professors teaching sixth-formers but about graduate students teaching young lecturers and first-year undergraduates. There seems to be a huge discrepancy.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to that point. We shall not press our amendments to a Division, but we believe that there is scope for amendments that define more clearly the point that we are trying to make.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall be very clear in response to the hon. Gentleman. I am anxious to explain clearly why we oppose the amendments. If a 16 or 17-year-old is at university in the circumstances described in the Bill&#151;receiving a full-time education and subject to pressure from a teacher&#151;the Bill's provisions will apply. The Bill is designed to do that. Such students in receipt of full-time education should be protected. Students of 18, 19 or 20 are older, but students of 16 or 17 require protection. Taking a different view would undermine our purpose, which is that, at a certain age and in certain conditions, and in relation to the four principles that I have outlined, a degree of vulnerability exists that should be protected by the law. That is not unreasonable. Indeed, I am interested to know why the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon should think it unreasonable to protect the vulnerability of youth in full-time education.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I understand the Minister's reply. Even if we have failed to convince the Minister on the question of full-time education or sixth-form education, there is a difference: teachers must presume that sixth-formers are under the age of 18 if they have any idea of forming a relationship, but it would not be normal in a college or university bar, where graduate students and lecturers mix, for a teacher to assume that he is dealing with a 17-year-old and that a relationship formed with such a student would be subject to the full force of the criminal law.
<P>
The Minister mentioned pressure from teachers. I accept that a direct teaching relationship is reasonably covered by the Bill. However, the point of our amendment is that there may be no direct teaching relationship in an institution of higher education. Will the Minister explain, either now or in writing, why a relationship formed in the college bar or disco should be subject to the full force of the law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hesitate to enter the college bar or college disco. I hesitated at the time. I hesitate even more so now. However, the Bill contains a defence for circumstances such as those described by the hon. Gentleman. It would not be beyond the wit of any lawyer, whether or not he meets the definition used by the hon. Member for Hallam, to ensure acquittal. Indeed, in such circumstances, given the unlikelihood of a conviction, it would be surprising if the Crown Prosecution Service were to prosecute. That is why we have the form of defence that we do. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry to press the Minister, but I should be grateful if he would reply to my serious point, to which he has not replied, although he has dealt with the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. According to the Bill, a teacher teaching in a sixth-form college can, as the Minister said, be prosecuted for abusing his position of trust in relation to a child at that college. However, in the case of a child from another school who comes to that college, because that child does not receive full-time education in the college at which the teacher teaches, such a teacher cannot be prosecuted under the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I do not necessarily accept that. For example, schools regularly make consortium arrangements whereby students registered at different schools receive different parts of their course on different campuses. We intend that the Bill will protect children in all those different venues. I have undertaken to the hon. Member for Hertsmere to consult officials, and we shall take steps to remedy any doubt and to provide the full force and protection of the law for such pupils. I believe that they will be protected under the Bill as drafted, but if not, and if my interpretation of the clause is too wide, we shall take steps to ensure that it is sufficiently focused to catch the mischief that both hon. Gentlemen have outlined.

<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Members of the Committee will be delighted to know that I shall speak briefly. The arguments on the amendment repeat some aspects of the arguments that we heard in the previous debate. The amendment widens the scope of the offence of abuse of trust by deleting the requirement that a perpetrator be shown to be regularly&#151;the word used in the Bill&#151;involved in caring for young people. It therefore brings in those involved occasionally or irregularly in such care.
<P>
If we leave the Bill as drafted, many carers would be excluded from the ambit of the offence because they could argue that they were not regularly involved. Indeed, I believe that one of the first defences used by anyone accused of the offence would be that his involvement was on an ad hoc basis. The involvement may have been frequent but irregular, and it would be very difficult for the courts to determine whether contact was regular or irregular. I suspect that there would be long arguments and taking of evidence about the regularity of the care given, and that injustices would result. It would be against the wishes of the drafters of the Bill if abusers got off on a technicality about the regularity of their care.
<P>
The amendment might serve to tease out from the Minister what he means by ``regularly''. Many people, especially in the voluntary sector, care for young people, but do not do so regularly. Those who care for young people on an irregular basis are likely to be subject to the same degree of attention and checks on their background when they are appointed as are those who care for young people regularly, but the former may be less professionally qualified and may be more prone to abuse their position of trust.
<P>
I have points to make on the other amendments grouped with mine but, as they have not yet been spoken to, it would be impolite for me to speak on them. I shall therefore wait to do so.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> It is fortunate that the hon. Member for Gainsborough bit his tongue because I do not propose to develop an argument on the amendment. Many of the points were made in our earlier debate on the different settings in which abuse may occur.
<P>
The amendment is designed to explore whether the Bill can be improved by making a distinction between those who look after and have overall responsibility for the care of pupils in schools, and those who directly teach. It is clear that abuse of trust by those involved in direct teaching should qualify for consideration as a criminal offence, particularly if it occurs in a residential setting. Head teachers and deputy head teachers who are not involved in teaching also need to be covered by the law. The amendment does not provide for the inclusion of that training and supervisory function, so it is not appropriate to push it to a vote. However, we wanted to make the point that the Bill gives rise to misunderstandings about whether the looking after or teaching is done on a regular basis, or whether the individual just has to be in the school. Perhaps we will come back at a later stage with something that makes that point more clearly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We are trying not to go over old ground but to cover new areas to keep our proceedings moving. Amendment No. 13 highlights an important point, and I should appreciate a response from the Minister. We were impressed by some of the considerations of the working group, in which the hon. Member for Bassetlaw had a hand. A clear thread running through it was that the in loco parentis relationship was a key factor in deciding who should and who should not be covered.
<P>
In trying to explore the legal definition of in loco parentis, there was less clarity. Many people seem to understand what the term means, but there is no clear definition of it. We felt that there was some merit in considering whether it should be defined in the Bill, to allow the courts, sensible lawyers, juries and judges to decide whether a relationship was in loco parentis. I should be interested to hear whether the Minister considered making the definition of in loco parentis specific. If he did not, and is not prepared to do so, that is unfortunate when we consider that it is a common thread that people understand when describing the sort of relationship of authority that we are discussing.
<P>
Amendment No. 16 would leave out the word ``regularly'' from the clause. The Royal College of Nursing raised some questions, to which the Minister responded, about the relationship between practice nurses and school nurses. We are interested in that relationship and understand that a practice nurse is covered by existing disciplinary codes in the nursing and medical professions, whereas a school nurse is not. One of the key elements is the ``regularly'' aspect of the clause. The crucial question is whether someone who visited a school in a nursing capacity on a one-off basis would be exempt, whereas a school nurse who saw the children every term would be included. In the context of nursing, what frequency of contact is required for the courts to be satisfed that the ``regularly'' provision applies?

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 26 deals with who comes within the ambit of clause 3(7), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person looks after persons under 18 . . . if he is regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of such persons.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment raises the issue of someone who supervises the people who are in a position of trust doing the caring for, training, and so on. I know that that issue will be of interest to at least one Labour Member, and possibly others as well. We want to explore the question of those who are higher up the chain of command. I am thinking, for example, of a principal or a head who is not directly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of 16 or 17-year-olds, but who supervises others, who are older, and who have such a relationship with 16 or 17-year-olds. We want to ensure that the people who supervise those in a position of trust come within the scope of the provisions. It is sad to say that those involved in high positions of responsibility have all too often been involved in the sad episodes that we have heard about in the past. The Utting report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The abuser is often in a position of actual or presumed power or influence: in 21 of 48 alleged or proven cases of abuse in residential settings reviewed in an unpublished report, the abuser was the principal, proprietor, head or deputy of the establishment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously, that applies to children who are under 16, but it also applies to 16 and 17-year-olds. We want to explore the issue of where the people who are higher up the chain of command stand in relation to 16 and 17-year-olds.
<P>
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough about the meaning of the word ``regularly'', which leapt out of the Bill and caught my eye. Is there a precedent in any other legislation for the word ``regularly'' and what does it import from the Bill. If there is no precedent in legislation, it would help if the Minister would say what the courts mean by ``regularly'' for these purposes.
<P>
I was interested in the question asked by the hon. Member for Hallam about nurses. I received the same representations from nurses and I am sure that they are following our proceedings anxiously. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response on those points, which I shall not repeat, but I look forward to his reply.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The clause lays out the four conditions in subsections (2) to (5) when a person over 18 is said to be in a position of trust. The conditions are applicable when someone is detained in an institution by virtue of a court order or enactment; when he is looked after by the local authority, whether in foster care, residential care or semi-independent accommodation; when he is receiving health and/or social care in a residential setting, including foster homes; or when he is in full-time education. In all those situations, in order for the older person to be treated as being in a position of trust, the condition is that he or she looks after the younger person.
<P>
Clause 3(7) defines what is meant by looking after, which is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of such persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We included the word ``regularly'' because all sorts of people may train or supervise a child in one of the institutions specified in subsections (2) to (5) on a temporary or casual basis only. Someone may train a 16 or 17-year-old as a supply teacher on a day when the regular trainer is ill. Someone may teach a class on only one occasion, when it could not be said that he is regularly involved in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Any sexual activity between that person and a young person of 16 or 17 in his care is reprehensible, but it can be dealt with by other means than the criminal law. Because of the transitory nature of the contact between the person in the position of trust and the young person, it cannot be said that the relationship is unequal in the same way as when there is regular contact. In that case, we think that the sexual activity is so wrong that it should be dealt with by the criminal law. There will not be that same degree of vulnerability on the part of the child or trust in the adult, as when the older person is regularly in a position of trust.
<P>
I hesitate to go on and on, but it is a question of having a sense of proportion and balance. We do not want to create an edifice of criminal law around a situation that involves only a transient, fleeting or limited contact between an individual and a person who is vulnerable by virtue of his age.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> In a moment.
<P>
In those circumstances, it cannot be said that the nature of the contact is such to enable the older person to bear on the will of the younger person. That is what the clause is about. We are trying to achieve a degree of balance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am looking forward enormously to the contribution of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, but I do not intend that for every given situation the law should become more and more restrictive. It would clearly be brought into disrepute if we did that. There must be a sense of balance and proportion. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in the hope that that sense of balance and proportion will be maintained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> With a preview like that, I do not know whether I can do justice to what the Minister has said. Is he saying that a supply teacher who teaches a child only once or twice and initiates a relationship with the child that continues out of school and leads to a sexual relationship will not come within the scope of the Bill and, therefore, will not commit an offence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hope that I have made myself clear, but I am happy to take the hon. Gentleman through the Bill, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of such persons.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A supply teacher in for the day, while Mr. X or Mrs. Y is out, will not be caught by that provision.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am concerned and pleased to hear what the Minister has said, because I spent some time during the previous debate trying to make it clear that the position of trust between the teacher and the pupil not the position that the teacher has in relation to other teachers should determine whether a criminal offence has occurred.
<P>
The Minister is creating a problem by exempting supply teachers, given that, even if they teach only in a school on one day and in other schools on other days, they are certainly
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of such persons''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, those in full-time education.
<P>
Under the Bill, the word ``teaching'' does not imply the direct relationship, regular or otherwise, between the teacher and pupil B, as defined in the Bill. Therefore, it will be difficult for the Minister to guarantee that supply teachers who work one day a week in a given school will be exempted. Judging by his previous comments, perhaps he does not want that to happen.
<P>
The Minister said that we must be proportionate&#151;a word that I used when speaking to a previous amendment. Indeed, I was surprised, but pleased, to hear him use the same words. The position of trust between teacher A and pupil B is critical, not the question whether teacher A regularly, or otherwise, teaches other pupils. The clause is flawed, and we shall return to it in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman will return to the clause, Mr. Atkinson, as often as you allow him and as the Committee's rules permit. He seems to suggest that I have said that supply teachers are exempt; they are not. Let me make it perfectly clear that, if supply teachers regularly attend a school week after week and, therefore, bring themselves within the definition in clause 3(7)&#151;that is, if they are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of such persons''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
they will be caught under the Bill. The whole point is regularity. If supply teachers are not regularly in contact with an individual under clause 3(7), it cannot reasonably be said that they are in a position to use their will and influence to abuse their position of trust.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon must try to break a habit that I know is not easy for any Liberal Democrat to break, as it is part of his make-up. He must not continue to try to be all things to all people all the time. Our experience of the Liberal Democrats is that they try to ride both horses at once. You must not do that on such a Bill as this; you should make up your mind what side you are on.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am on no one's side.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Indeed, Mr. Atkinson. If the Liberal Democrats were on the side of effective regulation, they would not continue to suggest that the Bill was defective because it sought, through the use of the word ``regularly''&#151;a word that is not uncommon in the law&#151;to obtain a sense of proportionality. They suggest that it undermines the purpose of the Bill. It does no such thing. It is necessary to keep a sense of proportion and balance. The word ``regularly'' will inject that sense of proportion and balance into a jury's judgment about the nature of a particular relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne):</B> We have stumbled across an important legal issue. I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to deal with the question raised earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, but can he at least write to the members of the Committee setting out any precedent in English law for the word ``regularly''? For instance, in the case of supply teachers, does it mean twice, more than twice, six times or even 12 times? As has been said, the answer could be important for supply teachers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I rise simply to give way to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister has been very generous in giving way, but we are in danger of the debate continuing by intervention rather than by speech. Would hon. Members making interventions please keep them short.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Am I speaking or intervening?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As I understand it, you are intervening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That was my understanding, Mr. Atkinson. I am simply responding to the debate. I am in the hands of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I intervene to ask the Minister to indicate clearly when his remarks come to a close. The points that I wish to make cannot easily be made in an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> How much longer?
<P>
I shall respond briefly. If the hon. Gentleman wants to continue the discourse, he is free to write to me.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Hertsmere cares to turn to the Police Act 1997, he will find the term ``regularly'' in section 115. It is a term that, in this context, introduces a sense of proportionality and balance.
<P>
I turn to the other amendments that have been floated. Amendment No. 12 seeks to leave out the words ``training'' and ``supervising'' from the definition of those who are in a position of trust. By removing those words, many people who may be in a particularly strong position of trust, including most teachers, would be removed from the Bill's provisions. That cannot be right. The words ``training'' and ``supervising'' have a purpose; they will ensure that people who exercise that function and who are therefore in a position of trust do not abuse it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam is singularly retro in his desire to reintroduce Latin to our statutes. That is a backward step. The House has been struggling for centuries to draft our laws in the vernacular. Since the reformation, we have become better and better in doing just that. I hesitate to mention the reformation in the company of the hon. Member for Gainsborough, but it did happen. To reintroduce Latin phrases such as ``in loco parentis'', into our statute would be a highly retrograde step and I urge the hon. Gentleman to think again.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We use the term ``looks after'' because it better conveys the intention of the Bill. The Latin term ``in loco parentis'' is undesirably narrow and would cause confusion, although no doubt it would be of great benefit to lawyers, about whom the hon. Member for Hallam is so concerned.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 would make supervisors and those in a position of trust potentially liable to prosecution. Supervisors may not have especially close contact with the young person. They are not in the same position as others. Suddenly, the hon. Member for Hertsmere is becoming interested in the debate. He seems to have missed the point of the Bill. Our aim is not to go right up to the level of the managing director of, say, a residential home, who may have no contact with the establishment. We do not want to go up to the level of someone who has no contact with the young person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, I want to explain why we shall resist amendment No. 26. We want to ensure that we continue to adhere to the four principles that I have outlined, by which I mean those who regularly care for, train, supervise or are in sole charge of the young person. A connection with the individual who is in that position cannot of itself be sufficient to bring a person within the ambit of the criminal law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> When I drafted the amendment, I was thinking not of managing directors but of heads of establishments, school principals, heads of children's homes and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> They are covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I seek clarification. Is the Minister saying that heads of an institution who are not directly involved regularly in caring, training, supervising or who are not in sole charge of such a person, but who have a supervisory capacity&#151;as heads of establishments often do these days&#151;are covered by the provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I should have thought that it was obvious that head teachers, for example, are covered. By virtue of their office, they are involved in a supervisory, caring, training or associated role with the young peson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> How?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Well, it is obvious that they are. I cannot envisage circumstances in which a head teacher, a proprietor or governor of a particular establishment would not be in the position described in clause 3(7) of the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman can cite an example of when that would not be the case, I should like to hear it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My purpose in tabling the amendment was to explore whether such people would be covered. It occurred to the Law Society of Scotland that the issue might arise, because it suggested such an amendment to me. Will subsection (7) cover the head of an institution who begins a relationship with a 16 or 17-year-old, but who does not play a part in caring for, training or supervising, and is not in sole charge of, that person in that institution?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The head of an institution would be covered by clause 3(7), by virtue of the office. I find it difficult to conceive of a head of an institution who would not be covered. It seems fanciful to speculate that someone could run an institution but not be involved in regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of a person. By the very nature of the role, someone who is responsible for an institution is, I should have thought, obviously, regularly involved in the care of those contained in it. If the hon. Gentleman can envisage a contingency in which someone might head an institution and not be in some way regularly involved in one of the four categories of caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge, it is difficult to see what sort of a relationship such a person might have with the other person involved&#151;or am I missing something?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The vast majority of 16 and 17-year-olds who stay on in education in Sheffield are taught at Sheffield college, an organisation with 40,000 students. The critical question is whether the principal and senior management of that college, most of whom will never have met the vast majority of the students, would fall within that definition. I suspect that they may have quite good legal grounds for saying that they do not, as they have no contact whatsoever with those students.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> They may have a defence, but it will be difficult for them to say that they are not regularly involved in caring for their students, because they are. If they are not, it is difficult to see what their job involves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Let us take the example of Sheffield slightly further. Could the definition conceivably apply to people on the board of govenors or board of management of that institution, who may only irregularly have contact with students?
<P>
<B>Mr Boateng:</B> The board of management presents an interesting point about regular involvement. It would depend very much on the nature of the board's involvement and that of the individuals on the board. Some members of some boards are more regularly involved than others. Undoubtedly, that issue would need to be explored. However, the plain words of the Bill speak for themselves. A person does not have to be in sole charge of a young person to be covered by the Bill. It covers regular involvement in the four categories that the words of the Bill specify. Those words are designed to cover contingencies other than when the person is in sole charge. The additional words have a purpose&#151;to catch all those whose relationship with the young person involved is such as to raise issues of abuse in the context that the Bill is designed to cover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> As I moved the lead amendment, I do not know whether now is the appropriate time to sum up my arguments. I was going to speak against amendment No. 13, tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Hallam, which introduces the words ``in loco parentis'', until I heard the attack by the Minister on Latin, which I can only describe as Latinist. Presumably, he does not mind discriminating against Latin, because it is a dead language&#151;rather like a dead parrot, which is no doubt why the Liberal party favours the amendment.
<P>
I wish to speak to amendment No. 16. The matter before the Committee is serious. The amendment would delete the word ``regularly''. The Minister is aware of the Pepper v. Hart case. The courts will be very confused when they read the debates on amendments to clause 3. They will pore over every word from this very articulate Minister. His words run away with him&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> He talks a lot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> He talks a lot, but very well. How will the courts be able to determine the meaning of ``regularly''? They will face enormous difficulties in that respect and I hope that the Minister will clear up the matter on Report, because the clause as drafted is shot through with holes. It will be easy for a lawyer&#151;I shall not use the pejorative term ``clever lawyer''&#151;to find a way out for his client. I intend to press my amendment to vote.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is not a criticism of the hon. Member, but the normal convention of the Committee is that members debate and make their points, the Minister winds up, the hon. Member who moved the amendment sums up and occasionally the Minister comes back a second time. The debate is in danger of getting out of control. I should be grateful if everyone who speaks would remember the normal convention in Committee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am grateful for your clarifying remarks, Mr. Atkinson. I want to raise a problem with the clause. The Minister was aware of it when he launched his churlish attack on the Liberal Democrats, which was water off a duck's back at this stage in a Parliament.
<P>
I do not have a problem with the retention of the work ``regularly'', but by means of amendment No. 16 I want to draw the Minister's attention to a problem in the phrasing of clause 3(7). I raise the matter in the spirit of constructive opposition. We would be disappointed if the Minister did not get upset with us from time to time for pointing out problems. He did that so well himself when he was in Opposition, even if he did not necessarily agree with the amendment under consideration.
<P>
I listened carefully to what the Minister said when he read out the last four words in clause 3(7). He said that it stated that someone was ``in sole charge of such a person''. On another occasion&#151;the record should be checked carefully&#151;he said, ``In sole charge of the young person''. The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that the clause specified sole charge of ``such a person'', not ``such persons''. The phrasing is critical; subsection (7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person looks after persons under 18 for the purposes of this section if he is regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of such persons.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The ``such persons'' referred to do not relate to such persons as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``B . . . receiving such education''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but to the fourth, fifth and sixth words of that subsection, that is, ``persons under 18''.
<P>
The point is important in considering the position of a supply teacher, which the Minister rightly does not want to catch if the teacher does not regularly teach in the school where B is in full time education. Supply teachers will, by their nature&#151;unless they do just one afternoon a week or work as locums all over the place&#151;be regularly involved in different settings in, let us say, schools P, Q, R and S, looking after persons under 18 by being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of such persons'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is persons under 18 receiving education.
<P>
If the Minister is keen for the ad hoc supply teacher taking one lesson not to be covered, subsection (7) will have to be redrafted because the expression ``such persons'' relates to persons under 18.
<P>
There is clearly a problem and it goes back to the flaw underlying the clause that I have raised before. The phrasing of subsection (7), when taken with subsection (5), is a peculiar way of defining the position of trust. I believe, and this view is shared by my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam, that the position of trust should be defined between teacher A and person B and not between teacher A and a group of other people into which wider relationship person B may briefly intervene.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister drew attention to the position of someone who teaches on a Saturday morning who, he correctly feels, should not be covered even though there is a direct educational relationship, albeit for only one hour and even though there may be duress because the student needs a grade in that subject. The Minister used the trivial example of mah-jongg, but it may well be maths, physics, chemistry or a useful subject like that. I would even expand it to the humanities. The possibility of duress may exist where a good grade is needed. It is much more important to cover that situation than to cover a large sixth-form institution where teacher A does not and will not teach or be the form teacher or pastoral carer of person B. The hon. Member for High Peak talked about the corporate responsibility of the teaching profession, but that does not apply sufficiently to cover the latter situation, which is more nebulous than the one hour on a Saturday morning, and to make the clause proportionate.
<P>
If one talks about the corporate responsibility of teachers, one must incorporate supply teachers. The regularity of the interaction of a supply teacher with B's school or with B him or herself, is not as important as the direct relationship between A and B. I come back to my earlier point: subsection (7) is flawed because ``such persons'' does not refer to anyone other than persons under 18 and will catch supply teachers. Indeed, if the mah-jongg teacher teaches person B on a Saturday and lots of other people at other times of the week, he will be covered by the clause.
<P>
This is not a criticism of the Minister's stance on the amendments that we have discussed, but I ask him to look carefully at what I have said and to consider either writing to us or coming back with a revision or clarification of his remarks relating to subsection (7).

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Do any other members of the Committee wish to speak before the Minister wraps up for the fourth time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response, which was courteous as ever. I detected a slight amount of sensitivity and defensiveness. I can assure the Minister that I was seeking only to explore the clause to make sure that it was as cast iron and comprehensive as it could be. My amendment was inspired by the Law Society of Scotland which cast its eye over the clause and thought that the issue was something that needed exploring.
<P>
I take what the Minister says, but I should like to put a scenario to him. We need to be careful about people in positions of higher responsibility in institutions. They are often in a strong position, not just in relation to the young person but in relation to people beneath them and their colleagues. Let us take the example of the Sheffield institution which the hon. Member for Hallam described. The principal of that institution, with all the many students who come within it, is not regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of a particular 16 or 17-year-old in that institution. On one occasion they meet and he perhaps offers a lift home and then goes on to develop a relationship with that person. Will that principal definitely be covered by the wording of the Bill, even though he may not be involved on a day-to-day basis or any other basis in caring? If that is the case, I will happily accept it from the Minister: it is what I sought to clarify.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will give way to the Minister in a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I do not want to intervene; I want to reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will wait for the Minister's reply, but I make no apologies&#151;I noticed a brief ripple of discontent&#151;about the need to be careful in the light of the Utting report, which made it clear that abusers were often in positions of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``actual or presumed power or influence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the principal, proprietor, head or deputy of the establishment''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as having been involved in abuse. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Other alleged or actual abusers have been active in local union or political circles. Some were bullies who inspired physical or moral fear in colleagues and managers. In at least one case staff were reluctant to press complaints lest they appeared to oppose the equal opportunities policies of their authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report continued about the extent of the managerial authority possessed by some abusers. We must be cast-iron about this matter.
<P>
That brings me to the case of the supply teacher, which emerged from the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. The Minister argued that the position of trust arose only when a person was regularly involved in teaching or caring for a young person. He said that he was taking a ``balanced and proportional'' view of the matter. I can understand his argument, but I was not entirely convinced by it. Many of my constituents&#151;and, I suspect, his as well&#151;would regard anybody who teaches as being in a position of trust and responsibility at all times. The fact that they are teaching at any time is what puts them in a position of trust and responsibility. So long as they remain in that teaching position, so they will remain in a position of trust.
<P>
I remain concerned about supply teachers and I have to say that the Minister's idea of a position of trust is not the same as mine. Let me put this example to him. If I am fed up with hoarding my savings beneath my bed, decide to go to a solicitor who is good and trustworthy by repute, entrust him with my savings and find that the next day he has made off to Acapulco on the strength of my savings, has not that solicitor broken his position of trust with me&#151;even though it is the only time that I have ever entrusted my savings to him? According to the Minister's logic, that solicitor could turn round and say, ``No, I was not in a position of trust because I did not regularly look after your savings''. I would say that as a solicitor, that man remained in a position of trust at all times&#151;and the same applies to a teacher.
<P>
As I said, I am concerned about the position of supply teachers. We need to know from the Minister how many times supply teachers have to teach before bringing themselves within the ambit of the Bill. A loophole and an anomaly are being created and I invite the Minister&#151;in view of the constructive debate on all sides&#151;to take the provision away and have another look at it. I am asking the Minister not to guarantee anything on Report but merely to reconsider the issue.
<P>
I repeat that many of my constituents regard someone who teaches their child as being in a position of trust by virtue of their position as a teacher&#151;no matter how many times that child is taught. Many members of the public would take that view and would find it surprising that the Bill draws a distinction&#151;as the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough teased out&#151;between supply and other teachers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Let me first deal with a semantic point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. My references to ``such a person'' were in response to the specific examples put by the hon. Member for Hertsmere&#151;and similarly with his own references to ``such a person''. The monstrous edifice that developed at the hands of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon as he explored that semantic was utterly misguided. The specific example given by the hon. Member for Hertsmere does not refer to clause 3(7). ``Such persons'' referred to in subsection (7) are persons in that institution. The hon. Member for Gainsborough is always concerned about Pepper v. Hart, so let us be crystal clear about the purpose of this subsection. The Bill covers a supply teacher who teaches at a school once a week. Such a teacher does not necessarily have to teach the individual with whom he or she enters a relationship. Teaching at the school is sufficient for him or her to be covered by the Bill.
<P>
A supply teacher who comes to the school once a year, or perhaps even once every few years, cannot be regarded as being in regular contact with the person under 18 for whom clause 3(7) makes provision. Such a teacher will not be caught by the Act.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon may not like supply teachers being caught in that way. However, that is the Bill's intention and, in due course, I hope that it will become Parliament's manifest will.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about principals. When such a principal comes within the provisions of clause 3(7), he or she will be covered by the Bill. I cannot envisage circumstances in which the principal of an institution&#151;whether a school, a residential home, a community home, a voluntary home, a mental nursing home, a nursing home, a private hospital, or any institution that the Bill refers to&#151;could be other than regularly involved, by virtue of his or her office, in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of persons under 18. A principal who falls into one of those categories is covered by the Bill. When the Bill is enacted, such persons will be subject to the full force of criminal law.
<P>
That is our intention, and I ask the Committee to give effect to it.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have been at the clause for some time; although I am prepared&#151;reluctantly&#151;to allow a stand part debate, I hope that hon. Members will not recover ground and that they will be brief. If not, I shall remember them.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I have every intention of not disappointing you on that score. However, it is right to say a few words because once we accept that clause 1 is hived off because the House voted on Second Reading to lower the age of consent, clause 3 becomes the key clause. It is the heart and soul of the Bill and it is important that we get it right; indeed, members of the Committee have a duty to do so.
<P>
We all know the massive concern that exists in our constituencies about sexual offences and about paedophilia in particular. Only last night a constituent, a distraught mother of children, was on the phone to me about such issues. Hon. Members will remember the recent, highly publicised case in my constituency of two little girls from Hastings who were abducted by one of my constituents.
<P>
There has been a ``Through the Looking-Glass'' quality to many of the speeches in the debates on clause 3. The debate is about the abuse of trust and&#151;which is why the clause is so important&#151;about how we define a position of trust. It is precisely because of the, in my view misguided, decision of the House to lower the age of consent that we are obliged to ensure clear safeguards in the sort of situations that have debated at such length.
<P>
The Government recognise that lowering the age of consent will result in a significantly enhanced danger to young people&#151;otherwise, they would not have lavished so much time, attention and drafting skills on producing the provisions in the clause. [Interruption.] I am surprised that that produces disagreement on the Labour Benches; I hope that some of our more silent colleagues will develop the point. The reason why we are here, and have been here for some days, is the decision to lower the age of consent. We therefore need new legal provisions to meet a perceived danger&#151;[Interruption.] I am happy to hear from hon. Members, in interventions or their own speeches.
<P>
Two distinct philosophies have emerged in our debate. While we recognise&#151;or at least Opposition Members do so&#151;that these are matters for a free vote and a free expression of views, my hon. Friends' and my overarching belief is that we need to make the provisions as iron-clad as is humanly possible so as to protect vulnerable young people. The Government have taken a different view; they have made proposals that may not be watertight and may be too narrow. The Liberal Democrats have tabled amendments that would loosen and weaken even the Government's measures to protect young people.
<P>
We have had a long debate&#151;you will be relieved, Mr. Atkinson, to know that I do not intend to repeat it&#151;about the meaning of ``regularly''; whether it means once a week and so on. A doubt exists in my mind, and would surely exist in a court's mind, if the matter got that far&#151;as it surely one day will&#151;about whether a supply teacher is covered. That example is a particularly good one. However, the Bill does not even attempt to cover people such as vicars, choirmasters and scout leaders&#151;or a range of others who hold positions of trust that could be abused.
<P>
Our debates have been extremely important in trying to put the Bill to rights, but what matters most is clause 3. Once a decision is made to lower the age of consent, the onus switches firmly to those who were in favour of lowering the age of consent on Second Reading to make absolutely sure that as a result of that decision, which I believe is misguided, as few young people of 16 or 17 as possible will suffer anguish and agony at the hands of those in positions of trust&#151;whether as defined in the Bill or as I have defined in a broader sense. I hope that we can return to some of the more specific and detailed issues at a later stage in our consideration of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I wish to develop one theme, check one point and pose one dilemma. The theme that I wish to develop arises out of remarks made at three different points in our debates on clause 3. One is to do with the word ``full-time'', one with the word ``regularly'' and one, which was merely touched on by the Minister, with the word ``sole'' in ``sole charge''. I had the impression, whenever we tried to pose a problem that could be raised by the use of those words, that the Minister's approach was, using a Latin expression, to adopt the technique of reductio ad absurdum.
<P>
For instance, with regard to full-time, the Minister said that it would be ridiculous if a teacher who came in casually for an hour a week were to be caught by the Bill. However, he did not answer my question, which was what would happen to a teacher who came in for a substantial part of a child's timetable but who was not technically full-time but three-quarters of full time, or even four-fifths, five-sixths or seven-eighths of full time.
<P>
The Minister may have shown how ridiculous my question was at one end of the spectrum, but it is far from ridiculous at the other end. The danger is that the lawyers will have a field day trying to escape the provisions of clause 3 by showing that the teacher who apparently broke the law did not engage in full-time education.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member is going back over territory that we have already debated in detail. I ask him to move on.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I wish only to illustrate the summary theme, so I shall confine myself now to one sentence on each of the other two words to illustrate the point.
<P>
The Minister referred to a fleeting contact when talking of ``regularly''. In fact, it is the same dilemma. On the question of being in sole charge&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is going back over matters that we have already debated. That is not the purpose of a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I conclude from the overall impression of those three cases that a flaw exists in the clause as a whole. In all three cases, we are being offered a defence that negates a range of possibilities. Most people would see is as an anomaly that some people will be caught by the Bill and others will not, when, according to the circumstances of the case, there was little moral difference in what they had been doing. That is the theme.
<P>
I wish to ask the Minister&#151;sadly, he is not here&#151;why a teacher is permitted to have a relationship with someone whom he does not teach and who is a student at another school. I do not think that that point was raised earlier, Mr. Atkinson, so I am not going over what has already been said. What would happen if a teacher had a relationship with a pupil from another school&#151;someone whom he was not teaching&#151;and one or other of them were subsequently transferred to the same education establishment? I should be grateful if the Minister would address that point.
<P>
I conclude by posing a dilemma. If there were to be a vote on clause 3 stand part, I and others of a similar view would be in a quandary. On one hand, the clause could save some young people from improper and inappropriate relationships. However, the clause will also enshrine in law a rag bag of anomalies, which will give lawyers a field day. The provision will be rightly seen as a palliative and a sop, and an inconsistent set of proposals that could cause injustice even if it protects a few more people, who should not have been put at risk by the Bill in the first place.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> As has been said, clause 3 is the substantive part of the Bill. Anxiety about its wide drafting has marked all our debates on amendments. An example was given of a 17-year-old at university who has to wear a badge that states, ``forbidden fruit''. The Minister has never demurred from the fact that such a 17-year-old would be covered by the Bill. He said that the matter could be left to the good judgment of the courts, an English jury and the prosecutors. That is a cop-out. It is the job of legislation to frame measures carefully. All the abuses of trust that I envisage could be covered by a more tightly drawn catchment, which did not include young teachers who are in relationships that are wrong, but who are subject to a professional code.
<P>
Will the Minister reassure the Committee that he will review the Bill, especially clause 3, if the wide drafting leads to many more false accusations and few successful prosecutions of teachers who are in relationships with pupils whom they do not teach, and of whom they are not in charge in a residential school?
<P>
Finally, I want to dissociate the Liberal Democrats from the remarks of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson). The clause is entirely separate from the reduction in the age of consent. That provision was included in the measure for convenience. The Government have said that often, and the hon. Member for Bassetlaw accepts that point. We accept the Government's sincerity on that. The provisions apply to girls, who are the main victims of the abuses of trust that we have discussed. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw made that point early in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman accepts that, in the real world, as opposed to that inhabited by the Liberal Democrats, the two issues are covered in the same measure because of the sterling efforts of hon. Members from all parties, not least the hon. Member for Bassetlaw, when the issue came before the House previously?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> No, I do not belive that. The Utting report was so clear about what needed to be done that, regardless of the age of consent provisions, the measure was required to deal with many settings, especially residential settings. The need would have existed even if the age of consent provisions had been passed in another place under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>
We wanted the reduction in the age of consent to be covered by a separate measure to prevent the hon. Member for Eastbourne and hon. Members who agree with him from associating reduction in the age of consent with the need for special protection for 16 to 18-year-old consenting males. Young males do not especially need such protection. Abuse of trust affects heterosexuals and homosexuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I shall be brief. I associate myself especially with the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Eastbourne and for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), who covered many points.
<P>
I tell the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that I hope that no teachers at university or elsewhere look upon people over whom they have a duty of care, and for whom they stand in loco parentis, as fruit, forbidden or otherwise. Perhaps I am rather naive.
<P>
The Miniser has been extremely articulate, as one would expect. I suspect that he is a very able lawyer&#151;some might describe him as a clever lawyer. In fact, I am rather surprised that he is not a Queen's Counsel. I am adding a little flattery. However, on this occasion he has shown flawed logic, and tried to bluster his way through it. At one point he appeared to use an argument that he opposed in the previous debate, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon demonstrated. The debate has shown confusion throughout.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Labour members of the Committee, most of whom are, I fear, here only to make up the numbers, have shown some impatience. The person who chuntered away most impatiently is the Whip, who is not present. Here we are making law, the consequences of which we should understand. One consequence is that people will go to prison, so it is very important to get the law right. The clause disturbs me. There are elements of confusion among my hon. Friends following the Minister's remarks, and my hon. Friends and I have certainly discovered anomalies in the clause.
<P>
The clause does not define accurately the meaning of the term ``position of trust'', which is what it was designed to do. The Minister was rude about Latin, which I regret, as Latin has added a great deal to our language, not least the roots of most of it. The Minister himself brought up the phrase ``in loco parentis'' as the third part of&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are straying on to ground already covered. We are discussing what is in the clause, not what the hon. Gentleman would have liked to be in it. If he wanted something included, he should have tabled an amendment and persuaded the Committee to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I apologise for straying, Mr. Atkinson. But the Minister used the term several times throughout the debate, not on any particular ground.
<P>
In defining the clause, and the terms ``position of trust'' and ``in loco parentis'', we must make their meaning clear beyond doubt. The Bill does not do that. People to whom others entrust the care of children should know precisely what they mean. We as parents, and constituents who are parents, expect the House and the Committee to make sure that the term ``position of trust'', as they understand it, is explained clearly. The clause is flawed&#151;indeed, the whole Bill seems flawed. The Minister would be wise to withdraw it and await the results of his review, but I know that he will not do that. The clause is bad law; many people will be greatly confused and lawyers may have a field day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> In deciding what to say in the debate, I resolved to try to understand the Minister a little better. I consulted Gay Times, where a beautiful picture of him adorns the entire front page under the heading ``It's a matter of trust.'' The article continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Paul Boateng is the sort of Government minister you hope you can trust. He has all the right credentials.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``He became the MP for Brent South in 1987, in the dark days of the Thatcherite nightmare''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also states what he would like to forget&#151;I hope that the Prime Minister is not listening&#151;that in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the 1980s, he was a prominent member of the Greater London Council''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that he wishes to forget that. The article states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Paul is the sort of Minister you hope you can trust.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure that we can trust the clause as it is now drafted.
<P>
We know even before we begin that the clause contains a massive loophole in that a person would be able to escape the Bill's operation if an offence was already under way when it came into law. The Minister has, so far as he is concerned, a nice, tidy Bill. But we know that there are massive anomalies&#151;that the Bill does not cover part-time pupils, step-parents, youth workers or occasional supply teachers. No wonder the Home Office had admitted that there will be only 10 to 15 prosecutions a year.
<P>
That is hardly surprising. No wonder the Home Office described the abuse of trust provisions as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``a very limited legal criminal offence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Exactly. That is the type of offence that the Minister wanted to introduce. We know that the Home Office and the Minister drafted clause 3 as&#151;

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> A sop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> As my hon. Friend says, the provision has been drafted as a sop. There will be only 10 or 15 prosecutions a year. We know why the Bill is so drafted; it is a sop for the hon. Member for Bassetlaw, who has a neighbouring constituency to mine. The Bill will not catch many people. As was revealed in our debate, many people will not be covered by it.
<P>
The Bill proposes an absurd situation whereby if a child is taught by someone from another school, that person will not be covered. The Minister must propose new measures on Report. Labour Members shake their heads. I am sorry, but I cannot repeat details of the debate; they were made clear at the time.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere referred to sixth form colleges. As he said, an increasingly large percentage of our school population between the ages of 16 and 18, who receive some education at a sixth form college, will not be covered. The Minister's defence in the face of our arguments is that such matters must be carefully defined in law.
<P>
Other legislation has no difficulty in meeting the points that we have raised this afternoon. Law on domestic violence has no difficulty in protecting adults who cohabit. Family courts deal all the time with residence and parental responsibility orders. The Minister could have drafted the Bill far more widely to ensure that children are protected. Tens of thousands of children, will not be protected, which is a matter of great regret.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I did not plan to speak in this stand part debate, but I have been provoked to do so by reading the article to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough referred. I regard the Bill as an opportunity to protect children. I hope that I have not drawn any inappropriate distinctions. I am looking to protect both boys and girls from men and women.
<P>
I am sure that members of the gay community will share every bit as strongly as other sections of the community the wish to protect children. They will have at the back of their minds, as others do, the question, ``Is this important clause doing enought to protect children?'' I make no apologies for going into some detail when I speak to amendments and for exploring how best we can give children protection to ensure that all those who should be covered are so covered. After listening to the debates, however, I shall have that question in the back of my mind.
<P>
I do not want to go back over old ground, but the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made an important point when he referred to the Utting report, which is the background to the Bill. That report dealt mainly with children, often in residential care, who were under the age of 16. The Bill will do nothing for them. We wish that we had the opportunity to amend it so that it does. I cannot take the matter any further now, but I feel very strongly about it because those children are in the greatest need of protection.
<P>
Have other children been left out because the definition of a position of trust is not drawn as appropriately as it could be? We have raised some important issues and there are question marks in my mind as to whether all the children who should be covered will be covered. We may ask such questions again in the future.
<P>
The article to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough referred concerned the review of sexual offences that is being undertaken. In the eyes of the person who wrote the article, the Minister was a little cagey about the timetable of that review and would not be drawn on it. The article states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the review could take a year and then there will be a period of . . . consultation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That underlines the need now to take the opportunity to do all that we can. We shall continue to think about the Bill in those terms and do all that we can. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the debates flexibly and constructively to see whether it is possible to do far more than we are currently doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We have listened with great interest to this clause stand part debate, but I am bound to say that aspects of it concerned me. The speech of the hon. Member for Eastbourne was less than helpful; he did not fully appreciate the context of either the clause or the Bill.
<P>
The Bill is very much part of taking forward an agenda of protecting children and vulnerable people to which the Government are committed. Any examination of the research&#151;not least, the document ``Sex Offending Against Children: Understanding the Risk'', to which we have referred&#151;will clearly show that by far the greatest risk is of heterosexual offences against children and young people.
<P>
We are not in the business of pitting heterosexual against homosexual, man against woman or boy against girl. We want to protect childhood and children. It matters not whether the predator comes from the ranks of one gender or another. The important thing is that children must be protected. It is in that context and in that spirit that I hope all members of the Committee will view the clause. It is in that context that the debate should be conducted.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw has from the outset made clear the basis on which he supports the Bill. He does so having been a lifelong campaigner for the rights and interests of children. It is important, not least because of the attention that is given to the Committee's proceedings, that we make it absolutely crystal clear that we want to protect the rights and interests of children, and we believe that clause 3 meets our needs and requirements.
<P>
This debate has been useful; it has undoubtedly highlighted certain matters. We shall reflect on the quality and nature of the debate in Committee to be sure that the Bill catches all those whom we intend it to catch. I am perfectly clear in my own mind that it fulfills our purposes and intentions.
<P>
Any teacher who regularly goes into a school is covered by this Bill, regardless of whether he or she is a supply or other teacher. I shall consider whether any group falls outside the ambit of the Bill, especially in relation to full-time education that is split between locations and institutions. We shall table any amendment necessary to deal with that.
<P>
Similarly, in response to the point made by the hon. Member for New Forest, East, a teacher and a pupil who start a sexual relationship must end it if they move into a relationship of trust. If they do not, the position of trust will be abused. On that basis, I hope that the clause will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part ofthe Bill.
