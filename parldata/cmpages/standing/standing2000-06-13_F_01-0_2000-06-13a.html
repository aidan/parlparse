<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
May I say that I hope that it will be a relatively brief Committee, Mr. Stevenson, and that it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I know that it must be difficult for you, given that the Committee follows the crash of a prominent soccer team last night, but then I do not take a great deal of interest in the subject.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do you mean Stoke City's failure to be promoted?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I hope, Mr. Stevenson, that you will enjoy the Committee's proceedings as much as we shall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. As we said on Second Reading, the Opposition welcome the Bill. It started life under the previous Administration in response to the real concerns expressed by the accountancy and legal professions about the unwarranted and unacceptable personal exposure to liabilities that can result from the business activities of partnerships. We therefore would not expect the sittings to start any earlier than 10.30 am on Tuesdays or 10 am on Thursdays.
<P>
I concur with the Minister in saying that the Committee's proceedings are likely to be brief. However, they may not be as brief as the Minister would like because we have an important scrutiny role. The Bill will receive considerable further Opposition scrutiny because, despite the enormous scrutiny that it has already received, several concerns remain unanswered. Consultation documents were published by the previous Conservative Government in February 1997. That was followed by detailed scrutiny and a report by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. Another draft Bill and consultation document was issued in July 1999, and the Bill was finally published in November 1999.
<P>
Thanks to the exemplary work done by my noble Friend Baroness Buscombe, significant changes were made to the Bill, which makes it a far better proposition as it begins its Committee stage here than when it began that stage in the other place. However, we are still concerned about some issues, such as the default provisions in partnership law, which have been debated at length. A consultation document on the matter was published in February 2000 and a summary of responses and the Government's reaction to them was published in May. The debate covered by those documents is important and I hope that we shall be able to refer to it.
<P>
One of the Committee's legitimate and important roles is to ensure that the Government do not indulge in an excessive use of secondary legislation. That matter was raised in the other place by the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation. That Committee considered the use of Henry VIII clauses, of giving the power through secondary legislation to amend principal Acts of Parliament and of using secondary legislation to import into those rules indictable criminal offences and punishment. We, too, shall need to give particular attention to those matters if we are to carry out our primary task of scrutinising the probity of the Bill. Too much of the meat of the Bill appears to be by way of secondary legislation.
<P>
There seems to have been plenty of consultation, not all of which was taken on board by the Government, but some of the debate should take place in public and not behind closed doors. The Committee is an appropriate place to discuss such matters.
<P>
One issue raised in the consultations on the regulations that are to be made under the Bill is the importing into its provisions of the company law requirement to disclose the earnings of the highest paid member of the limited liability partnership in the notes to the published accounts. The reason for that requirement under company law is to ensure that shareholders are aware of those important facts, to which they would not otherwise have access. They are not important to third party creditors in assessing the viability of a company. However, in the case of a limited liability partnership, the members are the shareholders, so they already have that information. Therefore, to incorporate that requirement into the legislation on limited liability partnerships is nothing but left-wing prurience.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It is a long time since I have been called a left winger and I have never been called prurient. However, is it not the case that limited liability partnerships will have clients who should know exactly what the financial situation is within the partnership to which they are entrusting their custom?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is not a matter for the law or for the Government. It is up to the provider of services to the client to decide whether to disclose that information. The law's purpose is to provide protection for third party creditors when we, as legislators, create an artificial body—either a company or a limited liability partnership—with its own legal personality. It is important that the Government do not take the line of being too prurient as a result of their egalitarian concern with what people in the private sector earn. Down that route lies a socialist economy, which will ultimately create an absence of the wealth that we would all like to spend on social services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fabricant </B>(Lichfield): My hon. Friend will be aware of the John Lewis Partnership plc, which is a contradiction in terms, but perhaps I shall have an opportunity to explain the relevance of that a little later. Before the previous election, the Prime Minister said that the John Lewis Partnership plc was the perfect example of a stakeholder. Its chairman earns £450,000 a year—and worth every pound—but people who work on the shop floor earn as little as £11,000 a year. That demonstrates that there are differences in earning capability even in the case of a stakeholder.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I look forward to hearing his comments about that partnership, of which I am especially fond after taking delivery of various goods. It provides a really good service. However, my point is that consultation has taken place on a whole range of regulatory matters relating to the Bill, many of which I should like to debate in Committee. The consultation document states that none of the consultees supported the disclosure of the earnings attributable to the highest paid member. The most common objection was that the information would not provide any greater protection for third parties, but despite the fact that none of the consultees supported the measure, the Government's response was to ignore all the consultees' views and to proceed regardless.
<P>
That is not something that we can debate in Committee, despite its relative importance. Some professional partnerships believe that disclosure is an important issue because it will deter some law firms from becoming limited liability partnerships, which will mean that they cannot take advantage of the new structure that they believe is vital in helping them to recruit and retain new staff. However, despite its importance, the issue has been relegated to secondary legislation. Default provisions and whether to legislate for a general duty of care are important matters, which should be included in primary legislation so that the Committee could debate those issues.
<P>
On Second Reading, in answering concerns about whether the Administration of Justice Act 1960 would need to be amended to enable law firms to take advantage of the new limited liability partnership format, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Further consideration is being given to the necessary changes and to how they could be given legislative effect.—[Official Report, 23 May 2000; Vol. 350, c. 891.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was on 23 May and it is now 13 June, so considerable time has elapsed during which consideration should have taken place. I trust that the Minister will use one of the Committee's sittings to explain the outcome of that consideration because many firms of solicitors, as well as the Law Society, which raised the concern originally, will be interested to hear his response.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister also mentioned a proposal that the Government might introduce in next year's Finance Bill—should this Administration be in office next April—to counteract the use of limited liability partnerships for tax avoidance schemes. The Minister said that such new measures would not be intended,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to undermine the commercial certainty of limited liability partnerships' taxation treatment for those businesses for which limited liability partnership status was intended. That will be at the forefront of our minds, whatever options are proposed. [Official Report, 23 May 2000; Vol. 350, c. 891.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, any statement by the Minister will create the very uncertainty that he is seeking to avoid, so given that this is a new legal entity, which legal and tax experts have sweated over for the past three years, I hope that the Minister will find an opportunity to explain precisely what measures the Government intend to introduce in next year's Finance Bill. I do not want to hear that that is a matter for the Chancellor, which cannot be disclosed before the Finance Bill is published, because that is nonsense. Technical changes to Acts of Parliament may be announced way in advance of the Budget statement. In fact, such provisions may even be published in draft before the publication of the Bill. That would deal with the uncertainty that the Minister has created and would help to ensure that limited liability partnerships are successful. Given the great amount of scrutiny that the Bill has already received, and given the considerable support for the Bill from Conservative Members, I believe that the sittings motion should be adequate to ensure that the Bill receives the detailed scrutiny that it deserves, provided the Minister is prepared to listen and act on our remaining concerns.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): May I also welcome you, Mr. Stevenson? I have served under your deft, wise and patient chairmanship in previous Committees.
<P>
We, too, support the principle behind the Bill, as we made clear on Second Reading, and as my colleagues in another place also confirmed. Nevertheless, the Bill could and should be significantly improved. Joint and several liability in this world economy can be especially unfair. Therefore, the law is ripe for change. However, the price for limited liability should be full disclosure to protect creditors, customers and clients. A good deal of the legislation will be introduced in regulations, which we deprecate, because many of those matters should be included in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) referred to the impact of the Bill on the solicitors' profession. I should disclose that I am a qualified solicitor. I should also add that I am no longer connected with any firm of solicitors. I believe that I am owed some money by a firm of solicitors in which I used to be a partner, but other than that, I have no connection with any firm. However, I hope that I shall have an opportunity to move new clause 1. It is nonsensical that the solicitors' profession should be the only profession or business that is unable to become a limited liability partnership, a matter to which I hope to revert in future. Nevertheless, we support the thrust of the Bill and hope that it progresses speedily through Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> May I, too, say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson? I echo what the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) said about your wisdom and experience. In addition, you are a fellow Staffordshire Member of Parliament and, although I would not expect you to be too indulgent when it comes to my excesses, I hope that that factor will influence my attempts to speak just a little. However, I do not intend to speak for more than an hour, or even five minutes.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I welcome the Bill. Times have changed since the Partnership Act 1890 was introduced. The idea of joint and several liability in large partnerships is out of place in the modern world. Britain has led the way in financial institutions, especially our large firms of chartered accountants and solicitors. Sadly, they are not covered by the Bill. The Minister should explain that decision at length. It is important that partners are afforded protection. Some people might be unwilling to join a firm if they were jointly and severally liable.
<P>
I want to mention the strange case of the John Lewis Partnership plc, which is probably the first example of a limited liability partnership. The organisation was given in trust to its staff. It has 45,000 partners. Instead of a dividend being declared to shareholders, each partner receives a bonus at the end of the year that is a percentage of his or her salary. However, to protect the whole organisation, the trust is held by trustees and the assets are held by a £100 plc, which is not quoted on the stock exchange. It is an unhomogeneous hybrid organisation which, for the sake of the partners, tries to get around the rules of normal partnership. It will be interesting to see what its chairman, Sir Stuart Hampson, decides to do when the Bill becomes law.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, the idea was originally the Conservative's. How nice it is that the Government are treading in the footsteps of the previous Administration—how wise of them, too—and how good it is to know that the Minister is no longer left wing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Is the Conservative party going to follow the practice that it employed last time the Labour party picked up an idea from its manifesto? It decided to repudiate that idea and opposed the Bill that became the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1998.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am allowing a wide-ranging debate on the sittings motion. There will be ample opportunity for Committee members to make their points when we discuss the clauses and amendments. I do not want the Committee to cite political history, recent though it may be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I also want to echo the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made about Henry VIII clauses. Too many blank cheques have been written in the Palace of Westminster. We have passed Acts of Parliament with huge spaces that are filled by statutory instrument Committees. There is insufficient scrutiny of that legislation, which is a dangerous move. Some Bills—I shall not name them, first, because it would be out of order and, secondly, because we all know what they are—have not received sufficient scrutiny. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) has been accused of prolonging debate when, in fact, prolonged debate has provided the scrutiny that is necessary to protect the Government. Without it, they might introduce Bills that need to be corrected or—in one case—torn in half and discarded.
<P>
It is dangerous to have parts of Bills in which the future is not clear. We are writing a blank cheque. That is not to say that some elements, especially with regard to charges and penalties, cannot be dealt with by a statutory instrument Committee because certain factors will vary according to inflation and changes in the business community. General principles of law should not be dealt with by statutory instruments and secondary legislation. They should be considered on the Floor of the House. On that point, I disagree with the principle, or rather the detail, of the Bill.
<P>
Having said that, the Bill is long overdue. I wish it a fair wind. Under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson, it will be concluded sooner rather than later. I wish my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton every success—and I will support him in persuading the Government to make the changes necessary to enable the business community to prosper under the current difficult conditions.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved, That, during proceedings on the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice is required of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that are reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Limited liability partnerships</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I hope that the Minister will move the clause. As the Bill is short, the Minister should move all the clauses so that we have on record the Government's purpose in each.
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister would address one particular issue. Clause 1(2)(a) refers to the concept of ``oversea limited liability partnership''. Will the Minister explain what that means as far as the Bill is concerned? In clause 14(2), the Bill creates the power to make regulations in respect of the winding up of an ``oversea limited liability partnership''. Have such regulations been published in draft? If not, will the Minister confirm whether such regulations will be forthcoming and if so, when?
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is concerned about the issue of ``oversea limited liability partnership''. It states in its briefing that it is concerned that the existing classification of foreign limited liability partnerships is not always consistent. It gives the example of a recent High Court case in which the Inland Revenue refused to confirm that a Jersey registered limited partnership would be treated as a partnership for United Kingdom tax purposes rather than a body corporate. However, certain United States limited liability partnerships, which operate in the United Kingdom through branches, are treated as partnerships. Later in the briefing, the institute states that the purposes introduction of United Kingdom limited liability partnerships provides an opportunity to ensure that the treatment of overseas limited liability partnerships for United Kingdom tax purposes is consistent. It would make sense to treat all overseas limited liability partnerships as United Kingdom limited liability partnerships for the purposes of UK taxation. That may require the re-classification of existing entities as limited liabilities partnerships. Perhaps the Minister could address that issue.
<P>
Clause 1(5) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>except as far as otherwise provided by this Act or any other enactment, the law relating to partnerships does not apply to a limited liability partnership.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That touches on the coming debate on clause 5. For now, however, will the Minister explain why that phrase appears in the Bill? What is the reasoning behind the blanket exclusion of partnership law from the Limited Liability Partnership Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that there is no problem in having a limited company as a partner in a limited liability partnership. I do not believe that there is any problem, but I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.
<P>
My second point is analogous to the point on taxation to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred. What research have the Government conducted into whether the concept of a limited liability partnership is inimical to any other jurisdiction? I am aware of the conflict between laws and how that is usually resolved, but is the limited liability partnership, as a business entity, inimical to any other foreign jurisdiction?
<P>
Finally, I should like to comment on the Partnership Act 1890. As was mentioned on Second Reading, the Act is very useful and has withstood the test of time. It is also underlain by considerable case law and certainty, so it is much to be regretted that the Bill's fallback provisions are not directed more towards that legislation than towards Companies Act legislation.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I think that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton queried clause 1(2)(a). The clause provides for the limited liability partnership to be a new form of legal entity that is formed by incorporation. It will be a body corporate with unlimited capacity and its members may be liable to contribute to its assets if it is wound up. The regulations will set out the extent of the members' potential liability. Clause (1)(2)(a) shows that there is currently no intention to make regulations on overseas limited liability partnerships, although we have powers to introduce such regulations if it is necessary to do so. We will certainly consult before taking such action, and I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will accept that. We do not intend to make hasty decisions on these complicated matters.
<P>
As I understood. him, the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) asked about the implications for limited liability partnerships of foreign company law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Foreign business law.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> He spoke about foreign business law, and asked whether the limited liability partnership was inimical as an entity to other countries. I presume that he was referring to the important markets where partnerships might suffer. As far as I know, it is not inimical, but I accept that the hon. Gentleman made a good point. If I cannot provide the answer that he seeks today or by Thursday, I shall ensure that he receives the results of any survey that we conduct.
<P>
In the event of partners having agreed with other members on potential liability, the regulations will set out the extent of their potential liability. I know that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton sees that as a problem. Indeed, I remember saying the same thing when my party was in opposition. He conceded, however, that there had been a tremendous amount of consultation. We have no intention whatever of trying to pull a fast one on anybody. I want to get the legislation right, as I know that the hon. Gentleman does, and we will set out our intentions with all the clarity that we can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> Does the Minister envisage that the extent of liability will be a function of the numbers of partners and/or their wages? On what basis does he think that the regulations will be drawn?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</b> We certainly cannot use those as prime determinants. That would be foolish. I have no intention of being over-prescriptive about the sort of agreements and arrangements that can exist between partners, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance.</B><P>
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Burnett:</B> Did I hear the Minister correctly? I believe he said that the regulations will set out the extent of a member's liability—I made a note of that—but I thought that a member's liability was to the full extent of his assets. If the member was personally negligent and his liability was to the full extent of the assets of the limited liability partnership, in all other matters that would be contract as well as tort. I should be glad to hear from the Minister not about the vicarious liability of members, but about the liability of the individual employees who do the work.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon knows, the liability of members of a limited liability partnership was discussed in the other place. Lord McIntosh of Haringey made clear the Government's intention to rely on the effect of general law to provide for the liability of negligent members of a limited liability partnership rather than making specific statutory provision.
<P>
It would be undesirable and potentially dangerous to amend the law of negligence by a side wind, as it is obviously of wider application than to limited liability partnerships. The explanatory notes to the Bill state that a limited liability partnership's existence as a corporate entity means that the effect of the general law on members of a limited liability partnership is different from its effect on the partners in a partnership. Should a partner be negligent in the work that he carries out for a client, there will be generally be two possible causes of action against him—contract and tort. However, because a limited liability partnership will be a separate legal entity, if the client is contracted with the limited liability partnership itself, only the tort action is potentially available against the member.
<P>
Concerns raised in the other place focused also on the fact that recent developments in case law might make it less likely that a case could be proved against a negligent member of a limited liability partnership whose conduct had resulted in an economic loss for the client. A wronged third party would still be able to pursue the limited liability partnership. That puts third parties in a similar position to clients of a company, but in a somewhat different position from clients of a partnership. We have considered the considerable complexities of the matter carefully, and we have concluded that we have achieved an appropriate balance.
<P>
Employees of a limited liability partnership will be in the same position as employees in a solicitor's partnership. If they personally do something fraudulent, they will be liable; but not otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister. I am glad that he is now dealing with employees. Will he elaborate a little on the employee's position when doing work for the client, both in contract and in tort?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have tried to explain that it will be exactly the same as the employee of a solicitor. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that. We shall come later in the Bill to specific instances.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>INCORPORATION DOCUMENT ETC</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister would give a full explanation of the clause for the benefit of the Committee. In particular, subsection (2)(c) says that the corporation document must state whether the registered office is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in England and Wales, in Wales or in Scotland.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Into which category does an office in Cardiff fall? Why is the paragraph so written? Subsection (2)(f) refers to ``designated members'', saying that they should be specified. Clause 8 is dedicated to designated members but nowhere in clause 2 or clause 8 is it said what a designated member is. Will the Minister spell out the Government's intentions in respect of designated members?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> It is especially fortunate that we have a Minister from Pontypridd—I hope he noticed that I got the pronunciation right, my mother being Welsh.
<P>
Would there be legal implications regarding devolution if an office was said to be registered in England and Wales? What would further devolution in Wales mean in relation to the company law that forms the broad context of this matter? In which jurisdiction would the office fall? Finally, will the Minister clarify whether such a registration would be made at Companies House in Cardiff?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I remember an interesting debate on this matter during a previous sitting. We discussed why a certain publication—I cannot remember the title—did not exist in Wales. It seemed that we were deprived of an organ for official announcements in Wales.
<P>
I shall answer the points raised by the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant) first. The short and honest answer is that the effects of devolution in terms of jurisdiction are anybody's guess. Welsh law and English law are currently more or less identical. The functions of the Welsh Assembly are important but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, they deal with secondary legislation, so those functions would not influence or affect the Bill.
<P>
Regarding subsection (2)(c), the clause follows arrangements in the Companies Act 1985. If the office is in Cardiff, it will be registered in Wales. It is for the limited liability partnership to choose. If registered in Wales only, the expectation is that it will stay there, whereas, if it is registered in England and Wales, it can move between the two countries. The measure gives a firm flexibility in terms of the location of its chief office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> The Minister has raised a fascinating point. I am sure that his answer is correct—it was passed to him by his officials so it must be right. Would a company be precluded from extending into Scotland by a lack of predesignation?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I see no reason why a company should not do that. The choice of headquarters, including the location of the named address, should be left to limited liability partnerships.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</b> I have not yet heard the Minister explain what a designated member is.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I cannot do that at the moment, in an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Then I shall continue. In the summary of responses to the July 1999 consultation document, which was published in May, it says that consultees were concerned about the lack of a definition of a designated member. The Government's response was to state that the designated member is responsible for a number of requirements in the running of the limited liability partnership, which draws on many areas of the Companies and Insolvency Acts. Those include the signing and buying of accounts, the removal of auditors and, in the event of insolvency proceedings, the provision of any statement setting out the affairs of the limited liability partnership. That is helpful. I am sure the Minister will say something similar when he responses.
<P>
It would be useful if that definition were written into the Bill, because the Bill talks at length about the designated member, but fails to define it. The Bill states that there must be some designated members and covers the issue of appointment, but it does not outline what they are meant to do. When we draft legislation and consider it in Committee, we should think carefully about the eventual users; we should make their life as easy as possible, rather than as difficult as possible. The former is the general method of legislating I have observed since I entered the House.
<P>
Two specific issues are raised in the summary of responses document, and I hope the Minister will respond to them. The document states that Companies House will publish guidance booklets on limited liability partnerships, which will include details on the roles and duties of designated members. When will the booklets be published, when can the public expect printed copies to be available at Oyez Stationers? The document also states that it will be for the limited liability partnership to allocate duties among members and designated members; in the event of default by the limited liability partnership, the relevant designated member and any other member in default, as well as the limited liability partnership, will be subject to any penalty. Will the Minister set out what the penalties are?

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I suddenly realised a moment ago that I could not speak for five minutes on an intervention.
<P>
I shall try to explain what is meant by a designated member. It is intended that a limited liability partnership will have at least two designated members who will carry out a number of administrative functions: for example, taking responsibility for communications with Companies House and—importantly—the approval and signing of the annual accounts, filing of the accounts at Companies House, and, in the event of insolvency proceedings, providing any statement setting out the affairs of the limited liability partnership, assets, debts and liabilities. A designated member—this is part of attempting to define what a designated member is—will in no way be regarded as superior to or more responsible than any other member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> That is a helpful clarification. Would the Minister say that a designated member is almost equivalent to a company secretary in an ordinary plc or limited company?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The designated member will carry out some of the statutory obligations that company secretaries carry out.
<P>
The limited liability partnership's incorporation document will set out who will be the designated members fulfilling the functions I have just outlined. A limited liability partnership must have at least two designated members. If no members are specified as designated in the incorporation document, all the members will be considered to be designated members.
<P>
A number of the powers assigned to a company secretary under the Companies Act 1985 will be transferred to a designated member; for example, the signing of the annual return. Other responsibilities of designated members echo those of the company secretary, as the hon. Member for Lichfield point out. A definition will not make the role of a designated member any clearer than the current provisions in the Bill and in regulations. We have followed the format adopted in the Companies Act, which imposes duties and powers on officers of the company, but gives no single definition of the role of an officer of the company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> Would it be as easy for the designated member to be changed if circumstances altered within the partnership as it is to register another company secretary, which is achieved simply by filling out a form and filing it with Companies House?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes. As I made clear, the limited liability partnership incorporation document is intended to specify the identity of the designated members. It does not prohibit changes to those members, but any change requires the agreement of other members, which means that consultation and discussion must occur within the partnership. If the document does not stipulate that particular named members are designated, all the members will become designated. The Registrar of Companies must be informed when the designated members change. The notice has to be made in a form that is approved by the registrar and must be signed or authenticated by a designated member. When a person stops being a member of the limited liability partnership, he or she will automatically stop being a designated member.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The point that the Minister misses is that company secretaries' custom and practice for many decades—even centuries—has enabled them to understand what a company secretary does; people to know what to expect. The concept of a designated member is new, so the Government are beholden to incorporate in the Bill a definition of what it is meant to achieve. Alternatively, they could have used the term ``company secretary'', to make it clear that they intended to incorporate the whole relevant body of custom and practice—and probably case law—that applies to company secretaries. I am grateful for the Minister's comments, which were helpful, although we shall probably debate the matter at greater length during consideration of clause 8.
<P>
Finally, will he explain the penalties that will apply if a designated member is in default of his duties? Where are those penalty regimes set out, and will he give a flavour of level of penalty and the sort of punishments that will be faced by a designated member who defaults'?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his supportive remarks. He asked earlier about the booklets that have been issued by Companies House, which will be available to the public when the limited liability partnerships become legal entities. I am sorry that I did not answer that question earlier. We hope that the guidance that we are providing through our deliberations will be a taster.
<P>
We will discuss the penalties at some length later in our consideration of the Bill. However, I should make it clear that I want to ensure that limited liability partnerships are not used as a bolt hole for scoundrels. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman endorses that aim. The disciplines that currently apply to company law will also apply to limited liability partnerships.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am hoping for just a little more explanation of the penalty regime. I hope that the shuffling of papers that is going on will enable the Minister briefly to set out the nature of the penalty regime for defaulting designated members.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>INCORPORATION BY REGISTRATION</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am a little disappointed that the Minister did not respond to my remarks about penalties, to which I hope we will return during discussion of clause 8. Perhaps then he will be more prepared to answer my questions.
<P>
Clause 3(1) refers back to clause 2(2)(a), which states that the incorporation document must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be in a form approved by the registrar.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 3 ensures that, unless that form is complied with, the registrar will not issue a certificate of incorporation. Has such a form been produced in draft? If so, when can we see it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> Again, it is relevant that the Minister is Welsh. Shortly after becoming a Member of Parliament in 1992, I served on the Committee that considered the Bill that became the Welsh Language Act 1993. I was keen for the Welsh language to be recognised. In many ways, the clause echoes existing company law, but the language issue is important none the less. Will a version of certificates of incorporation, or, under clause 3(1)(b), certificates of limited liability partnership, be available in English and Welsh for companies that specify that they are based in Wales, or in England and Wales, or for any partnership that wants its certificate to be in English and Welsh?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Member for Lichfield is right to ask that question. Like all Welsh Members of Parliament, at least once a week I receive Welsh language policy documents from almost every company and agency of note. I know that Companies House has an extensive operation in that respect, because a large number of Welsh speakers work there. I am confident that Welsh translations of those various documents will be available.
<P>
To return to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the clause provides for the registration of limited liability partnerships by Companies House. Registration is a necessary procedure that underpins the regulatory requirements of a limited liability partnership—for example, the filing of accounts and information about members. The procedure to be followed by Companies House is in keeping with the procedures that currently apply to limited companies under sections 12 and 13 of the Companies Act 1985. Once Companies House is satisfied that all the information required to register a limited liability partnership has been provided, it will issue a certificate of incorporation in Welsh for those who require it.
<P>
The certificate will be proof that the limited liability partnership is a registered corporate body in its chosen name. Any person wishing to do business with the limited liability partnership will be able to check the register at Companies House to confirm the authenticity of a limited liability partnership. I asked that we should be absolutely certain that the documents will be published, and I am told that they are being prepared. They will follow those made available for company registration, and, if the hon. Member for Lichfield requires it, we shall provide copies as soon as they are completed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> In Welsh?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Of course. There would be no point in doing it in English.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>MEMBERS</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We are grateful to the Government for having responded to Opposition concerns about uncertainty as to whether members of a limited liability partnership might be regarded as an employees, which could have important consequences for employment law and for the taxation of the members. Clause 4(4) has been changed to make it absolutely that a member of a limited liability partnership is not an employee. Clause 4(3) has been changed to enable a member to leave the partnership by giving ``reasonable notice'' unless otherwise agreed. Interested parties who were consulted on the matter wanted a fixed number of days or months notice—-for example, 28 days. Will the Minister expand on what the Government intend by the phrase ``reasonable notice''? The more guidance he is able to give to the Committee, and therefore to the public, the less will the phrase need to be tested in court-—with all the accompanying costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> My question is similar; it is about designated members. In answer to my question on how a designated member can be changed, the Minister, said, correctly, that it would be with the agreement of existing members. Clause 4(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any other person may become a member of a limited liability partnership by and in accordance with an agreement with the existing members.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am a little concerned about that. One of the reasons for introducing limited liability partnerships is that partnerships have changed: many partnerships, in the United Kingdom and abroad, are no longer firms of two or three people, but comprise hundreds of people. Despite the availability of e-mail, does the Bill imply that every member—there may be hundreds—would have to agree to such a change, or will the original document specify a small proportion of the overall number of people in the partnership—10, 20 or whatever number is convenient to the organisation—who could agree to such changes? We need to be reassured that not every partner or member will have to agree to membership changes.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The signatories to the incorporation document will be the first members of a limited liability partnership. Thereafter, as the hon. Member for Lichfield reminded us, anyone can become or cease to be a member with the agreement of the other members. He rightly mentioned the good partnerships that are spread around the world. I do not intend to make the arrangements in partnerships and existing partnerships for co-opting or recruiting additional partners too prescriptive, but I am worried about what happens when membership drops below two. In that situation, we intend to include in regulations a six-month grace period before the remaining member loses his limited liability status. It is also possible for the courts to wind up a firm with fewer than two members. I hope that that is helpful and gives a taste of our intentions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned reasonable notice. He is a reasonable man and he must realise that a set number of days could trap the unwary. For example, would it include Sundays and how would we decide on the best number of days? We would prefer to leave it to the common sense and discretion of the business constituency to decide what constitutes reasonable notice. I would be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's view on that.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Throughout consultation on the Bill and during its passage through Parliament, there has been an intensive debate on the issue of default provisions. If a partnership agreement, which links different members within a limited liability partnership, is silent on an issue, or if there is no such agreement between members and the limited liability partnership, should the law that governs the relationship between members of a limited liability partnership default to the body of partnership law in the Partnership Act 1890 and case law of the past century? The majority opinion of the Law Society and others was that there should be such a provision. Indeed, the first draft of what was clause 6(1)(c) stated that the rights and duties of members of a limited liability partnership shall be governed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>subject to paragraphs (a) and (b), by the rules and principles which would apply if the law relating to partnerships applied to them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That paragraph, which forms the basis of amendment No. 6, was removed by the Government for the reasons set out in paragraphs 6 to 10 of their February 2000 consultation document. They decided that, because a limited liability partnership has a separate legal personality and requires the incorporation of significant amounts of the Companies Act 1985, there is likely to be a conflict between the two sets of rules.
<P>
The consultation document says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the provisions of partnership law which govern relations between partners assume a structure which will no longer be present in a Limited Liability Partnership. For example, sections 20–23 of the Partnership Act deal with how partners hold partnership property. There can be no direct read across of such a provision to Limited Liability Partnerships, since a Limited Liability Partnership can hold property of its own.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The body of partnership law would be brought in only to deal with the relationship between members of a limited liability partnership. It would not be brought in to deal with matters clearly set out in the Bill or specifically introduced by regulations under it.
<P>
Many consultees approached by the Department of Trade and Industry held such views. One, quoted in the summary of responses, said that many seeking incorporation would have had years of partnership practice, yet
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>their members will be expected to behave in ways respecting both their mutual obligations and their obligations as agents of the Limited Liability Partnership. A statutory duty . . . will help to establish practices beneficial both to members and to third parties.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Consultees quoted in the consultation document argued that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the absence of an adequate agreement between the members of a Limited Liability Partnership, the relationship between members would be uncertain; there was a strong desire that partnership law should govern the rights and duties of the members of the Limited Liability Partnership . . . partnership law is well understood by partnerships and practitioners, with the principles established over many years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government decided to spell out the specific partnership law default measures and to put them into regulation in response to the consultees' concerns. They listened to the consultees, ruled out the introduction of a general default provision and decided instead to spell out an exhaustive list of default measures to be put into regulations. The Government tabled an amendment in another place introducing new subsection (c) to clause 15 to allow incorporation of the regulations into law.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Specific regulations were then consulted on and a summary set of responses published in May this year. They tightened up the drafting of the regulations. The original pre-consultation regulations are the basis of what we have set out in amendment No. 7. I still contend that the general default provision, as set out in amendment No. 6, would be preferable. A specific and exhaustive list of partnership law default provisions would likely cover the most usual requirements, but would not incorporate more than 100 years of legal history wherein thousands of different cases and issues have been covered. All future cases will inevitably not be covered by a specific list of a dozen or so provisions. That might cause difficulties, especially for smaller and less well-advised partnerships, which might not take the audit advice that they need to ensure that they are not caught without specific agreements to deal with likely issues.
<P>
If the Government do not want to set out all the default provisions thought appropriate, specific measures should at least be on the face of the Bill rather than hidden away in secondary legislation. That is the purpose of the amendment, which uses the wording from the Government's consultation document on the earlier draft of the regulations. The measure to exclude the general application of partnership law is set out in full in clause 1; the extent of the inclusion of elements of partnership law should also be set out in the Bill.
<P>
The other issue debated at great length during consultation concerned good faith and honesty. If there is no general default provision, the question is whether there should be a specific general duty of good faith and honesty between members of a limited liability partnership in legislation, just as general partnership law imposes on partners such a general duty. Bodies such as the Construction Industry Council are clearly in favour of such a provision. The council says in its briefing that its particular concern is for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>small organisations. In our opinion they need to carry through the ethos of partnership practice, if third parties—clients, customers, suppliers—are to be well served. The consultation paper makes two proposals that we strongly support:
<P>
i. default provisions for mutual rights and duties; and
<P>
ii. a statutory duty of good faith.
<P>
Both will help . . . immature Limited Liability Partnerships, especially, to fulfil the government's expectation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The responses to the Government's consultation documents on the issue of a general duty of good faith were, according to the summary, split about 50–50 for and against a general duty of good faith between members. The response of some of the consultees was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Without a duty of good faith between members, where partners have acted unconscionably there remains substantial room for litigation. Why should this matter be left to the courts, to a series of costly compromises ending in a test case?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another group of consultees said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We . . . think that it would be desirable to provide that the members' duty to act in good faith one to another extends to an obligation, owed to those members, to act in good faith towards the Limited Liability Partnership itself. This would address the problems arising where a majority, acting in bad faith, controls the Limited Liability Partnership.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A different group said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A duty of good faith is essential.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree, and that is why amendment No. 8 sets out a general duty of honesty and good faith. The Government have opted for a narrower duty. Paragraphs (x) and (xi) that amendment No. 7 would introduce into clause 5 are relevant. They have come out against the more general duty of good faith and honesty. I can see no difficulty in legislating for people to be honest towards one another and to act in good faith. Why do the Government refuse to incorporate those sensible measures in the Bill?

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I endorse the remarks of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Continuity, simplicity and, as far as possible, certainty are important in business. I have used the Partnership Act 1890 at work for years. As I said on Second Reading and earlier today, a body of case law arises from that simple and straightforward Act which would provide a better fallback for limited liability partnerships than the bulk of the Companies Acts that are being used. Of course, the Companies Act 1985 and the Insolvency Act 1986 have a place in dealing with some points relating to disclosure and insolvency. Nevertheless, aspects of limited liability partnerships,—perhaps some that we cannot even imagine arising—will not be covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. It is nice to see a little cross-party agreement on the Opposition Benches about the amendments.
<P>
My hon. Friend and I have both spoken before about Henry VIII clauses. It is extraordinary that as important provision as clause 5, dealing with the relationship of members, is so short. I suspect that the Minister will say that he does not want to prescribe how a partnership should behave. However, the general principles of amendment No. 8 in particular are decent and go back to the earliest conduct of jurisprudence in this nation with respect to businesses, predating the Partnership Act 1890. The idea of a duty of honesty and good faith is predated by the duty of care which is drawn, some would say, from Talmudic law. Amendment No. 8 would add a new subsection (1A) to the clause, paragraph (c) of which would provide for a duty
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not to profit to the detriment of the firm or in rivalry with it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has said, that is particularly relevant to immature partnerships—newly-formed firms that might lack an ethos of how to work together.
<P>
I should be happy if the Minister were to say that he disagreed with certain subsections and gave us his reasons, but stated that the Government would incorporate into the Bill the bulk of amendments 6, 7 and 8—amendments of amendments, if you like. That would be a fair response. If the Minister rejects them outright and calls the issue to a vote, the Government will win, but since when has the jackboot of the majority been necessarily right? I hope that the Minister, a particularly reasonable and particularly Welsh man, will respond that the amendments 6, 7 and 8 are decent, being based on long-held principles of English law; and that, while he might not agree with every subsection of every amendment, he will, in principle, adopt most, if not all of them.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8 are decent amendments, but I will not accept them. The debate is at the heart of Opposition Members' concerns about a certain element of the Bill. I will attempt to deal with those concerns as comprehensively as I can.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton stated that the Law Society supports the wholesale application of partnership law. That may have been something the hon. Gentleman was told at a dinner. However, the Law Society told the Government, in response to the February consultation document, that it agreed with us that, as limited liability partnerships will be bodies corporate, partnership law should not apply wholesale to them. I shall elaborate on that point.
<P>
The common thread in the amendments is the extent to which the provisions of partnership law are applied to a limited liability partnership. That was the point made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. He said that continuity was needed, that we have a proven body of practice and case law and we should accept it wholesale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I did not say it should be accepted wholesale. I made differentiations. I said there were cases—I gave examples—in which it is appropriate to incorporate either provisions from the Insolvency Acts or the Companies Acts, for example, on disclosure. Although, exceptions do exist, the main body and thrust of the Partnership Act 1890 is a good fall back because it is simple, certain and provides continuity.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I stand corrected.
<P>
As I mentioned on Second Reading, there has been much debate about to what extent a limited liability partnership should be treated either as a partnership or as company. Although a limited liability partnership is a body corporate, it has been designed with enough internal freedom and flexibility to allow the members to decide their own relationships. The hon. Member tor Lichfield predicted that I would say that.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 seeks to apply partnership law to limited liability partnerships. The Government have made a conscious decision not to do so, primarily because to apply it to a corporate entity would create substantial uncertainties. The Government are applying appropriately modified parts of Companies Acts' provisions to limited liability partnerships by regulation. The general application of partnership law would only lead to confusion about how the two would interact. In limited circumstances, legislation has been drawn from the law of partnership to create a regime for limited liability partnerships: the chief example is in the area of taxation, where the members of a limited liability partnership are taxed as if they are partners. In those cases, as in our application of companies legislation, the Government has modified the application appropriately to suit the structure of the limited liability partnership. Nowhere will we make wholesale applications of any legislation.
<P>
The Government are aware of concern that inexperienced people, for example, establishing a limited liability partnership might not realise the need for an agreement until it is too late and so get into difficulties. That is why we decided to introduce a set of default of provisions based on section 24 of the Partnership Act 1890 as part of the regulations, to apply only where was no agreement between members or when an agreement did not cover a particular problem.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We consulted in February on our intended provisions and published a final draft in May. Although the provisions in amendment No. 7 bear close comparison with those on which we consulted, we have made a number of changes as a result of the consultation. We believe that those alterations, which were highlighted by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, improve the original provisions. That is one reason why I am extremely reluctant to agree to amendment No. 7. Also, I fear I do not agree with the view that the default provisions should be included in the Bill, which would provide no greater certainty or advantage than secondary legislation. It would only mean that they would be more difficult to amend if it turned out that they needed some adjustment to deal with new circumstances. The Bill creates a new entity and we cannot be expected to envisage every possibility, as the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon pointed out.
<P>
Amendment No. 8 contains a set of six duties that are commonly held to be components of a general duty of good faith that exists between partners. I believe that they are similar to those that we listed in our February consultation document. As the document explained, although we thought it reasonable to expect a member to owe fiduciary duty to the limited liability partnership because he would be its agent, we were doubtful that a similar duty would be owed between members. As the document said, we thought, on balance, that it was preferable not to impose a statutory duty. I stress that the legislation will contain nothing to prevent members from owing a duty of good faith to each other or from building that into their formal arrangement, if they wish to do so.
<P>
Furthermore, the components of amendment No. 8 are largely encompassed by the provisions that we intend to include in the default regulations that I have just outlined. The duty of honesty and of acting in favour of the firm will be owed to the limited liability partnership because of the fact that a member is an agent of it. Each member will owe a duty to the limited liability partnership and the agreement between members will govern their management of the entity and the manner in which they disseminate information between themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Having been a partner in a firm for more than 20 years, I know that the ethos of partnership as it now exists is very strong inter se, or between, the partners. In other words, the duty of good faith means a great deal, or at least should do so, to individual partners. It is in the interests of clients for that ethos to be transposed to limited liability partnerships. The ethos of good faith between partners should be carried over to limited liability partnerships to ensure that it serves the client.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I agree with every word of that intervention, and I hope that the new corporate entities will be imbued with the spirit that the hon. Gentleman describes, which has served partnerships very well and on which they depend for their very existence. I do not believe that limited liability partnerships could work if they were not infused with that spirit, which I think that we have strengthened. The fifth duty listed in the amendment is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a duty to treat fellow members fairly.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That duty will be covered by secondary legislation, as we intend to apply section 459 of the Companies Act 1985 in schedule 2 of the limited liability partnership regulations, modifying its application to ensure that it can be excluded by unanimous agreement between the members, so that any person who joins the limited liability partnership later is treated as having agreed to the exclusion. We see no advantage in amendment No. 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As the Committee would expect, I am disappointed with that response, although I can understand why the Government resist incorporating into the Bill a statutory requirement for good faith. The Government were elected on a manifesto that they have signally failed to deliver, and they have lost faith with the British public. To include a good faith requirement in the law would not fit easily with the Government's general demeanour.
<P>
On a more serious point, it is disappointing that the Government do not wish to incorporate amendment No. 6 into the Bill, because it would deal with many of the problems that might arise. However, I give notice that I shall press amendment No. 7 to a Division, as I believe that, of the three amendments, it is the most acceptable to the Government, given that it uses the wording of the original draft of the regulations. I accept that the Government have revised the wording of the regulations. If I knew that, as a result of consultation, the Government would make such an amendment on Report, I would gladly not press the amendment now, but accept that Government amendment.
<P>
The Minister made it clear that he saw no advantage in including the provisions of the amendments in the Bill. I strongly disagree. Such fundamental matters should be included. The Bill disavows any use of partnership law in clause 1, but it should be included so that readers of the Bill will know precisely where they stand. They should not have to go from clause 5 to clause 15(c) and then to the relevant regulations. I shall seek to withdraw amendment No. 6 and then press amendment No. 7 to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P><H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>MEMBERS AS AGENTS</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>


<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister explain how the regime under clause 6 differs in principle from general partnership law where a partner who holds himself out as being a partner therefore buys the partnership. How do the agency arrangements under clause 6 differ from that original general partnership law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I rise to support the broad principle of clause 6. There are huge similarities between its provisions and company law, especially in respect of the relationship between partner and agent, which are similar to the common law relationship between master and servant. I seek clarification of clause 6(2)(a), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a limited liability partnership is not bound by anything done by a member in dealing with a person if . . . the member in fact has no authority to act for the limited liability partnership by doing that thing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am a little worried about the wording, ``doing that thing''. In addition, if there is nothing in the partnership agreement, to which we referred earlier, how can one define in law whether a member has the authority to ``do that thing''? That requires clarification.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The clause provides that all members will be agents of the limited liability partnership and that the limited liability partnership will be bound by the action of its members, except in specific circumstances, which the hon. Member for Lichfield emphasised with his usual erudition. Those circumstances are set out in clause 6(2). Under the provision, the limited liability partnership will be liable to the same extent as any member, should the member be guilty of a wrongful act or omission when carrying on the business of the limited liability partnership, or if the member acts without the authority of the limited liability partnership.
<P>
That leads me on to the question raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. The broad principle of agency is the same, but, in partnerships, the partners are agents of each other, whereas in a limited liability partnership, members are agents of the limited liability partnership. I shall certainly write to the hon. Gentleman about that if he requires more detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In relation to people who have ceased to be partners but who continue to hold themselves out as partners, what is the position under the Bill compared with the general position in relation to partnerships?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Any business that a member carries out after ceasing to be a member will still bind the limited liability partnership, unless either the other party has been told that he is no longer a member, or notice to that effect has been delivered to Companies House. The agency of members within the entity's structure is fundamental in allowing the business to carry on. The agency of a limited liability partnership's members ensures that the limited liability partnership will be liable for its members' actions, which, in turn, gives the consumer some recourse in dealings with the limited liability partnership. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
On the wording, I agree that the use of the word ``thing'' is interesting, to say the least, but much company law is interesting, especially in terms of syntax and semantics.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 4, line l9, leave out from `partnership' to end of line 21 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) But subsection (2) does not affect any right to receive an amount from the limited liability partnership in that event.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also consider amendment No. 5, in page 4, line 21, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) Subsection (2) shall have effect subject to the terms of any agreement between the former member (or any of the persons referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (2)) and the other members.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Subject to what the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon has to say about amendment No. 5, I do not expect to agree with it.
<P>
On amendment No. 1, it was not my intention to table any Government amendments to the Bill at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I hear support from the Government Whip on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> The Minister should not feel remotely embarrassed. Most Government Bills receive massive amendment, usually on Report, but also on Third Reading, if the Government have the chance.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Would the non-embarrassed Minister care to respond?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Member for Lichfield did not have the pleasure of joining the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the Government Whip and myself in the Committee that considered the Utilities Bill, which was a Himalaya of amendments.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I said, it was not my intention to table Government amendments at this stage. The Bill received careful scrutiny in the other place, where we tabled amendments that were necessary to ensure its efficacy. We have, however, paused for thought on clauses 7 and 17, to which we have tabled amendments Nos. 2 and 3. Clause 7 protects payments that are made by the limited liability partnership to a member in connection with cessation of membership. It will ensure that former members or their representatives in such circumstances as are set out in subsection (l)(a) to (d), do not lose money that is rightfully theirs simply because of the cessation of membership. The remaining members cannot decide to deny them their rights.
<P>
The clause also tries to ensure that former members or their representatives cannot interfere in the business of the limited liability partnership. The problem lies with interpretation of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may receive from the limited liability partnership any amount to which the former member, or member, would have been entitled but for that event.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have concluded that there is a risk of the phrase being taken to mean that a former member or his representative is entitled only to what he received before that event, which is defined in subsection (l)(a) to (d).
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Not for a moment. This is complicated.
<P>
The definition in subsection (l)(a) to (d) includes death and bankruptcy. In many cases, the entitlement will be a continuing and regular withdrawal of the share of the profits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I just wondered whether ``thing'' would be more embracing than ``that event''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howells:</B> I do not intend to discuss that.
<P>
We anticipate that buy-out provisions would be included in the agreements of many members. The former member or his representative would often not want to continue entitlement, but would prefer to have his share in the firm bought out once and for all. That might also be favoured by the limited liability partnership, which otherwise would face a continuing liability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> What is wrong with future payments if they form part of a pre-arranged agreement between members of a limited liability partnership? Such payments to an individual who is bankrupt would simply go to the trustee in bankruptcy.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not saying that there is anything wrong with that, but the amendment replaces the problematic phrase with one that refers to the right to receive an amount. That will ensure that a buy-out provision in the members agreement is not hindered by the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I rise to speak to amendment No. 5. There has been much discussion between the Law Society and the Department of Trade and Industry on clause 7, in particular on the arrangements that members of a limited liability partnership can make between themselves when someone ceases to be a member. Government amendment No. 1 is a distinct improvement and as such is welcome. It permits members of a limited liability partnership to determine the financial rights of an individual's successor, such as his personal representatives. That resolves the blatant unfairness of invalidating a buy-out provision in an agreement between members of a limited liability partnership. The amendment cures that defect.
<P>
Nevertheless, the clause as amended will invalidate an agreement that was freely entered into by members of a limited liability partnership, which entitles a non-member to interfere in its management or administration. At first sight, that may sound reasonable because a non-member does not owe the same duties to a limited liability partnership and because it can be argued that a non-member has no right to interfere in the business. However, it is a most undesirable restriction of the freedom to contract. If the members of a limited liability partnership wish to confer a right to interfere in the management on a non-member, it is reasonable to assume that the members regard such a move as being in their interests and therefore in the interests of the limited liability partnership.
<P>
I shall give two examples. Two members, one of whom provides a loan to the limited liability partnership for its working capital, form a limited liability partnership. The loan is secured by a floating charge. The lender dies and the limited liability partnership is unable to pay the loan when it falls due. Clause 7 appears to prevent the personal representatives of the deceased member from appointing a receiver or otherwise enforcing the charge because that would constitute interference in the management or administration of the limited liability partnership. The courts may reach a different conclusion, but it is an area of uncertainty.
<P>
My second example may be simpler and more compelling. A limited liability partnership is formed by two members and both members die simultaneously. Under clause 7, their personal representatives would be precluded from interfering in the management of the limited liability partnership. The amendment would address that problem if an agreement between the members provided expressly otherwise or the court implied an agreement to the contrary. I understand that the DTI objects to the amendment on the grounds that a limited liability partnership might be managed by a person who is not a member and who did not owe the limited liability partnership the same duties as a member. However, the draft regulations prepared by the DTI, which are to be made under the Bill when it becomes law, apply to limited liability partnerships the provisions of section 741 of the Companies Act 1985. In doing so, they substitute for the references in the section to director and shadow director references to member and shadow member. That means that a person who occupies the position of a member will be treated as a member under the law. People, in accordance with whose directions or instructions the members of a limited liability partnership are accustomed to act, will be effectively members. They will be shadow members, but will be treated as members.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> When the hon. Gentleman talks about members being those with whom other members are accustomed to act in accordance, is he not echoing how the Companies Act views directors? A director need not be registered at Companies House. The law deems a director as being anybody according to whom other directors are accustomed to act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point. That is what the Companies Act provides for in certain circumstances. The Taxes Acts make the same provisions.
<P>
The amendment is not a means by which liability can be avoided because the Bill and the regulations under the Bill will address that problem. The Bill and the regulations, are sufficient to protect the limited liability partnership from the actions of somebody who is not expressly a member, but who has the right to interfere in the management or administration of its business.
<P>
The Bill does not attempt to preclude a limited liability partnership from employing a manager who is not a member in other circumstances. For example, a professional manager can be recruited to manage a limited liability partnership even though he has no interest in it. I hope that the Minister will give thought to that point, which is important for continuity, certainty and the smooth management of the transition between partnerships and limited liability partnerships.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> In drafting the clause we sought a balance between the interests of the ex-member or his representatives and the limited liability partnership. The clause would prohibit the ex-member or his representatives from taking part in the management of the limited liability partnership. The intention is to minimise the disruption to the limited liability partnership by the transfer of a member's interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howells:</B> In a moment. If I may, I shall deal with some of the important points raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The clause is designed to reflect the fact that the limited liability partnership will continue as a going concern, managed by the continuing members, without interference from an ex-member or his representatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I think that the Minister is suggesting that real problems might arise, but is he aware that under current partnership law a partnership agreement can make arrangements with respect to outgoing partners or their personal representatives subsequently having certain rights in the management of the firm? That has not prejudiced the existence of partnership, the partnership ethos or the success of partnerships.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The provision is by no means unique. Section 31 of the Partnership Act 1890 states that an assignment of a partner's share
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>does not . . . entitle the assignee . . . to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or affairs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As to companies, if a director dies, his personal representatives cannot manage the business of the company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Surely a partnership agreement can contract out of that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As I have explained, we are attempting to continue with that flexibility in arrangements between partners.
<P>
During consultation on the draft Bill a variety of views were expressed. Some argued that a liquidator or the trustee of a bankrupt should not be entitled to intervene in the management or affairs of the limited liability partnership and some suggested that the clause should be subordinate to what was agreed with the ex-member before his departure. On balance, we decided that it would be prudent to leave the provision undisturbed. It does not seem to be in the interest of the limited liability partnership—which, it should be remembered, for there seems to be some confusion about it, is a legal entity separate from its members—that members should be able to reach agreement allowing an ex-member or his representatives to interfere in the management or administration of the limited liability partnership. For example, if that third party had a controlling interest it might not be in his interest for the limited liability partnership to continue trading. He would not have to have regard to the interest of the clients.
<P>
The original version of the clause, published in 1998, went further than the present one, in that it would have prevented an ex-member from requiring any accounts from the transactions of the limited liability partnership and from inspecting its books. It required him to accept the account of profits agreed by the members. There was general agreement that the restrictions were too great and clause 7 takes account of those views.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amount that an ex-member could receive from a limited liability partnership was restricted to a share of the profits to which he would otherwise have been entitled. That restriction was removed in the light of consultation, ensuring that a member is free to contract with the limited liability partnership to receive a capital sum in the event of his ceasing to be a member, for whatever reason. In addition, if a member has loaned money to the limited liability partnership during his lifetime, the loan will constitute an asset in the hands of his personal representatives and a debt to the limited liability partnership. The personal representatives of the deceased member will be able to enforce such a debt against the limited liability partnership. That is why I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> On the latter point, it may not be in the interests of the lender or the business to ask for repayment of a loan, say, on death. I am not clear what the Minister means by suggesting that clients could be prejudiced by the desire of a majority member to wind down the business of the firm. That is a matter for the members and for the agreement between them. Nevertheless, the Minister said that the Government wanted to retain the sort of flexibility that is provided by existing partnership law and, not least, the Partnership Act 1890.
<P>
My amendment would provide that flexibility. It is, more or less, a probing amendment, so I shall ask leave to withdraw it. I hope, however, that the Minister will consider it carefully and think again, in the spirit of his own words, about retaining the partnership flexibility that has been so valuable in the past.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I advise the hon. Gentleman that he cannot formally withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
