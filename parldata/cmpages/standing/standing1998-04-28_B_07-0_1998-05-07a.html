<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 7, leave out lines 22 to 24 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such period as the responsible authority shall specify''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment concerns the duration of strategies for the reduction of crime and disorder. Why have the Government fixed a time scale of three years?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</b> That is a sensible question. In the past, an analysis has been made of a particular problem, a strategy has been developed, and people have been left to tackle the problem according to that strategy. However, experience shows that one's understanding of a problem needs to be renewed after a period of time.</B><P>
<P>
Several years ago the problem of crime on the St. Mellons estate, which is in my constituency, was examined. We drew together all the agencies concerned, made recommendations to the police, the city council and the county council, among others, and reached agreement on a strategy. That strategy led to a reduction in the level of crime on the estate of approximately 85 per cent. However, that reduction would not now be recognised by those who live on the estate. Progress was interrupted by a murder, which damaged police and community work on the estate. Continuity therefore proved difficult to maintain. Moreover, it became clear that the problems of four or five years ago differed significantly from current ones.
<P>
In practice, baselines therefore need to be re-established over a reasonable period of time. One needs to go back, ask questions, and re-establish the ways in which improvements can be made within a given local authority area. Indeed, problems need to be analysed at a yet more local level, as was argued this morning. A relevant period of three years is based on lessons learnt from experience. A period of one year is too short. Certainly, the progress made in one year should be measured against the baseline. We would also expect objectives to be set and met within a year, and the general public to be informed of the progress made.
<P>
On the other hand, five years is probably too long a period. A great deal can change in five years. The local superintendent of police may move on, or the local chief executive may move on. Moreover, the community will hopefully develop and change, because that is the purpose of the crime and disorder strategy.
<P>
Three years is therefore our best estimate. It is based on personal experience and on discussions with those involved in local partnerships. It will not involve turning over stones to discover what is underneath them, or opening the oven door every few minutes to see whether the souffle has risen. Rather, the baseline will be re-established within a reasonable period of time in order to refocus the attention of partners in the wider community on the area's problems. The problems of 2002 may be different in quantity and priority from those of 1999.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has demonstrated that he understands why we asked the question. I have listened carefully to his full, but succinct, response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Supplemental</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 7, line 33, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(4) The Secretary of State shall within two years of this section coming into effect make a report to Parliament on the working of crime and disorder strategies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> When I first saw clause 8, I thought that it would necessitate a detailed debate during which I should wish to make several important points. However, Committee members will be pleased to know that many of those points have already been well made by my hon. Friends, and that I do not wish to delay our proceedings by repeating them.
<P>
The Minister has accepted that we want to see what benefits arise from the activity that will be engendered by the clause. We have presented to him our concerns about the level of that activity, and how we should like to achieve results on the ground. In his responses, the Minister has indicated that he believes that local measurements of the success or otherwise of the crime and disorder strategies are desirable.
<P>
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will respond sympathetically to amendment No. 57. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to make a report to Parliament on crime and disorder strategies. It would then be possible to bring together experiences at a local level and use them to form a judgment as to how the strategies are working in practice at a national level.
<P>
The process is currently in its early stages. The Minister spoke of looking inside the oven to see whether the souffle was rising. To adopt his phraseology, we have not yet put the oven on--perhaps we have not yet mixed the souffle, nor even selected the ingredients. It is early days, but we are anxious to see practical results emerging from the strategies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am happy to respond positively to that. We must ensure that we do not go from the frying pan into the fire. Positive progress must be achieved. If that does not happen, the hon. Gentleman is right that we should be aware of the impact both locally and nationally.
<P>
I am glad that he responded positively to my point about the local ownership of the targets that are to be set. In the early 1970s I was involved in the introduction of management by objectives into the city councils. From that experience, I know that if people own the objectives, those objectives can be set at a challenging level and people will work positively towards achieving them. A significant level of motivation is engendered by that sense of ownership.
<P>
The Government will be happy to discuss the effectiveness of the new measures within a year or two of their implementation. The amendment would require a period of two years; it may well be that the debate happens sooner than that. I hope that that response enables the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall put the Minister's words in the bank and save them up, and maybe they will be prayed in aid at a later date when we request a debate. For the time being, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Parenting orders</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 8, line 9, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) Subject to subsection (3C) below, at the end of each relevant period the Secretary of State shall provide details to Parliament of every area in which arrangements for implementing parenting orders are not available.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	(3B) Subject to subsection (3C) below, in this section ``relevant period'' means the period of six months beginning with the day on which this section commences and each subsequent period of six months.
<P>
	(3C) The duty on the Secretary of State to provide the details specified in subsection (3A) above shall cease when parenting orders are available in every area, but at any time thereafter when parenting orders are no longer available in any area the Secretary of State shall provide details as specified in subsection (3A) above for each relevant period and for this purpose ``relevant period'' means a period of six months beginning with the day on which parenting orders become unavailable in any area and each subsequent period of six months for so long as parenting orders are available in any area.'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 60, in page 8, line 16, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and for these purposes a ``responsible officer'' is a responsible officer within the meaning of subsection (8) below who holds a qualification in counselling or guidance from a professional organisation recognised by Her Majesty's Government.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 64, in page 8, line 41, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` ; and to qualify as a responsible officer for these purposes any one of the aforesaid must have had at least 3 years experience in such a position.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to the important new subject of parenting orders. We occupy a good deal of common ground with the Government on this matter. We share the objective of promoting parental responsibility and helping parents to be good parents. The previous Government passed legislation that worked towards that objective and we are prepared to consider anything that builds upon that in a constructive light.
<P>
Research shows and common sense suggests that the quality of parental supervision and of family life is an important factor in the field that we are debating. Amendment No. 59 deals with the availability of parenting orders. Parenting orders will not generally be available from the outset. Courts will be unable to make parenting orders until they have been notified of a date by the Secretary of State. That provision appears in the Bill. The Government have said that parenting orders are to be piloted, and we wish to know more about that.
<P>
Amendment No. 59 would require the Secretary of State to give details to Parliament every six months of the areas in which parenting orders are not available. The reporting requirement would cease when parenting orders are available. That would help us to determine the extent to which parenting orders are available. We think that it is desirable to have the availability of parenting orders monitored in this way. We would like to know in how many areas the orders are to be piloted, and for how long. When will they be available throughout the country?
<P>
The financial memorandum estimates that the cost of parenting orders will be &#163;4 million. We understand that the figure will depend on how the orders are to be used. Will the Minister confirm that the estimate represents the cost of parenting orders once they are available on a national basis? Will he tell us how much the piloting of parenting orders will cost in the meantime? How many parenting orders are represented by the figure of &#163;4 million? Will that money be used to fund the probation service or local authority social services? Who will receive it?
<P>
I turn to amendment Nos. 60 and 64. Probation officers, social workers and other members of the youth offending team will be responsible officers, as they are termed in the Bill. They will take responsibility for giving directions to parents on attending counselling or guidance sessions. Amendment No. 64 would require responsible officers to have at least three year's experience. Will the Minister tell us how responsible officers will be chosen and what experience they will be expected to have working in this field?
<P>
Amendment No. 60 relates to qualifications for counselling. It would be helpful to know who will carry out guidance and counselling and what qualifications they will have.

<P>

<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I wonder whether it will be in order for me to make general observations about the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I would prefer contributions at this stage to refer to specific amendments.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) for the way that he moved the amendment. he said that he was seeking information, but he expressed his support for the idea of parenting orders. They will form part of an approach that will encourage good parenting, but we do not see them as a magic wand that will deal with every problem and eventuality.
<P>
When people become parents, many recognise fairly quickly that it is not the easiest task that they will perform in their lives. Those of us who have brought up teenages know that parenting presents an extremely steep learning curve. My fifth child has just reached adulthood, but I still feel as though I have received only an initial training course in parenting over the past three decades.
<P>
The ministerial group established by the Prime Minister under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary to consider parenting and family issues recognises the need to examine matters that we have tended to put to one side because we had not seen the need to provide support and help to people.
<P>
I share the view of the hon. Member for Hertsmere that we need to be careful and ensure that the pilot exercises enable us to learn lessons and make proper use of parenting orders. The issue is still being considered and we have not yet decided what areas will be involved. However, we shall share that information with the hon. Gentleman as soon as decisions are taken.
<P>
Page x of the financial memorandum states that the &#163;4 million will cover parenting and child safety orders. The calculation of the figure is quite technical, but I am happy to make it available to the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps I might write to him on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall be happy with a written explanation. I understand that the figure of &#163;4 million is made up of &#163;250,000 for child safety orders and &#163;3.75 million for parenting orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> We share an understanding.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman used the amendments to probe the Government's intentions. To provide details to Parliament of every area in which arrangements for implementing parenting orders are not available would be a bureaucratic and costly exercise. However, we want to see the orders roll out over time and to put facilities in place. We will be best placed to introduce parenting orders nationally after the pilot exercise has been concluded and the evaluation exercise has been completed. At that point, Parliament will rightly expect to be informed of the way in which we intend to respond to the pilot exercise.
<P>
The responsible officers's role will be to ensure that parents attend whatever sessions are specified in the directions that he gives. He will be the key to the success of an order by making sure that it is implemented. In general, we expect a responsible officer to be a member of a local authority social services department, a probation officer or a member of the youth offending teams to be set up by clause 36.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 60 and 64 would restrict the pool of those who could act as responsible officers and would not provide any additional benefit. Those conducting the practical sessions involved will need to be property qualified. Although no exact templates of the courses required under the Bill are currently available, work is being done. Voluntary organisations do valuable work with parents, and we wish to adapt that for the purposes of setting up courses. We are looking at the scope for developing parenting classes, not simply as required under the orders but more generally as support for families. The responsible officer would organise the detail and structure of such courses, and so would not need the qualifications that the hon. Member for Hertsmere described.
<P>
With regard to the representatives of the agencies, people must be properly qualified to be appointed as social workers, probation officers or youth offending team members. It would be odd for those people to be appointed if they were not considered capable of performing a full range of duties. However, people coming into a profession are sometimes able to bring to bear wide experience gained elsewhere. That might be so in this instance: a person taking up a social worker post after many years working in the family sphere might be much more qualified than a person with three years' experience in that professional role.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the amendments would not add to the likelihood of the proposal's success. However, I agree that the matters that he has raised need to be explored during the pilot projects, whose implementation we shall monitor carefully to establish what works best in which set-up. Should people subject to parenting orders be dealt with individually or in separate groups? Will it be better to deal with them in conjunction with other people who have a different type of motivation? The exchange between parents may be as valuable as the input of professional staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Before the Minister draws his remarks to a conclusion, will he say what is his best estimate of when the orders will be available generally?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I hesitate to do that, simply because we are entering new territory. We must learn the leasons of the parenting orders. Obviously, if the parenting orders make a considerable impact and are recognised as valuable, the Government and many of the existing agencies will want them to be implemented quickly. Alternatively, if the pilot project results are a mixture of good and bad--a series of curates' eggs--we should need to learn those lessons. Therefore I am reluctant to give the commitments and estimates sought by the hon. Gentleman, as I think that they are unrealistic at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his acknowledgement of the work done during the previous Parliament to encourage parental responsibility. Work was under way to take it further as that Parliament ended.
<P>
The Minister will understand why we are interested in the funding of the parenting order and in how many such orders will be involved. We shall retain our interest in funding, as it is clear from the qualifying conditions in the Bill that parenting orders could apply to quite a large number of people. I look forward to receiving the Minister's letter on that subject.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 8, line 18, leave out `Sunday' and insert `Monday.'.
<P>
This is a small point, which I hope can be disposed of quickly. The Bill provides that parents required to attend counselling will have to attend once a week for three months. For that purpose, a week is said to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``aperiod of seven days beginning with a Sunday.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We were slightly worried by the use of Sunday in that context. We think that we understand the Government's intention, but we hope that the Minister will confirm that counselling sessions will not be arranged for that day.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): This is real anorak stuff--when does a week begin?--and so I have been asked to deal with it.
<P>
The intention is that sessions should not be held on a Sunday, but that is really a matter for the court. The key reason why Sunday is referred to is that we want to ensure that sessions are held once a week. To do so, we need to determine when the week starts.
<P>
Amendment No. 61 would effectively change the day of the week. ``Halsbury's Statutes'' defines a week as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``ordinarily the period from midnight on Saturday to midnight on the following Saturday''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such a definition is used in section 74 of the Shops Act 1950. Additionally the ``Oxford English Distionary'' defines a week as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The cycle of seven days, recognised in the calender of the Jews and thence adopted in the calenders of Chritian, Muslim and other peoples', a single period of this cycle, i.e. a space of seven successive days beginning with the day traditionally fixed as the first day of the week.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Jews regard Sunday as the first day of the week, and we have taken the first day of the week as being the first day following the Jewish sabbath. In the Bible, God rests on Saturday, and Sunday is therefore the start of the new week.
<P>
Obviously, it will be for the courts to determine what procedures they want to adopt. I cannot imagine that anyone intends that such events should be held on Sunday, but it may be that in some areas, for particular reasons, it will be decided to do so. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere will be aware, later in the Bill the religious needs of families are considered. I cannot imagine that anything would be done to interfere with those needs. I hope that that deals with his question and that he will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am pleased that this Minister has responded to the debate because it gives me an opportunity to apologise to him for my discourtesy in not welcoming him to the Committee when he made his initial contribution on Tuesday evening. I hope that having done that, we can get off to a better start with the Minister for the remainder of the Bill.
<P>
I found the Minister's remarks about why Sunday was chosen most interesting. What we really wanted to know was what he said at the end of his speech--that he thought it unlikely that Sunday would be chosen as a day for counselling sessions. I shall not tempt the Minister to go further; he has said that he thinks that that is unlikely. He will understand our reasons for thinking that it would be undesirable for sessions to be organised for Sundays. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 8, line 21, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and where such an order has not previously been made in respect of a parent a parenting order need not include such a requirement if the court is of the opinion that it is inappropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A parenting order need not include a requirement to attend counselling or guidance sessions if the parent has previously been made the subject of an order. In every other case, it appears that a parent must attend counselling or guidance. We understand the reasoning behind that, but wonder if in practice it is not a little inflexible. There may be some parents--I emphasise the word some--who have not previously attended counselling or guidance in respect of whom the court wants to make a parental order to make some other requirement of them, but who the court does not feel would benefit from guidance or counselling. An example of such a requirement may be to keep the child indoors at certain times. A court may want to impose such a requirement without also wanting the parent to attend counselling or guidance.
<P>
It would be regrettable if a court had to require counselling or guidance for such parents in order to impose other requirements on them. We wonder whether that would represent the best possible use of resources. I emphasise that we are not doubting the benefits of counselling or guidance, but questioning whether it is necessary in every case. We hope that the Minister will accept our argument for flexibility and that he will consider it sympathetically.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> To deal with the amendment and the issues that it raises, it is important for me to explain the aim and the effect of the clause so that the core nature of the counselling requirement is understood. Clause 9 makes provision for courts to impose a new court order called a parenting order. It is designed to help and support parents to control the behaviour of their children by requiring them to attend counselling and guidance sessions and, if necessary, to comply with specific requirements, which the courts may place on parents. The order can be made in a number of situations: when a child safety order, an anti-social behaviour order or a sex offender order is made; when a child or young person has been convicted of a criminal offence, or when parents have been convicted of failing to send their children to school. One of the central tenets of our youth justice reform programme is the need for young offenders and their parents to face up to their offending behaviour and to take responsibility for it. That was one of the main themes in our White Paper entitled ``No More Excuses'', which was published in November.
<P>
Parents of young offenders may not directly be to blame for the crimes of their children, but they have a responsibility for providing their children with proper care and control. We believe that, until now, insufficient help or attention has been given to parents to change their children's behaviour. We aim to address that by means of the parenting order.
<P>
Research has shown that inadequate parental supervision is associated strongly with offending. For example, a Home Office study showed that 42 per cent. of juveniles who had low or medium levels of parental supervision had offended whereas, for those juveniles who had experienced high levels of parental supervision, the figure was only 20 per cent. The same research showed that the quality of relationship between the parent and the child is absolutely crucial. We know also that parents who are harsh or erratic are twice as likely to have children who offend.
<P>
The order will consist of two elements. The first will impose a requirement on parents to attend counselling and guidance sessions where they would receive help in dealing with their children. They would learn, for example, how to set and enforce consistent standards of behaviour and how to respond more effectively to challenging adolescent demands. The sessions would be no more than once a week and up to three months' duration.
<P>
However, for those parents who wilfully neglect their responsibilities there will be a second element. The court could impose a requirement on them to exercise control over their children's behaviour. That could include, for example, seeing that their child gets to school every day or ensuring that he or she is home by a certain time of night. That element could last for up to 12 months.
<P>
An important feature of the parenting order is that its requirements will be supervised by a responsible officer. That person will have responsibility for, among other things, the provision of counselling and guidance sessions and for ensuring that the parent complies with any other requirements that the court may impose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I agree with a great deal, if not all, of what the Minister is saying. Is he satisfied that, in order to impose such requirements as those he described, it is necessary in each case for a parent to receive counselling and guidance?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The core of the clause is the counselling and guidance session, which is the key deficiency in the way in which the youth justice system operates. In 1993, I was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee that visited the United States to examine youth offending. A black woman judge in Virginia told me that their most effective orders were parenting orders, which tell inadequate parents how they might exercise greater control over their children's behaviour. That has become a core element of the clause. The hon. Gentleman wants to remove that core element and thus give the court the option only of the second part of the clause--the 12-month period of control. That is mainly directed towards parents who are wilfully negligent. Parents who are likely to need the 12-month period of obligation to control are people who need to be taught something about their responsibilities as parents.
<P>
It is difficult to imagine circumstances in which we would remove the core element of counselling sessions and retain only the second element, because that would be contrary to the purpose of the clause. For that reason, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary. It aims to give the courts an additional discretion to avoid making new requirements to attend counselling or guidance sessions when a parenting order has not been given to a parent for a different child or a different offence.
<P>
The amendment is not appropriate because counselling or guidance sessions are at the core of the new parenting order and it is right that they should be part of it, except, perhaps, when the parents have previously been subject to such a requirement, as set out in subsection (5).
<P>
I appreciate why the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment. I can see why he thinks that giving the court discretion in this respect might have some advantages but if the amendment were accepted, the core element of the clause would be removed from the parenting order, and we want to preserve it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to press the matter too hard, but it is our duty to scrutinise every nook and cranny of the Bill. I am not entirely convinced by what the Minister said. I agree with everything he said about the value of guidance, counselling and parental supervision, but the amendment seeks to provide for every case, whether or not a court decides that counselling and guidance are inappropriate. It would be a shame for a court to be obliged to impose counselling and guidance merely because it wanted to impose other requirements. I was trying to cover every case. We have already established that only &#163;4 million is being put to one side for parenting orders, and many parents may be in need of them. We want to ensure that every penny of the money is spent as wisely and effectively as possible.
<P>
I shall not press the matter further, but we are left wondering whether this is one matter in which it might be left to the court's discretion to use the order properly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, I give the clause a cautious welcome. However, I shall raise one or two concerns and ask some specific questions.
<P>
The Minister was right to say that a lack of parental supervision often results in youngsters turning to crime, as Home Office research shows. That is something that we know from our own practical experience of life. I do not deal with youth crime, which is committed by very young people, but I know that more often than not, the parents of 18 or 19-year-olds who appear in court are not present. One may ask where the devil is the family support? I have often asked a young person aged 18 or 19, ``Where is your mother or father? You are here on a serious charge''. The reply is ``Gone to work''. When I ask, ``Do they know that you are in court?'', the reply is ``Yes, they stayed at home''. In the case of younger children, the answers would probably be the same. With that kind of support, love and affection, it is not surprising that someone comes before the court. I am sure that many hon. Members would agree that a lack of strong upbringing with parental support, supervision, love and care is a large factor in young people's crime. It always has been and always will be. That is how life is.
<P>
I have a slight, general anxiety about the principle of parenting orders. Good parents will not need them; it would be a waste of time to make an order. However, will bad parents react favourably and positively to them? If they are the type of parent who would do so then the problem would not have arisen in the first place. We will get nowhere with some parents, whatever we do, although I hope that we might achieve something with others. As the Minister said earlier, some parents are inadequate but caring. Such parents might benefit. However, there are parents who are positively malevolent. They would be difficult to deal with and orders would not be helpful. I hope that the orders succeed in practice.
<P>
Even if they succeed only in a minority of cases, that would be money well spent.
<P>
More specifically, I was discussing the Bill with the headmaster of a boarding school in Surrey, who asked about the definition of ``parent''. He is officially in loco parentis to children whose parents are abroad and asked if he would be liable to a parenting order. I am sure that he would not be.
<P>
However, that raises the question of who might be subject to such an order. Will these orders apply to those who are in loco parentis? Would both parents--if there were two parents--be made the subject of an order, or would the order apply only to one parent? If an order is made against a guardian, does that mean a legal guardian? Some young offenders are brought up by an aunt, a grandmother or an older brother. Will such people be the subject of an order? It might be no bad thing if they were.
<P>
I assume that the definition of ``parent'' is strict, and despite those queries on factual matters, I broadly welcome the clause. I hope that the orders will be successful, but I repeat my concern about whether many parents will respond well to them in practice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Leigh (Gainsborough):</B> I should like to question the Minister further. It is obvious that parental supervision is vital and that a lack ofit can lead directly to crime. However, such orders are not necessarily appropriate in all cases. That was my first instinct. I refer, for my remarks on this topic, to a brief helpfully provided by the National Association of Probation Officers. That is not a political organisation. The Minister of State cannot accuse it of being an organisation of softies. The association has severe doubts about the clause. It is important to consider its doubts as a body representing professionals and experts in the relevant area. The association's doubts are so strong that it suggests deleting the entire clause. This is strong stuff from so moderate an organisation. I want to give the Minister an opportunity to deal with its worries.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The association makes the point that a parenting order may be an inappropriate response to the needs of many parents. We know why parents are poor parents. It may be because they lack money, employment, decent housing, skills, education, training or self-esteem. That is fairly obvious. NAPO suggests that the existence of the orders would make little difference to those core causes of poor parenting. The association says--I do not know whether this is right, but I should appreciate the Minister's comments, as he has the benefit of research not available to us--that very few parents wilfully neglect their children. I suspect that that might be right. Some appalling cases of wilful neglect reach the national newspapers, but their seriousness and the gruesome headlines that they make do not mean that they are common.
<P>
What would parenting orders achieve for the generality of poor parents, who, if we accept that wilful neglect is rare, simply have great difficulty in controlling their children? It might help to give them self-esteem, but it would not provide them with employment, housing, education and other things that they need. NAPO believes that the orders could make things much worse; that coercing parents in that way to attend a session could result in their taking things out on their children. NAPO suggests doing what we all know should be done--although Governments have wrestled with this problem since time began: making a substantial investment in things such as housing, to solve the primary problems. I realise that there is not the money for that.
<P>
I should like the Minister to comment in the light of the deep concern of such a serious organisation, which says that the orders might ``pathologise'' behaviour. I am not sure what the word means, but a serious charge is being made. Presumably the Minister or his officials have had meetings with the association and have assuaged some of its concerns. If not, the Committee should be worried. Does the Under-Secretary believe the association's response to be wrong and its concerns inflated? He may, while accepting that parenting orders will not solve fundamental problems still believe that they will help, but will he at least reject the association's charge that parenting orders could do harm? If he can convince me on that point I shall happily welcome the clause, like my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins).
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The orders in the Bill have been subject to widespread consultation for a long time, and many organisations have submitted their views to us. In May 1996, we issued a consultation document entitled ``Tackling youth crime'' and, in November 1997, a White Paper entitled ``No more excuses''. Some of the responses have been critical of some aspects of the Bill, but by and large, our proposals are viewed, especially by the police and law enforcement agencies, as an attempt to deal with some of the difficult, complex issues that police officers and others involved in the juvenile justice system deal with daily. However, none of the clauses, including this one on parenting orders, will provide an all-embracing solution to the problems of the juvenile justice system or youth offending.
<P>
Our core argument is that no one wants children to fall into crime, but many children do so because of inadequate parenting. Some inadequate parents can be assisted by learning basic techniques of parenting. Some parents will want to undertake the course and counselling voluntarily; others will need a sanction to do so.
<P>
The scheme is not so much about punishing parents as helping them to gain greater control and be good parents. It is not perfect, but it seeks to strike the right balance. It does something fundamental; it tries to reconstruct and, in some instances, create a proper relationship between offending children and their parents.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking raised several practical issues. He and I have practised in the courts. Until 1992, I regularly practised in juvenile courts. I, too, have been involved in cases in which parents did not turn up, despite the fact that a legal provision can be used to oblige them to do so. In my experience, some parents have been wilfully negligent in that they have had no interest in their children, although that is relatively rare.
<P>
If parents are wilfully negligent, the chances of their children offending are likely to be considerably more than if the parents are merely inadequate. Those who are parented by wilfully negligent parents are more likely to offend. Therefore, it is important that we deal with both wilfully negligent parents and inadequate parents, and we are attempting to do so.
<P>
We do not suggest that all parents will suddenly change their behaviour because of the clause, parenting orders or counselling. Some will not be able to cope with that, and they will remain inadequate, but at least we are beginning to address those parents who might well benefit from it. Some of the parents might want to benefit and undertake counselling voluntarily; others will need sanctions to encourage them to do so.
<P>
Section 1 of the Family Law Reform Act 1987 contains a complicated definition, but parents are effectively defined as the biological parents, plus others who have control over the child. Guardians are defined as such, and that is a similar relationship, except that it is not biological--in effect, they are in loco parentis, they are in charge of the child.
<P>
The definition is fairly broad, but guardian is defined in clause 104. The definition is the same as that in the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, and it includes any person who in the opinion of the court has for the time being the care of the child or young person. So it may well include a person who is simply in loco parentis for a time, provided that he or she has effective care of the child.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking raised the example of an aunt who for all practical purposes has practical care of the child. Such an aunt would fall into the category and therefore could be subject to a parenting order, if the court so decided. The hon. Gentleman said that that might well be a good thing, and I agree with him.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) raised a number of issues, some of which I have already dealt with. I accept his first point that orders are not always appropriate; they may well be appropriate in some circumstances and for some parents but not for others. We want to give the courts the power to tackle some of the fundamental problems behind youth offending. The clause gives the court the option to trying to address the issue of bad or inadequate parenting.
<P>
NAPO has expressed a number of concerns. Let me try to deal with some of them. First, it makes the point that orders are not always appropriate. I accept that. That will be for the court to decide, having considered all the family circumstances and read all the reports. NAPO also says that the problems of youth crime go much wider; they have greater social realities. Of course that is true; that is why the Government are seeking to address the causes of crime in a broader sense with the new deal and various other policies. No one suggests that the Bill of itself is the answer to all the problems of youth offending. Clearly it is not; it must be part of a wider strategy, and NAPO is right to say that we must also address some wider social issues.
<P>
The next point made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough was that the incidence of wilful neglect is small. My answer is that it may well be small, but the chances of children who are wilfully neglected offending is much greater, so we must have specific statutory provision to deal with wilful neglect. He then suggested that NAPO says that parents subject to such orders may well take it out on the child, so that orders may well have a detrimental effect on the relationship and the child.
<P>
The court will have to consider the family circumstances in each case and whether that is likely to occur. The overall objective of the clause and the orders is to make parenting better--to encourage and teach parents who are the subject of counselling how to be better and more adequate parents, who are less likely to abuse their child. They may come to understand that the physical abuse that they may in the past have felt to be an appropriate response is an inappropriate response, and that they can control the child's behaviour by techniques other than the severe violence that concerns the members of NAPO and the hon. Gentleman. My answer to NAPO's concern is that having undergone counselling sessions, parents are likely to be better parents than before, because they will have been taught new techniques, and so the chances of abuse will be reduced, not increased.
<P>
I hope that the situation is not ``pathologised''--[Hon. Members: ``What does that mean?''] I undertake to write to provide a definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I thank the Minister for the careful and courteous way in which he is replying to our comments; he is making some good points. I do not intend to be difficult; I am genuinely extremely interested to know the answer to this question. I am a parent, which is my most important role in life, but I feel inadequate because I have never attended parenting classes. Nor have I ever attended classes to help me to become a better Member of Parliament. I am curious about parenting classes. What will they teach people? What skills do parents need? Can the Minister explain such matters?

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The most important role of the hon. Gentleman--and I hope that he performs it well --is that of a parent. It is more important than anything else that parents get it right. We could all benefit from learning more, but some of us muddle through and it comes out all right in the end.
<P>
Some parents do not have the ability to muddle through and the classes will encourage them to consider how they parent and to ask questions such as, ``Is it right to chastise and, if so, what sort of punishment is appropriate--verbal or physical?'' If a parent says to a child that he or she must not do a certain thing or else a sanction will be imposed, the sanction must be imposed so that the child knows where the boundaries are. When children genuinely require attention, it is beneficial in the long term to provide them with it rather than leave them by themselves and go to the pub.
<P>
Parents will learn that, if they fail to comply with their legal obligations, they may be in trouble with the law. They must know when the authorities can intervene if they are inadequate. Parents must know what may happen to their children if they are taken into care or placed under court supervision. Some parents have no understanding of such matters and encouraging them to think about them may help people to become better parents. Counselling and guidance sessions will not be set up to teach from a standard blueprint how to be better parents. They will pass on a few techniques and advice.
<P>
Research shows that inadequate parents tend to beget inadequate children, who become inadequate parents themselves. The clause is an attempt to intervene in that cycle and nip it in the bud, a phrase that my hon. Friend the Minister of State often uses. We want to deal with the issue at a particular time to stop it recurring. I welcome the general support of members of the Committee for the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Parenting orders: supplemental</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 9, line 23, leave out `and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 71, in page 9, line 25, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) any conflict with the child's religious beliefs; and
<P>
(d) any interference with the times at which he normally attends an educational establishment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We note that, under clause 10, parents' religious beliefs and their right to attend work or an educational institution are protected. The requirements of a parenting order should avoid interfering with that. However, the religious beliefs or school attendance of a child whose parents are subject to a parenting order are not similarly protected. It is possible to conceive of circumstances in which the child's beliefs may be different from those of the parents or a particular parent, who has care and control of the child.
<P>
We imagine that responsible officers will wish to avoid interfering with the child's religious beliefs, if they are different from those of the parent, and school attendance, but we should like the Minister to comment on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendments would extend the provisions to avoid conflict with the child's religious beliefs and attendance at an educational establishment.
<P>
The amendment is not necessary because clause 10(2) already requires the court to,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``obtain and consider information about the person's family circumstances and the likely effect of the order on those circumstances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The court must consider any adverse effect that a parenting order would have on the child's religious belief or attendance at an educational establishment. Therefore, there is no lacuna, and no problem with the clause.
<P>
Some court proceedings that trigger a parenting order contain similar protection. For example, before a court imposes a child safety order or, in criminal law, a curfew order, it must not lose sight of the fact that the order is directed at the parents and that if affects their interests. All the parents' circumstances should be taken into account, including the effect of an order on their children. I hope that a good parent would wish to encourage a child's religious beliefs. Most importantly, a good parent wants to ensure that the child attends an educational establishment. The court will consider all the information about the family--that includes religious beliefs and school attendance. I cannot envisage a court trying to interfere with a child's religious beliefs or ability to go to school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response. He said that the court would receive information from a report. The same report would provide information about the parents' religious beliefs and attendance at educational establishments. Yet the Bill provides explicitly for protection of the parents' religious beliefs and attendance at educational institutions.
<P>
The Minister also mentioned the routes by which a parenting order could be made for a particular parent and child. A parenting order that has been made for a breach of a child curfew order may protect the child's religious beliefs, but other routes do not provide such protection. For example, a parenting order could be made because a child is convicted of an offence. In those circumstances, a child's religious beliefs would not be protected. The Minister looks puzzled, but there is no necessity for an order that protects a child's religious beliefs in the circumstances that I have just described.
<P>
If the Minister says that the courts would not want to interfere with a child's attendance at a school, or with its religious beliefs, and that a court should take such matters into account when reading reports, I shall be satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Under the clause, the court will consider all the family circumstances. They include the possible interference of a parenting order with religious beliefs or school attendance. The clause provides the safeguard that the hon. Gentleman rightly seeks. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied, and that he will not press the amendment into a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am and I will not. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 75, in page 9, line 42, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(8) Proceedings under subsection (7) above may only be instituted by or with the authority of the responsible officer in relation to that parenting order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a more serious and extensive subject. It deals with sanctions against parents who do not comply with a parenting order. Under subsection (7) of the clause, a parent who fails to comply with the terms of an order commits an offence, and is liable to be fined. We acknowledge the need for a sanction to ensure compliance with a parenting order, but we also appreciate that this is a serious step: it is the prosecution of a parent for a criminal offence. The parenting order will have been made in the first place because of the child's behaviour, not the parent's behaviour, although as the Committee will have gathered, wilful parental failure or neglect may lie in the background to such cases. Some interesting points were made on the matter in earlier debates but I think that the Minister will agree that it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between wilful neglect and inadequacy, and it is not easy for courts to do.
<P>
In either case, if the parent fails to comply with the requirements of an order which has been made because of such neglect or inadequacy, the parent faces prosecution and a criminal conviction, and possibly the start of a criminal record. That should be taken very seriously and the question who is the right person to take responsibility for instituting proceedings should be considered. We believe that the right person should be the responsible officer, who knows all about the parents. That would be a safeguard when so much is at stake for the parents in the case.
<P>
Amendment No. 75 requires that proceedings in relation to the order may be instituted only by the responsible officer. I shall be interested in the Minister's response; if he tells me that other people may be responsible for instituting proceedings we will want to know who they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> We have an opportunity to talk about sanctions and to raise such matters with the Minister.
<P>
I take it that when an application is made for a parenting order, the parent will be given notice and have an opportunity to make representations to argue the case. A parent may want to say, ``I don't want a parenting order against me.''
<P>
I am sorry to return yet again to the thorny subject of legal aid, but this might be the sort of case in which legal aid is available, although I am not sure that it should be. Will legal aid be available to an inadequate parent who is the subject of a parenting order for representations to be made against the order being imposed? I expect that the answer is yes.
<P>
The problem lies further down the line because when there is a breach the matter moves into criminal territory and more difficult factors are involved. I am thinking aloud--I hope that the Minister will comment on my points in due course--but I suppose that before a breach of criminal proceedings is brought the Crown Prosecution Service will be involved. The criteria for bringing cases against parents for breaches of orders will have to be well thought out if they are to be in the public interest.
<P>
A parenting order may require a parent positively to do something--for example, attend a counselling session--and there may be a breach if the parent decided not to turn up. That is not so difficult. Other requirements of an order might be more neutral and less obvious; I do not know whether an order could state, for instance, ``The parent is hereby ordered to be a good parent.'' That is a poor example, but I hope that the Minister understands what I am getting at. At the end of the day, what is a breach? How easy is it to spot a breach? Will we not have to be pretty careful about prosecuting breaches that are either minimal or hard to prove? Let us assume that there is a prosecution: we are then into the full rigours of the criminal law. The normal rules of all criminal court cases must apply. I am sure that the Minister will confirm that.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day what troubles me about breach proceedings with a maximum of level 3 on the standard scale, which I think is a fine of &#163;3,000, and summary only, is that the odds are pretty high that the parent is on benefits. Let us be careful about this because the last thing that one wants is to see highish fines imposed, as they just clog up means inquiries.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I am following my hon. Friend carefully. Would he agree that from our mutual experience in the courts, one of the concerns about breaches of these orders is that the sort of parents on whom courts may wish to impose these orders will be those who say, ``I am sorry, my teenage son is beyond my control and I want to wash my hands of him''? They are precisely the kind of parents who even when the magistrates, in a fit of desperation and irritation, wish to impose a parenting order may breach it, saying, ``I cannot do anything; there is nothing wrong with my parenting skills but this teenage hooligan is beyond my control.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point about the nature of the world outside. That is quite likely to happen. He illustrates with that example the sort of problems that might arise. We are in fairly sensitive territory when it comes to prosecuting. It is not a straightforward case such as someone who steals something. We are delving into personal relationships, nuances and shades of colour, and it is a dangerous area in which to have the criminal law too heavily involved. I am not even sure that it is necessarily a good idea. If it is implemented, it ought be be used fairly sparingly.
<P>
Mr. Mike O'Brien
<P>
: A number of useful points have been made. I shall deal first with those made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. Our concern about the amendment is that it might undermine the strength of the order by requiring consents from the responsible officer before a prosecution can be undertaken. That creates and extra hurdle which might make enforcement more difficult. Obviously the views of the responsible officer must be taken into account by those who are seeking to prosecute.
<P>
Subsection (7) puts in place the arrangements for dealing with a failure by a parent subject to a parenting order to comply with any requirements or directions set as part of that order. When a parent fails to comply with a requirement in the parenting order or a direction from a responsible officer, it will be incumbent upon the responsible officer to inform the police of the failure. There is therefore a role for the responsible officer to make perhaps, and probably usually, the initial approach to the police and thence on to the prosecuting authorities to inform them that a breach has occurred.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking asked what sort of breaches are we talking about, and I shall come to that in a moment. A typical breach would be simply not to attend the courses. The responsible officer can then say that the person has not attended the courses and it is necessary to deal with someone who has clearly decided to breach the law and breach an order of the court. The prosecuting authorities would then have to consider the evidence of that. It is a criminal matter.
<P>
The Crown Prosecution Service would take any statements that the police obtained from those seeking to bring a break before the court. It would consider whether the evidence was there on the normal merits test for a prosecution to justify taking the alleged breach to the court and charging the parent with it. The prosecution authorities initiate the prosecution in the normal way, applying the usual test of evidential burden and public interest. If a prosecution is brought, there will be an opportunity for the parents to defend any failure by them to comply with the requirements of an order. Following an amendment to the Bill in another place the parents will be able to use the defence of reasonable excuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> What the Minister is saying is right. I want to put to him the case where a responsible officer has done his duty and reported a breach and the police are considering whether to bring a prosecution for it. Would the Minister agree that the responsible officer's views should carry some weight with the police? If he told them that he did not think it would be a good idea to prosecute the parent because the parent was grossly inadequate, the police could decide that prosecution might make a situation worse rather than better. Does the Minister think that that could be taken into account on public interest grounds even though the other grounds for bringing a prosecution, such as the evidential test and so forth, had all been made out?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That will be a matter more for the CPS than the police. The police will have to consider what evidence is brought forward and the CPS will then have to consider both the merits of the case in terms of the evidential burden and the public interest criteria. Circumstances might arise where the views of the responsible officer might lead the CPS to take a particular view of these matters. It would depend entirely on the circumstances. I cannot really take it much further than that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking raised a number of important points to practising lawyers in particular and to everyone who believes that practising lawyers sometimes defend the interests of all citizens. Access to legal aid has its merits and importance. Let me also declare an interest: I am a lawyer although I have not practised for many years. The initial order will be a circumstance in which the normal rules relating to legal aid would apply, although where it is regarded as a civil case the assistance by way of representation rules would apply.
<P>
If we were dealing with the breach, subsequently, the circumstances would be the normal ones for criminal legal aid. Those rules would apply in the normal way. There is therefore the opportunity for the parents to make a representation in the initial circumstances if they comply with all the legal aid rules. In terms of the criminal breach, the normal legal aid criteria would apply provided that the parents met the income test and what used to be called the Widgery criteria and is now called the merits test. Legal aid would then be available.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking also asked what would be a breach. An obvious one would be not attending the court. He rightly says that there needs to be, and I am sure there will be, a sensible and careful approach to the issue of prosecuting. The issue for the prosecuting authorities is not so much whether the child has subsequently offended but whether the parent has breached the order. It is incumbent upon the magistrates court to ensure that any terms of the parenting order are such that it is clear to the prosecuting authorities at a later stage whether there has been a breach of that order. Vague or general provisions under the parenting order would not be adequate. There would need to be specific obligations on the parent, breach of which would clearly result in prosecution. There will be specificity and care, not only in making the decisions to prosecute, but in the way in which the initial order is set out.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking asked whether the normal rules in criminal cases would apply in breaches of the order. The answer is yes.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about financial circumstances, as did the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins), who is leaving the Room. Perhaps he would like to come back while I reply. Often, people who come before the courts are living on benefits. The courts are used to dealing with such cases and if they impose penalties, they will consider the circumstances of people with limited means in the same way as in any other criminal case. The provisions already exist to enable courts to deal adequately with such matters.
<P>
I have explained how breach proceedings will work under the parenting orders. I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will accept that the amendment is entirely inappropriate and unnecessary, and that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I did not table the amendment because I thought that it was entirely inappropriate and incorrect. I wanted to probe the issues that we have debated.
<P>
My initial response was similar to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. Prosecution in the criminal courts is a serious business and we should not undertake it lightly. I agree with the Minister that when a parent has decided not to comply with the order of the court and wilfully flouts it, I would have no hesitation in prosecuting that person. That parent would evidently be in breach of the order.
<P>
I am worried however, about the parent who is grossly inadequate. Such parents will be subject to parenting orders. We hope that they might improve as a result. Those who are taking decisions on these matters should do so with common sense and with a touch of compassion.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised a valid point. Some parents are inadequate people, not just inadequate parents. Indeed, that might be part of the reason for the need to make an order. Such people might have difficulty in coping with the regime set up by the order. However, during the proceedings the court will be able to consider any evidence about those parents. The parents might give evidence. The courts will receive information, in the normal way, about the adequacy of these individuals. The mechanisms are already in place to deal with such difficulties, which occur daily in criminal cases. This would be a similar matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister makes a fair point. The information will be available to the courts when the orders are made. After any breach proceedings, it would also be available as part of the criminal case. However, by that time the prosecution would have been brought; the responsible officer would have reported the breach to the police and proceedings would be instituted. The courts might then have to deal with a grossly inadequate person, but one who is legally, under the Bill, in breach of the order and liable to conviction for a criminal offence. We hope that liaison and discussion between the responsible officer, the police and those responsible for bringing the prosecution can take place at an earlier stage.
<P>
I hope that the Committee understands the concerns and feelings that have motivated the amendment. I have heard the Minister's comments and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 10, line 42, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) The court shall have the power to compel the attendance at court of any parent or guardian of the child.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 97 in Clause 13, page 11, line 33, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) Before making a child safety order in the absence of a parent or guardian a magistrates' court shall satisfy itself that all reasonable efforts have been made to secure his or her attendance at court.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We move on from parenting orders to child safety orders. We shall go over similar ground, but in a different context.
<P>
Child safety orders will deal with children of less than 10 years of age and, therefore, under the current age of criminal legal responsibility. We need to keep that fact at the forefront of our deliberations.
<P>
The Bill places great emphasis on children of under 14 and on very young children of under 10. We shall probe the justification for the weight given to the children by the Bill. They play a prominent part in it. We do not doubt the Government's concerns, but what objective evidence do they have to justify the courses of action that they are inviting the Committee to take?
<P>
If under-10s are going off the rails sufficiently to justify taking them to court to seek child safety orders, inevitably that might be because of wider problems at home. Youth courts, which deal with offenders up to the age of 17, recognise the importance of parents attending court. It is even more important that parents should be in court in the case of very young offenders.
<P>
Amendment No. 76 would give a court the power to compel the attendance of any parent or guardian of a child, and amendment No. 97 would require a court to satisfy itself that all reasonable steps have been taken to secure the attendance of any parent or guardian. We hope that courts will be prepared to go to some lengths to ensure parental attendance in court.
<P>
It is also important that a court clarifies who will be responsible for what under the terms of the order. For example, the powers under subsection (5) could result in a child being made subject to the requirements to prevent bad behaviour. We would like the court to determine who will be responsible for that. Will the parents or the responsible officer be responsible for ensuring that a child complies with the requirements preventing bad behaviour? That question has been raised by children's organisations, and we await the Minister's response.
<P>
I hope that the Government will recognise that the fate of very young children is very much bound up with what is going on at home and the performance of their parents and that they see the merits of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is important that parents attend court when their child is being considered for a child safety order. The Government are keen that parents accept their responsibilities for their children and for their children's behaviour. Being considered for a child safety order is a serious matter, and parents should be present to play their part. Parents will often have a role to play in ensuring that the requirements set by the court are met. The court may also wish to consider whether a parenting order is appropriate.
<P>
The amendments are unnecessary, because existing legislation already deals with the points that they raise. Section 34A(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, as inserted by section 56 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, gives the court sufficient powers to deal with court attendances by parents or guardians. Section 56 of the 1991 Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``3A.--(1) Where a child or young person is charged with an offence or is for any other reason brought before a court''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that includes a family proceedings court that will deal with the child safety order--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) may in any case; and
<P>
(b) shall in the case of a child or a young person who is under the age of sixteen years,
<P>
require a person who is a parent or guardian of his to attend at the court during all the stages of the proceedings, unless and to the extent that the court is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to require such attendance, having regard to the circumstances of the case.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Malins
<P>
: I am unclear as to whether a child aged eight or nine has to be present in court when a child safety order is made. When the court makes an order that, in the words of clause 12(1), puts the child
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``under the supervision of the responsible officer''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``requires the child to comply with such requirements,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is not specified whether the child has to turn up in court. I should be worried if it had to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The circumstances will vary in each case, and the courts will have to decide whether the child's attendance in court is appropriate. We are anxious not to be overly prescriptive in our approach. It may be appropriate in certain circumstances for a child under the age of 10 to attend, particularly if it were necessary to emphasise to the child that the issue was serious and that it was taken seriously by the parent. In other cases the court may feel it to be inappropriate--for example, if distress might be caused to the child because of its family circumstances. We do not want to restrain the courts unduly and, broadly speaking, they will make the decisions in such matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked who is responsible for ensuring the child's behaviour under the requirements of clause 12(5). Responsible officers will be responsible for supervising the child or young person. They will have to ensure that the parent is doing his or her duty and is not wilfully negligent or behaving improperly. Those circumstances can be brought to the attention of the court in determining whether the child safety order is being complied with. That involves ensuring the safety of the child--its proper supervision and protection--and safeguarding the overall community interest by ensuring that the behaviour of the child is taken into consideration. The order's purpose will be to facilitate a balance between those two factors. The responsible officer will supervise the operation of the child safety order, ensure that it is effectively administered and ensure, as far as possible, that the child's behaviour is reasonably good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response, and I still have one or two worries. He will understand our reasons for tabling the amendment. However, I do not propose to press the matter to a division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 77, in page 10, line 46, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) Subject to subsection (2C) below, at the end of each relevant period the Secretary of State shall provide details to Parliament of every area in which arrangements for implementing child safety orders are not available.
<P>
 (2B) Subject to subsection (2C) below, in this section ``relevant period'' means the period of six months beginning with the day on which this section commences and each subsequent period of six months.
<P>
 (2C) The duty on the Secretary of State to provide the details specified in subsection (2A) above shall cease when child safety orders are available in every area but at any time thereafter when child safety orders are no longer available in an area the Secretary of State shall provide details as specified in subsection (2A) above for each relevant period and for this purpose relevant period means a period of six months beginning with the day on which child safety orders become unavailable in any area and each subsequent period of six months for so long as child safety orders are unavailable in any area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 96, in page 11, line 30, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `, and to qualify as a responsible officer for these purposes one of the aforesaid must have had at least 3 years experience in such a position.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It may be for the convenience of the Committee and the Minister to know that I do not propose to press amendment No. 96 because that ground was covered by the Minister's response to a previous amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 77 would require the Secretary of State to submit a report to Parliament on the availability of child safety orders. Will the Minister confirm that they are to be piloted? Will he also tell us where and over what period they will be piloted? I realise that Ministers were unable to say in what areas parenting orders will be piloted--is that also true of child safety orders? We would like an answer as soon as possible.
<P>
We are curious about how child safety orders will be resourced. The Government informed me in a written parliamentary answer that, where the cost of parenting orders was estimated at &#163;3&#183;75 million, that of child safety orders was estimated at about &#163;250,000. We realise that it is difficult for the Government to give precise figures. However, by any standard of Government expenditure, &#163;250,000 seems a small sum adequately to pay for fully operational child safety orders throughout the country.
<P>
The Government said that they expect the parenting order to be used more widely than the child safety order because it will be available in a wider range of circumstances. That surprised me, as the circumstances in which a child safety order could be made under clause 12(3) are in fact wide. The amount of funding set aside to cover those circumstances is therefore relatively small. We need to hear more from the Government about that. For example, can the Minister tell us how many child safety orders the figure of &#163;250,000 represents, and on what basis that figure has been calculated? Those are important questions that the Government must deal with, and I look forward to the Minister's response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those points, and the way in which he made them. He has agreed not to press amendment No. 96, so I shall not address that issue.
<P>
The problem with amendment No. 77 is that it nearly replicates amendment No. 59 and that it is therefore unnecessary. However, I suspect that it is a probing amendment, the purpose of which is to uncover issues that relate to piloting. Therefore, I shall not point out the amendment's flaws, which concern the cost and bureaucracy that it would entail, because its purpose is solely to elicit information from me.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the child safety order will be piloted. To begin with, that will happen in a few areas only--hence the initial estimates of the cost of the project.
<P>
The question of where the piloting will take place and for how long is being examined. We shall make an announcement in due course. I shall not give an undertaking to write to the hon. Gentleman with that information, as it may be some time before the decisions are made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a moment. What I can do, as soon as the decisions are made and provided that the legislative process is well advanced, is ensure that the hon. Gentleman is given that information. I shall do that in a letter to him or in a parliamentary answer--or, more likely, by both means.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We do not know how long our proceedings in Committee will last, but if the decision about where the pilot scheme is to be held is made before they end, will the Minister be able to tell the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government's aim is to ensure that the Committee and Parliament as a whole are given as much information as possible. According to the latest estimate being handed to me, the child safety order pilot is expected to run for 18 months from the autumn of this year. The area involved has not yet been determined, but that gives some idea of the length of the pilot project.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about how the costings for the pilot were identified, and I hope that the information that I have just given will clarify my earlier response. The limited piloting exercise with child safety orders will show us how they operate and help us to get the mechanics right. The costing reflects that aim. In due course, we shall examine those calculations in more detail, when we have established how useful the orders will be for the courts.
<P>
The Committee must bear in mind that the Children Act 1989 gives the courts other options, such as supervision orders. Those alternative mechanisms might be more appropriate in certain circumstances. The main distinction between the provisions of the Children Act and this Bill involves the protection of the community. A Children Act supervision order mainly protects the child; this Bill is concerned with protecting both the child and the community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened attentively to the Minister's courteous reply. I accept that the piloting of the child safety order will guide the Government's final estimate of the cost. However, the Government knew that the order would be piloted when they arrived at the initial figure of &#163;250,000. I know that the Minister cannot go into great detail, but I should like to know a little more about where that figure came from. How many child safety orders does it represent?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The pilot trials will take about 18 months. We have tried to estimate the likely costing on a year-to-year basis. The figures represent the end result of our calculations. I would have to get my officials to prepare a memorandum setting out how the calculation was made. I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman with details of the calculation. If the hon. Gentleman accepts that, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am happy to accept that. I think that we are four square on our understanding, but will the Minister confirm that &#163;250,000 is the figure for the general application of child safety orders throughout the country and not just the pilot schemes?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I see that off stage my officials are nodding that the hon. Gentleman is correct. However, that is not my understanding of the situation. The issue is important, so I will ensure that it is covered in detail in any reply that I give to the hon. Gentleman. Should I make that reply, I will ensure that it is circulated to Committee members so that they are properly informed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for that. I would be grateful if the Minister would include in his reply details of the costs of the pilot and of the costs of the scheme once it is fully operational. I understand from the reply that I have already received that the costs are those of the scheme when fully operational, but I may be mistaken. On the basis of what the Minister has told me, I seek leave from the Committee to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 347, in page 11, leave out lines 2 to 6 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the child's behaviour indicates a serious risk of the child offending after he has attained the age of 10 and that making such an order is in the interests of preventing the child so offending.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 78, in page 11, line 3, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`punishable with imprisonment in the case of an adult.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 79, in page 11, line 7, after `notice', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the court is of the opinion that the making of a child safety order is necessary to prevent a further breach of such a ban'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 94, in page 11, line 9, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`not of the same household as himself'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Clappison
<P>
: All amendments are important, but some are more important than others. These amendments are important because they relate to the grounds on which child safety orders might be made by the courts. We take the view--which may be contrary to what the Government say in the written reply that I have already adverted to--that these are fairly wide grounds. We wonder whether it would be possible to refine and improve those grounds.
<P>
Conditions for making child safety orders are set out in subsection (3) of clause 12. Only one of those conditions has to be fulfilled for an order to be made. The conditions are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) that a child has committed an act which, if he had been aged 10 or over, would have constituted an offence;
<P>
(b) that a child safety order is necessary for the purpose of preventing the commission by the child of such an act as is mentioned in paragraph (a) above;
<P>
(c) that the child has contravened a ban imposed by a curfew notice; and
<P>
(d) that the child has acted in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The first two conditions need to be examined. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Woking has cast his eagle eye over the conditions, but it struck me that the first one is interesting. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the child has committed an act which, if he had been aged 10 or over, would have constituted an offence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that that raises the possibility that we may reduce the age of criminal responsibility to zero?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I am going to argue that the ground rule will require the courts to show some mental agility in how they apply the provisions. Those provisions are questionable on the grounds of workability.
<P>
My hon. Friend is not alone in the anxiety that he expresses. He shares it with a number of organisations that are concerned with children, including the National Association of Probation Officers and the Association of Directors of Social Services. The latter organisation says:
<P>
``The order in practice criminalises the behaviour of children under 10.''
<P>
We are concerned about the workability of the conditions, because subsection (3)(a) refers to ``an act'' which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would have constituted an offence''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
if it had been committed by a child ``aged 10 or over''. Committee members know that such matters raise the question of intent. In many cass in criminal law, the act would be an offence for someone over 10 only if there was the requisite mental element. How does that work in respect of the condition in the subsection?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that virtually the same definition is used in the criminal injuries compensation scheme? It causes no problem in deciding whether to pay compensation to victims of what would have been an offence had the perpretrator not been under the age of 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are talking about the making of a child safety order, a much more serious matter as far as the child is concerned. The courts must be satisfied about such matters before they impute to the child what might, in effect, be criminal behaviour.
<P>
Notwithstanding the response of other members of the Committee, we want an authoritative response from the Government on the matter. Do they expect the courts to look for intent in the case of a child or is the act, without the requisite intent, sufficient on its own? The courts will want to know too.
<P>
How realistic is it to discuss intent in children under 10? As I said earlier, we are talking about very young children and we must think carefully about that. Later, the Government will invite the Committee to abolish the doctrine of doli incapax, which we will not oppose, although it is a serious step. That doctrine relates to older children between the ages of 10 and 14. The Bill will abolish the presumption that a child of that age does not know the difference between right and wrong, a presumption that has to be rebutted by evidence. The presumption is that a child of that age cannot form the necessary mens rea.
<P>
The clause relates to children who are even younger and the Committee must think about its implications very carefully, especially as everything rests on the balance of probability. I do not want to provoke my hon. Friend the Member for Woking, who has strong views on the matter, but he will have noticed that the child in such cases will not have the safeguard of whatever must be proved being proved to the criminal standard; it need be proved only on the balance of probabilities.
<P>
We do not want to be difficult, but we have questions about the workability of the clause. Our amendments, although not perfect, may be an improvement on the Government's proposals. In amendment No. 347, we suggest an alternative condition: that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the child's behaviour indicates a serious risk of the child offending after he has attained the age of 10, and that making such an order is in the interests of preventing him so offending. I hope that the hon. Member for Hendon will agree that such a condition would not require the court to undertake the mental exercise of asking whether the act in question would have been an offence if committed by someone aged over 10. Although it may not be perfect, the amendment is an improvement.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 serves a similar purpose in respect of child curfew schemes. We presume that local authorities will apply for child safety orders. We hope that they will use their common sense in applying for an order as the result of a contravention of a ban imposed by a curfew notice. In due course, if local child curfew schemes are in existence, we do not want children to be hauled before the courts for what are isolated breaches that are unlikely to be repeated.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 would require a court to be of the opinion that the making of a child safey order was necessary to prevent a further breach of such a ban. A single breach on its own would not be sufficient: it would have to be necessary to prevent a further breach. The conditions set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (3) describe a child's criminal act. We think condition (c) could also be narrowed down, to some advantage. The same child care organisations that I have just quoted, and others besides, have expressed concerns about this. We share, to take one example, the concern of Barnardos, which has said that we should try to avoid
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a situation where increasing numbers of young children are forced into the youth justice and care systems''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are concerned that the Government have pitched the conditions wide. We are concerned about their workability. We shall listen carefully to the Minister's response on the points that we have raised, which bear closely on the consequences that the schemes will have for very young children.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I rise to lend support to some of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, who has spoken persuasively. I do not like the idea of the child safety orders, because the courts have no business dealing with a lot of very young children. That would not be good for our reputation as a humane and fair society. I should like to know whether I am right in thinking that there is no minimum age to the provision. A child is a child, and the clause refers only to a child under 10, which means any age under 10. It may be ludicrous to suggest that the provision would be available against a child of four or five, but what I have said is a fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I should not put it past new Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend shows concern about the new Labour party and I share that concern. The measure is potentially heavy-handed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> What happened to the pary of civil liberties?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend again makes a good point. The past few sittings of the Committee seem to show that concern for civil liberties has shifted. Conservative Members have always, of course, promoted civil liberties, and my hon. Friend and I have certainly done so in Committee. We must continue to do so, in view of the curiously stony attitude of the Government Bench in this context. They are hard-faced men.
<P>
All right, what I have suggested will not happen, but what if a six-year-old child takes a sweet from another six-year-old child?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): Ridiculous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Yes, it is ridiculous. I was waiting for that. If the hon. Lady can tell me that that event would not be covered by paragraph (a) and, in precise legal terms, why not, I shall be obliged.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I am happy to do so. Conservative Members are certainly taking the civil liberties argument to their heart, which they did not do in their 18 years of government. It is obvious from the text of the Bill that we are not concerned with a child taking another child's sweet in the classroom. The hon. Gentleman, as a practising lawyer, will know that that is not the spirit of the test in the paragraph. He knows that we are concerned not with the sweet in the classroom, but with intervening early, when children and families are at risk, and preventing tragedies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The hon. Lady has not answered my point. It is all very well saying what the Government are trying to do. Opposition Members must scrutinise the Bill and see what it says. It says--
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Stinchcombe </B>(Wellingborough): As I have pointed out before, in comments on other provisions the Opposition have overlooked the word ``may''. There is no obligation for orders to be made. There must be discretion. It is absurd logic to assume that a law is bad because it could conceivably cover a ridiculous situation.
<P>
<B>Mr Malins:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but the logic is not absurd. Of course the court may make an order, but need not. We are considering the clause, to which the question of intent must be relevant. What is a court to do with a child whose actions if carried out by a 25-year-old would constitute a criminal offence? Does the court have to apply different criteria to a child who is under 10? If so, the child's intent must be considered.
<P>
Labour Members may mock me for making narrow points, but if I turn a narrow point into a serious general point--
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I take the serious point about the child's age. However, the hon. Gentleman should consider the following points: an increasing number of children are excluded from primary schools; in my constituency, children described by the police as 11 to 14-year-olds, which is a fairly general age, were involved in a riot over the arrest of a 14-year-old; and in an affluent primary school, a nine-year-old was part of three to four re-formed families and was profoundly disturbed. By the time many children have finished middle school, which takes nine to 13-year-olds, they have lost the chance of any sort of reasonable adult life. Child safety orders are intended to deal with the profound behavioural problems of some young children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> If the Bill is intended to deal with serious conduct, it is a pity that it is not clearer. Conservative Members remain uneasy about including such young children in the criminal justice system. The Bill does not even provide for a minimum age. It sets out conditions for child safety orders that are not right. Paragraph (a) of subsection (3), which deals with a criminal offence, requires careful thought about the standard of behaviour, and the mens rea--the mental intent--of a very young person. I have not made that point well, but we must be careful when we consider the mental intent, as opposed to the natural conduct, of under-10s.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> From his interventions in our proceedings, I was aware that the hon. Member for Woking was a closet woolly liberal, but I had not expected the hon. Member for Hertsmere, and even the hon. Member for Gainsborough, from a sedentary position, to make comments that led me to suspect that they were also closet woolly liberals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Where are the real closet woolly liberals? They are in the closet.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If we are to have closet interventions, they should not be made from a sedentary position. Did the hon. Gentleman want the Floor?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I was wondering where the real Liberals were. They have been conspicuous by their absence. We have hardly seen them during an important debate on children.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Conservative Members have not grasped the serious problem that we are attempting to tackle. The courts must be able to deal with serious misconduct by children under 10. The Opposition's comments constitute a recipe for doing nothing constructive about children under 10 who need safety orders.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking talks about trying to stop increasing numbers of young people moving into the criminal justice system. We are talking about a civil order. Despite the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who seems not to understand that, an order will not involve a criminal conviction. No child under 10 will receive a criminal conviction of any sort as a result of the provision. Let that be quite clear; we are discussing a civil order and family proceedings, not criminal proceedings, and there will be no conviction. That is why we have talked about the balance of probability--because civil proceedings, not criminal proceedings, will be involved. I hoped that that was clear from the Bill, but it appears that Conservative Members have not fully understood that. I hope that it is now clear to them.
<P>
The example of a six-year-old raised by the hon. Member for Woking betrayed his belief that local authorities will never be reasonable. The local authority will have to make an application. Does the hon. Gentleman really think that any local authority would make an application for an order on the grounds that a sweet had been taken? There must be a serious need to deal with the safety not only of the child but of the community.
<P>
A number of protections are already inherent in the clause, not just those of clause 12(3). Child safety orders deal with children under 10. They will form an important part of early intervention and fill the gap in existing provisions. The new powers will be available in family proceedings courts and will be welfare based. Their purpose will be to prevent the continuation of anti-social behaviour, and to nip offending behaviour in the bud.
<P>
Clause 12(3) sets out the conditions under which a child safety order may be made. The first is that a child has committed an act which, had he been over 10, would have been a criminal act. We do not need to go into all the circumstances of proving mens rea and actus reus that does not arise. We need to examine the behaviour of the child and ask whether, in all the circumstances, it gives rise to a need for an order. All the comments about considering children's intentions are irrelevant.
<P>
The second condition is that the child is at risk of committing what would be a criminal act if he or she were over 10. Courts will consider the behaviour of the child and whether he or she would be likely to commit such an act, and take a view on whether the child needs a child safety order. Another relevant question is whether the child has been in breach of a local child curfew, as is whether the child has been acting in what is effectively an anti-social manner. We do not need to consider mens rea; we need to consider the behaviour of the child and ask questions about welfare.
<P>
The conditions are clear in their purpose and the courts will have little difficulty with their interpretation or application. Amendment No. 78 would amend the first condition by restricting it to those offences that warrant imprisonment in the case of an adult. That would restrict the effectiveness of orders to deal with the safety of children. Presumably, the purpose of the amendment is to restrict child safety orders to serious offences. That misses the point of the new orders. If only serious offences can trigger a child safety order, the opportunity to intervene effectively at an early stage will be missed. Why wait until a child has done something really serious when something useful could be done sooner? That is why we will resist the amendment; it would undermine our efforts to nip such behaviour in the bud.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is in danger of becoming slightly less temperate than he has been in his previous responses. I think that he understands our point--we want the orders to be restricted to serious matters. Can he give us an example of an offence not punishable with imprisonment that he thinks would justify imposing a child safety order?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The second criterion, set out in clause 12(3)(b), states that it is the behaviour of the child that must be considered, and whether it is likely to lead to the circumstance in which offending behaviour will occur. It is about dealing with young children who are becoming out of control. The courts will understand that. The circumstances are set out clearly. The paragraph does not require an offence to have been committed; the court must consider the behaviour of the child and its likely result.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is my fault for not making my point sufficiently clearly. The amendment is to paragraph (a) of subsection (3). It would restrict the operation of paragraph (a) to an offence punishable with imprisonment. My question was: can the Minister give an example of an offence not punishable with imprisonment that would justify imposing a child safety order?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The circumstances might arise if the behaviour amounted to abuse or persistent harassment; or if it caused an individual alarm and distress or much disruption to the local community; or if a court considered that a child is out of control and in need of protection. I am conscious of the time, so I shall press on.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 would qualify the third of the conditions by adding the proviso that the court believes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the child safety order would be necessary to prevent a further breach of such a ban.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is one of the purposes of child safety orders; the other is to ensure that the child in question receives appropriate care, protection and support and is subject to proper control. Both of those purposes are important, especially for the young child persistently found out unsupervised late at night, about whom the police are becoming concerned.
<P>
The amendment recognises only one of those important purposes. It is unnecessary as both are dealt with in subsection (5), which states that requirements under a child safety order should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``desirable in the interests of . . . preventing any repetition of the behaviour that led to the child safety order being made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 94 would amend the fourth of the conditions under which a local authority can apply for a child safety order. Therefore, it is identical to an amendment tabled to anti-social behaviour orders under clause 2. The amendment goes against the spirit of the provisions on dealing with anti-social behaviour.
<P>
The condition in subsection (4) is, like the proposals on anti-social behaviour orders, intended to be used where a child is engaged in serious persistent anti-social behaviour that affects the community, causing harassment, alarm or distress to people in that community. It is not intended to combat anti-social behaviour between members of the same household.
<P>
To accept such an amendment would be to change the intention of the provision dramatically. Given that the Committee has rejected a similar amendment to clause 2 tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, it would make the provision inconsistent with the previous provision.
<P>
Amendment No. 347 would replace subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b), and is based on the belief that a child's behaviour is a serious risk if the child offends after the age of 10. That raises several questions. What is defined as a serious risk? How practical will such a condition be? If the event happens when a child is five, will the local authority and then the court be required to assess how the child is likely to be in five years' time based on how he is now? Is it not more realistic to allow the court to base its decision on the child's action at the time, as we have done?
<P>
I accept that the hon. Member for Hertsmere might, in a rather convoluted way, be trying to address offending behaviour by dealing with it early, but I am satisfied that that is covered in subsection (3)(b).
<P>
In the light of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the amendments will not add to the strength and effectiveness of the clause, although I understand why he conceived them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend's amendment relates to subsection (3)(a), which states that the conditions are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the child has committed an act which, if he had been aged 10 or over, would have constituted an offence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are agreed on that. Shoplifting is an offence. Tens of thousands of shoplifters appear before the magistrates courts every year.
<P>
Children under the age of 10 often go into shops and behave in a way that in an adult might constitute shoplifting. I have had to take my own children to task for this. The Minister will claim that there is no way that the courts would impose a child safety order on a child caught shoplifting. However, we have to consider what is in the Bill. The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere would restrict such behaviour to serious behaviour. The amendments are well put.
<P>
The Minister may dismiss the arguments made by Opposition Members as the ravings of woolly minded liberals. However, he should listen to the statements of the National Association of Probation Officers. It is very worried about the clause. The association hopes that this provision will very rarely be used. Will the Minister make it clear that that will be so?
<P>
The Minister's response to the arguments that have been put forward today is that, contrary to the association's claim, the clause does not reduce the age of criminal responsibility to zero because it is not a criminal sanction. It is a civil sanction.
<P>
However, this is a crime and disorder Bill. We are discussing the use of magistrates' courts. The Minister cannot say that this is a comfortable matter of a civil sanction; we are not criminalising these children, we are trying to help them. The National Association of Probation Officers states that the provision should be used very rarely. It wants an assurance that care proceedings would be used when appropriate. The association
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is concerned that the clause is framed in fairly negative terms, prohibiting contact rather than encouraging care and support.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are discussing tiny children. We should not even be thinking in terms of punishment or supervision. We should be thinking of care and support. As NAPO has pointed out,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``these orders would more appropriately be made by a Family Court with social work supervision.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
These are serious matters, which I hope that the Minister will address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend's contribution was timely and pertinent. I agreed with everything that he said.
<P>
I was grateful that the Minister had understood our reasons for tabling the amendments, but after listening to his comments, I cannot accept that the amendments were incorrect or defective. They might not be perfect, but they are better than the provisions in the Bill.
<P>
There is much common ground between us, although not all members of the committee realise that. I agree with the hon. Member for Northampton, North who said that the orders should be made only in serious circumstances. The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) was correct when he said that although the courts had the power to make such orders, they were not required to do so. If there had been any suggestion that such powers were to be mandatory, there would have been shudders of dismay in other parts of the Government--although not, perhaps, in the Home Office.
<P>
Conservative Members are concerned that so little money has been put aside for child safety orders that few will be made. There might be cases in which someone should receive care and support, but the money and the power to set up such orders should not be used in inappropriate circumstances. The poor drafting of the Bill could result in child safety orders being made in the wrong cases. They should be restricted to serious cases, which are those punishable by imprisonment.
<P>
The Minister said that the courts do not want to be bogged down with questions of mens rea, intent and other legal technicalities. I agree with the Minister. However, the problem is in his Bill, which requires the courts to get involved in such matters, and to do so with some mental agility. One of the conditions under subsection (3)(a) is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the child has committed an act which if he had been aged 10 or over would have constituted an offence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will know from his own legal experience that, if there is no mens rea, there is no offence and a care order cannot be made. The Bill is requiring the courts to do exactly what the Minister does not want them to do, which is to go into mens rea, intent and recklessness for very young children, when such issues are probably deeply unrealistic. The clause has been badly put together. We are concerned about its workability and that the courts will be left with a much more difficult task than needs to be the case.
<P>

<P>
The amendment might not be not perfect, but a least it is a little more realistic to consider the circumstances of the child at the time rather than looking ahead to what would have been an offence for a child aged over 10 years. Given the lateness of the hour, however, I shall not press the amendment to a Division. I hope that we have sufficiently expressed our concerns about the measure and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
