<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 17, line 40, leave out `weeks' and insert `months'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 20, in page 18, line 5, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, except that notification given in relation to any accounting unit of annual expenditure or gross income of less than £5,000 shall be sent to the Commission within nine months.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 21, in page 18, line 13, leave out `nine' and insert `twelve'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendments are exploratory. We want to ensure that the Minister is aware of the likely impact of the provisions on small accounting units in political parties. The amendments seek to give a little more latitude in the reporting procedures and to ensure that the requirements in the Bill bear some relationship to reality.
<P>
At a previous sitting, we talked about the Hazel Grove action group. I would like to move on to the Littledon village branch of the Liberal Democrat party. Mrs. Brown has been its treasurer there for about 23 years, and she has just reached her eighties. The branch has about 15 members and it has two or three coffee mornings a year. The account is held in the local post office because it is too far for Mrs. Brown to get to a bank. The idea of the branch receiving a donation that exceeds £200 is more likely to induce a stroke in the treasurer than it is be used for a flight to South America.
<P>
Mrs. Brown will be subject to the provisions of clause 30 in its entirety. That requires that the report that she has to submit arrives at the commission within six weeks. The accounts must be approved according to the commission's scheme, in accordance with the same timetable as that which applies to the principal political parties. It will mean that the period in which the branch has to report is the same as for the main parties.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to draw the attention of the Minister and the Committee to the fact that, in many cases, reporting requirements that are highly necessary for whole parties and major accounting units are not sensible for small accounting units. There are ways to get round that, however, and the amendments seek to explore some of them. For instance, we could have a de minimis category of accounting unit that had separate accounting rules. Later amendments deal with that solution.
<P>
We are thoroughly committed to ensuring the most rigorous inspection of central party accounts. We are equally committed to making sure that the parts of the parties known in the Bill as accounting units are also responsible, and we think that rules should be drawn up that reflect the complexity and severity of the mischief that might follow a unit stepping over the line.
<P>
I also want to draw the Minister's attention to the parallel problem for schools and school governing bodies. If one increases the burden on volunteers and relies on them to run the system, there comes a point where the hypothetical Mrs. Brown says, ``That's it. I can't go on. I can't take the worry or stress.'' We would find that it became more difficult at the lowest level of volunteer organisations to find people willing and able to become involved.
<P>
The Littledon village branch probably does practically nothing. Perhaps once every four or five years, it puts someone up to the district council elections if it can find anyone to stand. When that happens, it has to appoint an agent, who will be subject to all the controls of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and, if the Bill becomes law, of additional requirements as well. That is proper but, before a second person in Littledon becomes subject to the full force of law in every respect as though he or she ran a major national party, will the Minister reconsider the restrictions and barriers that will be put in place of genuine volunteer efforts at the grass roots of politics?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> May I welcome you to the first proper sitting of the Committee that you have chaired, Mrs. Michie, and say that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) is pursuing an issue that we talked about in some depth? It relates to ensuring that the Bill is not too onerous for smaller parties, and especially for people in large parties--for example, treasurers such as Mrs. Brown of the Hazel Grove Liberal Democrats.
<P>
I shall try to reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is a misunderstanding about the nature of the clause. It is a transitional arrangement that takes the registration of political parties under the Representation of Political Parties Act 1998 and transfers it to the Electoral Commission's new register. We are clear in our mind that that must be done quickly. I do not know when the general election will be. People with more authority will make such judgments, but I know that all political parties want to ensure that the Bill is in place by the next general election so that we can conduct it under a more transparent and accountable system.
<P>
If we accepted amendment No. 19, which in effect would change ``six weeks'' to ``six months'', it would not be possible to have the legislation in place within the timetable. Again, I want to stress that that responsibility of a transitional scheme being put in place within six weeks applies to the national treasurer--the national officer--not to Mrs. Brown. The existing 1998 legislation will be transferred to the new legislation, and the commitment will be national and not on Mrs. Brown.
<P>
Mrs. Brown will be delighted when the consequences of the Bill become clear to her. The hon. Gentleman made a strong, important point. There are worrying aspects to the Bill. He talked about the need for, and the difficulty of getting, school governors. We are putting constraints on voluntary action and, if we are not careful, we will put people off the notion of citizenship.
<P>
Mrs. Brown will have the ultimate responsibility for submitting her accounts in six weeks. I reassure the hon. Gentleman about what Mrs. Brown will have to do. The clause will have no effect on her whatsoever. Once the Bill is enacted, Mrs. Brown will have to submit accounts at annual intervals in a simple form--which will be negotiated with the commission--if the income of a party is more than £25,000, a figure that we will discuss later. If Mrs. Brown receives a large donation--one can speculate about what a large donation would be; I understand that a figure of £200 might cause bubbles to come out of people's heads and questions to be raised--she will have to report it. The figure of £200 is not a de minimis figure. I accept entirely the point made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that it is important that the legislation works at local level.
<P>
There are concerns that the amendments will not do the job that the hon. Gentleman anticipates. I hope that important people such as Mrs. Brown, who are the lifeblood of the party--people whom we do not praise or comment on enough--will not be under the obligations that the hon. Gentleman mistakenly believes exist under the clause. I hope that he will reflect on the matter and withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for dealing with me so gently. I appreciate his points and welcome his reassurance on the Government's approach to the Bill and on the operation of the lowest level--I do not mean that in a derogatory sense--of our democratic system. Without such volunteers in many small locations, in all our political parties, there would not be a political structure on which to build the rest of the elaborate framework that we have.
<P>
I understand the points that the Minister made. I am pleased that he accepted the generality of my argument. Perhaps when I pursue other amendments, he will bear in mind his own words and we will make progress. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): Although we formally welcomed you to the Chair at our first meeting, Mrs. Michie, I welcome you to the first deliberative sitting of the Committee that you have chaired.
<P>
I seek merely a little guidance from the Minister on the provisions of the clause. First, a straightforward question: it may have been merely artistic licence on the part of the printer, but I wondered why the first two subsections are in italics and whether some mystery is associated with that. It happens in later clauses, too.
<P>
More seriously, I seek guidance on the sort of scheme that the Minister envisages for distributing the £500,000 among the various political parties. Those who may be deemed to be in greatest need of the money might be the smaller political parties, and those who reside in Millbank or Smith square may be considered already sophisticated enough not to need any assistance.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Will the scheme involve an element of equity, or is my perception correct that the money may be granted on the basis of need among the smaller, less-efficient parties, if I may put it that way? I am especially worried that in places such as Northern Ireland, which has a proliferation of smaller political parties, making a meaningful contribution to them would mean that there would be little left over from the £500,000 for the larger parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Liberal Democrats have investigated the implications of the Bill in that respect, and various estimates have been passed to me. It is not proper for me to present them to the Committee, because I am not entirely sure of their provenance. However, I share the view expressed by the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) that we need some idea of how it is intended to approach the matter, bearing in mind that I am not aware of any political party that has large sums to spend on frivolous exercises. I do not mean to dismiss the problem, but in terms of additional expenditure it is clearly a serious issue for any party, large or small, and one on which it is reasonable for us to seek some assurances.
<P>
If the estimates that have been passed to me are valid, we seem to be dealing with a significant number of parties with, presumably, an essentially fixed cost element, plus an allocation for size. Even given that parties must show that the money has been spent properly before the grant is made, will the sum in the Bill be adequate for that transitional exercise? It is difficult to offer a more professional critique of either the sum or the mechanism, because it is not available. Now is the appropriate time for the Parliamentary Secretary to make clear the Government's intention and how he envisages the commission will proceed in that respect.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> First, I shall answer the direct question--why part of the new clause is in italics. I have been reminded that the parts of the Bill in italics relate to money and money resolutions. As the hon. Member for North Dorset said, that is the case for other parts of the Bill. During the lunch hour, I shall confirm that, as I have forgotten.
<P>
The hon. Members for North Dorset and for Hazel Grove asked how the money will be allocated. The Government's intention is clear. It will be a matter for the Electoral Commission, which will want to consult and take guidance on the matter. It is envisaged that most of the £500,000 will be paid in cash, but, as the clause states, it will be possible to provide other assistance, such as software packages, which could be centrally designed to meet the party's needs.
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the sum in the Bill is sufficient. If the hon. Member for Hazel Grove knows that it might not be, I would be genuinely interested to see his calculations. There might be issues of confidentiality, but I would be grateful to review any figures that he could provide. I envisage that new procedures will build on existing procedures. The Government are keen for the Electoral Commission to negotiate solutions with political parties. There is no fixed system. If the money is insufficient, we would of course be prepared to examine it again.
<P>
The second issue is about allocation, which again is a matter for the Electoral Commission. I am attracted to the idea of meeting need, but needs applied to political parties beg many questions. If a party's performance is poor, it could be argued that it had a real need for funds. I jest a little there, but the notion of need is difficult to define. The size of parties is also relevant. In relative terms, smaller parties might have more to do, and the converse is also true, as larger parties might have more to do in a different sense. At this stage, I can only listen to the debate and try to ensure that any points raised separately by political parties are drawn to the attention of officials, so that as the Electoral Commission emerges it will hear the views that have been expressed in Committee this morning.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Party political broadcasts</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Again, I seek clarification from the Minister. Subsection (2)(a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the holder of a licence under the Broadcasting Act 1990 or 1996'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but paragraph (c) refers separately to Sianel Pedwar Cymru, the Welsh channel 4, which now apparently operates two channels: its own terrestrial channel plus two satellite channels. I had thought that it was covered by the Broadcasting Act and came under the jurisdiction of the Independent Television Commission, but I am prepared to stand corrected on that. What is envisaged for Channel 5, which does not carry party political broadcasts?
<P>
I wish to raise the issue of satellite television and radio channels, of which there are a great proliferation. How will they be covered under the clause, and what of radio stations such as Atlantic 252, which broadcasts from the Irish Republic? That is important, as we shall later debate the issue of political parties operating on the island of Ireland, particularly the relationship between the parties registered in Northern Ireland and those registered in the Republic.
<P>
The internet is also important. We shall deal with amendments relating to the internet later on in the Bill, mainly in terms of statements made on the internet that are incorrect, maliciously or otherwise. A number of broadcasters in the forefront of technology are now talking about distributing their programmes via the internet and therefore bypassing both satellite and terrestrial television. Controls over the internet are very difficult, but in drafting the clause have the Government considered the question of party political broadcasts by unregistered parties being broadcast over the internet?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): The hon. Member for North Dorset raises some important points that I would ask my hon. Friend to look at extremely carefully, especially given the development of political information on websites under the control of broadcasting organisations. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would agree that one of the great success stories of Britain's involvement in the internet revolution has been the BBC's site. But the BBC itself has inaccuracies on its website that affect a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House. Are its obligations to be impartial in the context of party political broadcasts? I do not believe, that those are malicious inaccuracies, but factual errors have crept into its website, albeit one with tens of thousands of pages? Errors are bound to creep in.
<P>
There does not seem to be any mechanism at present in the relationship between broadcasters and public service obligations and the political process to ensure a degree of accuracy. That needs to be looked at with some care. Later clauses deal with deliberate attempts by a third party to mislead, but this clause is specific to broadcasters who are committed by statute to cover the political process through party political broadcasts. We need to look carefully at how their parallel activities on the internet square with that. The BBC has detailed texts of ministerial statements and party political statements on its site but there can be misleading statements in the information held on the site about right hon. and hon. Members that perhaps should be covered by the protections of this Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Member for Dorset asked directly whether the whole question of broadcasting on the internet had been looked into in drafting the clause. I have to admit that it has not. In the light of the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Mr. Lewis) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) that we shall come to later in our proceedings, I can now say that we are on the case. We are beginning to work on it.
<P>
I should explain the purpose of clause 32. It requires that broadcasters transmit no party political broadcasts other than those that are put out by a registered party. It is a very precise and tightly drawn obligation on broadcasters.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Hon. Members asked broader questions about the role of the broadcaster; in fairness, I should write to all Committee members about that. If they are not prepared to wait, I would draw to their attention the excellent Library research paper 2000/3 on party political broadcasting. I remind hon. Members of the core of current legislation. Independent television--that is, Channels 4 and 5--falls under the requirements of sections 36 and 107 of the Broadcasting Act. There is no parallel legislation on the BBC; it acts voluntarily and in accordance with custom. My recollection, confirmed by the research paper, is that Neill considered BSkyB and the Welsh language channel whose name I will not try to pronounce--I know that there are experts in the Room and I do not want to demonstrate my lack of linguistic skills--but they broadcast voluntarily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Will my hon. Friend consider the following before he writes to us? Suppose that the Hazel Grove action group, which is an unregistered party, does something extremely newsworthy and promotes it on its website--it is, after all, a modern organisation--in the format of a conventional party political broadcast. Is my hon. Friend saying that it would be improper for one of the news broadcasters such as the BBC to cover that news piece, including a sound clip, with a piece taken off the group's website?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The situation becomes increasingly confused. I shall come to my hon. Friend's point in a moment.
<P>
The issue of party political broadcasting is the subject of discussions with broadcasters and the political parties and was referred to on Second Reading. Some hon. Members are of the view that the system does not work as well as it might. I am sure that there will be discussions about that away from the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I do not know whether I can take a proprietorial interest in the Hazel Grove action group, which I want to say is mythical--
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Up until now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Yes, up to now. When I moved some amendments earlier, which were not accepted, the Minister said that the Hazel Grove action group would have to be a registered political party, so perhaps that example does not illustrate the point that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston was making. I am sure, however, that parallel cases come to mind.
<P>
It seems to me that if the legislation is to be extended in the direction suggested by the Minister and the proposed amendment, we must avoid eliminating political news stories from the media, which is a potential risk of an overdrawn piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I shall not move on to future clauses--we shall come to them in due course.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is related to party political broadcasting and news reports of the sort referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston would not be covered. Of course, we need to reflect on and do more work on the emerging issue of the internet. We shall have the opportunity to discuss that later in our deliberations and we may well need to change the legislation in time.
<P>
All that I will say to my hon. Friend at this stage is that recent research--dare I say research, carried out since he tabled his amendment--shows that the law is confused on this point and that there have been different judgments in different levels of the courts. We are on the case and, when we come to the appropriate point in our proceedings, I hope to be able to reassure hon. Members although I have my doubts--this is a luddite speaking. I cannot say more than that there are possibilities of tapping into the problems. With that, I rest my case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I would like to ask a question about clause 33, Mrs. Michie, if that would not be out of order. I was fascinated by subsection (4):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In the Appendix of Forms . . . for ``Merchant'' there shall be substituted ``Independent''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister tell us to what the word ``merchant'' refers, in the context of its substitution by the word ``independent''? I can see where ``independent'' comes from, but where did the word ``merchant'' come from in the original Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perhaps I should write to the hon. Gentleman about the term ``merchant'' and where it comes from. I suspect that it comes from parliamentary election rules that are set out in schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983. The purpose of clause 33 is to update that legislation.
<P>
The Act does not feature prominently in my reading list and I am not sure whether I can help the hon. Gentleman except by saying that, at one time, ``merchant'' was an example of a description once used on a ballot paper. Given the provisions of the Bill, such a description will no longer be possible. However, I shall look into the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman.

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 21, line 19, leave out `six' and insert `five'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 23, in page 21, line 35, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and to different accounting units.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> This amendment brings us back to Mrs. Brown again.
<P>
I shall deal with the second amendment first, because it perhaps illustrates my point sufficiently. In the light of discussions at the drafting stage, clause 6(b) was amended to allow different accounting periods for different parties. That is a wholly reasonable amendment that reflects reality. Our amendment would also enable clause 6(b) to reflect different accounting units. As drafted, every unit of a particular party would be required to have the same accounting period.
<P>
Commonly, at least two obvious accounting periods are used in the commercial and real worlds--1 January and 1 April. In politics and in particular in the Littledon village branch, matters may be dealt with on a basis that has more to do with the local government electoral cycle. Therefore, 1 June or 1 July may well be seen as the start of an accounting period, thereby allowing election accounts to be dealt with in a more complete way from the branch's point of view.
<P>
Like me, Mrs. Michie, you may have found that the accounting period is of greater importance at branch level than, for example the abolition of the NHS or the privatisation of the railways. Such matters are vital to the practical working of the units of a party. The amendment would in no way weaken the safeguards that are incorporated in the Bill and would not affect the need to give proper account. However, it would allow existing, sensible and entirely legitimate practices to continue as necessary at a local level.
<P>
Amendment No. 22 draws attention to the record-keeping provisions in the Bill. Six years is a substantial time for the village branch to preserve accounting records. It is perhaps appropriate to require a national party to preserve records for a period spanning at least two general elections. That would allow for inspection and, if necessary, revelation over a prolonged period. However, I doubt whether all Committee members could put hand on heart and say that all branches and units of their local parties can reliably find their financial records for the previous six years. One must consider what is sensible, practical and necessary in terms of inspecting the public record.
<P>
Given that, under the Bill, such accounts will be reported to someone else, the six-year preservation requirement is perhaps somewhat over the top. Amendment No. 23 is a probing amendment that seeks the Minister's reaction to that point, but I none the less believe that it would give significant variation and flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I have some sympathy with the purpose of amendment No. 22, which would reduce the requirement from six to five years. However, I hesitate to say that I support that suggestion, because the provision is somewhat consistent with the Companies Act 1985 and the practice of the Inland Revenue and other bodies. Nevertheless, as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has noted, in a small accounting unit, the treasurer will not necessarily want to keep records for up to six years if they cease to hold that job. A large degree of responsibility would therefore fall on the constituency organisation, or even on the party nationally, in that respect.
<P>
I believe--the Minister may correct me--that the way in which the clause is drafted means that an accounting unit with a turnover of less than £25,000 will not have to comply with it. In the interests of transparency, we have tabled an amendment to a later part of the Bill that would lower that limit. We shall explain that in due course.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am concerned about the proposition by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that there should be different accounting periods for different accounting units within the same party. The essence of the Bill, which is very much in the spirit of Neill, is that an outsider can look at the accounts of a political party and feel that he has a picture of where the money is coming from and how it is being spent. I appreciate the argument for two different accounting periods. However, if different accounting units had different accounting periods, the commission could approve a whole series of such accounting periods. If one accounting unit received money in one year and transferred that money to the central organisation in another year, we would be unclear as to exactly where the money that was being spent in the second year had originally come from. Therefore, although I have a great deal of sympathy with amendment No. 22, I do not support amendment No. 23.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I turn first to amendment No. 22, which is the simpler of the two. In effect, it would allow records to be destroyed after five years, rather than six. If the hon. Gentleman does not mind me saying so, there is not much difference between six and five. The figure of six is in the Bill because it brings the Bill into line with companies and charities legislation. There are well-known precedents for six years in legislation that covers both those sectors.
<P>
Amendment No. 23 is more interesting. When I read it, I thought that it took us back to an earlier discussion about federal parties and different accounting years in different parts of a federal party. The Government intend to table amendments so that national parties can be independently registered. If that were the case, they could of course have different accounting years. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove has taken us back to Mrs. Brown and the real issues that surround ward and constituency parties.
<P>
In effect, the hon. Member for North Dorset was doing my job for me. The Bill specifies one accounting year for each party for the reasons of transparency and accountability that he outlined. It is also important that parties are well organised, so that they can meet the demands that the Electoral Commission will make upon them. I accept that there is a great deal to be done.
<P>
I believe that all hon. Members have received a copy of the letter that was sent out to political parties. For the legislation to be in place for the next general election, there must be progress now. I know that some parties have strong views about independence and are determined to do things in their own way, but it is not unreasonable for all parts of a political party that agrees the scheme through negotiation with the Electoral Commission to use the same accounting year. I accept that it may cause difficulties and tension in some political parties, but it is in the interests of the commission, the party and, most important, accountability and transparency, that we have each unit of every political party has the same accounting year. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on the matter and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 24, in page 22, line 14, leave out `£250,000, or' and insert `£5,000'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 25, in page 22, line 14, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ii.a) exceeds £5,000 but not £250,000, or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendments would introduce four zones or bands of gross income and total expenditure for a party and its constituent parts. It is right that there should be sub-divisions and that the oversight of a party's performance should increase as its gross income or total expenditure rises. Subsection (4)(a)(i) makes de minimis provisions for small accounting units, which can do little damage. It is right that there should be increasing steps, however, there seems to be a middle band that does not take full account of the range of size and the mischief that might be created on the one hand by a political party with a gross income of a little over £1,000 and, on the other hand, by a political party with an income approaching £250,000. The amendment seeks to address that by inserting a category dealing with incomes between £1,000 and £5,000.
<P>
The Committee will want to know why we have chosen £5,000. There may be a better intermediate figure, but in drafting the amendment I had in mind a category for an accounting unit, or a political party, that was up to funding contesting one general election seat, but was not in the flat-out mode required to pay the current maximum election expenses. In other words--and this is not a political secret--at the last general election it would have covered most constituency parties that contested seats that were not fought tooth and nail, hammer and tongs, where there was, to varying degrees, a pro forma campaign. It seems sensible to ask the Minister to consider such an amendment as constituency parties should have greater oversight than Mrs. Brown and her village branch, although they do not need the same depth of examination as constituency parties that fought hammer and tongs to the last halfpenny of expenditure or national political parties that may have fought only a few seats but have a much wider impact.
<P>
Therefore, the intention is more important than the precise numbers. The first category catches what one might call the normal branch, which perhaps contests local government elections and gently runs along on its own track. Our new second category would catch parliamentary constituency parties performing essentially the same job. Then the new third category would cover organisations where real mischief might occur.
<P>
Committee members well understand the issues that I have brought to light, so I shall not deploy my argument at greater length.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove touch on a point that has force. As I look through the Bill I am concerned by how inevitably bureaucratic and onerous some of the burdens that are placed on different organisations will be. I appreciate that the drive behind the provisions is to produce transparency and accountability, but we must live in real world where many organisations that act in a bona fide and honest way do not necessarily have the accountancy skills of a major public company. I therefore have an anxiety, which I confess has grown as I have read the Bill--in a spirit of co-operation I have not opposed clauses that appear to go in the right direction--that we are coming close to being unable to see the wood for the trees, and that smaller organisations will find it difficult to meet the criteria.
<P>
One of the points at issue is that the commission will be able to set the rules, so to some extent we are in the commission's hands, and it is probably not for us to fetter it too much. However, we have decided to include in the clause some guidelines for banding. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove is right to say that the band from £1,000 to £250,000 is an enormous one and would benefit from sub-division.
<P>
Let us consider the matter reasonably. Perhaps some Labour Members will relate their own experience, as one of the problems of the debate is that it is difficult to know the funding details of Labour party associations. I have some knowledge of the funding details of associations in my own party. My own association is almost certainly at the top of the tree in funding terms, as it is probably one of the wealthiest and most productive associations in terms of raising money for the party in the United Kingdom. It consistently wins prizes, which are awarded with great fanfare at party conference for its contributions to party funds. I also know that, by virtue of its locality and the size of its membership, there are some clear accountancy provisions and it is run professionally.
<P>
The banding under £1,000 makes a great deal of sense, as we are talking about a very small unit, but the band from £1,000 to £250,000 is extremely wide. The proposed band from £1,000 to £5,000 would be likely to cover a substantial number of local associations. I am reasonably satisfied that the band from £5,000 to £250,000 will probably cover virtually every local association of any political party in the United Kingdom. There may be one or two exceptions, but I would be somewhat surprised if there were, because those are substantial sums, unless one has some extraordinary source of funding. I can think of one association in the United Kingdom that may have that amount, but I still think--
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Islington Labour party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That may be the case for associations whose members are prepared to dig deep into their pockets or for those that have sources of commercial revenue on which they can depend. I can think of some associations that own property and are able to let it, but this is quite unusual.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This issue ought to be considered, because if we do not set guidelines or allow for a separate tranche, it will be impossible to do very much about the situation. If, on the other hand, we create this separate category, it will still be open to the commission to say, ``On reflection, we have decided to have the same rules for the band from £1,000 to £5,000 as for that from £5,000 to £250,000'', but we will not have pointed it in the right direction. The Minister should give careful thought to that; the amendment has force.
<P>
The Opposition have tabled an amendment to schedule 4, to which I shall return later. The amendment identifies the £5,000 benchmark as important, and would alter the reference to £25,000 in the schedule. I will not go into that now, but there may be a tie-in with the present amendments, and the Minister should listen to what we say on our amendment, when he considers the entire issue.
<P>
That is all that I wish to say on the amendments, but I should perhaps give warning that there is something that I wish to raise in relation to the clause when we come to the stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> One of the attractive aspects of discussing the Bill is that one begins to understand the secrets of other political parties. The Beaconsfield Conservative party is well organised and well resourced and sets itself performance targets, just like its Member of Parliament.
<P>
I have a good deal of sympathy with the points that have been made this morning To an extent, we are discussing the fine tuning. I am inclined to agree that the difference between £1,000 and £250,000 is too large, but I want to ensure that the Bill is kept as simple as possible, as hon. Members have suggested, so I am anxious about introducing too many levels into the scheme. The mechanics of the Bill were drawn up in discussion with the parties--with, dare I say it, their technicians--but in the light of the discussion this morning, I am minded to hold further discussions with them on whether we could have three bands, but define them as, respectively, nothing to £5,000, £5,000 to £250,000 and £250,000 and above. I make no commitment to the Committee that that will be the outcome, but I will canvass opinion on such a scheme. If we can devise a scheme based on bands of nought to £5,000, £5,000 to £250,000 and £250,000 and above, that would take into account the points properly raised this morning. I hope that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, given that undertaking to consider the matter again, will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Beaconsfield for his comments, but I am somewhat disappointed by the Minister's reply, not least because the Bill currently allows for a de minimis provision for the smallest units, those of a mere £1,000. I feel that it would be in the spirit of the legislation to have a category up to £5,000 so that the rules applying to somebody who spends £4,999 would inevitably be that bit tougher than those for somebody who spends £999. The Minister may feel that he has offered a concession, but by catching those who spend between £1,000 and £5,000, who are currently excluded from the middle band considerations, he has made the application of the rules more severe. I do not find his concession attractive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It all depends on the severity of the mechanism for the rules applying to expenditure up to £5,000. Throughout the morning, I have had Mrs. Brown in mind. She figures vividly in my imagination. I want to help both Mrs. Brown and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, and I hope that he will hear the spirit of what I am saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I appreciate the Minister's intervention rather more than I did his initial contribution. He has offered further talks, and if he is content--as his intervention suggested--for those discussions to result in proposals that do not carry the seeds of making the regime more severe for those who spend between £1,000 and £5,000, which is the reverse of my intention, I am content to withdraw the amendment. However, I will return to the issue if we do not obtain a successful outcome, because there is a genuine problem, which has been recognised on both sides of the Committee, for which a solution is required. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not intend to detain the Committee for long. As the Minister knows, there is an issue relating to subsection 4(b) about separate rules for Northern Ireland parties. I flag that up now, because we will return to it when we reach clause 63, and I do not think that it would be right to allow the Committee's scrutiny of clause 37 to pass without saying that we have the gravest reservations about the principle of having separate rules for parties in certain parts of the United Kingdom. When I develop that argument on clause 63, I will go further by saying that it is difficult to understand how that principle can be compatible with the human rights legislation on fair and free elections. That is an issue of fundamental importance that we want to approach constructively when the time comes. Subsection 4(b) appears to allow different rules to apply to Northern Ireland, at the commission's discretion, to cater for the consequences of clause 63. If we persuade the Minister that clause 63 needs serious reappraisal, which I hope that we will succeed in doing, clause 37 will have to be reassessed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield for giving notice of his intentions on clause 63. Perhaps I could, in a similar spirit, say that clause 63 is far from satisfactory and needs much work. The Government intend to table amendments to that clause and I shall save my comments until then, although they are relevant to subsection 4(b) of this clause. There are real and different needs and problems in Northern Ireland. In our discussions both this morning and later, we need to be aware of the changing scene and climate there. As I said, the Bill is not satisfactory at this point and we will need to amend it. I will save further comments until we reach clause 63.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 37 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 23, page 14, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, save that where a party ceases to be registered under section 28(3) and upon the expiry of the period set out in section 28(4), any such debt shall be deemed to be discharged.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to make it clear at the outset that this has nothing to do with Mrs Brown; it is an entirely separate point. Whereas previous amendments dealt with territory with which we are all familiar to some degree in terms of our own internal party organisation and the thresholds that should apply, this is an entirely different matter. The amendment would help if the commission had had to send in the auditor to deal with the consequences when a party was failing in its fundamental duty to carry out audits.
<P>
The amendment would address a situation that is associated with the phoenix point, which was discussed at an earlier sitting. The Minister may want to include it in his consideration of that. It was tabled before that discussion, but it is still relevant. If a party goes out of business and goes bust, what happens to the debt due to the commission? The amendment simply says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where a party ceases to be registered'', <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
if that debt has not been collected by the expiry of the 12-month run-on period, or it is not collectable, it should be ``deemed to be discharged.'' The amendment would not apply to a party that was deliberately seeking to avoid its obligations. Rather, it is intended for situations in which a fundamentally incompetent party has been unable to fulfil its obligations, the commission has put in the auditor and the party has dissolved and disintegrated. It seemed to us that a provision was needed that would prevent the commission from chasing individuals or successors to that party pointlessly and unnecessarily.
<P>
As I said, we may be able to deal with the question in the context of the phoenix issue. Clearly, were the phoenix situation to arise, we would have to ask whether any outstanding liabilities from the previous party were transferable to the newly re-registered party. That is a subtler question, which my amendment does not seek to address. However, the matter is worth considering, and I hope that the Minister will take it on board.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman rightly says that amendment No. 26 relates to phoenix parties. I undertook to write to the hon. Member for North Dorset about such parties and I hope to be able to do so soon. Discussions have already commenced on phoenix parties, about which members of the Committee have expressed views. I will, of course, take on board in that letter the hon. Gentleman's comments about his amendment, but perhaps with one caveat: if a political party goes out of business and ceases to exist, but still has some resources, it would not be unreasonable for the commission to try to retrieve what is, in effect, public money. However, the party may in reality have become extinct, as dead as a dodo, and have no resources. Its members may have been scattered to the winds. In that case, there would be little point in the commission pursuing the party. I have said that I will write to Members both about phoenix parties and about the amendment, and I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I fully understand and accept the Minister's point, and would be happy for our suggestion to be taken in the context of phoenix parties. The drafting of the amendment makes it clear that the debt would not be discharged until the expiry of the run-on period, which, as I understand it, is intended to ensure that any liabilities are settled. The amendment is intended not to give a party the option of discontinuing business to avoid the effects of the Bill, but to ensure that after the lid has been screwed on to the coffin and it has gone into the earth, nobody tries to dig it up and get the money back. In that context, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I will not delay the Committee long. The clause is entirely reasonable. The limit of £250,000 for requiring a party's accounts to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``audited by a qualified auditor'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is liberal. Although we are not in favour of over-regulation, or of the suggestion that the figure should be lower than £250,000, I hope that parties would consider it correct to have their accounts audited by a qualified auditor at levels much lower than that. It is certainly custom and practice in my party that our constituency organisations, with turnovers far below £250,000, have their accounts audited by a qualified auditor. Even small branch units in constituencies have their accounts audited, and branches with turnovers of less than £1,000 often ask chartered accountants--perhaps a retired chartered accountant--to audit their accounts. Therefore, I hope that the practice will develop, and that the commission may consider in time whether party organisations and accounting units with turnovers below £250,000 might employ a qualified auditor.
<P>

to Commission
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 24, line 4, leave out `3' and insert `6'.
<P>
The amendment is similar to those that I moved earlier, and we have already travelled over the ground that it covers. The Minister needs to tell the Committee what mischief he thinks a longer reporting period would cause. We simply seek to change that period from three months to six months to give flexibility to the procedures that will be followed. I fully understand the logic of our debate on that amendment, but it depends on how the universal accounting period falls as to whether it will be easier or harder for that three-month deadline to be achieved at the lower levels of the party machines.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider varying the time--or that he will describe what mischief he thinks may befall us if we do not make the change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The clause aims to avoid mischief. However, those who are determined to avoid being found out will no doubt attempt to find a way around the provisions. Part III makes it clear that parties must make their accounts available within six months if they are audited and three months if they are not. It is not unreasonable to ask for accounts to be delivered within three months if they do not have to be audited. I remind the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that the Neill committee considered that specific point and that it recommended three months.
<P>
Circumstances can arise when it is not possible for a treasurer of a local accounting unit to submit the accounts within three months. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to subsection (3), which gives the commission the flexibility to allow more time in special circumstances, but three months is not unreasonable. It is a matter of judgment. We have spoken of the burdens placed upon people like Mrs. Brown, but if the period is too long they will be tempted to delay, just as they are with tax returns that must be made by the 30 January deadline. If the deadline is too far away, the lack of immediacy can lead to problems. The Committee may want to reflect on the matter, but I am clear that three months is right.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I seek clarification. We may have some difficulty in discussing the matter, because it relates to the provisions on the Electoral Commission in part I. Clause 41 (a) states quite reasonably that the commission should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as soon as reasonably practical after receiving the statement, make a copy of the statement available for public inspection''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many of those statements will relate to political parties established in the various nations of the United Kingdom--Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Does the Minister envisage facilities being made available for people to inspect registers in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> We will debate part I on the Floor of the House, but my recollection is that the commission will have officers in various parts of the United Kingdom. If so, it should of course be possible for material to be made available there. I receive confirmation of that as I speak.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 106, line 30, leave out `£25,000' and insert `£5,000'.
<P>
Schedule 4 details the responsibilities of accounting units. The Minister will probably agree that those units are likely to be local associations. We support that state of affairs in principle, but we are concerned about the level at which the requirement for submission of statements of account should apply.
<P>
This is less a financial matter than a political issue because, unlike national party finance, local association finance is likely to be a matter of considerable political interest to others--with respect not to financial probity, but to the details of how campaigns are funded, which areas provide most money and a host of information that might be useful to political opponents. Transparency makes such concerns inevitable, although aspects of the matter may depend on the rules about accounting requirements set by the commission. The Minister may want to confirm that the commission should not be interested in whether a local association is politically active in area A or B, but only in whether it is honest and open.
<P>
Perhaps that way of doing things will deal with the problems. Nevertheless, the matter needs to be considered, because otherwise some unfairness may be perceived. For example, two local political associations, representing different parties, might be at more or less level pegging--equally successful at fundraising and campaigning. If one of them generated income or expenditure of £24,900, no one would need to know anything about its accounts, whereas if the relevant figure for the other association were £25,100, the whole of its affairs would be disclosed and information that might be of use to its political opponents would be accessible to them. The Minister may agree that my question is fair.
<P>
One way of dealing with the issue that I have raised is to take the view that the method used for the accounts presented to the commission needs to be clarified. The amendment would reduce the level of income or expenditure at which disclosure was required. An organisation with income or expenditure of £5,000 seems unlikely to be of huge interest, whereas £25,000 is a quite substantial amount, hence my point about the sum of £24,900 as against £25,100.
<P>
Our anxiety has nothing to do with financial probity, but concerns the perceived or real unfairness of one association being obliged to lay bare the secrets of its soul while others did not, even though doing so might be to their advantage. I would be grateful to hear the Minister's comments.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
A limit of £25,000 would cover most associations. Many more would be covered by a limit of £5,000. Where might the best line be drawn, or is there an alternative? If there is, it would be helpful to hear about it from the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I was interested to hear the argument in support of the amendment--it has opened an interesting line of thought. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said during an earlier debate, one can speak only from personal experience. Several of my colleagues in the House--never mind the less successful ones outside--would be delighted to cross the £25,000 barrier. The hon. Gentleman and I come from different cultures, and we must live by our experience.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point was not without merit. However, I am unaware of any figures, available to anyone, that show the distribution of constituency party incomes, either within or across parties. Such figures would show the sensible point to draw the line, either to include or to exclude the majority of parties--both options would be fair. It would be especially unfortunate to have a budget of £25,100 and one's opponent had one of £24,900. In such circumstances, I might be inclined to send him a donation of £150 to put the matter right. Wherever one draws the line on the distribution of constituency party or accounting unit profiles, somebody will be a little below it and somebody a little above it.
<P>
The Committee should consider whether the provision should include or exclude the huge majority of constituency parties. Largely on the grounds advanced by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, it would probably be best to have a provision that excluded the largest number of constituency parties, without being silly or unreasonable. I say that from my cultural background. We may be able to put our heads together and find a Liberal Democrat local party with a turnover of £25,000, but we would be searching for quite a while. So that is not a material consideration. The issue is whether or not we are trying to catch everybody by the provision. We must be fully aware of the hon. Gentleman's point that information collected originally for one purpose will clearly be available for others.
<P>
I would not want it to be thought that £5,000 was necessarily the right figure. Let us consider some of the circumstances with which I am familiar. A Liberal Democrat inner city party covering several constituencies might have a turnover hovering around £5,000. It might be involved in tense electoral contests, predominantly with Labour. It would be disadvantaged whether its turnover was above or below the threshold. That example makes my point--wherever one draws the threshold, there is a risk of advantaging one side, because of access to information, and disadvantaging the other. I understand the case, but as I am from a different political and cultural background I am not persuaded of the need to lower the level.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am pondering the issue, having listened to both hon. Gentlemen. The logic is wrong. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield is right, because I suspect that the majority of constituency parties would have income and expenditure substantially below £25,000. Some aspects are covered--certainly in election terms--and the £8,000-odd that he spent on his re-election campaign is well documented and covered by other legislation. However, there could well be local circumstances in which he would develop a strategy to improve his majority, of which he would not want his political opponents to be fully cognisant. Would his approach mitigate against that and be politically damaging to his objectives? Having a figure that he acknowledges to be high is the right way to proceed, because the net effect would be that the extraordinary would come to public attention, as distinct from the approach that he is adopting, where the norm, which includes activities that he would put down as part of his political strategy would be immediately in the hands of his opponents. In terms of the professional running of his political party, I wonder whether his approach would damage his case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I read his amendment in conjunction with schedule 5, which we have not yet reached. Schedule 5 goes into a degree of detail which I find mind boggling. When linked with schedule 4, it appears to give an advantage which, if were merely basic financial information, would probably be of no consequence. That is part of the thrust of my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> We have to remember that the Bill is a milestone in terms of the financial propriety that we want to put into political life. Earlier legislation covered what candidates spend at elections at constituency level, but the Bill takes political parties into a new arena. If we are to have accounting units at constituency level, it must be equitable and fair for one constituency party to have its accounts laid before the electorate, while another avoids it because it has not met the threshold.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove asked whether we were seeking to catch the majority or the few. If we were seeking to catch the few, perhaps we should have rejigged our amendment and raised the threshold, but there can be no equity in catching only the few. That would apply equally to the Conservative party and to the Labour party. I am interested in what I hear about the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
Any local party organisation that rents a suite of offices and employs a full-time agent is likely to go through the £25,000 threshold. On that basis, the accounts of a significant number of local party organisations, though by no means the majority--certainly of the two principal parties--would be available for public inspection. The accounts of their opponents would not be because they would not be accounting units that have to file separately to the Electoral Commission.
<P>
We are looking for financial transparency in political life and we propose in all seriousness that the threshold should be £5,000, which is not too onerous. The Minister said that we may look at that figure as a threshold for accounting and for rules under the Electoral Commission. If there were to be separate rules for a £5,000 unit anyway, it would be logical that, if party organisations are to account directly to the Electoral Commission, their accounts should be a matter of public record. That would catch the majority of serious, on-going contenders in political life, but not the smaller parties that tend to poll only a few thousand votes. It is right, in the spirit of Neill, and of the Bill, that such accounts should be available for public record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> This has been an interesting debate. I thought initially that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield had tabled a probing amendment to give us the opportunity to explore the issue--and we have done so--but when the hon. Member for North Dorset said that the amendment was tabled in all seriousness, I did a double take.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove properly made the point that, wherever the line is drawn, some party will complain of being either above or below it. The Micawber principle is still alive: bliss if one's party is under it, but misery if it is over the top.
<P>
Setting aside the limit, the main question concerns the practicalities and procedures that the commission will employ. We are having this discussion in the dark, but I am confident that the Electoral Commission, when it exists, will look at what has been said in Committee. We are trying to make life easier for ordinary party members--the Mrs. Browns of this world. If the limit came down from the proposed £25,000 to £5,000, there would be more work for more people, including those on the Electoral Commission.
<P>
At a local level, I anticipate that the commission will use a relatively light touch. I cannot guarantee that the accounts produced will be summary accounts. Until the hon. Member for Beaconsfield raised the issue, I had not thought that we would spend time searching out other people's accounts and looking at how they organise to win, although that is clearly a possibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Perhaps the Minister would give me some guidance. If a local accounting unit's accounts in excess of £25,000 included donors of more than £1,000, would those donors be listed as a matter of public record in the commission's file for that particular accounting year?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I think that that is the case, but I would have to find the relevant part of the Bill. My recollection is that names and amounts, but not addresses, would be in the public record. It must be right to offer a degree of confidentiality to individual donors. I will check on that answer, but I am fairly confident that it is right. The issues are clear.
<P>
To return to how the commission will work, light touch and, I hope, summary accounts mean that it will not be necessary for all of us to spend our time as accountants and researchers examining the accounts of individual constituency parties. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove correctly said, we have set the limit at £25,000 deliberately in order to exclude as many accounting organisations as possible. I, too, can speak only from my experience, but I do not believe that many will fall into that category. There may be some, but well organised parties with a full-time agent and headquarters are, sadly, few and far between these days.
<P>
I take on board entirely the points that were made about the need for a soft touch and for accounts to be presented in summary form, not so that people cannot research them, but so that they are relatively easy to keep and we minimise the obligations and responsibilities that are put on local parties. I want to reflect on the suggestions that have been made and discuss them a little more, but at this stage I am far more inclined to stick with the £25,000 limit than to reduce it to £5,000. I suspect, however, that we will return to this theme later in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister because, as I said, there may be two different ways of approaching the problem. He certainly suggested a willingness to explore an alternative way, while leaving the £25,000 limit. I accept that that could solve the problem.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset said, there is a limit of about £1,000 on individual donations, but the actual level of donations to be recorded is £200. One realises from reading schedule 5--I am sure that the Minister will be aware of this--that some complicated arithmetic could be involved. Even donations of very expensive bottles of whisky to raffles could fall into that category and have to be valued. The fact that the provision goes down to such minute detail is one reason why we want to keep it under close scrutiny.
<P>
The Minister said at the outset that he thought ours was a probing amendment. It is indeed, but probing amendments come in different degrees of seriousness. Some may be tabled just to raise a wide-ranging debate, but we suggested this approach in all seriousness as one way of addressing the problem. We accept, however, that there are others. Given the Minister's assurance that he would consider the issue in the light of our suggestion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 27, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless spent in the course of a commercial transaction'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 37, in page 27, leave out line 13.
<P>
No. 39, in clause 47, page 28, leave out lines 29 to 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The amendments are probing amendments because Conservative Members are unhappy with the definitions in the Bill, particularly those relating to sponsorship. We are clear that if someone writes out a cheque for £1,000, £5,000 or £25,000 to a political party, it should rightly be recorded as a donation to that party. However, the provisions relating to sponsorship are unclear.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 applies to clause 45(2)(c), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any money spent (otherwise than by the party or person acting on its behalf) in paying any expenses incurred directly or indirectly by the party;''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would add to that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless spent in the course of a commercial transaction''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To finance their activities, modern political parties do not simply take donations and subscriptions; they also engage in commercial activities. The largest commercial activity of both major parties is probably the annual party conference. We would certainly regard the exhibition stands as a commercial activity. We would wish to profit--I think I dare to use the word these days--from selling space in the conference centre to people who want to sell their wares to the established delegates or to extend their lobbying activities for various political causes. Many of those commercial or lobbying companies would have stands at the Labour, Conservative and possibly Liberal Democrat party conferences. I think, however, that they would be concerned if what they saw as a strictly legitimate commercial activity in furthering the fortunes of their company, industrial organisation or trade union were regarded as a donation to a political party for which, as we shall see when we consider the requirements for companies later in the Bill, they would have to seek prior shareholder approval.
<P>
But the provisions extend even beyond that. Many companies would, as a matter of course and as part of their commercial activities, take advertising space in party publications which are themselves used as a commercial activity by parties. Amendment No. 36 makes is quite clear that any money that is spent by an organisation that is not part of a party, is not an accounted unit of the party and is not directly affiliated to the party should not be regarded as a donation if it is spent as part of a commercial transaction with the party.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 would delete subsection (2)(f) which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the provision of any sponsorship in relation to the party.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that at the Labour party conference, just like at the Conservative party conference, Times Newspapers or the Irish ambassador host drinks parties--[Interruption.] Oh, he does it there as well. The aim of such drinks parties is to curry favour between those who have been invited and the cause that they wish to pursue. It is difficult to see how that could be regarded as a donation to a political party. It does nothing for the party itself in terms of the furtherance of our cause. The fact that a number of party members at a party conference were invited to a drinks party hosted by the Irish ambassador does not make any of my electors in North Dorset any more inclined to vote Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That depends on your behaviour at the party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Every other year that drinks party is held close to my constituency. The local newspaper would pick up any inappropriate activities by the Member of Parliament. I have always been well behaved at the Irish ambassador's party and I shall continue to do so for as long as he invites me.
<P>
It is for that reason that we wish to delete that paragraph. It also relates to other sponsorship activities. The Conservative party does not have those delightful little red ribbons on which Labour Members hang their conference passes and which are paid for by a well-known supermarket chain. I suspect that the primary aim of that kind of sponsorship is to have the supermarket's name appearing every time a delegate goes in front of the television camera rather than any desire to fund the activities of that political party. That company tends to sponsor other activities at our party conference and it always has the very best champagne.
<P>
To be a little more serious, amendment No. 39 is consequential upon the other amendments and relates to clause 47 and the value of donations. I do not want to deal with clause 47 in any significant sense but the amendment has been grouped here and so I must refer it. It would simply delete clause 47(4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the value in monetary terms conferred by the sponsorship in question on the party; and any such value conferred on the sponsor shall be disregarded.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 36. There are some issues that are not clear to me in the drafting of the Bill. It may be that I have not read it in sufficient depth, but subsection (2)(c) appears to cover all sorts of transfer payments. Someone attending a party conference and taking a stand in an exhibition hall might simply be making a transfer payment for services relating to the installation of their equipment. Paragraph (c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any expenses incurred directly or indirectly by the party''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which might well arise from subcontractors at exhibitions or other events.
<P>
Will all the costs that might fall to a sponsor or an exhibitor, which happen to be paid through the party to a subcontractor, a supplier, a transport agent or whatever, be deemed to be donations? When legislation like this comes into force, exemptions and exceptions that seem sensible and reasonable when they are put in place can become the loophole through which all sorts of ballooning expenditure can be passed. I am slightly concerned that although the provision is designed to enable funding to be more direct, the costs and expenditure being pursued by exhibitors and sponsors will actually become less transparent. Is my interpretation right? Can an exhibitor coming to a conference hall and paying for services via the party and who may well have made a block contract or a block booking be covered by clause 45? If so, does the Minister feel that that is entirely appropriate?
<P>
Having said that, I do not support the intention behind amendments No. 37 and No. 39. Were amendment No. 37 to be put in force, there might be circumstances in which value conferred on the sponsor would not be disregarded. That would open a wide-ranging debate about the value of the sponsorship that would not be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I have some questions for my hon. Friend. I appreciate that some of them may require further consideration outside the Committee. Not being a lawyer, trying to make sense of a clause like this is a bit of a nightmare, but some questions need to be answered in the context of party conferences. I have listed four activities in which I have been directly involved in the last 12 months at party conferences that are in different categories and could be regarded in different ways within the clause. The first is a fringe meeting in which a was commercial organisation had an interest and was prepared to sponsor the hiring of the room and provide a lunch. Where would that fit in, in the context of clause 45, amended or otherwise?
<P>
The second was touched upon by the hon. Member for North Dorset and concerns the stall taken out by the commercial organisation to advertise its wares. Times Newspapers was given as an example. I had never seen as many copies of The Times as I did at the Labour party conference last year. The third activity pertains to all-party organisations within the House. I am thinking particularly of Pitcom, the Parliamentary IT committee, which sponsors meetings at party conferences. I perhaps should declare an interest in this as a vice-chairman of Pitcom. Our meetings at the party conferences were sponsored by BT. Where would the registered groups within the House and their sponsor fit in?
<P>
My fourth and slightly more complicated and tangential involvement is as president of Computing for Labour, which is a limited company. If it holds a fringe meeting at the party conference where a lunch is sponsored by a commercial organisation where would that fit in? These questions need to be probed deeply. I appreciate that I am throwing them at my hon. Friend cold; I should be grateful for some answers although I realise that he may not be able to give me them in detail now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not want to add too much to what my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset said, but we are getting to the nitty-gritty of the legislation. It has been interesting to hear the comments of Labour Members on this matter. There are all sorts of areas where it is difficult to see how the provision will work in practice. I was fascinated by my hon. Friend's comments about the Irish ambassador's party. Not only is there the question of what sponsorship, if any, is being provided by the Irish ambassador, but dare I jump ahead to clause 63 and say that it might be a prohibited form of sponsorship unless it is towards one of the parties that has been exempted by the Secretary of state? If it were not the Irish ambassador but the French ambassador, I do not think that he would be allowed to hold a party at all under the rules proposed in the Bill. We are in serious danger of getting ourselves into the most terrible mess.
<P>
One issue touched on at Second Reading by my rt. hon. Friend the Member for North West Hampshire (Sir George Young) was auctions. It is quite common, possibly also in the Labour party, for items to be sold at auction to raise funds for the party. The item is donated, so it is a gift. It is then paid for at auction. The question that arises looking at all these donation lists relates to the market value of the item. Is it simply what the person is prepared to pay for it or will it be suggested that people may be paying inflated values? What is the inflated value? Let us take an example.
<P>
It is quite common for bottles autographed by Baroness Thatcher to be auctioned. If the Minister had a bottle of whisky autographed by the noble Lady, he would probably take the label off and put it in the dustbin. He would not necessarily be interested in the label itself. On the other hand, certain people may regard it as a valuable item for which they are prepared to pay a substantial sum. Reading the definition of donation in the clause, I am totally unclear whether that would be covered in any way and, if so, what the outcome would be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I understood that the Conservative party had resolved this matter, because its chief auctioneer, Lord Archer, will not be doing it again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That is an interesting comment, but during my time Lord Archer has not acted as my constituency's chief auctioneer. Nevertheless, I have witnessed such auctions, and other auctions could be made equally successful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> We are having a fascinating discussion. We hold auctions occasionally, not necessarily of objects but more of products and services. We offer to clean a house or cut a lawn. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the Bill's lack of precision. Does he agree that it fails to separate donation and subscription, which might lead to further confusion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That might be so. When we debated sponsorship I cited the Irish ambassador. Organisations sponsor parties in various ways. Organisations of high reputation and merit such as the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung will sponsor Members of Parliament attending conferences to further relations between countries. How will they be treated? They might be outlawed under clause 63, but where do they fit in the context of these measures?
<P>
We are in danger of getting ourselves into the most terrible mess. I hope that the Minister will forgive us if our amendments merely highlight the problem without proposing a solution, but we believe that there will have to be greater simplicity and recognition of the fact that some categories will have to be excluded. Alternatively, the detail will have to be improved. At some point, the crunch will come. If we cannot detail with the matter in Committee we shall do so on Report, possibly in a more confrontational environment. It would help if we could achieve some agreement about how these difficult issues are best addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Davidson </B>(Glasgow, Pollok): These issues are undoubtedly difficult. Judgments must be made about what is commercial and what is sponsorship. It would be relatively easy to conceal donations by claiming that they were sponsorship or commercial transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, it is better that such matters are dealt with openly.
<P>
I understand that anything that is described by the provider of the service or of the money as commercial or as sponsorship would be exempt from the conditions on disclosure. That is a major step in completely the wrong direction. It is far better that matters are disclosed, perhaps over-keenly, than them not being disclosed at all. It is all too easy for organisations that, for example, give £1 million worth of computer equipment to the Labour or Conservative party to say that that amounted to sponsorship or was a commercial decision, when in reality it was a means of transferring money to a political party that it would otherwise have to spend buying the equipment.
<P>
I am in favour of disclosure being made wherever necessary. A strong case has not been made for removing the clause's disclosure provisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> We have had a useful debate, in which hon. Members have drawn on their experiences of sponsorship, which is a growing activity. I was struck by the recollection of the hon. Member for North Dorset about the cords that Labour Members of Parliament and delegates at the Labour conference wear around their necks. The sponsorship does not seem to have done the company concerned--a large supermarket chain--much good at all. The cords were white, with purple lettering. The red cord to which the hon. Member for North Dorset referred was an alternative, designed by people such as my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), displaying the name of a trade union with which the supermarket chain was experiencing difficulties. Perhaps that was not the best sponsorship that that company had undertaken.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) put the matter succinctly. The Committee accepts his views. We must ensure that sponsorship is not, in effect, a donation. The issue is how we achieve that, and some hard examples have been given.
<P>
I, too, enjoyed the Irish ambassador's party. I am a regular visitor, and I am grateful for the invitations. If the Irish ambassador arranged a reception at a hotel, invited Members and we all went and had a good time, provided no payment was made to the party, that would not be regarded as sponsorship. If the Irish ambassador booked space from a party holding a conference, there clearly would be a difficulty, but I must leave a question mark hanging in the air on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am grateful for the Minister saying that he will leave a question mark hanging in the air on that point, because that is precisely what worries me. The party is involved in a commercial transaction with the Irish ambassador or with any other organisations that might buy space in a conference centre or hotel that had been block booked by the party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I take the point, but let me deal with another example that the hon. Gentleman gave. He spoke of a sponsor buying am advert in a party newsletter. If the company pays for the advert it is, in sense, sponsorship.
<P>
A further example that was given on Second Reading, and which was mentioned today, is that of party conferences. Parties run lavish conferences these days, with big exhibitions and much space available. Sometimes, a little political discussion is simply an add-on to the exhibition. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston reminded me how profitable the Labour party conference is, compared with the Conservative party conference. That has nothing to do with professional marketing or good design, but with the relative balance of the two parties. These things go in cycles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister is treading interesting ground. The argument is that the level is dependent on the return received on the investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That is a relevant point, which also links into the example of auctions and the value of prizes offered. I shall not be drawn on that this morning, although I may be this afternoon. Many of us believe in the market, and clearly, different markets operate around auctions. It is a hard philosophical point, but it is important to devise a system that allows for commercial contracts and distinguishes them from sponsorship. That will not be easy.
<P>
The matter was discussed on Second Reading and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is in touch with the Neill committee about it. We accept that there are problems and that we have to find a solution. The solution might be for the provision to be simpler, as has been suggested, or more detailed; both are possible ways forward. It is important, however, to take soundings from the Neill committee. We have given that committee the sharp example of party conferences and asked them to direct their attention to it.
<P>
We have also asked the Neill committee to consider whether it might be possible for companies to include in their accounts a sum for sponsorship, which would not necessarily have to be agreed at the annual meeting. I accept that it is a difficult matter and that members of the Committee want to distinguish between sponsorship and a concealed donation. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said with candour that we shall return to the issue in a more confrontational way on Report. We shall return to it on Report, or later in our proceedings, because there is no doubt that there is a lack of clarity and we need to do more work on it. I confess that at this stage I am not clear what solutions are available. I shall follow the debate closely and shall be interested to hear what hon. Members have to say. I am concerned to find a consensual way forward that meets the needs of honesty, transparency and accountability without, as my hon. Friend the Member for Pollock and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said, opening up loopholes for ingenious people and parties. I accept that there is a problem. We need to work on it, and we will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> We have had a useful debate on donations and sponsorship. I was intrigued by the comments about the relative profitability of the Labour party and Conservative party conferences. That may have something to do with the Labour party having abandoned Blackpool--in the north--to hold its conference in the south. I am delighted that they are using Bournemouth, in Dorset. That does wonders for the economy of my constituency, but not for the budget of the Dorset police authority. I was interested in what the Minister said about referring the matter back to the Neill committee for definitions of sponsorship and how companies might deal with that in relation to the provisions later in the Bill.
<P>
As I said in my opening remarks, when a party sells space and rents rooms to companies and other organisations, that should not be regarded as a donation, but as a commercial transaction entered into in the same way as any other such activity, whether it is buying photocopy paper or sub-letting office space that is surplus to its needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> May we have some confirmation as to how the hon. Gentleman would propose we overcome the difficulty of hidden donations? If somebody offers to let property from, say, the North Dorset Conservative Association at 15, 20, 40 or 100 times the going rate for the local area, how can it be made clear that that is not a concealed donation, but a genuine commercial transaction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> That is not difficult--it already occurs. The Inland Revenue applies that sort of test on a regular basis when it feels that people are trying to transfer value as a means of tax avoidance. Many people work for financial institutions that offer discounted mortgages. That amounts to a benefit in kind and the sort of tests that have been applied to discounts on a non-commercial basis would be exactly the same as those that would be applied to companies buying services from political parties. If they were gaining some benefit that was less than the transaction price, the difference between the commercial value and the amount paid by the company would have to be treated as a donation.
<P>
What concerns me about the way in which the Bill is drafted is that it does not take account of the commercial nature of the transaction and therefore I am delighted that the Minister is to reconsider that. I shall re-address the question of the value of donations when we discuss clause 47 of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
