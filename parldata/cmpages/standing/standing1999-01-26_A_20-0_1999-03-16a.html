<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I express the hope that all members of Committee had a pleasant and restful weekend. Spring appears to be with us for at least a day or two, and I am pleased to announce that both the rugby club in Macclesfield and the town football club won their matches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): They are still bottom.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, they are not bottom; they are off the bottom, but still in difficulty
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> Next to bottom.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Minister, you are always well informed.
<H4><center>Clause 207</center></H4>
<H4><center>Establishment, membership and duty to maintain police force</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): We have come to part VI of the Bill, and are embarking on clauses relating to the Metropolitan police and the police authority. I am leading for the official Opposition on these clauses, and my name was attached to the amendments.
<P>
I am here in part by accident. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) believed that I had once been a Home Office Minister, and that it would therefore be suitable for me temporarily to return to the Opposition Front Bench in an honorary capacity to move the amendments. That was a case of mistaken identity; my father was of course Home Secretary. Given the continuity of my party, it was in no way surprising that my hon. Friend made a mistake in the hierarchy of generations, and attributed presence in the Home Office to me. As I am a temporary Front Bencher, I shall continue to occupy the seat that I have occupied throughout the Committee's sittings.
<P>
I have another reason for sheltering on the Back Benches, which I already have shared with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey). I spent a couple of hours earlier today by the side of the road with a broken clutch cable. The Minister for Transport in London will say that that is entirely my own fault for having brought my car to work. I pay the warmest possible tribute to the Metropolitan police for the manner in which I was looked after. However, when the pick-up truck arrived, it took not only the car but my papers for our proceedings. Consequently, there will be a degree of interest in and excitement about my presentation of the Opposition's case.
<P>
I always intended to say what I am about to say, although I may otherwise have said it in speaking to the related schedule, rather than the clause. I will not filibuster; I shall seek to remain in order--I know that you, Mr. Winterton, would bring me up if I did not. However, I am conscious as we address the clause and this part of the Bill that the whole Committee meets in the shadow of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. I am certain that there will be references to that inquiry as we deliberate on the clauses. I will not dwell on that now, but it is important to know where we have come from, given our responsibility for the future of the Metropolitan police.
<P>
I freely confess--in this respect, I return to my father's era--that I have drawn for my introductory remarks on the history of police in England and Wales by Mr. T. A. Critchley, who was the secretary of the royal commission on the police that led to the Police Act 1964, for which my father was responsible. The Committee consists of 27 Members of Parliament for the Greater London area--the only two members of the Committee who are not London Members are the Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary and the official Opposition Whip, who periodically tells us about events in the west midlands. I recommend the first two chapters of Mr. Critchley's book, which are devoted entirely to the origins of the Metropolitan police and are an exceptionally good read.
<P>
Members of the Committee will be relieved that I am not going to go back to the origins of policing in this land under the Saxons and Normans, although those matters are covered by Mr. Critchley. I shall refer briefly to the introduction of charlies during the reign of King Charles
 II. They had exactly the same role as that of bobbies under Sir Robert Peel, who presumably borrowed their name from Sir Robert in the same way that the charlies--1,000 watchmen appointed to serve in the Cities of London and Westminster--took their name from Charles II.
<P>
I shall not speak at length of Jonathan Wild, the thief-taker general, who made commissions on receivership. He arranged for things to be pinched, which were brought to him in his capacity as thief-taker general, and then returned them to the people from whom they had been pinched, taking a commission for the service that had been rendered. He did that successfully for seven years until he was executed at Tyburn, then on the site of Marble Arch in my constituency.
<P>
I shall not dwell on the two great Fielding brothers, the novelist Henry Fielding and his blind brother Sir John Fielding, who succeeded him as a magistrate at Bow street magistrates court. However, I shall quote an observation by Henry Fielding that seems to me to be worth recording in the transcript of the Committee's affairs. He said that his was a design that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "alike opposes those wild notions of liberty that are inconsistent with all government, and those pernicious schemes of government which are destructive of true liberty."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are views with which Tory members of the Committee can immediately identify, because they are at the heart of our political philosophy. I do not propose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman is making a very interesting, entertaining and enlightening address. However, I think that the Committee would like to know what he is going to dwell on rather than what he is not going to dwell on. While I hesitate to interrupt him, perhaps he could gradually direct his comments towards the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I was confident, Mr. Winterton, that you would keep me wholly in order, and I propose, as you rightly suggest, to explain why I have given this lengthy prolegomenon. I shall accelerate my comments, Mr.
 Winterton, to avoid risking any further intervention. However, there is a purpose in what I am saying.
<P>
I shall pause for a moment on Bow street magistrates court, because the Bill deals with magistrates courts and how they should be led and coordinated. I draw attention to the considerable weight of the magistracy in Westminster. Historical reasons lie behind that and, in a constituency capacity, I could argue that Westminster should take the lead in the co-ordination to which I referred.
<P>
The Gordon riots in 1780 gave rise to the first Government attempt to introduce legislation on the police. I think that you will agree, Mr. Winterton, that I am now touching on the matters that are covered in clause 207. Ironically, Pitt was deterred from proceeding with the Bill, which was introduced by his Solicitor-General, because the City of London made it clear that it would have no part of it. Pitt withdrew the Bill with the happy words that he was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not perfectly master of the subject."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a condition with which I have profound sympathy at this point in the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
Pitt's initiative of 1785 had particular significance, as did developments thereafter. In a previous sitting, Mr. O'Hara was kind enough to say that he was fascinated to learn about the river police. They were introduced by Patrick Colquohoun, a Glasgow merchant of a utilitarian bent who had been Lord Provost of Glasgow in 1792, and were the origins of the force. They were devoted to reducing massive pilferage in the West Indies docks at a time when almost all trade was going through the port of London. I shall not dwell on the role of Sir Richard Ford in identifying aliens during the Napoleonic wars, or on the introduction of the Bow street runners.
<P>
I shall, however, mention a coincidence that played a large part in subsequent events, and which is relevant to the debate. In 1786, a Police Act took effect in Dublin, and a police force was set up. That change played a significant part in the history of policing in these islands. Sir Robert Peel subsequently served as Chief Secretary in Ireland, during which time he had exposure to and experience of the police force there, which gave rise to the subsequent measures on which he embarked.
<P>
I pass over the famous Wapping murders in a sentence. I should, however, mention the 1822 committee set up by Peel, who said that he had no great confidence that it would make any significant contribution. It was devoted to tackling crime in the metropolis. Peel set up a further committee in 1828. He took the chair of both committees, and the force of 1829 developed out of them and their work. Peel was assisted by the fact that the Prime Minister of the day was the Duke of Wellington--
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I find my right hon. Friend's speech so interesting that I cannot wait to get on to the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall seek to respond courteously to the hon. Gentleman and to be diplomatic and similarly courteous towards the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), whom I have sought to guide back to the paths of righteousness and correctness. I hope that within a very few moments, the right hon. Gentleman will relate the history of the Metropolitan police to the clause and to the broad clause stand part debate on which I had hoped that the Committee would embark.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. Perhaps you may find a little sympathy for the view that we live in an age of hurry, soundbites and television advertisements that cannot last for more than five seconds. Hearing somebody review the background of a matter can be quite civilising.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I have to tell the Opposition Whip that I have so far shown 10 minutes of discretion. Perhaps I shall grant another minute or two, but I should tell the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that while we are all fascinated, and while I know that he is explaining the foundation stones of the current Metropolitan police and the history of the police of London, I hope that he will quickly relate his remarks more directly to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friends were kind to intervene, but I did not stand in immediate need of their assistance. I was coming, through the events that I described, to the crux of the matter--clause 207. The arguments on moral, ethical and political philosophy that led to the establishment of the Metropolitan police are not a million miles from the issues that we will consider in the aftermath of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. They relate also to the need for us to meet the ambition of Stephen Lawrence's father that we restore the faith of the black community in London in the police.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The point to which I was leading relates to the success with which Peel fashioned the police out of the philosophical arguments that had been going on for the best part of the previous 100 years. They were encapsulated in a remark in a book on representative government by J. S. Mill, one of my predecessors as the Member of Parliament for Westminster, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In England there has always been more liberty but worse organisation, while in other countries there is better organisation, but less liberty."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Peel showed great skill in bringing the legislation to the statute book. He did not arouse excessively great expectations about what would be achieved. With great dexterousness, he traded his way through the political shoals and created a force. We all know from the Bill that aspects of the government and governance of the Metropolitan police go back to the original Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and have coloured the work of the police for the past 170 years.
<P>
I make that point because the skill of particular politicians and individuals at this crucial moment in the history of the police will be important to the future of the police. One can take Tolstoy's view that we are all corks bobbing on the river and that we are subject to its currents; or one can take an anti-Tolstoyan view, and say that everything is decided by individuals. I suspect that most practising politicians take a position halfway between the two: there are tides, but it is important that they should be harnessed. It is extremely important--whether this happens through the mayor, the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis or the Home Secretary--that the individuals who have to take charge of events at this time should be worthy of the past of the Metropolitan police and thus capable of steering its future.
<P>
It is for those reasons that I have made a quarter of an hour of introductory remarks on clause 207 stand part; and you kindly allowed me to do so, Mr. Winterton. Clause 207 is not in itself controversial and the Opposition do not seek to amend it. I am confident that it will go through with the approbation of the Committee. It is the foundation stone on which the whole of the rest of part VI stands. It is therefore important that it should not pass just on a vote and without any signal as to what we are dealing with.
<P>
I am delighted that you gave me the opportunity to provide the opening overs in this particular section of the test match in which we are engaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): We welcome the history lesson from the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, and my hon. Friends and I welcome the clause.
<P>
In 1986, in one of the debates that is usuaily--but not always--held every year in the Chamber on the policing of London, I first made the point that there should be a democratic police authority for London. I have repeated that point in each of the almost annual speeches that I have made since that debate in 1986. The clause not only reaffirms that we should have a police force in London--that is self-evident--but sets up a new authority for London. Instead of coming under the responsibility of the Home Secretary, the police will he responsible to a police authority, as is the case in the rest of England--apart from the City of London. That is an anomalous situation, to which we shall return later.
<P>
One of the failures of the present system is that the Home Secretary must be Mikado-like--he must speak to himself, as police authority for London, and then the police authority must speak back. The present Commissioner and the police believe that that is not in London's interests. London has no independent voice to put its case for policing to the Home Secretary, unlike the other forces in England, which have independent voices. Your force in Cheshire, for example, Mr. Winterton, speaks, independent of the view of the Home Secretary, to the Home Secretary as the Secretary of State responsible for policing. That has never been the case in London, which is a disadvantage from which the police in London believe that they have suffered. They have for several years called for a change.
<P>
The Secretary of State for the Home Department--the boss of the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall whom we greatly welcome--is, as holder of that office of state, responsible for the police authority. It cannot be delegated to Ministers of State or Under-Secretaries of State. Yet we have had the nonsense that Secretaries of State have in the past left debates on policing London, even though they are supposed to be the accountable authority. I have criticised previous Home Secretaries for not sitting through the only occassions in the year for holding our police authority to account. The authority in the form of the Secretary of State, is held to account by Parliament, which obviously includes London Members of Parliament, although it is rather remote from the people of London.
<P>
An interesting factor that we may well come on to, in spite of the quiet protestations of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), is that in the most recent inquiry into the activities of the Metropolitan police, Sir William Macpherson spent a lot of time talking about the operations of the police, but forgot to mention that the Home Secretary was in charge of the police all the time, from the day Sir Paul Condon took office to the day Stephen Lawrence died, and every day after that. I do not think that the Home Secretary should subsequently be allowed to say that it was nothing to do with him. If things go wrong, it is as much the responsibility of the police authority for London as it is for the chief of police in London.
<P>
The clause will make London policing more accountable, which we welcome. We shall deal shortly with the way in which that accountability will work; my hon. Friends and I shall seek to test the Government on some of those issues.
<P>
Finally, we have always been clear that there should be a majority of elected representatives on the Metropolitan police authority. The clause deals with the authority's size. Specifically, it puts the case that its size should be determined by the Secretary of State, and that it should be larger than the other police authorities in England. When we had the review of policing legislation, we came, after wide debate, to a broad consensus that police authorities should be made up of a majority of elected councillors, a minority of magistrates and a third group whose members would be chosen by the other two groups. That was a fine balance and, although there has been some criticism, it has worked well.
<P>
In London, the same balance is to be maintained. we support that; it is the right way to start. It brings London in to the same sort of structure as the rest of the country. The only difference is that London's police authority would be bigger. An argument for its being so is the size of the area for which it would have responsibility and the breadth of its duties, such as responsibility for the diplomatic service and the royal family, which are specific to the capital city.
<P>
We support the clause and the belated but welcome transfer to the new police authority. We welcome the fact that the Government committed themselves to that when in opposition, as we did, and are now putting it into practice. We think that it will make for better and more accountable policing in London. Above all, it will give London and London's policing needs a clearer and louder voice so that it can make its case more effectively. That will be very welcome to the current and subsequent chief officers of police in London and to all those who serve in and rely on the police service in our capital city.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey):</B> I welcome the remarks of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) on this important part of the Bill.
<P>
I am not sure that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster really needs notes; if that was what he could do without notes, perhaps it is just as well that he did not have them with him--we might still be listening to him. I sympathise with his dilemma, but I am sure that he will not in any way be put out.
<P>
I further welcome the right hon. Gentleman's overview of the history of how we got here; although I do not want to go into that now, it is important sometimes to look back. The police authority arrangements for London started way back in 1829, which is an important reason why we need to modernise and to make the Metropolitan police accountable and responsive to Londoners' needs.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey talked about how long many people in London have wanted this change to happen. This is a historic moment in the history of the police and the proposals will be welcomed by people throughout London and, indeed, throughout the country. For far too long, Londoners have not had the accountable police force that they need.
<P>
Clause 207, for which there is wide support, is the foundation stone for the rest of the proposals. Proposed section 5B provides for the establishment of a police authority for the Metropolitan police district. It is worth pointing out that a lot of what we will be discussing is about making London fit into the Police Act 1996 so that its arrangements are as near as possible to what is happening outside London--but remembering London's special circumstances.
<P>
With regard to size, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was right; we need a bigger police authority than other places, where the minimum number of members is 17. We believe that 23 members is about the right number. That will enable it to cover London's wider area. It is important to remember that 20 per cent. of all police officers in England and Wales are in London. The clause is really the introduction to schedule 16, which makes detailed provisions relating to the membership of the MPA. We will debate that in more detail later.
<P>
The clause is significant and it is important that it has all-party support. It will set up something that Londoners have wanted for a long time. many political parties--particularly the Labour party--have been committed to it, and we are very pleased that we now have the opportunity to put it into practice.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 207 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on to schedule 16, the Minister would like to raise a brief point or order by way of correction and clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I apologise for not raising this earlier, but I was distracted by your remarks about Macclesfield Town football club, Mr. Winterton. I am a supporter of Northampton Town, which is one place above Macclesfield in the league.
<P>
I simply wish to raise as a point of order the fact that in column 1149 of the Hansard recording of our Committee proceedings on 11 March, I said, referring to figures that had previously been quoted frequently, that the average cost of introducing the new Greater London authority would be 3p a week to a person on the average council tax band D. Probably because I spoke rather quickly, Hansard, recorded it as band E. I make no complaint about Hansard, which is most admirable in recording our proceedings, and I understand how the confusion could have arisen. However, I felt it right to correct it so that the Committee knows that the average 3p a week cost is for band D.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Because the Almighty is even-handed and kind, I have a page of detail relating to the amendments, for which I am most relieved.
<P>
The amendments address the matter of local government representation on the authority. It will not have escaped the Minister's eagle eye that amendments No. 83 and 89, which we shall dwell upon later, refer to election rather than appointment. My comments on schedule 16 carry the implication that we shall come to those amendments to which the members of the official Opposition have added their signatures alongside those of Liberal Democrat Members. I compliment Liberal Democrats now--although I shall no doubt do so later--on being more vigilant than we in realising how many consequential amendments were needed in the context of election. We did not put our names to all their amendments although I dare say we should have done.
<P>
Amendment No. 973 would provide that the Metropolitan police authority consists inter alia of six borough representatives as well as six members of the London assembly elected by the assembly. It would replace the Bill's proposal that 12 members of the assembly be appointed by the mayor. We shall come to the issue of appointment rather than election on the next group of amendments.
<P>
The proposal concentrates power in the hands of the mayor. It does not allow for representation of the boroughs--on which subject I will dilate a little more in a moment. It does not reflect the model of non-metropolitan police authorities, and does not allow for the pluralism that is otherwise the model for London. I recall that the proposals for the London development agency, which we discussed last Thursday, contained alternative arrangements for borough participation.
<P>
The Metropolitan police authority, under the proposals, would be an undemocratic body, unresponsive to local needs. I look forward to consideration of the next set of amendments, which will address that matter. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 imposes a duty on borough councils, and on the Commissioner, to formulate strategies for the reduction of crime and disorder in their areas. The underlying philosophy of that Act is to develop and enhance partnerships between the Metropolitan police and other agencies involved in the criminal justice system--above all, with local government.
<P>
From my own local experience, such a link is already valuable and proving its potential for further worth. In February 1998, the police community consultative group in south Westminster, in conjunction with the Metropolitan police, put on an exceptionally valuable half-day conference entitled "The Street People". I had the privilege of attending the conference, as did about 100 residents from different parts of Westminster. Those who addressed it were from all relevant areas, including the local authority. At the conclusion of the conference, the residents said that they had had no idea that so much was going on, not least in the collaboration between the police and the local authority, and that they were profoundly impressed that that kind of thinking and activity was taking place.
<P>
Against that background, it is logical that the boroughs should be represented on the Metropolitan police authority, to facilitate compliance with the duties outlined above. The arrangements for appointing such borough representatives, proposed in our amendments, mirror those in schedule 2 of the Police Act 1996, which provide for local councils, or joint Committees of local councils, to appoint members to a police authority. We propose that six members--not the 12 proposed in the Bill--should be members of the London assembly, and that they should be elected by the assembly and not appointed by the mayor. Under the Bill, too much power would lie in the hands of the mayor, there would be a risk of the politicisation of the Metropolitan police authority, and--I have to say, in a low voice--the possibility of corruption.
<P>
We had similar debates on these matters in earlier stages of the Committee. I recall the Minister for Transport in London arguing that those who served on the assembly would be quite different from those serving in a democratic capacity in the rest of London, because they would be "strategic"--that would be the one thing on which they would concentrate. I suspect that the Minister may respond to this debate by saying that the MPA will be a strategic body, that only those capable of understanding strategy should serve on it, and that the assembly should be the catchment area from which that membership is derived. The possession of a strategic skill is implied, which will confer the ability to serve on an authority of this sort.
<P>
I acknowledge that the ability to think strategically is a special skill. When proceeding down Whitehall towards Trafalgar square, one passes, on the right, a statue of my kinsman, Lord Alanbrooke. On the plinth of his statue--he was the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for Sir Winston Churchill during the second world war--he is described as "Master of Strategy". History records that he was greatly disappointed not to be given the command of the D-day landings and Operation Overlord, which went to General Eisenhower instead. Of course he wanted to be a leader in the field as well as a strategic adviser. I am not making a family point when I say that as a nation we were lucky that he was available as a strategic adviser to a Prime Minister who was exceptionally fertile in ideas but needed someone of strong will and character beside him to point out when the ideas were not as good as they might have been and to ensure central co-ordination of the overall strategy.
<P>
Of course I accept that developing strategy is a skill. However, were Plato to be present--and I know, Mr. Winterton, that you would be the first to welcome him--and to translate the Committee's proceedings into a Socratic dialogue, he would rapidly prove that it would be highly unlikely for 12 out of 25 assembly members to have a special strategic skill comparable to my kinsman's. Even if they did--if 12 masters of strategy who were unlike other men could be found to serve on the Metropolitan police authority--that would amount to the diversion of about half the authority, and the concentration of a valuable resource, on one issue. I do not believe that any Committee member thinks that people will stand for the assembly believing, after searching their hearts, that they possess a unique strategic skill and that it would be wrong for them to serve elsewhere in London government because fate has singled them out to exercise that skill. I expect that although the 25 people who serve on the assembly may have strategic tasks, they will be remarkably like the generality of the House of Commons and of people in local government in London. They will come in all shapes and sizes and will not be uniquely distinguished for strategic skill.
<P>
One of the glories of Parliament and local government is that those who are elected are remarkably representative of mankind as a whole and therefore bring a range of skills to the task. I do not agree that the 12 assembly members should constitute the elected membership of the Metropolitan police authority. We are just as likely to secure the desired strategic thinking from the whole of London local government as from the 25 members of the assembly. That reinforces my view, which is derived from the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, that local government at borough level should be represented on the authority.
<P>
I appreciate that Governments sometimes operate in iron harnesses, which do not have the flexibility of a leather harness, but the Bill would be enormously improved, and Londoners would view it as a sensible compromise, if the dozen places in question were divided between the boroughs and the assembly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I take this opportunity to address one or two issues that the schedule as a whole raises thereby avoiding the need to speak in further detail later. As the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said, the amendments aim to find out whether the London boroughs can have a role in the governance of the Metropolitan police authority. We have looked at that in the context of our group of amendments and our response to the Government's consultation at the Green Paper stage and have decided that we cannot support the formula set out in the amendments. However there are some important questions about the MPA's relationship with the London boroughs that I should like to explore.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is no uniquely blessed group who bring to the Metropolitan police authority the ability to take a strategic view. Certainly plenty of London authorities demonstrate that they do not necessarily have that ability, but equally, many demonstrate that they do. That is not necessarily the most central point in terms of the composition of the MPA. Strategic vision and an ability to operate in a strategic way will be important, not least because the MPA will not be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Met.
<P>
I wanted to dwell on the links with the London boroughs which are important, given the realignment of the Metropolitan police boundary on to the Greater London administrative boundary and the subsequent realignment of police divisions on London boroughs. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 placed a new duty on London boroughs in respect of community safety and the need to develop community safety partnerships and community safety strategies. Although those strategies will be focused at a local level, they will require a strategic Londonwide view to work effectively one with another to deliver reductions in crime and in fear of crime right across the capital.
<P>
How will this independent Metropolitan police authority develop its strategies in consultation with the commissioner so that they are in step with the strategies that the London boroughs have a duty to produce in conjunction with the police? It is important to establish how the Government see those two things fitting together because the London boroughs are busily working on the Crime and Disorder Act, undertaking their crime audits and developing their strategies in partnership with various agencies--the police, the probation service and others at a local level.
<P>
Will the Association of London Government continue to have a role, at least at a consultative level, in the development of strategies of the Metropolitan police authority? How do the Government see that link continuing? At present 10 members of the Metropolitan police Committee, who were appointed by the Home Secretary, were nominated by the Association of London Government. They are currently doing a good job for Londoners and they will want to know whether they will continue to have a role in the new structures for governance of the Metropolitan police.
<P>
The introduction of the MPA provides an important opportunity to integrate policies which is one of the key features of the GLA. It will be able to integrate across a host of different policy areas, such as planning and transport, that perhaps have not been integrated as effectively as they should have been in the past. That lack of effective integration has unfortunately contributed to crime and the fear of crime in London. Again that link with the London boroughs will be crucial to deliver this in as effective a way as possible.
<P>
I conclude with a couple of questions and a comment on the second group of amendments. First, can the Minister tell us why the MPA will be allowed to choose its own chairman and why the mayor will not have that role? I am not certain from reading the White Paper that that issue is entirely covered and it would be useful to have that set out clearly today. The second question relates to the tenure of office for members of the Metropolitan police authority. Paragraphs 11 and 12 of the schedule set out the tenure of office. Paragraph 12 states that members of the authority will be appointed for four years, although the term could be shorter. Again, it would be useful to understand the thinking behind the provision. Why will members of the police authority be appointed on a four-year basis of tenure?
<P>
Liberal Democrats believe that the amendments do not quite address the concern expressed by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. In some ways, the amendments that the Committee will discuss shortly, which relate to the role of the assembly in electing representatives to the MPA would be a better means of ensuring democratic accountability and a clear link back to local government within Greater London. We will not support the amendments for that reason.
<P>
Our final reservation relates to amendment No. 984, which proposes that magistrates should declare their political allegiances. The Bill does not currently require such declaration, and it would be an unfortunate step to require all magistrates to declare their political allegiance, even if many of them are independents, as they are now. It would be wrong to exclude from the police authority magistrates' non-party and independent views as the amendment proposes. We cannot support the amendments for that reason alone, although we feel also that they do not properly meet the general principle. We would therefore not support them if they were pressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Field Marshal Alanbrooke was not only a master of strategy but a master gunner. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster opened debate on the amendments with an especially well-directed barrage. I shall offer a little supporting fire.
<P>
It was entirely correct to table amendments that seek to ensure a better balance in representation on the police authority between assembly men and the representatives of London boroughs, I hope that the Committee will forgive me for seeking to draw a general conclusion from my local experience in west London. In the borough that my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) and I, as well the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell), have the honour of representing in Parliament, the Metropolitan police have just reduced the number of police officers by 11. Local opinion has rightly been highly critical, and people feel that Scotland Yard does not sufficiently appreciate the specific difficulties that attend policing in our part of London. For example, Harefield in my constituency and nearby areas have large expanses of open country. It is a semi-rural environment, but that is not to say that the need for policemen on the ground is any less. Similarly, Heathrow airport, which is situated in the south of the borough, is an especially demanding police responsibility that calls for remarkable expertise and a great many officers.
<P>
It is important to maximise the opportunity to represent distinct parts of the capital in the police authority, such as the part that my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington and I have the honour of representing. That would be more likely to occur if the London boroughs could choose six representatives because it is to be hoped that they would do so on just such a geographic basis. The Government propose that there should be 12 assembly men on the authority, which I believe to be an excessive number. The danger is that the duties of assembly men with constituencies will be so onerous that they will not have much time to serve on the police authority as well. Consequently, the preponderance of representation of assembly men on the police authority could derive from the rootless 11 who have no constituency responsibilities and will therefore lack the deep perception of local issues that they would enjoy if they represented a particular area and were involved in a dialogue with their constituents.
<P>
The balance proposed by the loyal Opposition is much sounder. It would be wrong to do anything that diminishes the authority of the borough councils as repositories of wisdom and strategic vision, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster put it. The police authority will need as much judgment and local expertise as it can get, and that will be diminished rather than increased by excessive representation from the assembly. That is what will happen if our amendments are not accepted.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I do not often disagree wholeheartedly with the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, but I do so now, especially with regard to amendment No. 973. He takes the view that the number of assembly members on the MPA should be reduced to six, and that the other six should be persons elected by a joint committee consisting of London borough councillors. I assume that the six persons would be councillors, although the amendment does not make that clear. The joint Committee could, therefore, consist of London borough councillors who would then elect six people whom they happened to like.
<P>
The amendments are another example of the wish of Conservative Members that the London boroughs should jointly take on a greater role. The right hon. Gentleman and his party have still not come to terms with the roles of the assembly and the mayor. We have explained before why it is unacceptable for the boroughs to trespass on to the rightful territory of the assembly. We have drawn a clear line between strategic issues, for which the GLA should be responsible, and other issues that are best kept by London boroughs. Everyone in London would surely agree that the policing of London is a matter that requires a strategic overview. The elected membership of the police authority must therefore be drawn from the assembly rather than from individual boroughs.
That means that we must give more careful consideration to the way in which its membership is constructed and how appointees are appointed. We have tabled the amendments because we believe that it is not enough for the assembly to provide the pool from which the mayor chooses the representatives who sit on the MPA.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The power should be granted to the assembly to choose and elect those whom it wishes to serve on the MPA to give it that element of independence in its relationship and dealings with the mayor. That is particularly important, given that the clause and schedule place a duty on the mayor to have regard to the political balance of the assembly at any given time when selecting people whom he or she wishes to appoint to the MPA from the assembly.
<P>
We welcome the fact that the composition should be proportional; that should be an important guide to the make-up of all the functional bodies and other bodies to which the mayor appoints members. However, although the mayor may well ensure that the political composition is correct, it will be the mayor doing the choosing--the individual political groups on the assembly will not be able to put forward their nominees. I am sure that in most cases the choice will be made in a reasonable and amicable way, but because of the way in which these provisions are drafted, if relations were to break down between a leader of a political group on the assembly and the mayor, the mayor might choose to exercise his power in a way that would be disadvantageous to the interests of that political group and the people whom it represented. That concern has led us to explore the issue further.
<P>
I wish to return to the substance of the amendments, which go well beyond the interests of individual political groups on the assembly. They go to the heart of the balance of power between the mayor and the assembly, and the unique position of the MPA, compared with a number of the other functional bodies in the GLA. We hope, therefore, that the Government recognise that the way to fulfil their vision of an independently constituted MPA, as proposed in the White Paper, is to allow the assembly to elect its 12 members, rather than allowing the mayor to choose them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Because the issue of election as against appointment has played so significant a part in the earlier group of amendments--you were kind enough, Mr. Winterton, not to rule me out of order when I looked forward to the second group--I shall not repeat everything that I said about the amendment that I moved. However, the official Opposition share the concern of Liberal Democrat Members, and in that sense we are marching shoulder to shoulder. There is a considerable hazard that if these issues are concentrated in the hands of the mayor, they will not be subject to the same democratic process.
<P>
London is, necessarily, in a different position from that of the other non-Metropolitan police authorities. There is in their case no mayor to make the appointment. But in defending the mayor's ability to appoint members,
 the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department should explain how, in giving the mayor this power, she is ensuring that the pattern of the authority resembles as closely as possible that of non-metropolitan authorities. I do not think that it would be fair for her simply to refer to paragraph 5.140 of the document to which I referred earlier. That does not seem to be the sort of exception which the man on the Clapham omnibus would regard as one that should reasonably make London different from anywhere else.
<P>
We retain the view that there should be elections rather than appointments. Let me give an entirely even-handed example of the hazards of appointment. The case was slightly different, but the outcome was the same. It happened in a different capacity, but it is highly apposite, given the day's news, Mr. Winterton. Late in 1976, Lord Callaghan, then the Prime Minister, approached the then Leader of the Opposition and asked for her permission to approach two members of her shadow Cabinet about becoming a Commissioner in Brussels. Lord Soames was, I think, due to give up at the end of the year, but I am not sure whether I remember correctly. The Leader of the Opposition said that she was not prepared to have those shadow Cabinet members removed to Brussels in those circumstances and, to be fair to Lord Callaghan, he did not press the point or approach the people concerned. He did, however, ask a third person without consulting the Leader of the Opposition. My predecessor in my Parliamentary seat, Mr. Christopher Tugendhat as he then was, became the Commissioner, through force majeure exercised by the Prime Minister, who could argue extenuating grounds.
<P>
An example that tends in the opposite direction concerns the desire of the then Opposition that Mr. Neil Kinnock should become a Commissioner earlier than he did. The Prime Minister of the day turned down the loyal Opposition's recommendation and made a different decision.
<P>
There is inevitably some blood on the carpet from both those episodes in the mythology of the two parties concerned, Both seem to be classic instances of of why it is a mistake to leave the relevant power with the mayor in preference to a more pluralistic and democratic solution--taking us back to the practice with respect to non-Metropolitan police authorities, which to a substantial extent being used as a model.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> The fact that the amendment is tabled by both Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members does not make me any more sympathetic to it. Under the amendment, the 12 assembly members on the authority would be elected by the assembly rather than appointed by the mayor. That is another example of the Liberal Democrats' and sometimes, but not always, the Conservatives' wish to extend the powers of the assembly at the expense of the mayor.
<P>
I do not want to rehearse again our arguments about the balance that we have struck between the mayor and the assembly, which was endorsed by Londoners in the referendum. I remind the Committee that under paragraph 2(3) of schedule 16,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Mayor . . . shall ensure that, so far as practicable, the members for whose appointment he is responsible reflect the balance of parties for the time being prevailing among the members of the London Assembly."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> On that point, perhaps I may put to the Minister a scenario in which the mayor is informed of political groups' nominees for the appointments and, for one reason or another, rejects a nomination and selects another person from the relevant political group, to maintain the balance. That person refuses the nomination, as do all the other members of the group in turn, in support of the person whom they collectively nominated. What takes precedence--the mayor's obligation to ensure proportionality, or something else? How would the mayor break that impasse? Ensuring representation through the mechanism in question on the Metropolitan police authority is an important aspect of assembly groups' rights.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a scenario and we could all do the same, but any scenario would be based having done his or her best to ensure political balance in the appointments. Clearly the mayor cannot be entirely responsible for the whims of a particular party at a given time if it chooses not to be part of the agreed structure. However, it is unlikely to happen. If a member of a party chose not to go along with the process, I should hope that other more sensible members would. I do not think that we should go into the detail.
<P>
The mayor will do whatever is practical. Hence our use of the word "appointed". The mayor will be a responsible person--we assume that the people of London will not elect someone who is not. Whoever it is will do his or her best to ensure that the Bill's provisions--which we have attempted to make as politically balanced and acceptable as possible--will be applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is perfectly reasonable response to the scenario that I set out. However, will the Minister reflect a little further--I do not expect her to answer now--in the context of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which introduced the principle of proportionality to local government and removed the situation of a majority party on a local authority being able to use its majority to select members of other parties to sit on committees. Will the hon. Lady tell the Committee whether the principle established by that Act will continue to apply to the operation of appointments under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the Bill is different from the 1989 legislation. The mayor may or may not be a member of a party, but he will be elected as someone very much responsible for the whole of London, having been elected by the people of London. That is not the same as a party nominating another party, so there is a distinction. I realise that it is difficult because the idea of a mayor and an assembly is something new and we are all having to get our heads round the difference. We have to remind ourselves that this is not like local government or anything else that we have had, while at the same time realising that in many respects it is not different. We shall have to be a little patient about the implications of every sentence that the hon. Gentleman would like me to try to explain.
<P>
I wish to pick up the point made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster about the need for the composition of the membership to be more closely in line with that of other police authorities and his justification of the amendments on the ground that they would bring it more into line. That argument fails to take account of the unique and special model of governance that is being created newly for London. It ignores the mayor's strong strategic role, although I must admit that after so much discussion for so long about the strong strategic role of the mayor, I do not know how anyone could ignore it.
<P>
We regard the power of appointment as crucial to the mayor's ability to take a strong and strategic interest in the MPA's effort to tackle crime and maintain an efficient and effective policing service in London. The people of London will expect the mayor to play an extremely high-level role in that. Moreover, that role is consistent with the mayor's power of appointment to the other three functional bodies. We do not wish there to be any dilution of the mayor's power in this respect.
<P>
The argument of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster ignored the split between the executive role of the mayor and the scrutinising function of the assembly. Local councils outside London combine these roles, although it is too simplistic to argue that the assembly should elect its members to the MPA because local councillors elect their own members to police authorities. Those local authorities do not have mayors. There is therefore a straightforward difference, which has to be taken into account. The assembly and local authorities are not directly comparable.
<P>
I understand why the amendments were moved. However, I hope that hon. Members understand why we oppose them, and that, having heard my comments, they will seek to withdraw them.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Minister touched on a number of different issues. I do not know about my hon. Friends, but I am not convinced by the Government's arguments. She was gracious enough to say that the fact that the amendments were tabled by both Opposition parties did not convince her, and equally I do not have to be convinced simply by the firmness with which she holds her views. Of course we are dealing with a unique institution; of course we are engaged in a legislative experiment in creating something that has not existed before. However, in the context of 1,000 years of history, that is an argument for caution rather than for automatically accumulating a power in the hands of those who will exercise it.
<P>
The Minister for London will recall that in a debate on the governance of London in June 1997 I quoted Mr. Sam Rayburn, the Speaker of the House of Representatives under President Johnson. He was a Texan of extremely few words and one of his most famous observations was that the three wisest words in the English language were "wait a minute". It is more sensible to proceed cautiously with the experiment against all the pragmatic political philosophy of the land rather than to take risks.
The Minister says that it would be inconsistent to make the appointments to this body different from those of the other bodies with which the mayor will have an interface. The reason for that difference is that for at least the past 170 years, we have tried to keep the police out of politics so that the role of the police is not politicised. Every caution, caveat, restriction and control needed to ensure that should therefore be built into the Bill.
<P>
 We have debated how a mayor can be removed from office for improper behaviour, and mayors throughout the world are not insulated from original sin or any foibles of venality. It is therefore extremely important that powers should not be concentrated in the hands of one individual. If we took expert evidence from the police about this I would be extremely surprised if they were enthusiastic about having such power concentrated in the hands of one individual. The role of the Home Secretary is necessarily different.
<P>
The Minister says that we can rely on the mayor to behave reasonably. The Minister for London repeated on a series of occasions that the automatic a priori premise of administrative law in this country is that people will behave reasonably. I understand that but this is an area where there is concern about the relationship between politicians and the police for reasons with which every member of the Committee is familiar. One cannot automatically assume that the person will behave reasonably. A far better way of retaining a pluralistic control is to have elections rather than appointments.
<P>
That goes back to the observations of J. S. Mill, which you, Mr. Winterton, so sagely allowed me to quote on clause 207. It is part of our history that that power should be pluralistically exercised. It is an irony that the Opposition are pressing for election and the Labour party, the heir to a notable tradition, over the past 100 years, of upholding democracy, is seeking to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
<P>
I gave examples earlier of the European Commission, which is a similar case. We acknowledge the reality--although that does not mean that we like it--that the Prime Minister chose to appoint my noble Friend--[Interruption.]

<P>

<B> The Chairman:</B> Order. There are rather a lot of conversations going on and I find it increasingly difficult to hear the right hon. Gentleman. Will Members of the Committee communicate with each other quietly, so as not to disturb the debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Prime Minister appointed my noble Friend Lord Alexander to the Jenkins Committee to examine the question of proportional representation. He was there because he took the Tory Whip in the House of Lords, and it is well known that he has strong views on proportional representation.
<P>
The Prime Minister also invited my noble Friend Lord Wakeham to chair the royal commission on the House of Lords. Those were invitations and appointments made to individuals by the Prime Minister. The political party that Lord Alexander and Lord Wakeham represent was not consulted. I am not suggesting that anything improper was done, but that was not the way to secure the democratic endorsement by the Conservative party of the decision or the commission. Whatever our views of the individuals concerned, and our personal friendship with them, the Conservative party played no part in the process of choice. For that reason, too, I am worried that the authority will get off on the wrong foot, in terms of the manner in which it is appointed.
<P>
The Minister said--as I expected--that, as the circumstances will be different and we shall have a mayor, we should behave differently from those outside London. I argued earlier that the opposite should be the case, and that because the mayor will be unique, it will be necessary to stay with the comparable arrangements elsewhere as far as possible. That is why we favour caution in these arrangements, rather than blindly going for an appointment system.
<P>
I recognise that the contingencies of which I speak--given that the London county council ran from 1889 to 1965, and the Greater London council for 21 years--may not occur during the time that any of us in Committee continues to play a relevant role in these affairs. However, it would be a reflection back on the Committee if we had conferred powers on the mayor that were subsequently abused and led to a breakdown in relations between the major parties. That would be singularly unfortunate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We have certainly had a useful run round the course on the issue of appointments, and the methods by which they are made. There are strong arguments in support of the amendments. However, we feel--as did the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster on the previous group of amendments--that we should be able to return to these issues. Although we have not been persuaded by the Minister's arguments, we may wish to withdraw the amendment in a moment.
<P>
The Minister's response shows that it is increasingly clear that the authority will be different and yet very familiar. That is not surprising when one reads the number of clauses that are, to some extent, cut and pastes from previous legislation. I do not intend to offend those who have drawn up the Bill, but merely to observe that much of it is based on existing legislation and does not advance matters much.
<P>
The amendments are intended to flag up to the Government that whether the configuration of powers between the mayor and assembly is right or wrong in the Bill, there is a need for greater clarity about the way in which the mayor will exercise the powers that it confers upon him in relation to the police authority. The powers of appointment are considerable, and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster was right to express his concerns. The same concerns led us to table the amendments and others like them, and I am sure that Ministers would be surprised and stunned if hon. Members ceased to pursue the point. It is important to us, even if the Government have drawn a different conclusion.
<P>
I shall not speak any further about the point now, but we shall seek to return to it later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 16 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 208</center></H4>
<H4><center>Assimilation of general functions to those of other police authorities</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Although the clause is short and apparently innocuous, it provides that the Metropolitan police authority shall have the general function of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"securing the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall therefore spend a little time addressing the legacy that the Met under the current Home office will leave the police authority, and the action that should be taken to get it into the healthiest position to discharge its objectives. Some of my remarks will be entirely unrelated to the responsibilities of the Government, excepting that the Home Secretary is the police authority. I may make other more critical remarks about present Government policy on the police, which is beginning to give not just London's police services a hard time.
<P>
There are 38 police forces in England, and I believe that almost without exception the public support them and regard them as good value for money. Currently, policing in London costs the average precepted Londoner 218 a year, and I think that we get very good value for that money. The cost is London is more than the British average of 130 per head per year, which is also in many places regarded as good value.
<P>
It is right that the police in London, as elsewhere, are regularly subjected to scrutiny about whether they are doing a good job with the money that they receive. The Audit Commission is the body that does that most authoritatively, and I shall start by drawing on its most recent report of its tests of whether London has an effective and efficient police force.
<P>
London's force has the largest number of police officers per head in England--we are well ahead of anywhere else. Compared with other capital cities, however, we have very few policemen and women. London has about 25,000, Paris has considerably more per head of population, and New York has something in between. As a capital city, London does not have exceptional police numbers, but I recognise that we have a large number compared with other areas. That number is dropping, however, and Londoners are concerned that the previous and present Governments' funding policies appear to be forcing a reduction in police numbers. All of the representations that I have received suggest that that reduction is not welcome. I shall return to that point in a moment.
<P>
In terms of expenditure per head, the reality is that we now have--the Audit Commission's figures are very clear--the worst but one reduction in expenditure per head in the country. Page 18 of the Audit Commission's latest report covers 1997-98 performance indicators for the police and fire services. It includes a table that lists all the police services in England and Wales and the percentage differences in spending between 1994-95 and 1997-98, adjusted for inflation. Only four services have seen a reduction in spending in real terms--Essex a little, Wiltshire more, followed by the Met and, finally, Warwickshire most of all.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I find no support for the view that spending should be reduced in real terms--that is what has happened, as it is down by about 2 per cent. over the period.
<P>
In the final analysis, a police service must be judged by what it does rather than by how much money is put into it. Outputs, not inputs, should be the test. I therefore turn to the mixed picture that the Met provides in terms of how efficient and effective it is in terms of the tests that were set by the Audit Commission. Some of those tests show improvements, but some show deterioration. The Met has one of the two lowest figures of all the metropolitan police authorities for the speed with which it responds to 999 calls, although it is improving. That is one of the real tests as far as the members of the public are concerned--how quickly they get an answer if they call 999 because of a fire, a burglary or an attack. The new routing systems for police telephones do not help, and I believe that the Met needs to improve considerably in that area. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether that is a technology problem or a personnel problem. The Met has experienced a reduction not only in its uniformed personnel but in civilian personnel such as those who answer 999 calls.
<P>
The target for immediate response is another test that the Audit Commission sets. It reveals a deterioration in the met's speed of response, which is not an encouraging sign. It would be helpful to know what Ministers propose to hand over to the police authority in terms of the Met's ability to respond more quickly when the public need that response.
<P>
Tables on pages 14, 15 and 16 set out the number of recorded crimes per 1,000 of population, the percentage of crimes detected by primary means, the percentage of violent crimes detected by primary means, the percentage of household burglaries detected by primary means and the number of crimes detected by primary means per police officer. Those are good tests of how well the Met is doing. The Met does relatively well in terms of the number of recorded crimes per 1,000 of population. Although it is the biggest and most complicated police force area in the country, two other metropolitan forces have more crimes per 1,000 population. According to these figures, it is much safer to live in London than in Humberside, Nottinghamshire, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Cleveland or South Wales. That is to the Met's credit, because London is more difficult to police.
<P>
The number of crimes has decreased marginally, which is also a good sign. However, in terms of the percentage of crimes detected by primary means, the Met is well down the league table in the bottom third, and it is bottom of the league in terms of the percentage of violent crimes detected by primary means--that is, by front-line policing rather than by information. One of the great failings revealed by the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, which is attributable not only to racism, was that the Met has been very bad, relatively speaking, at clearing up murders and violent crimes in London. Although, mercifully, there have recently been fewer murders in my constituency, there was a period during which there were a considerable number of murders every year, many of which were not solved. No one has been brought to justice for the murder of people whom I knew and whom the community valued who were stabbed in a club in front of 60 people.
<P>
I know that in response to the Lawrence inquiry, the Met is keen to give murders and other violent crimes a higher priority. That is absolutely necessary, because one reason that the Met has lacked credibility in recent years is that it has not been able to deliver the goods in response to violent crimes and homicides in London. It must do so if it is to have credibility with the public. It is all very well--and right--that it should try to reduce the number of burglaries and catch more burglars, but if when someone is knifed in the street, raped or killed it cannot bring someone to book, its credibility is seriously undermined. We have the worst record in the country in that regard, which is no credit to the Met. The Met needs more money and more officers qualified in the investigation of serious crime to deliver an appropriate response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick </B>(Poplar and Canning Town): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that that is not always the result of incompetence or inefficiency on the part of the Metropolitan police? I am told that in my constituency--the hon. Gentleman must have come across examples of this with his local constabulary--police officers are refused information by victims of stabbing, who tell them, "We'll sort this out ourselves." That is a local community culture in small enclaves. It is not fair to place all the blame at the door of the Metropolitan police service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I was not putting all the blame there at all. I support the hon. Gentleman's point. I have spent almost two years working with my local police to try to ensure that the people who killed a young man, a 17-year-old called Jamie Robe, in the Lower road in August of the year before last, are brought to book. Thanks to a lot of work by the police, and, I hope, the help that I and others--often without revealing their identity--have been able to give them, five people have now been committed for trial at the Old Bailey. Others may still be committed. We have had terrible trouble getting people to say anything, because they have been terrified--rightfully, because some of those who appear to have been involved are nasty bits of work, who would have made the lives of anyone who was known to have said anything hell.
<P>
I do not want to exaggerate, but that is why witness protection issues are hugely important. The police do not yet think that witness protection mechanisms are sufficient. Although, to their credit, the Government are trying to make progress on that, it is a big issue. However, that is not a justification for the Met being so much worse than any other force in the country. I cannot believe that in Gorton, in Manchester, which is not far from where I was born, or in Handsworth, in Birmingham, or down by the river in Tyneside, life is so much easier that people are willing to grass, as it were, on anyone who has committed a crime. People often feel intimidated in urban areas.
<P>
The remaining figures are not so dramatic. We are nearly at the bottom of the list for the percentage of burglaries detected by primary means, but we perform poorly on the number of crimes generally detected by primary means by police officers. Only two forces in the country have a worse strike rate per officer--bizarrely, in a way, those are Hertfordshire and Surrey. Those are tests of how well the Met is doing, and my umbrella question is: what is the Home office, which is responsible for standards of policing, doing to ensure that both the Met and the MPA will be able to deliver a more efficient and effective police force, that gives better value for money?
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman sought the reason, or himself thought of the reason, for the low rate of detection in Surrey and Hertfordshire. Might it not be that the perpetrators of crime in Surrey and Hertfordshire do not come from those areas, which makes clearing up crime rather more difficult?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I was not aware that any criminals stopped at county boundaries or other local authority boundaries to ensure that they did not leave their patch. In fact, I have first-hand evidence that the opposite is the case. Before I was elected to the House, I was a youth leader in south London. Some of those in groups of which I was the leader regularly got on the Greenline bus to Kent for their days out because they would find richer pickings in the leafy suburbs and nice towns and villages of Kent than they would down the Old Kent road.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) is right; of course what he says is true, but I do not know whether it is the reason. Hon. Members representing constituencies in Hertfordshire and Surrey might argue that there is another reason, which is to do with the funding of their forces. I know that it is generally felt by local authorities in the home counties that they are under financial pressure adequately to service their police forces. Perhaps we will touch on that when we discuss the change in the Met's boundaries, because that has a funding implication.
<P>
I should like to mention one other important set of statistics--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appeal again for a little more courtesy to the speaker. I am allowing a wide debate on this clause. Although the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is going slightly wider in the detail that he is giving than is strictly in accordance with the clause, it is helpful to the Committee to allow a wide-ranging debate at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton. I am trying to remain in order by talking about effective and efficient policing, but I will always be guided by you.
<P>
The other matter, which is clearly a test of effectiveness and efficiency, is the number of complaints that have been made against a force and the number that have been substantiated. Of course London has a larger population than the rest of the country, but the truth is that the number of complaints made against the Met in the last year for which figures are compiled is hugely greater than for any other force in the country. The only forces with more than 1,000 complaints in that same year were Avon and Somerset with just over 1,000, Sussex with just over 1,000, Greater Manchester with 2,000 odd, Merseyside with 2,000 odd, West Midlands with 1,500, and the Met with more than 8,000, of which 236 were substantiated. The Met is the only force in the country by miles with substantiated complaints running into three figures. Clearly, justified complaints are regularly made about policing in the Met at a level that is not reflected anywhere else in the country.
<P>
That does not mean that we do not all understand that policing in the capital city is more difficult. Of course it is more difficult, but whether the ratio is of population to the number of complaints or population to the number of substantiated complaints, the Met is way ahead. For me and for my constituents, one of the tests of whether the Met is efficient and effective is the number of complaints against it--which should be relatively few--and the proportion of those which are substantiated, which should be small.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I do not want to detract from the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but surely he should add that about a quarter of police officers in the country serve in the Metrolitan police force. The size of population and the size of police force must be reflected in the level of complaints.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I think that I took that into account in what I said. Certainly if one scales down the figures in proportion to the size of force and size of population, the Met is still way ahead. An efficient and effective police force does not regularly have complaints upheld against it. We must drive down those figures, because the more we drive them down, the more we will drive up public confidence in the police.
<P>
Many of my constituents have very little confidence in the police. They regularly tell me that they do not see police officers very often, and increasingly they regard them as driving around in cars rather than being out on the street--we must judge whether we think that that is appropriate. Moreover, they often find that the police do not resolve crimes when they report them. According to the Metropolitan force, its officers spend about 55 per cent. of their time on the streets as opposed to behind their desks or inside. That is quite a good figure. However, we must not be complacent. Ours is traditionally a great police force that has excellent people working for it; but, like the rest of us, it must be held to account to make sure that it does its job better.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That leads me to the last issue that I want to raise in which, more directly, the ball is at the Government's feet, as it were. Over the past four years, police funding in London has been reduced by 4 per cent. Over the same period, police officer numbers have gone down considerably, not up. Some 25 per cent. of the police force have more than 25 years' service, which means that they are eligible for retirement in the next five years. We could face a very large number of people leaving, because people in the police service have a 30-year career, at the end of which they leave. The share of money that comes to the Metropolitan police from the taxpayers' budget has in the past few years reduced from 29 per cent. to 22 per cent. That is very nearly one third less. The Commissioner, the senior police management team at New Scotland Yard and consultative groups in our constituencies have all made it clear that they want the funding restored.
<P>
Ours is the worst police service in the country when it comes to a reduction in numbers. Since Labour came to power in 1997, there are 571 fewer police officers. In addition, we are seeing a fall in police funding in real terms--for only the second time in 20 years, according to Parliamentary answers. Given those factors, I hope that the Government realise that to deliver an effective and efficient police force before and after the MPA comes into force next year, they will have to put more funding into the police force.
<P>
The figures show clearly that almost every police division in London now has fewer police than when the Government came to power. I have a list: Charing Cross has 108 fewer, Barnet and Hertsmere 59, Battersea 44, Wandsworth 42, Ealing 41, Hammersmith 35, Kingston 32, Brixton 32 and Croydon 32; Barkingside has 31 fewer, Kilburn 31, Islington 30, Bromley and Orpington 28, Whitechapel 28, Ilford 28, Marylebone 26, Paddington 26, and there are 25 fewer in Heathrow, Chiswick and Havering.
<P>
<B>Ms Karen Buck </B>(Regent's Park and Kensington, North): The hon. Gentleman mentioned Marylebone's figures. Two weeks ago I was talking to the divisional commander of Marylebone about the implications of the settlement. He reminded me that once again, for the second year, we are talking about changes in an establishment figure that has never been reached. He is completely unconcerned, as are other divisional commanders in my area, because the establishment figure bore no relation to the number of police on the beat.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I would be surprised if he was completely unconcerned. In my divisions, the establishment figures have regularly been reached--we have not fallen short. Over the years, there have been about 225 police on the establishment in Southwark, Peckham and Walworth.
<P>
The hon. Lady leads me to my next, and final, point.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I think that the intervention of the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) was entirely fair. It is worth exploring whether the establishment figures are real, realistic or arbitrary. In order to have an element of balance in this very interesting debate, could any of those shortfall numbers be compensated for by greater discharge of duty by civilians?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The answer is that of course they could. The police have been trying to transfer people from uniformed duties to civilian duties, although that process has not been completed. I remember, before I was elected to the House of Commons, going to see someone who had been charged and was being held at Peckham police station. A uniformed police officer spent most of the night typing out one charge sheet because his typing skills were of the one-finger variety, to put it generously. Competent police officers are still asked to do administration tasks for which they are not suitable.
<P>
I would be able to tell the hon. Member for Solihull that he had hit on a good point if I did not have the figures for civilian reductions in the Met. In the 18 months since the Government came to power, civilian numbers have reduced from 13,493 to 12,033--that is, by 1,460--and uniformed police officers have decreased in number from 26,667 to 26,106. Furthermore, a quarter of the Met are approaching retirement in the next five years and, to return to the point that was made by the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, there is a growing recruitment crisis.
<P>
The Commissioner has told me personally that the truth of the matter is that he needs to increase the numbers of graduates that are recruited, particularly from London and from black and Asian communities, because those numbers are decreasing. Unless that trend is reversed the Met will be in big trouble, because it will not have police officers of the necessary quality with the right qualifications for modern policing.
<P>
Yesterday I had lunch with two members of London First--Lord Shepherd and its chief executive, Stephen O'Brien. I put to them the idea that they could try to establish a graduate sponsorship scheme with London's corporate sector. That is what the armed services used to do--they paid for someone to go to university in return for his spending five years in the services. ICT and large employers operated similar schemes. I suggested that in addition to fellowships and mentoring, which the Met has already looked at, the London community could say to young people, "We will support and encourage you through school, college and university, in return for which we ask you to join the Met for five years' minimum service so that you can give back to London something of what London has given to you."
<P>
London's police service will have decreasing numbers of officers and be less effective and efficient if it is not properly funded--the Government must deal with that --and if it is not given the ability to recruit the people that it needs. I hope that the Minister will assure us that London's policing budgets are not going to be cut when the MPA comes into existence, because they are being cut at the moment. The cuts should be reversed so that Londoners in all boroughs can look forward to more police, not fewer, and more civilians, not fewer, so that the Met can do a better job and not have to struggle as it does at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fitzpatrick:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he discussed with Lord Shepherd and Stephen O'Brien the possibility of a graduate scholarship scheme. I would be interested to know what their response was, because it appears to me that the way for the Metropolitan police to become more effective is through properly trained officers who spend a lifetime detecting crime and learning their craft. A five-year tenure seems to be an insufficient contribution to the police service in terms of increasing its efficiency or reducing crime statistics.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is a perfectly good point. The question is how to get people into the police service. At the moment, it is clear from the figures that it is increasingly difficult to recruit people. The number of recruits is decreasing, and the level of their qualifications is declining to below the standard of five GCSEs or A-levels. How is that to be reversed?
<P>
There are more graduates and more universities in London than ever before. Interest in the police service should be aroused in young people at school. They should then be given financial help--particularly those who might not consider the police because they cannot consider going to university--and finally given a financial incentive to stay. It may be possible to get them to sign up only for five years, but it is to be hoped that they would stay on because the police service needs people with experience. We do not want people to do it for just five years; if we can get them in and they see that it is a rewarding career and that policing is effective and competent, I hope that they will stay. The two people to whom I referred said yesterday that they were going to consider the idea. They saw it as something that the business community could do--it would not be a complete answer, but it would be a recognition of the fact that we have a big recruitment problem and that unless we do something collectively, we are likely to have an under-resourced and under-qualified London police force.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): With regard to recruitment, one of the main differences between the project to get graduates to enter the force for five years and the short-service commissions that were offered by the armed forces is that in the latter case, graduates would come in as officers. Does the hon. Gentleman think that it would be a good idea for there to be direct entry for graduates into an officer class in the police force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not want to be distracted into areas where I am less competent. My hunch is that everyone is a better officer if they have been through the ranks first. That is my view of life in general. If one has scrubbed the floors, one is more likely to be competent at telling other people to scrub the floors, because one knows what the job involves. I am generally against people being parachuted in, although I am not saying that there should not be fast streams as there are in the civil service.
<P>
I am concerned with giving a detailed answer to the question so much as raising the questions asked by the Met. The Met says that its funding is going down, the number of people about to retire is increasing and the number of people coming in is dropping off. Perhaps I can end by giving some telling figures. The number of applicattions to the Met has decreased from 7,200 in 1995-96 to just under 3,000 in 1998-99. Thus, the figure is half what it was four years ago. Moreover, the percentage of applicants joining has doubled. According to the police, that means that they are having to take people at a standard at which they would not have taken them four years ago. They do not have the quality of applicant that they had, so they are obliged to take people at a lower standard. They do not want to do that. They say that they are taking on people whom they would prefer not to take because they are not adquately qualified.
<P>
There are severe concerns about providing an efficient and effective police service in London. I hope that the Minister can give us some reassurance so that the Met will feel that under the MPA it can have a healthy future with the officers and civilians that it needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Mr. Winterton, you were extremely forbearing when I spoke on clause 207 stand part, and I do not propose to test your forbearance by speaking for a similar length on clause 208. I simply want to add three observations to what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said.
<P>
First, the official Opposition have exactly the same preoccupation with police numbers and funding as the hon. Gentleman. There is a Supply day debate on Thursday, as he and the Minister will know, and we intend to address these matters then. Unless Committee members are going to be released to take part in that debate, we will be meeting upstairs while it is taking place--I shall certainly be here. The subject is one that my party takes seriously.
<P>
My second observation derives from personal history. Long ago--by long ago I mean in the late 1960s and early 1970s--I employed in the private sector a retired policeman who had been the chief constable of three counties and the first inspector of constabulary, a role that was set up under the Police Act 1964. I well remember his saying that so far as he was concerned, as a senior policeman he would like every police recruit to do a year's service in London as part of their training because the acceleration of their experience as policemen would be so dramatic--they would have experiences in a year in London that they might not have in five or 10 years in a provincial force. That point underlines the significance of policing London, to which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred.
<P>
Thirdly I should like to add a footnote that may not arise in Thursday's debate on the Floor of the House. The hon. Gentleman alluded to the chronological factor, and pointed out that a significant proportion of the Metropolitan police will retire in the immediate years to come. The Church of England is familiar with such circumstances, with the retirement of elderly priests and ensuring recruitment problems.
<H4><center>12.45 pm</center></H4>
<P>
At least once in the House I have aired another consideration that is relevant to the hon. Gentleman's argument. In the 1970s, when Labour members were last in office, police pay was neglected until the setting up of the Edmund Davies inquiry. As a consequence of that neglect, a large number of sergeants, sometimes in their middle and late 30s, left the police force because of inadequate pay. The new Government of 1979 not only honoured the Edmund Davies recommendations but provided a substantial increase in public funding for the police. A flood of recruits came into the force from 1979 onwards, but there was a significant shortage of experienced and trained sergeants to provide practical leadership and training for those recruits. The benefits of the extra numbers were therefore not as full as they should have been.
<P>
I am not sure which Minister will respond to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but I look forward to hearing a response, and believe that the Committee is in debt to the hon. Gentleman for having aired the subjects to which he referred.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The clause is simple, and ensures that the principle of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "securing the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 which is the current objective of all police authorities, shall apply to the Metropolitan police authority. Characteristically, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey introduced his speech with a declared intention to speak briefly and then spoke for more than 30 minutes. Despite all the performance indicators that he quoted, he presumably does not think that we should consider performance indicators of efficient and effective political speeches. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that there will be appropriate occasions on which, to debate the Metropolitan police, their performance and their achievements. When we do so, it will be right to consider a range of indicators, some of which the hon. Gentleman quoted and some of which he conspicuously did not. Notably, his long speech contained no reference to actual reductions in reported crime achieved by the Metropolitan police. We should all be pleased about those reductions, and should give the Metropolitan police full credit for them. It is necessary to debate some issues relating to resources, numbers, efficiency and effectiveness in reducing crime, but they should all be considered at an appropriate time. I do not believe that now is the appropriate time. The Government are simply transferring into the Bill the existing requirement for every police authority in the country so that it applies to the Metropolitan police authority. It is an obvious and sensible requirement, and I hope that the clause will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I think that the Minister owes the Committee an explanation of when in its debates he answer questions about resources, recruitment and manpower.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> It is not for this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Government Whip says from a sedentary position that it is not for the Committee to discuss those issues. Hon. Members are passing a law that provides that it will be the duty of the Metropolitan police authority to be efficient and effective. We are asked to sign up to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Perhaps I should remind the hon. Gentleman of what I have already pointed out. The duty to ensure an efficient and effective police service already applies. It applies to the police authority for London--currently, the Home Secretary. All that the clause does is transfer that obligation to the new Metropolitan police authority that we are creating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I think that all members of the Committee know that. We are debating the setting up of the new Metropolitan police authority, and its duty to be efficient and effective. Is not that the occasion on which to debate whether it has the resources to be efficient and effective--whether it has sufficient Home Office support? If the Minister is telling the Committee that he refuses to debate the matter, he will not hear the last of it. If he, as the representative of the Home Secretary in Committee, is going to duck questions about why our funding in London is being cut, I will ensure that as many people as possible outside the House of Commons hear about that. It is an embarrassment to the Government that they are not funding the police in London properly.
<P>
If the Minister tells me that he will return before the end of our debate on the police today with the answers to our questions I will hold my fire. If not, he does the Committee a disservice. Londoners will not understand why, at the best opportunity that we have had to debate policing in London, Ministers have bottled out, hidden the facts and hidden the truth. That is unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Not only did the hon. Gentleman go on at great length in his speech, he has clearly failed to listen. There are many, many appropriate opportunities to discuss the performance of the Metropolitan police. As the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said there will be such an opportunity this Thursday on the Floor of the House. I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will be there to participate in that debate.
<P>
The clause is about transferring a technical obligation from the existing police authority for London to the new one. It did not deserve a lengthy speech lasting half an hour or more from the hon. Gentleman, including selective statistics about which he should be ashamed. Rather than issuing hollow threats in Committee, he should ensure that there is a proper, mature and balanced debate about the performance of the Metropolitan police--its successes as well as its shortcomings.
<P>
I remind him of the matter before the Committee, which is a small, technical clause transferring a function from one police authority to another. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now come down to earth and recognise that. We can have debates on policing in London in other, more appropriate locations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister may try to run away from the issue, but I will not let him. The truth is that all my figures came from the latest Audit Commission report on the police and fire services. I was not selective; I did not cite some of them and leave out others. All the figures came from the same report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Crime rates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Crime rates were not in the report. I am criticising not the Met but the Government. The Minister still has not answered the question. If he tells us that later today, during debate on one of the new clauses, amendments or clause, we will get some answers, that will be sufficient. But if he is saying that the Committee considering the Bill to set up the GLA and transfer to it responsibility for policing in London will not hear one contribution from Ministers to explain how they will ensure that the Met is efficient and effective, that is a dereliction of duty. Londoners will not understand that; they will regard it as a failure on the Government's part. The Government are hiding a huge embarrassment, because they know perfectly well that they are in difficulty on the funding of the Met, its personnel and other such issues.
<P>
On the point about Thursday, as the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said, if the Committee is sitting, as scheduled, at the same time as the debate occurs on the Floor of the House, the Minister knows perfectly well that some of us may have to be here rather than there. I assure him that my hon. Friends will make the same case about the Government's attitude to police funding and numbers. Even if the Minister runs away here to hide from the issues, Ministers will not be able to do so in the Chamber.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 208 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I allowed a very wide debate to take place on clause 208. As the Minister correctly pointed out, it was a narrowly drawn, technical clause, but I felt it appropriate to allow the airing of the sort of issues that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised. I wish to make it amply clear that I shall not use my discretion in such a way when we come to debate other clauses in this part of the Bill which are specific, and I hope that members of the Committee will direct their remarks specifically to those clauses.
<P>
Clause 209 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton, and I also welcome the clause. It deals with openness, which is part of the rationale behind the Metropolitan Police Authority. We should acknowledge that openness has been significantly increased in recent years in the Metropolitan police force, and in forces around the country, through the publication of the type of report to which my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred. Audit Commission reports, for example, detail performance statistics comparators so that we can see what is happening in our police forces, and that is a welcome development.
<P>
Here in London, the Metropolitan police commissioner has been far more open than his predecessors in talking about the operations of his force and the need to crack down on corruption. I believe that he has the support of all members of the Committee for such actions. The clause builds on improvements in the Metropolitan police force. Giving the MPA the power of scrutiny with public meetings and published documents, is a welcome development. I am sure that that will help to restore public confidence in the Metropolitan police force. Such confidence has been damaged over recent years, particularly in relation to the Stephen Lawrence tragedy.
<P>
There is one specific point that I wish to raise with regard to the improved openness that Home Office Ministers are proposing. I refer to police officers who are freemasons. The Home Secretary and the Select Committee on Home Affairs have been doing a considerable amount of work on the matter. I have no special knowledge of the subject. My first and only contact with freemasonry was a very enjoyable visit to the masonic lodge in Surbiton last summer, when I was greeted with great hospitality and warmth by the freemasons. I was keen to go because it was an open day--their first ever. The freemasons answered my questions in detail, and showed great willingness to address the concerns that I had after reading books such as "The Brotherhood". They genuinely believe that they have nothing to hide.
<P>
The Government's developments on openness with regard to freemasony are welcome. The progress made so far has been important. Will the MPA have powers to consolidate that progress and take it further? We welcome the establishment of internal registers of police officers who are freemasons. We welcome the fact that they will be open to chief constables to peruse. We welcome the fact that broad numerical data from those registers will be published. Are the MPA and police authorities across the country, on track to establish registers and publish data next month? The Home Secretary promised the Select Committee that it would be done by the end of April 1999.
<P>
Will chief constables who are freemasons have to publish that information? If they are the ones reading the registers, we would like to know whether they are also freemasons. How far has the Government's thinking gone with respect to publishing the registers in due course? We understand that the issues are complex--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let us have courtesy to the speaker and to the Chair. It is increasingly difficult, with the hubbub--perhaps immediate pre-lunch euphoria--not to allow members of the Committee who are not speaking to get carried away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton. I was asking whether the Minister could tell the Committee how far the Government's thinking has advanced on publishing the registers, so that the information that will allegedly be available from April 1999 will come out into the open.
<P>
It is my understanding of the Bill that the MPA will have the power to follow through the admirable progress that has been made in this regard so far, and I should like the Minister's confirmation. I hope that she will be able to do so, because we believe that such openness will strengthen the police, public confidence in the police and, indeed, freemasonry.
<P>
