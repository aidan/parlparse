<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I bid good morning to all members of the Committee. I gather that the debates have been very good natured and I have no doubt that they will continue to be so. The clause is highly complicated and technical, but I know that I can rely upon all hon. Members of both sides of the Committee who contribute to the debate always to be entirely within order. I know that my advice will be heeded.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton, and welcome to the Chair. I suspect that you may well find yourself in the Guinness Book of Records, because the list of chairmen for this Committee is possibly the longest ever and it might make an entertaining entry. I am sure that we shall enjoy sitting under your chairmanship and I know that, should we stray from order, we shall be brought back immediately into order. [Hon Members: "Shame".] I suppose that it would be an intellectual game to see whether one can go out of order without being pulled up, but we will try not to do that.
<P>
It will be a great comfort to you, Mr. Winterton, to know that you have missed the easy part of pensions, the part that we could all understand. Last Tuesday we were debating the perennial issues of pensioners who work and child benefit. It was noticeable, however, that Government Members were not so involved in debate on those issues: there was a diminution in their contributions after the social security and child support discussions.
<P>
Today we enter the difficult part. It is boring, ridden with jargon and highly technical. I can tell from the reaction of my team working on it that it is of mind-boggling and eye-glazing complexity. Front Benchers on both sides have agreed that it would be useful if, from time to time, we could use hi-tech equipment in the Committee to produce illustrations of our proposals. The proposals under discussion would be more easily understood in terms of figures, tables and charts than they are in words, however lucidly and clearly we express ourselves.
<P>
When I was preparing for this morning's debate it occurred to me that it might be an occasion on which we could usefully stand procedure on its head and have the clause stand part debate before discussing the amendments, to make sure we understood what the Government were trying to do. I will make as good a fist of it as I can. I do not want to steal the glory of the Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Rooker), but to introduce the amendments, I need to try to explain what we believe the Government's proposals to be. If I am wrong I shall no doubt be corrected. We all wait--not exactly with bated breath, because we would probably all expire if we did that--to hear the Government's own explanation of their proposals.
<P>
The clause is the meat of the changes made to pensions by the Bill. It provides for a new form of state provision which will replace over time the state earnings-related pension scheme, which the Labour party in its manifesto promised would remain. The manifesto stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Labour will retain SERPS as an option for those who wish to remain in it. We will also seek to develop the administrative structure of SERPS so as to create a 'citizenship pension'."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps that is what the Government are talking about, but it is not a way forward that we would take.
<P>
It is only fair to the Committee to make sure that the Government understand that, in principle, we want people to be encouraged to make their own provision rather than relying on the state. However, we recognise that there is a debate between those who believe that the state should provide all pensions, or most pensions, and those who wish to see a much higher proportion of pensions provided by the private sector. Although it is not my intention to go into the philosophy and principles, we need to recognise that some people in the community want to rely on the state and others want to rely on private provision.
<P>
The problem that we have with the clause is that it forces more people to rely on the state. Our amendments try to help the Government produce a state second pension that fits better with the desire of those people who wish to rely on the state, but makes better provision for those who wish to move on to private provision--perhaps through stakeholder or occupational pension. However, many of our comments are about the interaction with stakeholder pension. Although we are talking about the formula for the second state pension in this debate, all the issues involving stakeholder tend to come in so I should like to discuss the implications of stakeholder.
<P>
The stakeholder pension is geared to helping people save for a private pension when they have an income between £9,500 and £21,000. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will agree, that on that sort of income a family is financially stretched; every penny of the budget is carefully looked after and monitored to make sure that there is no overspending and it is a strain to have to put an extra £20 a month away. We should admire those who can do so, are determined to save for their future, and understand the need for long-term savings so that they can have an easier retirement. However, we also have to recognise that many of the people on such incomes are the least financially sophisticated. Many members of the Committee, whatever their income, probably agree that they, too, are fairly financially unsophisticated when it comes to pensions. Pensions are of huge complexity. I understand that at least 12 different tax regimes are involved in pension provision across the board, and I can quite understand why people say that they do not want to think about it, that it is all far too complicated, and that retirement is too far away. However, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will also agree that we want to see people focus much more on providing for themselves in their old age.
<P>
One of the problems with stakeholder, which we pointed out as it was going through the Committee last year, is that it will take a long time before the amount saved in a stakeholder pension exceeds what people can get on state benefits at present. If one tots up minimum income guarantee, housing benefit and council tax, on stakeholder alone it would be a long time before anybody saved enough to equalise that.
<P>
If we also look at the combination of state second pension and basic state pension, the Library has calculated that it would be 2028 before anyone would equal the minimum income guarantee. Those who are financially unsophisticated will have to make an arithmetical calculation to assess whether they should bother to put any long-term savings into the state second pension or stakeholder pension rather than continue to rely on state benefits. We must always bear that fact in mind when we talk about the formula and how people are encouraged to save.
<P>
The Government have not picked up on the opportunity to simplify. As I have already said many times, and will undoubtedly say again, the Bill complicates the pensions regime--it does not simplify it. It is a legal minefield. Pensions lawyers, the pensions ombudsman, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority and the Financial Services Authority are all trying to resolve pensions disputes and complaints. There is a growing legion of unhappy consumers of pensions in both the state and private sectors. Everyone, unless they are tax planners, actuaries or accountants, is switched off by pensions because they are so complex. The Government have the opportunity to create a clean sheet on pensions, but they are complicating it further. The formula that they have produced would make it still more complicated.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Winterton. We are talking now about clause 28, but many of the amendments relate to clause 29. If the basic concept is kept to the fore, it is not too complicated. We know that low earners, carers and those with a disrupted employment pattern will be treated for state second pension as if they had earned £9,500 a year. Those who earn more than that will have an earnings accrual rate to ensure that moderate earners are better off than under SERPS, that high earners get the same and that those who contract out will have an earnings-related rebate. That concept is simple.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> And fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> And fair, as my hon. Friend says. In practice it looks technical to the lay person, but the concept is simple and that should be kept at the forefront of our minds.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The concept of any pension is simply to save money for one's retirement, but the devil is in the detail and it is to that that I hope to take a forensic scalpel to show how complex the second state pension is and how it interacts particularly with the stakeholder pension. Our proposal is intended to help the Government to simplify what is unnecessarily complex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): The principle of saving for one's retirement is simple, but the band of earners about whom we are talking have to make a choice. Does not the fact that the detail is so unbelievably complicated make that almost impossible?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My hon. Friend is right. It is very difficult and the most basic problem is whether it is better not to save at all and to rely instead on state benefit. As I go into greater detail, members will understand the problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I want to get to grips with this. People will have no choice. They will be pushed into a second state pension or a stakeholder pension. They will not be able to say, "I am having none of this. I am not earning very much at the moment, so I shall rely on the basic state pension."
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. I have slaved over the problem for more hours than I care to think about, so I hope to explain it in a way that even I can understand. However good the Government's intentions, the problem is the interaction between the schemes, and whether it is financially beneficial to save with a state second pension or a stakeholder pension, or whether one should rely on state benefits. Members of the Committee will know from the number of interventions that have been made that comprehending that interaction will be difficult. Indeed, an overhead projector would be useful.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Those who earn between £9,500 and approximately £21,000--I hope that the Committee will allow me to use round figures--will, in effect, be shoehorned into a stakeholder pension. I have already illustrated that a stakeholder pension is not necessarily the best bet for people with that sort of income. Stage 2 of the proposals will push people into stakeholder pensions. The other problem is that stage 2 will act as a disincentive to those who earn £9,500 or less and those with credits; they will see no point in earning more. Those earning £9,500 get the best deal. Above that, especially in stage 2, people will receive no credit for their extra earnings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is misleading. The rebates will be earnings-related. Those leaving the state second pension who earn £10,000 or £11,000 a year will take with them an earnings-related contracted out rebate. A flat-rate incentive is built into the system, but earnings-related contracted out rebates will be accrued to help fund the stakeholder pension. It is not true to say that there is no incentive.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman also tell me that there is no incentive to stay in the state second pension in stage 2?
<P>
I said earlier that people who believe that the state should provide will wish to stay in the state sector. We do not necessarily believe that that is the best thing for them, but if they want to do it, they should have that choice. People who earn more than £9,500 are being shoehorned into the stakeholder pension. That figure is a cut-off; it is a disincentive to people earning more. When the right hon. Gentleman comes to answer, I shall be happy if he wants to dissect that point. We need to have a clause stand part debate first, so that we can understand what the Government are trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): We Conservative Members are grateful that my hon. Friend understands the provision. However, so that I can struggle on with it, will she tell me whether it is true that people who earn up to £9,500 are on a state second pension, irrespective of their contributions, but that in the stakeholder bracket between £9,500 and £21,000 people can remain in the state second pension but no extra money will be coming down the track? Is it true that if people do as the Minister suggest and opt out, they will have a slightly better pension, but that if they earn more than £21,000 a year they will be on their own?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> If my hon. Friend will bear with me, I shall try to explain. If what I suggest is wrong, I hope that the Minister can persuade us otherwise.
<P>
Disincentives seem to be built into the formula. Indeed, it has almost the same disincentive effect as the tapers that we have discussed in Committees over the years, such as the original family credit, the working families tax credit and capital disregards. I do not want to detain the Committee by analysing all the disincentives, but I shall explain the order in which I shall speak to the amendments.
<P>
I shall speak first to amendments Nos. 201 and 198, which form a fundamental part of our proposals. I shall subsequently discuss amendments Nos. 188, 251, 252, 191, 192, 253, 254 and 195. The third group of amendments includes amendments Nos. 229, 230, 232 and 235. Amendment No. 196 is, understandably, grouped with amendment No. 169, as they both relate to stage 2 of the state second pension. Amendment No. 196 is crucial to our proposals, and it will become clear why it is so grouped. I apologise, but that is the only way in which to--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 196 is not part of this group. It relates to clause 29. The hon. Lady may refer to it briefly in passing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I accept your guidance, and shall try to explain how the amendments tie together.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 201 and 198 would reduce the threshold figure, the top of band 1, to use the technical jargon, from £9,500 to £8,500. They form part of the overall package, of which we offer two versions, to smooth the reduction in accrual rates. Accrual rates act as a disincentive both to earn more than £9,500 and to remain in the state second pension scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will my hon. Friend give the Committee a short seminar on accrual rates?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have a horrible feeling that the Chairman would probably not allow that.
<P>
Under clause 29(4), the Government propose accrual rates of 40 per cent., 10 per cent. and 20 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> My hon. Friend is mistaken. The accrual rates are 40 aa2N, 10 aaN/2 and 20 aaN. There is a significant difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lait:</B> You are absolutely right, but for the sake of--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, I am not absolutely right; the hon. Gentleman is.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> You are absolutely right, Mr. Winterton. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to point out that I did not present the figures in their entirety: I was trying to make it as simple as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am trying to understand the table on page 26. Will my hon. Friend explain 3LET 2QEF, please?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Yes, I will be happy to. It may help if the initials are understood. I do not want to appear to be showing off, but I remember what they mean because I wrote them down. QEF is the qualifying earnings factor. In money terms, it is 52 acLEL--the lower earnings limit, which is currently £66 per week. So QEF is £3,432. LET, the lower earnings threshold, is £9,500, which our amendments Nos. 201 and 198 would adjust to £8,500. The upper earnings limit, which I suspect will not come into our debate, is £500 a week, which equates to £26,000 a year. I shall use it as an element of the amendments. I hope that that helps a little.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 201 and 198 attempt to reduce the top of band 1 to £8,500. This is part of the overall package to smooth the reduction of accrual rates because, as I have said, the Bill is unfair on people earning more than £9,500 once the state second pension goes to stage 2: their accrual rate on the marginal income above that level appears to be zero, and the point is to get everyone into stakeholder pensions.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend is being indulgent with us in allowing interventions. Can you tell the Committee what stage 2 is?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the hon. Lady can tell us what stage 2 is.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Stage 2 is a crucial factor in our amendments. It comes in when the state second pension becomes a flat rate pension, and is yet again part of the attempt to get everyone into a stakeholder pension. Amendment No. 196, to which I shall refer only in passing, proposes the abolition of stage 2, so that people have the genuine option of remaining on the state second pension or moving into a stakeholder pension. I confess that we are not wedded to the idea of having £8,500 as the top of band 1. We want the Government to think a little further about smoothing out the humpback structure of benefits for people who stay in the state second pension.
<P>
I move on to the large group of amendments, beginning with amendment No. 188. We have not yet had a clause stand part debate, so I should explain the effect of the Government's proposals. Let us examine table 1 on page 26. For band 1, it states "Not exceeding LET", which hon. Members will remember refers to the lower earnings threshold, and the percentage is given as "40 + 2N". In real terms, someone earning up to £9,500 would receive a pension of £2,427.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Band 2, which exceeds LET but is not three times the LET minus twice the qualified earnings factor, is given as 10 plus N/2. That leads to a pension of £3,641, or, for someone earning at the top of the band, £21,636. The upper earnings limit comes in for band 3, which is three times LET minus twice QEF, expressed in percentage terms as 20 plus N. In figures, that works out as £4,514.
<P>
Stage 2 is set out in table 2 on page 27. Without going into all the initials again, it means that a stakeholder earning at the top of band 1 at £9,500 would be credited as--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I apologise for interrupting the hon. Lady--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman can clarify all this, I shall be happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady is right that it would have been better to have a clause stand part debate from the outset. However, if she or other members of the Committee want to talk about figures, they should ignore table 1 and concentrate on table 2. Table 1 is in the Bill only because from this April the full effects of changes made in social security legislation in 1986--the Fowler changes--start to transist for accrual rates down from the present 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. We are not interfering with that. At the bottom of page 27, the Bill makes it clear that N is 0.5 for each tax year. That is transitional for 10 years--0.5 per cent. per year for 10 years. Our proposals build on the top of that framework so that people do not lose out. Table 2 therefore is not stage 2. Stage 2 is flat rate, as provided in subsection (6).
<P>
If the hon. Lady wishes to proceed more quickly with her amendments, I shall be happy to respond to them. We could have a more fruitful debate in respect of setting out the scene. Some of her comments were untrue. We need greater accuracy, but I do not want to pop up every moment to interrupt the hon. Lady. I repeat that table 2 is not stage 2.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have followed the debate carefully. As I said in my introductory remarks, this is a complex and highly technical part of the Bill. From my point of view, if the hon. Lady wishes to move her amendments, but range slightly wider, we could describe it as a stand part debate. I am happy for that to take place, but it may mean that I shall not wish to grant a stand part debate. The most constructive way in which to tackle this complicated part of the Bill is to have a stand part debate when discussing the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton. Your ruling is of great help to the Committee. [Hon. Members: "Very helpful."] I hear acclamation all round. We shall take full advantage of your guidance. I appreciate the Minister's--
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Offer.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I was about to say "correction". While I accept what the right hon. Gentleman said about table 1, table 2 would be as affected by our first long group of amendments as table 1. If he accepts that, we can proceed. The list of amendments is long to make our proposals consistent throughout the clause.
<P>
Stage 2 of the basic state pension will become a flat-rate accrual sum, but as the Minister said, people will receive rebates to make it more attractive. It will come in about five years after the state second pension has been introduced.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I find the hon. Lady's rear extremely attractive, but I should be grateful if she would address her remarks to the whole Committee and the Chair, not just to her colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I apologise, Mr. Winterton. I shall try to do better. Thank you for that compliment; it was worth all the pain and agony of the diet that I have been on since Christmas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): That is what I was just thinking.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It is always a pleasure to listen to my hon. Friend speak, which he will no doubt do in due course, by which time everyone will be fed up to the back teeth with my voice.
<P>
When stage 2 comes in, the accrual rate will become flat--about £2,427 a year. That will be introduced when the Government are satisfied that stakeholder is successful. For the first five years, when the state second pension is introduced, people will accrue their pension healthily. I do not argue with that, but why bother with stage 2? The Government will be putting on the pressure to get everyone into the stakeholder pension and we come back yet again to the balance between the minimum income guarantee and state benefits.
<P>
Having gone through--I hope, as clearly as possible--what I understand to be the Government's proposals, I now want to go into our proposals in much greater detail. I have explained why we want the band brought down to £8,500. Amendment No. 188 is our first attempt to amend the formula. We have deliberately drafted it in a way that fits in with the Government's approach--an approach that is not our gut reaction. As Conservatives, we like to simplify such matters and not make them too onerous. However, the Government have adopted a formulaic approach in the Bill, which is reflected in our amendments. The amendments propose a nicely bureaucratic, regulatory, rigid and complex arrangement, which should please the Government.
<P>
I have read out the formula and explained all the variables. We want to help people earning just over £9,500, which is the point at which the state second pension goes to stage two. Under the Government's proposals, the accrual rate on marginal income above that level is zero. We do not agree with that, so we have tabled probing amendments giving illustrative figures. We urge the Government to adopt a gradualist approach for accruals.
<P>
We would reduce the lower earnings threshold from £9,500 at current prices--let us use that figure and not argue about inflation--to £8,500. Earnings from the lower earning limit to £8,500 should be in band 1 and, as in the Bill, have a 40 per cent. accrual rate for the state second pension. That sum would amount to £5,068. Under amendments Nos. 251, 252, 353 and 254, band 2 would be the same as band 1, not twice the amount, as in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am trying to follow, but am finding it difficult. Can we not cut the Gordian knot and do away with all threshold problems? There could be a system of rebates along the lines that I proposed on Tuesday, which would get people into a funded system. As a result, we would not need all those problematic thresholds of £8,500 and £9,500.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have huge sympathy with my hon. Friend's proposal, which I would accept if we were the Government and I were sitting in the Minister of State's seat. Unfortunately, however, we are not in that position, and the Chairman would call me to order if I discussed my hon. Friend's suggestion. I am trying hard to stay in order as I would hate to incur the Chairman's wrath. We must deal with the Bill before us.
<P>
We are proposing that band 2 should be the same as band 1. I apologise for repeating myself, but the matter needs to be seen as a whole. The mechanism by which that would be done would change the formula for the top of band 2 and therefore also the bottom of band 3 from three times the lower earnings threshold minus two times the qualifying earnings factor, as in the Bill, to two times the lower earnings threshold minus one times the qualifying earnings factor.
<P>
There is nothing magic about that formula, which would yield the desired result of removing the hump. The 40 per cent. accrual factor would also be reduced to offset some of the cost of the higher accrual factor in the next band. Again, I must emphasise that the figures are indicative and have not been costed. The aim is purely to make the case for a more gradual slope in the reduction of the rate of accrual.
<P>
The result is that band 2 would add another £5,068, taking the individual's earnings up to £13,568. Under amendments Nos. 188 and 192, accrual rates in that band would be 20 per cent., not 10 per cent. as in the Bill. Under amendments Nos. 191 and 195, all earnings above £13,568 up to the upper earnings limit would accrue the state second pension at 10 per cent.
<P>
I shall pass over amendment No. 196, under which there would be no stage 2 of the state second pension. The Bill will hit hard those who earn just over £9,500. If hon. Members will bear with me, I shall revert to the figures as I understand them.
<P>
We propose that up to the top of band 1, that is, £9,500, the accrual would be £2,227. Up to the top of band 2--£21,636--it would be £3,848, which is a difference of £1,621. Up to the upper earnings level of £26,000 the accrual would be £4,284, which is an increase of £36. Perhaps I can compare that with what I understand to be the Government's figures. At £9,500, the Government propose an accrual of £2,427, which is some £200 greater than our proposal and is entirely covered by the difference between £9,500 and £8,500. Up to the top of band 2, the Government propose £3,641 compared with our figure of £3,848, so the Government's difference would be £1,314, as opposed to our difference of £1,621. In essence, our proposals would ease the hump. Up to £26,000, the Government propose £4,514 compared with our £4,284. The Government difference is therefore £873. I hope that that makes sense. We could do with an overhead projector setting out all the figures for hon. Members to see.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
I come now to a proposal which is, in essence, much more in accord with Conservative philosophy. It takes a much freer-flowing, less regulatory approach and does not rely on formulae to get us to where to want to go, which I am sure will be a great relief to my hon. Friends. The objective of our proposal is a simpler system. State second pension would not be an earnings-related pension. Instead, in the words of Professor Phil Agulnik of the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion at the London School of Economics and Political Science, it is rather like an increase in the basic pension, but with a 50-year time lag. It is another way of emphasising Labour's breach of its election pledge to keep SERPS.
<P>
As with our first proposal, amendments Nos. 228 and 229 would scrap stage 2 of the state second pension. Amendment No. 196 would also have the same effect, The cut-off between bands 1 and 2 would be retained at £9,500, but amendment No. 232 would scrap band 3 so that band 2 continued to the upper earnings limit. Amendment No. 230 would apply a 12.5 per cent. accrual rate to earnings in band 2. Amendment No. 235 is consequential and would make the proposal more coherent.
<P>
In practice, the amendments would achieve a straightforward system with just two earnings bands and two state second pension accrual rates--40 per cent. for band 1 and 12.5 per cent. for band 2. There would be no stage 2 and less upheaval and disruption for employers and the pensions industry. It would keep an earnings-related element in the state pension for those earning more than £9,500, and only higher earners would be worse off than under the Bill's proposals, because the accrual factor between £21,600 and the upper earnings limit would be 12.5 per cent. instead of 20 per cent. We would be doing Labour's job for them by keeping their pledge.
<P>
Amendment No. 234, which we shall discuss later, sets out the way in which our proposals would maintain an earnings-related element, unlike the stage 2 state second pension as proposed in the Bill. I intend to speak to that amendment at greater length when it is called.
<P>
The proposal incorporates the band 1 pension payments into the two-part state pension, so that it comprises the existing state retirement pension and the band 1 state second pension. Neither of those elements is related to earnings, so although they are distinct, they are in many ways the same. They are tax funded, not earnings related. We then treat separately the truly earnings-related element--the 12.5 per cent accrual on earnings in band 2--which we slightly mischievously refer to as the state earnings-related pension.
<P>
As with our first proposal, I want to make the second proposal in figures. It would mean that, up to £9,500, the accrual would be £2,427. That is the same as the Government's proposal. Up to the top of band 2, the accrual would be £3,944, which is a difference of £1,500, as opposed to the Government's difference between bands 1 and 2 of £1,314. Band 3 in our second option would accrue £4,490, which is a difference between bands 2 and 3 of £546, and the Government's proposal would be up to £4,514 in accrual with a difference of £873. Yet again, we are trying to take away the hump.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I am trying hard to follow the hon. Lady's amendments. If I am not mistaken, we are dealing with her third grouping of them, which includes amendment No. 232. That amendment seems to delete the third band, yet she has given figures for it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Indeed, I said that we would delete the third band, but had taken it up to the upper earnings limit, so a helpful calculation could still be made. I am sure that anyone in Committee who is not completely bog-eyed, brain dead and asleep will recognise that the figures are illustrative and try to deal with the interaction of the state second pension and stakeholder pension. Although we plan to vote on our second option, we do not say that it is the final answer. It is an approach to solving the problem of interaction.
<P>
Hon. Members will probably be grateful to hear that I shall stop speaking quite soon. The best way to sum up is to say that we believe that the Government's proposals are rigid, bureaucratic and, because they are constructed to push people towards stakeholder pensions, a positive disincentive to those who want to earn more than £9,500 and those who prefer to stay within the state provision. We want to encourage more people to provide for themselves, and have therefore tried to ease the transition to give them the choice between stakeholder pensions and state second pensions.
<P>
We must bear it in mind that many sensible people will say for the sake of their families that none of the proposals suits them, so they will have to rely on the minimum income guarantee, housing benefit and council tax benefit. Unless there is a huge change in the culture of people saving towards pensions, it will be many years under the Government's formula before anyone benefits from state pensions or stakeholder pensions. I hope that I have made my comments as clear as possible.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I advise the Committee that I am calling the Minister to reply because that will help both sides of the Committee and may reduce the need for subsequent speeches or interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> In seeking to catch your eye, Mr. Winterton, I am not trying to curtail debate or prevent hon. Members from speaking. I am not winding up the debate. It may be unusual, but I should like to cite Cm 4573, which is the report by the Government Actuary, as it is relevant to the Bill. I shall return to that in a few moments. In the past, I have sent members of the Committee copious background material with many graphs and charts, but this document was not included. Bearing in mind the comments of the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), it might be useful to refer to such material.
<P>
I pay tribute to the hon. Lady for attempting to get her head around such a complex issue. I am fairly new to the Department, but I have had more time than she has to get my head around state second pensions. I understand why she wants to change our proposals. Towards the end of her speech, she said that she wanted to fit in with the Tory philosophy. Under her amendments, more money would be given to the well-off at the cost of the poorer-earning worker. That may be an unfair description of Tory philosophy, but that would be the effect of the amendments. My appeal is to Opposition Back Benchers.
<P>
The Government's strategic philosophy, clarified in last year's legislation on stakeholder pensions, is to move from the present provision for pensioners, which is 60 per cent. state, 40 per cent. private, to 60 per cent. private, 40 per cent. state. That is our strategic objective and all changes should be viewed in that light. In a way it fits in with some of the issues raised by Back Benchers, although for slightly different reasons. The thrust of the hon. Lady's amendments is to provide incentives for some people to remain in the state sector with a state second pension rather than to provide incentives for people above a certain earnings level to withdraw from the state sector and have a stakeholder pension for their second pension. It is all part of the shift in the proportions from 60:40 to 40:60. That will not happen at once; we are talking about 40 to 50 years.
<P>
Under the hon. Lady's amendments, more would be given to moderate and higher earners at the expense of lower earners below the £9,500 threshold. Obviously, we want the state second pension to be redistributive towards lower earners. They may have care responsibilities, a long-term disability or may have had a lifetime of low earnings. We have made it clear that we want to help that group, which explains why we propose to even out the incentives later on.
<P>
If someone comes out of the state second pension into a stakeholder pension, earnings-related contributions will be relevant. You may want the morning off, Mr. Winterton, when we debate the contracted-out formula--which has not yet been published--at a later sitting. It is not a cut-off. The hon. Lady used the word "hump" several times--I kept wondering where it was. To put it crudely and in stark terms, so that people can understand, the hump seemed to refer to the fact that we were redistributing too much towards the lower earners, compared with the higher earners.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The thrust of table 2 in clause 29 is to keep the system as SERPS-neutral as possible. We are having to do that while SERPS is on the move. SERPS started in 1978, was changed in 1986 and changed again in 1995. Some of the changes in the legislation that created it, as in all pension legislation, were not to come into effect for several years. That is the nature of the beast. As I said, the single rate for SERPS, which is currently 25 per cent. for all earnings, is to be phased to 20 per cent. over a 10-year period, by reducing the accrual rate by 0.5 per cent. a year from this April, at the start of the new financial year. That was legislated for donkey's years ago and we seek to accommodate that change. We are not dealing with a static situation.
<P>
The state second pension reforms and enhances SERPS. It is not a brand new benefit in that sense. It is an existing additional pension that is being modified, specifically for the purpose of providing the low paid with better pensions. Even when it was started in 1978, SERPS was no good for the low paid, so defending SERPS to the last is not on. We have therefore sought to adjust SERPS, while acknowledging the benefits that this country has gained from occupational pensions, whether based on the final salary or on building up a pot for annuities. Philosophies change, as do practical realities, and we have to accept that. We enjoy the advantage of a state pension in Britain, unlike some of our European partners, but we take the view that it is unsuitable for people with a record of long-term low-paid earnings to go into such an arrangement as the hon. Lady proposes. We do not think that that would work.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does the Minister accept that the first group of amendments, which are designed to fit more easily into the Government's proposals, reduce the top of band 1 from £9,500 to £8,500 but the second does not? Does he also accept that our amendments are not challenging the limit of £9,500 or the notion of helping the lower paid? We are challenging the philosophical approach that the right hon. Gentleman is taking to the integration of state benefits with stakeholder pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Amendments Nos. 198 and 201, which reduce the lower earnings threshold to £8,500 from £9,500, may look seductively attractive for the hon. Lady's purposes but one thing is certain: pensioners would end up back on the means test in only four instead of nine years. In other words, more people would be tipped on to the means test more quickly and one of our objectives is to get pensioners off the means test. Without any change of policy, one in three people retiring in 2050 will automatically go straight from work on to the means test. Our policy changes will mean that one in five people will retire on that basis. I would love to say that no one will do so, but I cannot claim that that will happen.
<P>
When I walked into the Department and had all that information shoved at me in about two weeks flat, I said that I would take it away and think about it. So I took it away on holiday and read it. I asked whether I would be able to say that nobody in 2050 who had a decent working life would retire on the means test. I was told, "No, you can't say that, because the proposals aren't even that good." However, the figure reduces to 20 per cent. from 33 per cent. We are talking about millions of people. Twenty per cent. of pensioners in 2050 will be a much greater number than it is now. The number of pensioners may have increased by 50 per cent. from 10 million to 14.5 million, so our objective is to keep pensioners off the means test for as long as possible.
<P>
My initial reaction to amendments Nos. 198 and 201 is that they would put pensioners back on the means test within four years rather than nine. That is the opposite of our intention.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman please accept that we will be voting on our option two amendments, if the Chairman allows us. My intention in tabling the whole group of amendments was to open up the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> This is not a complaint against the Opposition, but when the amendments were tabled and selected late, we did not know what was in the Opposition's mind on the grouping. Clearly, the amendments could not all be put together as that would be contradictory, but we had to try to make an assessment of the cost.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I want to make the situation clear in my own mind, because the Government have made promises. Is the minimum pension guarantee going up in line with earnings and not with prices? Is the state second pension therefore not going up in line with prices rather than earnings? Can the Minister explain a little more why people will end up back on the means test after whatever period?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> All the policy projections are based on two premises: the basic state pension will go up in line with prices and minimum income guarantee will go up in line with earnings. For policy projections, the difference between the two is classed as 1.5 per cent.,--in other words earnings would be 1.5 per cent. above prices. That is the only way in which we can make the long-term projections in the graphs that I showed the Committee earlier.
<P>
We must make an assumption. On that basis, we can assess when people would fall back from a pension that is operated in line with prices at the time they retire--above the means test--on to the MIG, which is going up faster--at about 1.5 per cent. a year--in line with earnings. Therefore, we can make an assumption about a couple's income at retirement, based on people's ages, earnings and working lives. For example, the woman may have taken 10 years out for caring, and we have to take account of that. A couple may be on a pension above the means test and the MIG. We would see from their stakeholder or state second pension how long that would continue. For many couples--even the lowest earners--that will certainly be more than a decade. As regards single people, chopping down the £9,500, with no other changes, would put people back on the means test quicker than would otherwise be the case.
<P>
Before I reply substantively to the amendments, I want to draw hon. Members' attention to the Government Actuary's report. I regret that there are no copies in the Room, but there are some in the Vote Office. The report deals with the Bill's long-term effects on national insurance. It is extremely complicated, but well written. I needed the report and learned more from it than I did from the notes on clauses that we provided and, indeed, from the Library brief. That brief is also excellent, although we believe that some of the figures it contains are inaccurate, and they are currently being checked.
<P>
As a snapshot, graph 2.3 in the report shows the position starkly, The horizontal line represents the basic state pension. The light grey shaded area above represents SERPS without the proposed changes. The graph shows a range of incomes from £66 to £600 a week. The dark grey shaded area represents the effect of the state second pension, which will be a massive benefit to the low paid, because they receive virtually nothing out of SERPS. However, at about £200 a week--£9,500 or £10,000 a year--that tapers off. There is an incentive to come out and go into a stakeholder pension, but it is not true to say that there is no extra benefit. The benefit simply reduces as earnings rise.
<P>
One can see in stark fashion a snapshot based on all the premises--I will not call them caveats--in the explanation above the graph. There will be a period, before the pension becomes flat rate, for assessing whether stakeholder pensions are successful. We have not set that period, but it will certainly not be less than five years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> When I first looked at the table, I was confused. Does the Minister agree that the basic state pension appears to be only £31? It is not clear from the table whether the figure of £31 for 2050 takes account of inflation. Can he clarify that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We are not saying that the basic state pension will be £31 in 2050. Statistics are produced in today's money terms to make discussion easier, and the 2050 figures are in today's terms. The line for the basic state pension is horizontal because it is in line with prices, and so it does not move in real terms. We have made assumptions about inflation and the earnings limit to decide what the pension would be worth in 2050, but the figures must be considered in today's money to see a snapshot of the benefit for today's low-paid workers. That is what the graph shows. There is a big boost for workers earning less than £10,000 a year. However, that is £10,000 in today's figures. I do not know what that would be worth in 2050--probably £500,000. It would be chicken feed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am sure that pensioners look forward to that £500,000 although they might prefer it now rather than in 2050.
<P>
I would like to clarify figure 2.3. As I understand it, it is based on the assumption that stage 1 will continue into 205l, and that the flat-rate scheme will not be introduced; yet that may happen five years after the state second pension begins.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It would not make sense if the two were shown together. Figure 2.3 shows the effect of stage 1 of the state second pension. However, it is our policy intent, which we have also made clear in the legislation, to convert that pension to flat rate as soon as stakeholder pensions are established, at a rate equal to band 1 for the low paid. In effect, the basic state pension and the state second pension would be two horizontal lines, giving a different graph. That is our starting point.
<P>
I will now read from more of my prepared text so that I may answer some of the hon. Lady's questions. As I said, we made assumptions about how she would group her 15 amendments. We are in the middle of clause 28, believe it or not. Only one of the amendments is to that clause; 13 are to clause 29 and one is to clause 30. It is not straightforward. Heaven knows how those who read our debate will cope with what we are doing.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her explanation; the subject is extremely technical. SERPS has served some people well. It is producing good pensions for those who are retiring now, who have been in it from the beginning and have had a reasonable working life--especially those on average earnings. The Government's intention with stakeholder pensions is to help those who want to make more provision for themselves. SERPS applies one accrual rate to the whole of someone's earnings between the lower and upper earnings limits. The state second pension will target the low paid with three accrual rates. Everyone will receive twice as much on the first £9,500 of their earnings from the state second pension as they would have done under SERPS, including those who reach the state pension age before 2009; that relates to the phasing in, which is about to start.
<P>
The previous Government reduced the accrual rate from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. of reckonable earnings. The reduction was legislated for in 1986, although it does not start until April 2000. That is one of the problems with making comparisons between the past and the present--although we are trying to talk about the future. That reduction in benefits was to be phased in over 10 years and it means that those who retire in each year between 2000 and 2009 have different accrual rates applied to their earnings. That is why we have two tables. The factor N represents the 0.5 per cent. a year adjustment.
<P>
11.15 am
<P>
Amendments Nos. 228 and 229, one of which is not on the selection list, would remove the transitional protection for those reaching pensionable age before 2009. Some of those people would receive less from the state second pension than they would have under SERPS. We intend to make the change SERPS neutral, so that nobody loses what they would have got from SERPS. That would not be right.
<P>
Our proposals mean that those whose earnings come between the lower limit--about £3,400--and £9,500 will be treated as if they had earned £9,500. They will get more than twice what they would have got under SERPS. As we have discussed, carers and long-term disabled people with broken work records, who would have got nothing from SERPS, will now be treated as if they had earned £9,500 in the qualifying years. Moderate earners--those who earn up to £2l,600 a year--will also get more from the state second pension than under SERPS. That is despite the 10 per cent. accrual rate. We can see that from the chart in the Government Actuary's report.
<P>
The formulae for setting the two earnings bands above £9,500 are designed to achieve that effect; we go from 40 per cent. to 10 per cent. and back to 20 per cent. That claws back the extra accrued on the first £9,500 of earnings from those who earn more, but does it progressively for band 2. Someone would have to be earning £21,600 upwards, before he would cease to benefit from the higher accrual rate of 40 per cent. on the first £9,500 of his earnings. The lower someone's earnings are, the greater will be the proportionate benefit. The approach is redistributive, and that is the right use of resources.
<P>
As I recall, the figure in the Green Paper was £9,000. Obviously, that will change when the state second pension is introduced. The legislation will take account of that. The relevant figure will not be £9,000--that is in the figures for 1999-2000. We have already allowed for the legislation. The uprating will be in line with uprating provisions, so that it will be right from the start. If it were not, we would be selling a false prospectus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> The chart is very useful, but I would like one point clarified. Will people earning £600 a week still get more under the state second pension than under SERPS? If so, why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> They are not supposed to, and I was once given an explanation of why the graph appears as it does in the report. No doubt, I will receive further and better particulars as I go on. It is to do with the cut-off point.
<P>
We chose £9,500 as the starting level for the lower earnings threshold to ensure that someone with a lifetime of employment under the state second pension or periods of caring or disability will retire above the minimum income guarantee. In other words, if we were not careful and it were set too low, those people would be straight out on to the means test. That is not our intention. The financial effects of amendments Nos. 198 and 201 alone would chop £4 billion off pensions by 2050. Most of that would be pension provision, but some would be rebates. They would remove pension provision for low-paid workers, who would probably receive means-tested benefits. That would increase the number of people who retire on the means test, and would reduce the number of years before people who are close to the threshold fall back on to the means test.
<P>
The minimum income guarantee is intended to provide a safety net for people who cannot save enough to provide a decent income, especially today's pensioners, whose pensions were built up under existing arrangements. Under current assumptions, someone who, following a lifetime of employment, retires after 2038 will retire with an income above the MIG. Amendments Nos. 198 and 201 would put that date back to 2047. By 2051, even people with a lifetime of low earnings will remain above the MIG for nine years. The amendments would reduce that to four years. They would have exactly the opposite effect to what we propose.
<P>
The amendments would also push people who earn between £8,500 and £9,500 into funded pensions, especially in the second stage of the state second pension. Generally speaking, a reduction in the threshold would catch such people, because if they remained in the state scheme their pension would be based on the figure of £8,500, rather than their actual earnings, but private pension arrangements would still be unsuitable.
<P>
We do not believe that funded pensions are viable for people who earn less than £9,500. That figure is lower than would be typically involved today for someone joining a private pension scheme. Such people would not be considered. That is not to say that people should not join stakeholder schemes when they can make a worthwhile contribution. Such schemes are not compulsory. Individual circumstances vary. Occupational schemes are available for such people and, with the benefit of an employer contribution, they are usually the best option. All factors being equal, if someone is offered the opportunity to join an occupational pension scheme run by an employer, the advice would be to join, but the Government must not make it compulsory to do so, because we would be accused of mis-selling. Such schemes may not suit everyone's circumstances. Today, unlike 20 or 30 years ago, portable pensions and other arrangements are available.
<P>
We intend to ensure that people on low earnings who have private funded arrangements and have contracted out of the state scheme are no worse off as a result of their decision. We shall discuss that towards the end of our proceedings, when we debate the recent consultation and a new clause that we intend to publish as soon as possible.
<P>
Common to both the approaches suggested in the paper was the idea of a state top-up scheme. We must ensure that the Bill contains no provision, whether technical or otherwise, that seems seductive in relation to one policy objective but hits the long-term low paid. By and large, we have taken the strategic decision that such people should not rely on funded provision. That is why state second pensions were originally conceived, and that decision underpins the reforms.
<P>
Under amendments Nos. 198 and 201, people earning more than £18,600 would receive no more than they currently receive under SERPS. Under the Bill as drafted, everyone who earns up to £21,600 will be better off than under SERPS. Amendments Nos. 198 and 201, combined with amendments Nos. 188, 191, 192, 195, 235 and 251 to 254, would result in losses for lower and higher earners and increases for moderate earners. Indeed, they would create a reverse hump. We do not believe that that is coherent, and it is not what we are trying to achieve, which is a significant boost for low 
 earners, some gains for moderate earners and to maintain the position of high earners so that the scheme is as SERPS neutral as possible.
<P>
The combined effects--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You have one minute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, I know. I shall not finish this paragraph. In a moment I shall deal with the other amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Beckenham and come back to it. I want to deal with the combined effects of amendments No. 188, 191, 192, 195, 235 and 251 to 254. Everyone is to be given more in a state second pension than they would have received from SERPS, no matter how high his or her earnings. That would not be redistributive.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I congratulate all members of the Committee on their attention and good humour during the last hour and 25 minutes. It has been a complicated matter, but the debate has gone extremely well.
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
