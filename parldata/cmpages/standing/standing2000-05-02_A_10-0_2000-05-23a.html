<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I was reaching the end of my comments on the problem of access to information, which has been expressed by the whole range of interested parties. I was giving some more examples to add to those given by my right hon. and hon. Friends. I had just given an example from the Newcastle Evening Chronicle, which said of the new system:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These cabinets make it easier for councillors to approve things because they are not seeing the effect their decisions are having on the electorate and that is plain wrong. Democratically it is very bad if voters are unable to go along and show their strength of feeling to this inner sanctum that was making far-reaching decisions involving an awful lot of money.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
One of the most telling comments came from Cardiff. We have heard of the Cardiff authority on several occasions. The political editor of the Cardiff and Penarth Post commented several times on the new arrangements. He said that the flow of information has dried up and that the newspapers do not get the same information as under the committee system. He said that it is a closed cabinet system, and that the minutes are published on the internet, but generally a month after the meeting takes place. One of his complaints is that the scrutinising committees are all chaired by members of the Labour group and that the committees cannot dispute cabinet decisions because they would lose very lucrative positions. The first that members hear of decisions is when the reports go to the full council. That is not a good testament to the success of the cabinet as it has been working-or not working-in Cardiff.

<P>
Hon. Members have also mentioned the media and the letter that many of us received from ITN. Even with the supposed concessions that the Minister has made, the letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are extremely concerned that, in its present form, the Bill would remove the press and public's current statutory rights to attend council decision-making meetings, to obtain agenda papers in advance and to inspect minutes and supporting documentation afterwards. As news broadcasters, this would severely restrict the ability of our journalists to keep the public informed about local issues.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Campaign for Freedom of Information has been mentioned many times, so I shall not repeat what it has said. I shall quote instead from a letter from the Newspaper Society, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our fear is that the flow of information could be restricted and manipulated, resulting in partial and sanitised-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
an interesting choice of words-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>version of events and adversely affecting the flow of information to the community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are all end results that the Minister constantly claims she does not want. The experts seem to disagree with her.

<P>
The well-respected editor of the West Sussex County Times, whose criticisms were aimed at other cabinet structures, said that the cabinet that was reluctantly set up by West Sussex, a Conservative-controlled authority, has been a model of openness, to the extent that, from the start, all executive meetings have been held in public. Indeed, executive committees will be held in different venues in the county to encourage as much participation as possible by the press and public alike. That authority is going out of its way to make a bad system better. The editor said in a recent speech that for most local papers, local government is a vital source. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You will recall the big breakthrough in 1984 when we were allowed access to committees and documents through the Local Government Act. Since then we have enjoyed something of a golden age with our local authorities  That is now threatened by the new wave of reform in the Local Government Bill  and the arrival of Cabinet run councils.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then said that reports from editors elsewhere reveal that their cabinets are already meeting in private and that the flow of information is shutting down, open debate is being driven out and decisions are being made behind closed doors. Reports and agendas that were previously freely available are being withheld. He said that that could be the biggest set back for free information for years and that all the good work would be undone. That is quite an indictment from a respected editor, who is in touch with many other editors in boroughs of all manner of different political persuasions.

<P>
It was interesting the read the local newspapers from several of the constituencies represented by members of the Committee. The local paper in the London borough of Enfield, the Enfield Independent, has launched a campaign to force the local council to resist secrecy. It was pressure from that newspaper that forced the council to open its meetings to the media, although not thus far to the public. It has at last agreed to release agendas in advance.

<P>
It should not be for local newspapers to bring about that sort of openness-the sort of openness that was first brought about by Mrs Thatcher in 1960, as we have heard several times this morning. It would seem that it is the job of local papers to force local authorities that choose to hide behind the new proposals to come out into the open by whatever tactics they can. They are sometimes successful. In far too many cases, they are not.

<P>
I return to an old favourite-the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove, about which Ministers claimed last week to have a great deal of knowledge. Further inspections of what happened at last week's meeting reveals otherwise. I pay tribute to the campaign run by the Brighton Evening Argus, as my hon. Friend did last week. An article entitled ``The day the Cabinet system disintegrated'' referred to Brighton and Hove council's pioneering use of cabinets in local government. It reported:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The cabinet system has been undemocratic, with important decisions affecting residents and businesses being made behind closed doors. Councillors have felt disconnected from the council and have not been able to represent their electors at service committees in front of the public and press. Items could be scrutinised only after decisions had already been made.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Throughout the country, in local authorities of every political party and structure, the local press and other forms of media speak with one, united voice-with politicians of all parties, campaigners for freedom of information, environmental lobby groups and a whole panoply of people who have an interest in or are interested in local government-saying that we are seeing a closing down of openness and access.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) described this part of the Bill as being entirely friendless. We have yet to hear of anyone involved in expanding the availability of information who has a good word for the proposals. As I said earlier it is all about the perception of access. Whatever intentions the Minister claims to have, the perception among interested bodies and ordinary people is that access to information is limited and will be further limited by the Bill. That cannot be good for democracy. It certainly will not be an incentive for people to turn out and vote at elections or to take a greater interest in how local government works. Time and again we have been told that that is the Government's purpose, and we agree with them. In practice, however, they seem in the early stages to have achieved entirely the reverse.

<P>
The Minister said this morning that her door was open. I do not dispute that she has spent much time speaking to and listening to interested parties. We have absolutely no qualms about that. It might have been useful had she updated us on the changes that she proposed this morning, but she chose not to do so. If what she said is to have any credibility, and if her intentions are to have any substance, she must at least acknowledge the value of the Liberal Democrat amendments that were moved this morning, and that we support, and the amendments that we have tabled. I repeat that our amendments will not force executives to hold all their meetings in public with the press in attendance; they will still be able to use the extensive exemptions first set out by Mrs Thatcher in 1960. If what the Minister said this morning is to have any credibility, she should at least signal the merit in the principles that underlie the amendments. Almost exclusively, the Government have so far failed to propose any change to clause 21, even after all the meetings and listening sessions in which Ministers have supposedly engaged. They should at least consider tabling amendments to insert into the Bill the sort of guarantees that the Opposition, the public, press and media at large want. Will the Minister assure us that the Government will introduce on Report a provision that is rather better than the clause, which is entirely friendless and undermines the thrust of their purported aims in introducing the Bill?

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): We welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien.

<P>
We have had an interesting debate. I especially enjoyed the contribution made by somebody whom my notes call the right hon. Member for Skip and Rip, although I suspect that they refer to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry). You missed, Mr. O'Brien, the right hon. Gentleman's enjoyable and eloquent speech. He rightly pointed out that the key issue was access, as did the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). The right hon. Gentleman was supported by the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), who said that he found it worrying that he agreed with me. I also find that worrying. He made a similar point about access, and suggested that if the rest of our debate had been cut away, we would ultimately have returned to that issue.

<P>
Many hon. Members have referred to the large number of people who have expressed concern about the Government's proposals while welcoming many of the moves that have been made. Unfortunately, I failed in my opening remarks to mention Unison, the trade union that often represents the council employees who have to give effect to decisions made by the executive. I was fortunate enough to meet a Unison representative during our lunch break. She told me that Unison strongly believes that the Government's proposals are wrong. The organisation is already seeing that speedy decisions made by councils that are using the opportunity to hold their executives in secret have created problems in employment relations. I do not think that we heard previously about that additional point.

<P>
I apologise to the Committee, as I understand that I may have inadvertently attributed to the Newspaper Society some strongly critical comments that were made by the Society of Editors. I would not, however, like the Newspaper Society to go unrepresented. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Newspaper Society is dismayed that the proposed decision-making framework will not require meetings of the executive to be held in public.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government proclaims its commitment to freedom of information, but in the context of local government it is proposing to deprive the public of existing rights.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This morning, we had a lengthy, interesting and wide-ranging debate. Perhaps because we concentrated on amendment No. 258, which deals with access to the meetings of the executive, we did not discuss in enough detail some of the other issues that arise from the clause. Amendments Nos. 332 and 261 to 264 enable the Minister to deal with one of those issues. They relate specifically to decisions taken by the executive or by executive members and would ensure that the decisions, the reasons for them and the rejected options would have to be recorded and, subject to exemptions, made public.

<P>
The point of the group is clear. Currently, there are requirements in respect of some decision makers but not others. The amendments seek merely to put the same requirement on decision takers, including individual officers, on the full council and on any committee that continues to operate what we might call traditional lines. They would have to operate in the way that the Government, rightly, want other decision takers to work.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Minister opened up several issues in her response and I wish to take a few minutes to respond to some of the things that she said. I accept that individual members will take decisions more than they do currently, using the delegated authority of the executive. Further, we have accepted that our amendments would not apply to those decisions. However, the Minister gave the impression that individuals would take the vast majority of decisions. That caused me increasing concern. I hope that she will make it clear whether that is her view and whether there is to be a concept of collective responsibility by the executive.

<P>
To be fair, paragraphs 10.14 and 10.15 of the draft guidance are clear-decisions will be taken individually and we are not to view the executive as a traditional committee. Nevertheless, many of the major decisions-which the Minister refers to as key decisions-will cover issues on which there will be much debate in the executive before the individual, if it is to be an individual, comes to a conclusion. That raises the issue of the executive's collective responsibility for decisions and the importance of including in the openness requirements meetings at which the final decision is debated.

<P>
Some of the key decisions will be big. They will cover, for example, whether the council should opt for a stock transfer of its housing. I cannot get my head round the notion that an individual executive member will be told simply: ``Go away by yourself to the proverbial bath''-as we are referring to it-``think about the situation and make a decision.'' There will not be much discussion in the executive. Equally importantly, the executive will have no notion of collective responsibility for the decision.

<P>
I was concerned when the Minister said that meetings of the executive would be subject to existing openness requirements. The papers will have to be published three days before the meeting at which the decision is to be taken. Two issues arise from that. The Minister said-I think that I noted this correctly-that the draft guidance will make it clear that an executive will not be able to take a decision on an item not in the forward plan until three days have elapsed since the publication of the papers. The draft guidance does not say that. It states in paragraph 10.11:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There will clearly be occasions where the executive needs to take such a decision which is not contained in the forward plan. In such a case, the executive must notify the relevant overview and scrutiny committee(s) of the decision at least three clear days before it is taken as an addendum to the forward plan. Any such addendum must also be published.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that there must be three clear days notification that the decision is to be taken, but the draft guidance does not state that the paperwork on the decision must be published three clear days in advance, which is what the Minister implied. She must also acknowledge that that paragraph does not relate to urgent decisions, which are covered in the following paragraph. I hope that she can clarify that matter.

<P>
The second issue relates to what the Minister said about criminal sanctions. We debated the way in which the Standards Board will be better and how it will be easier for members of the public to express concern about a council's actions, but that will not necessarily be the case. When a member of the public wants to test whether there has been a criminal offence, he or she goes to the police. That person does not have to act as the prosecution, because that is the responsibility of the police. The possible threat of criminal action against individual councillors puts a powerful pressure on councillors to behave in a particular way. Although she acknowledged that there will be tough sanctions, I remain to be convinced whether the Standards Board alone will be sufficient.

<P>
I reflected on the matter during lunchtime and realised that there was a strange anomaly. Paragraph 15 of the draft regulations states that an attempt by a member or an officer to deny a member of the public access to paperwork for a meeting that is to be held in public will continue to be a criminal offence. I fail to understand why it will be a criminal offence for someone who deliberately obstructs another person from getting hold of paperwork for a matter that will be debated in a public meeting if it is not a criminal offence when an officer or member fails or deliberately obstructs someone from getting access to paperwork for a meeting that is to be held in private. I hope that the Minister will explain that contradiction. She has said that it is better to have the Standards Board, but its responsibilities will not apply to all cases.

<P>
The Minister also mentioned new clause 15. She accepted that there are arguments in favour of it, but that its proposals might be too prescriptive. She said that they would be better left to regulations. However, the draft regulations make no provision for the advance notice of decisions taken by individuals. If she is not prepared to accept the new clause, she should at least accept the need to amend the draft regulations to accommodate its proposals.

<P>
I made great play of how important it is to include proposals in the Bill rather than in regulations. It is clear from clause 92, which outlines how we are to treat the regulations, that they will be subject to negative procedure rather than a positive resolution of both Houses. That is disappointing. More significantly, however, when we read clause 92(5), we can see that regulations to be made under clause 21 need not be produced in draft form before they can be accepted. No draft regulations need be laid before Parliament. Both sides of the Committee have accepted that it is a critical issue, but both Houses of Parliament have been excluded from having a real say in the matter and seeing any draft regulations. If the Minister will not accept the amendments, she might, at least, make changes to clause 92.

<P>
We have not had an opportunity to discuss the issue as it affects Wales. I am glad that the Wales Office Minister is with us today. It is rather bizarre that, if the Minister has her way and the issues are dealt with by guidance or regulations-something that is important to the Government-the Bill will allow for a different situation in Wales. There, the decisions will be made by the National Assembly for Wales. It would be possible, if unlikely, for the regulations to be less strong than even those that the Government propose. Does the Minister see that as an acceptable part of devolution?

<P>
I return to the argument of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon that the debate about amendment No. 258 and those tabled by Conservative Members is, fundamentally, about access. Whatever decision is taken by the Committee when we vote on the issue in a few moments, I hope that the Minister will, at least, agree that it is important that there is an opportunity for continuing debate on the issue on Report, although I acknowledge that the decision is one for the Speaker to make. During our discussions, particularly on amendment No. 258, I jotted down a few of the Minister's phrases. She said, ``I remain to be persuaded,'' and, ``I am not absolutely convinced.'' She also said, ``I am not closing any doors,'' and that we should, ``edge towards a system that is open and accountable and gives real access.'' All of those phrases suggest that the Minister is prepared to consider further changes. She may not accept them today-I understand that-but I hope that we shall continue to discuss the issue. I hope that she will take up my invitation to do what she can to allow us to do that.

<P>
The Minister was wrong to say that accepting the amendments could lead to our losing some important things. I understand what she meant when she said that the open meeting had become an icon; to some extent, it has. However, the point about the amendments, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne so eloquently said, is that they are concerned with holding the line. They are not about adding anything, but ensuring that we do not take anything away. Amendment No. 258 relates to a package of measures, many of which the Government have already accepted, to ensure that people have access to information before decisions are taken, that they know who will be responsible for taking those decisions, that they have the opportunity to be present when the decisions are being taken, and access to a detailed account of how those decisions were taken. That is what many hon. Members want.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I note with interest that early-day motion 384 deals with the desire of many hon. Members to retain the same approach to freedom of information, access to meetings and so on, that is contained in the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985. That early-day motion is signed by 146 Labour Members: a large number of members of the party of Government, to whom attention should be paid.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments. If not, I hope that she will agree to enable further debate and take this opportunity to deal with at least some of the issues that, I confess, have caused confusion in today's debate.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I have enjoyed the debate and I particularly enjoyed the speech by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, with whom I found little to disagree. However, I thought that he was talking about general access to information, rather than access to meetings alone. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has not acknowledged that the Government are trying to secure greater access to information and a greater ability to question information than the current system or the statute book provides. In those terms, the main argument is how we achieve that end. We have published draft guidance to ensure that all comments and information are gathered in, so that the system can be got right.

<P>
On whether sanctions should be criminal, the draft guidance makes it clear that it would be appropriate for a criminal offence to be attached to an inadvertent failure to record lesser decisions. It is suggested that such a failure would breach the relevant codes of conduct and views on that approach are welcome. We are trying to ensure that those who must put the provision into practice have the opportunity to comment and report back. That is the difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition are saying that the provision must be included in the Bill and Parliament must decide, but such matters are complex and difficult and that is a very inflexible way in which to deal with them.

<P>
There is little difference between the Government and the Opposition in terms of the desired outcome, but we want to achieve it through the flexible method of secondary legislation so that, as we learn more, we can continue to make refinements and improvements. The real question is: what is the most effective way in which to get there? This morning, I made it clear that it is access to the decision-making process that is important, rather than a stage-managed event that people can attend.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon described his experience of the Council of Ministers. He is right to say that it is important for people to know who is taking a decision and for access to papers to be provided in advance, so that what is being considered is known. In that respect, the reading of the guidance as explained by the hon. Member for Bath is somewhat peculiar. It refers to the executive as ``it'' as that denotes circumstances in which the executive is either an individual or a group of people. Executive members will have to be part of the rolling-forward plan, so that as soon as papers go to an individual member they will go to the scrutiny panel and to the public.

<P>
We are incorporating the provision relating to three days as a backstop to ensure that matters are not compromised. However, if one is planning four months in advance, and publishing papers to enable executive members to consider the contents of that forward plan, the papers will inevitably be published outside the statutory three-day minimum period. I made a concession this morning, which I think that the hon. Gentleman might have forgotten, in saying that we were prepared to consider the proposal in new clause 15 and examine how we might deal with it effectively to gain the most clarity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I was grateful for that concession. However, I would like a clear answer to the following question. In relation to an issue that is not in the forward plan and is not urgent, the guidance currently says that the member must give three days' advance notice that he or she is going to make a decision. It does not include a provision that the paperwork should be made available before that three-day period. Will the Minister tell us whether she believes that it should be, and whether she intends to resolve the problem?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It will be, because any paper that goes to an executive member in relation to taking a decision will be made public at the same time. If a member wishes to take a decision that is not in the forward plan, the relevant paper will be published.

<P>
The Joint Committee that scrutinised the Bill also thought that that was the central issue. Contrary to what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said this morning, it did not recommend that the executive should meet in public. Indeed, paragraph 172 of its report states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we do not think it appropriate that the executive should necessarily meet in public.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It concludes in paragraph 176:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We consider that the provision of information about the activities of the executive is central to public confidence.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The report went on to say that papers relating to decisions should be made available in advance and that that should be made clear in regulations. The Government have followed that path precisely, because we believe that clause 21 should be an enabling clause, with the detail contained in regulations. The regulations have been changed, and I am sorry that the hon. Member for Eastbourne is not prepared to acknowledge that we have changed the Bill. We have not changed clause 21, but we have changed substantially the regulations and the guidance, to cover the issues put to us in lobbying meetings and by the Joint Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I do not blame the Minister; one has a great deal to contend with in the Bill. However, I thought that I had made it clear-as Hansard will no doubt reveal-that I welcomed the changes in the second draft of the guidance, although I did not think that they went far enough. Some of those provisions should be in the Bill. Furthermore, many of the people who have lobbied the Minister during the past few days had copies of the second draft, and they were still not happy about it.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have met those people whom I saw yesterday on several occasions. This is a continuing dialogue in which we seek to understand one another. The concession that I just made relates to today's discussions, not the regulations that we discussed last week. As will be clear to any impartial observer, we are continuing to respond to pressure. We are ensuring that people are able to influence decisions in advance and to have access to the executive before it takes a decision. This morning, a great deal was said about bad councils, which will try to avoid being open at all costs. However, none of the councils that has been cited as an example are acting within legislation as it is currently framed or within the regulations and guidance that have been issued.

<P>
However, let me consider those cases for a moment. Do people honestly think that requiring an open meeting would help in such a worst case scenario? I contend that it would not, and that we therefore need to ensure that, regardless of whether the meeting is open and how it is conducted, access to information and the ability to hold to account are absolutely clear. We are trying to ensure that people have access to the decision-making process beforehand and are building in ways in which to facilitate that. The public must be told what options are being considered.

<P>
Those provisions go far beyond the current requirements, and any council that decides to try to get round them will face severe penalties. We shall introduce mandatory standing orders, which will ensure advance notification of all key decisions, whether made individually or collectively, advance sight of all relevant papers, advance notice of who is to be consulted, and advance notice of how people can make their input-not on the basis of three days' notice, as at present, but as part of a continuing, month-by-month work programme. An individual, executive or council that chooses to ignore those mandatory standing orders does so at their peril. Breach of the standing orders will be a breach of the code of conduct. People will be able to complain to the independent Standards Board, which can enforce severe penalties.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bath asked me about an example in which a member of the executive decided that they wanted to put a proposal to tenants to transfer housing. That decision would not be for an individual executive member, but for the whole council. In those circumstances, the current legislation on committee and council meetings would prevail. As the executive member would presumably have said that he was interested in the idea and wanted the council to consider it, some scrutiny would have taken place beforehand. Although a decision may issue from the council, it is not a matter purely for the executive.

<P>
It is important to recognise that we are putting into the council's hands the whole policy framework and the whole budget framework. That is a robust regime, which takes account of the way in which an executive will work in future. It does not merely replicate the existing legislation designed for committees, but introduces new and enhanced levels of access. That will bring about a step change in public access to decision making. The amendment would not have that effect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the Minister answer three questions that I asked her earlier? First, does she agree that the draft regulations do not contain any details about the advance notice of decisions that are taken by individuals, but that they should do? Secondly, why is it that if an executive member or officer is accused of, and found guilty of, deliberately obstructing access to information about a public meeting, he will be found guilty of a criminal offence, but if a private meeting is involved, he will not. Thirdly, given the Minister's comments about the need for a continuing dialogue, does she agree that it would be of enormous benefit if, with the agreement of Madam Speaker, the matter was debated further on Report?

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I answered the hon. Gentleman's first two questions earlier. The answer to the first question is yes-I drew his attention earlier to the relevant provisions in the regulations. I understand his second question, and I shall consider the matter. The third question goes far beyond my responsibilities-much more rests with you, Mr. O'Brien, than with me.

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Given that the Minister gave no assurances that the matter would be debated further I shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I listened carefully to both the Minister's contributions to this debate. I repeat my earlier comment, which the hon. Member for Bath was good enough to echo, that this is simply a matter of holding the line-we should preserve the existing position, which is based on Conservative legislation and which has applied for many years. The Government had to make a case for changing the position, but they signally failed to do so. The Minister has not persuaded many Labour Back Benchers in this regard, let alone us. The way in which the amendments have been grouped means that we shall vote with the Liberal Democrats on this occasion.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 210, in page 66, line 11, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the deputy mayor of the executive'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`his deputy (referred to in this paragraph as the deputy mayor)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 211 to 218, 220 to 227 and 232.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> These are largely minor and technical amendments that relate to the deputy mayor in the mayor and cabinet and in the mayor and council manager forms of executive.

<P>
Amendment No. 210 will change the way in which the appointment of the deputy mayor is described in paragraph 1, and amendments Nos. 211 to 216 are consequential to that amendment. Amendment No. 220 will make similar changes to those that are contained in amendment No. 210, but in relation to the appointment of the deputy mayor in the mayor and council manager arrangements. Amendments Nos. 221 to 227 are consequential on amendment No. 220.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 218 and 232 simply provide that in Wales the deputy mayor can be called by the Welsh language equivalent of the title. [Hon. Members: What is that?] I shall not attempt to say it, but I must point out a printing error in the amendments in which the Welsh word for mayor has been mis-spelt. The second word should start with f and not s. I hope that that clarifies the matter for the Committee.

<P>
Amendment No. 217 corrects an error in paragraph 7 of schedule 1, which refers to what happens when the mayor and deputy mayor are unable to act.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary of State for Wales had not snuck out of the Committee just as we were about to embark on a debate involving the pronunciation of Welsh words. I wondered whether he speaks Welsh and whether he would have been able to give us some advice.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Under-Secretary will read that in Hansard and communicate with the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B>(Coventry, North-East): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is in a Committee next door.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The picture is clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 333, in page 66, line 16, after ``fit'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and with the agreement of at least half of the members of the authority excluding the deputy mayor'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 334, in page 67, line 5, after ``fit'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and with the agreement of at least half of the members of the authority excluding the deputy mayor.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Under schedule 1(5), the mayor may remove the deputy mayor of the executive from office. We shall consider later how to remove the mayor from office if he goes mad, is mad to start with or gets into difficulties like Mayor Barry. Following the Government's recent pilot scheme for directly elected mayors in London, they may prefer not to give them too many overweening powers. The mayor must have a substantial say in the appointment of his or her deputy, but giving him the power to sack the deputy mayor because they fall out over a minor personality clash seems too stringent. The amendment merely inserts a further condition to be complied with: that at least 50 per cent. of the members of the authority, excluding the deputy mayor who would have an interest in the matter, would have to agree with the mayor. It is just possible to envisage the mayor being wholly at odds with the majority on the elected authority, but the amendment would be a useful check on the power of directly elected mayors.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I could understand the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument, although I would not necessarily agree with it, if he had tabled an amendment that proposed that the council should vote to approve the person nominated to be the deputy mayor. However, he has not tabled such an amendment, so it is difficult to understand the logic of his argument. He is suggesting that, although the mayor should be able to appoint a deputy from the executive, he should have to obtain the council's approval to remove the deputy. Clearly, good working relations between the elected mayor and the deputy are important in ensuring that either of the systems that involve a mayor will work effectively. However, it is right that the elected mayor should be able to appoint a deputy. I must correct the hon. Gentleman because I think that he used the phrase ``the deputy mayor of the executive'', but that will not be the situation. A person will be appointed from the executive but will be deputy to the mayor. It is right that the mayor should appoint that person and should also be able to terminate that person's post if confidence in the relationship is lost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Under-Secretary makes a perfectly fair point and, if she continues to do so, I might withdraw the amendment. However, will she say what would happen if, right from the start, the elected mayor were so wholly at odds with the elected members of the executive that he or she could not find anyone to accept the job of deputy mayor? Would that negate the mayor's ability to make decisions later on, or would it have no effect at all?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I find it difficult to imagine that a mayor would not be able to appoint someone from the executive. The Bill makes it clear that the mayor will have the power to appoint a deputy. Indeed, the mayor needs a deputy who can act for him, should he be temporarily unable to act. Such matters would have to be worked out between the mayor and the executive when they arise, but I doubt whether they would arise at the start of a mayoral term.

<P>
The amendments have not been thoroughly thought through, and I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman will accept that it is right that the initiation and termination of the post of deputy should be the mayor's responsibility. That is central to the arrangements proposed in the Bill, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am suitably chastised. I obviously should have tabled more amendments rather than fewer. I hope that I have better luck next time, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 66, line 36, at end insert-

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972 does not apply to the function of determining the number of councillors under sub-paragraph (2)(a).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment simply clarifies the position that pertains when a council moves to a leader in cabinet framework. In those circumstances, it will have a choice about whether the leader or the council should determine the size of the executive. Having made that choice, amendment No. 219 simply makes it clear that, where it has previously been decided that the size of the executive is a matter for the council, the size of the cabinet must be determined by the full council and cannot be delegated to a committee. It is important to clarify in the new arrangements that if the leader is not given a free hand, the matter must be agreed collectively by the whole council.

<P>
This is a technical amendment, which clarifies the extent of the provision contained in paragraph 3(9). The provision will give the council manager the right to attend and speak, but not to vote, at meetings of the committees and sub-committees of the authority, except the overview and scrutiny committee. Amendment No. 228 provides that those rights will include the right to attend and speak, but not to vote, at any meetings of joint committees or sub-committees of joint committees.

<P>

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 229, in page 67, line 33, after ``appointment'' insert ``by the elected mayor''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 230, 231 and 198.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Amendment No. 229 amends paragraph 3(12) of schedule 1, which gives the elected mayor power to appoint committees of other councillors to advise him or herself and the council manager on the exercise of their functions. Such committees do not have to be politically balanced and, if appointed, their main purpose will be to assist the mayor in advising the council manager on the discharge of executive functions. That is consistent with the amendments to clause 15 that we debated earlier, which clarify that the principal role of the elected mayor is to advise the council manager on the exercise of executive functions. It also recognises that the mayor's mandate will often be different from that of the council and that, therefore, the mayor may wish to appoint different councillors to such committees.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 230, 231 and 198 are consequential on amendment No. 229. They remove the label ``advisory committee'' and its definition from committees appointed to advise the executive under paragraph 3(12). That is necessary because such committees will be appointed by the elected mayor and will be different from advisory committees as defined by the Local Government Act 1972.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendments made: No. 230, in page 67, line 34, leave out ``advisory''.

 `Meetings of executives and executive committees<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>. A member of a local authority who is not a member of the authority's executive is entitled to attend, and speak at, a meeting of the executive, or of a committee of the executive, only if invited to do so.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Amendment No. 233 will allow an executive to invite other councillors to attend its meeting if it so wishes. We have already included in the Bill a strong framework of arrangements to ensure that councillors outside the executive, and, indeed, local people, are fully involved in the policy development process. We have just concluded a long debate about the circumstances in which the executive might wish to meet in private in order to consider its options. The amendment will allow the executive to invite other councillors, but does not give other councillors the right to attend meetings of the executive without an invitation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The amendment seeks to clarify-[
Interruption.] I have not even cracked a joke yet, so I do not know why the Minister is beside herself.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is your Whip.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I shall see him later-he is undermining my authority while I am making a serious point. I do not know why the Whip and the Minister are signalling to each other, but never mind. This is not the third way, is it?

<P>
The amendment is intended to clarify the Government's intention that non-executive members should not attend or speak at executives unless invited to do so. I remember that when the Liberal Democrats first introduced the cabinet system to the borough council in Eastbourne, they came up with the idea of holding cabinet meetings in public but excluding other members of the council. However, they invited members of the public to address the cabinet from time to time. The ban on participation by opposition-that is, Conservative-members rapidly became a nonsense because they turned up purporting to be members of the public and put their points to the cabinet in that capacity. That shows up some of the problems in the provision that we are considering. I take it that members of the council who turn up as members of the public will still not be entitled to attend, even if the meetings are held in public. Also, who would be entitled to decide to issue invitations to other members of an authority? Would any executive member be able to do that, or would they have to come from the leader, the mayor or the executive as a whole?

<P>
Does the Minister understand that what we are considering is precisely the sort of thing that irritates councillors at present? Councillor Gerry Harrison of Camden told the Joint Committee that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is clear  what are emerging are first and second-class councillors. We are incredibly frustrated.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are serious matters. They cement the current impression of many councillors that they are to be consigned to a kind of back bench-a second-class role-in their local authorities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Jenkins </B>(Tamworth): I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister on her far-sightedness in tabling the amendment. It could alleviate at one stroke some of the difficulty that arises when members feel rightly, that they have been excluded from making representations to an executive before a decision is taken on an issue. The executive would now have the opportunity to bring a member, particularly one with a constituency interest in the decision, into the decision-making process. Something was missing and the amendment puts it right. It will go a long way to overcome the fears of councillors who are not on the executive.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I will try to respond briefly. I am grateful for the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins).

<P>
If an executive decided to hold a meeting in public, councillors would clearly be as free as other members of the public to attend, on the same terms. There would be no distinction. As we have stressed, the Bill enables, but does not require, executives to hold meetings in public.

<P>
The process by which an executive would decide whether to invite other councillors to attend, and which councillors to invite, would be for councils to work out. I remind the hon. Member for Eastbourne of what happened until recently under the current legislation in every authority that I know about. The only way to do business has been for the people with responsibility-who hitherto were those who chaired committees or had other positions in the political management structure-to meet all the time, formally and informally. None of those meetings was minuted or announced. The papers were not brought forward in advance and members who did not hold the relevant positions would not necessarily know anything about the meetings until the issues were raised in the political groups. Our proposal is an improvement on that approach.

<P>
I remind the hon. Member for Eastbourne that the Bill provides other council members who are not on the executive, through positions on overview and scrutiny committees, the power to require members of the executive to attend to be quizzed and answer questions. That is equality but difference. Equal powers will be applied in different ways to carry out the important but different functions of executive and scrutiny.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 234, in page 69, line 13, leave out from ``the'' to ``which'' in line 14 and insert

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 235 to 240.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The amendments are largely technical and relate to the right of church and parent and governor representatives to sit on overview and scrutiny committees when they deal with education. Amendments Nos. 234 to 237 and 239 are drafting amendments to make it clear that the provisions extend to representatives of any school maintained by a local education authority, not just those within its boundaries. I understand that certain local education authorities maintain schools outside the boundary of the authority. The amendment will include representatives of those governing bodies in the provision.

<P>
Amendment No. 238 is a technical amendment clarifying the regulation-making power of the Secretary of State in relation to parent governor representatives and amendment No. 240 deals with an outstanding concern that was raised by the right reverend prelate the Bishop of Blackburn in another place. We should note that the churches have been supportive of our policy in this context but wanted reassurance that a local education authority that, for whatever reason, failed to comply with its duties under the schedule, could be subjected to an individual direction from the Secretary of State to enforce them. We are happy to provide such reassurance and the amendment extends the existing direction-making power under the Education Act 1996 to cover the relevant parts of the schedule.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I do not know if the Minister first wants to tell us why it is such a good clause, but I am prepared, sight unseen, to rubbish her arguments something rotten in advance.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the Minister wants to explain, I shall call her.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It might have been noticed that we dealt with other clauses this afternoon without debate, and I was not sure whether the Committee wanted a debate on this clause.

<P>
The clause exempts executives and their committees from the requirement for committees to reflect the political balance of the authority. The political make-up of the executive will be a matter for local choice. If one party had a majority, the executive could be drawn from a single party, but that would not be a requirement. It could still include representation from minority parties. In authorities with no overall control the executive could be drawn from two or more parties, which could form an administration, but again, that would not be a requirement. Alternatively, the executive could, for whatever reason, reflect the political balance of the council.

<P>
The clause is another example of the flexibility of the framework for executive arrangements. I am sure that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will ask why we are giving councils those options and why we believe that they should be able to have single-party executives. The approach goes right back to the debate that we had when we began to consider part II. We all know that the real political discussion and decision making in most councils happens behind closed doors, in political group meetings. We also know that most councils have what is, in effect, a single-party executive. Many council leaders have explained to me that meetings with committee chairs form an informal executive. That happens now, and when one party has won sufficient seats to be the majority, ruling party, committee chairs will almost invariably be occupied by its members. I have not come across a council where a committee chair is given to a member of another party. If hon. Members insisted on an all-party executive, that is the sort of procedure that they would be asking for.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
To require the executive to reflect the political balance of the council would mean that a party that had won overall control and which had a mandate to advance its policy would not be allowed to do so. I do not think that such an approach is correct. Rather than meeting informally, as committee chairs, I would prefer the executive to meet in public and the decisions that it takes or considers to be made public. People will then be able to scrutinise those decisions, as the discussions will be minuted and recorded.

<P>
The clause is an essential element of the Bill, which underpins the transparency and accountability of executive arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I had predicted most of the Minister's remarks. As she said, the clause removes the requirement for local authority executives to be politically balanced, although, as I understand it, it is open to local authorities to have politically balanced executives if they so choose, as I think that the Minister said. She also said that they could use one-party or ruling coalition arrangements.

<P>
The evidence that is so far available suggests that more than half the councils that are currently operating executive arrangements have one-party executives or cabinets. Bedfordshire is one example of an honourable departure from that.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Middlesbrough.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Well, yes. As I have pointed out, however, I have been to Bedfordshire and met the Conservatives in the local authority, who operate a cross-party executive. Admittedly, there is a Conservative majority, but the Conservatives have a majority on the county council. It will no doubt increase next year. However, other parties are also represented. That is the choice that has been made, and it seems to work well in that area.

<P>
Our worry about the clause is based on our central concerns about the Bill in the round. The new arrangement is open to abuse. Most local authorities will use the new power in a sensible manner. However, if sufficient safeguards, checks and balances are not built into the Bill, some executives, especially in areas where one party is dominant and has been for a long time, might use the power to suppress the opposition entirely.

<P>
In case the Minister thinks that that is merely my own fanciful thinking, I shall refer again to that old standby, Councillor Brendan Bird, and the evidence that he gave to the Joint Select Committee. His comments related to Hammersmith and Fulham, which has been a fruitful source of examples of how not to do it. As pilots go, Hammersmith and Fulham has been remarkably useful in showing up all the potential elephant traps, as it has contrived to fall into every single one while continuing to pay its executive mayor handsomely. Councillor Bird stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Opposition members are even more disadvantaged  they only see the published decisions  Can they rely on the briefing given by the officers for something which the latter are de facto already committed to. This increasing loss of knowledge and consequent degrading of perspectives leads to cherry-picking of scrutiny items and partisan behaviour. Effectively, opposition members scrutinise in the dark with one arm tied behind their back.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Councillor Bird paints a colourful picture, but he expresses a worry that exists not only among Conservative councillors. In parts of the country where there is a small Conservative opposition group and a large, dominant Labour group-in some areas, that has been the case for generations-people are anxious that the Bill provides another opportunity to keep the opposition out of the picture and in darkness; in other words, to subject them to what could be called the mushroom treatment. Does the Under-Secretary share our concerns about such abuse of the provision?

<P>
Rather depressingly, the Under-Secretary's central argument was, yet again, the old counsel of despair. She gave the impression that, as people in local government are busily getting together in public houses, bath houses or wherever else to make decisions in a manner that is beyond scrutiny, we should go along with it and introduce the provisions. That seems to be the main argument on which Ministers repeatedly fall back.

<P>
We have expressed serious reservations about the clause, but we will not seek to press it to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I want to cite a practical example, to which I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond. The main council in my constituency, Adur council, gained no overall control in last year's election. The Labour party was the largest group. it proposed a convention and took chairmanship of the council and all of the committees. The council still operates under a committee structure, although it is conceivable that the chairmen and chairwomen of those committees would form the executive if they were to adopt one. I am glad to say that the Conservatives made sweeping gains this year, moved from third to first place and are now in minority control of the council. As the Conservative group is more fair-minded and wanted to show that it was not in control of the council-the Labour group had automatically assumed that it was in control-it offered chairmanships to the minority party leaders. It received positive responses from all but the Labour group, which said that it was its policy not to take places when it was the minority.

<P>
Is it a policy of Labour administrations throughout the country, even when they form the largest group but have minority control, to assume executive positions and committee chairmanships across the board and not to co-operate if they are not the largest party? Has a directive to that effect been issued? That was the suggestion implied by the labour group on my council. When the Labour group was not in overall control, it still sought to take all the positions and all the other minority parties. Was that just a one-off?

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendments Nos. 148 to 151, 157 and 158.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> In effect, the amendment replaces subsection (3)(a) with a new subsection, which ensures that councils must consult local electors and other interested parties before drawing up their proposals for executive arrangements. All of the amendments, some of which are technical, are about reinforcing the message to be included in the statutory guidance and in directions so that councils must consult before drawing up proposals to establish what option local people prefer rather than simply seeking confirmation later. We intend the power to be used in that way with regard, for instance, to executive arrangements.

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> These are minor drafting amendments. My note says that I should say that I am sure that hon. Members will not find reason to oppose them. However, the hon. Member for Bath is in Committee again, so I cannot be confident. The amendments will bring the wording of the clauses into line with the usual formulation in legislation for referring to local government electors. The relevant part of the clause will read ``the local government electors  for the local authority's area.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 85, in page 17, line 28, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) No referendum shall take place until rules for the conduct of referenda have been approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament and all referenda shall be conducted in accordance with such rules'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
There is excitement about clause 26, as, of course, there has been excitement all day. I will try to make the subject of referendums as exciting as possible. The clause deals with referendums on proposals for elected mayors. An error in the amendment refers to ``referenda''. It is commonly accepted in Hansard that ``referendum'' is a gerundive and that the correct plural is ``referendums''. I did not draft the amendment; its grammar would need correction for it to be accepted.

<P>
The referendum should not be applied until the rules have been approved by an affirmative order of Parliament. The Government's proposals involve a significant number of local authorities holding referendums but include no mechanisms for ensuring that the referendums are conducted in a fair and straightforward way. The amendment would ensure the establishment of standard rules for their conduct. They would remain subject to the affirmative approval of Parliament.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I might save the hon. Gentleman from having to go through his speech by confirming that the regulations under clause 41(3) will establish an affirmative resolution procedure that will achieve precisely what the amendment seeks to achieve.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Presumably, that is covered by the regulations that we received the other day-

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Clause 92.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Which we shall consider at a later stage.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
A number of questions arise from the Joint Select Committee report. On page 25, the report recommends that details relating to the conduct of referendums should not be left until a later stage but sorted out during the Bill's legislative passage. However, we are now faced with new conduct of referendum regulations, which are still subject to extensive consultation. Indeed, the document with which we were presented last week asked for consultation responses by 30 June. By that date, it is feasible that the Bill may have completed its Committee stage.

<P>
I seek further clarification from the Minister on how such referendums should take place. A number of Joint Select Committee witnesses raised concerns about, for example, the associated cost, and the feeling was expressed that it ought to be possible to delay referendums, so that they can be held in tandem with local elections. Some councils felt that the Secretary of State's power to specify the way in which referendums will be conducted would be better granted to an independent electoral commission. Other councils were keen to see a turnout threshold, which we shall discuss when we consider subsequent clauses.

<P>
Establishing how referendums will be run is the purpose of the amendment and the exploratory questions. To do so is important, given that, even though the Bill has been under scrutiny for some time, the details are far from finalised.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman was saying that the amendment is a probing amendment. It is clear that the conduct of mayoral referendums will be subject to regulations made under clause 41(3), which makes provision for referendums. Clause 92 deals with orders and regulations, and clause 92(5) will require that certain regulations and orders be subject to the draft affirmative procedure. The list of provisions in clause 92(5) includes regulations made under clause 41. Before they can be made and come into force, such regulations will therefore have to be laid in draft and approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.

<P>
Any local authority referendum that is not in accordance with those regulations will not be a valid referendum for the purposes of this part of the Bill. Therefore, an authority would not be able to rely on the result of such a referendum for the purposes of introducing an elected mayor, for example, but would have to hold a referendum in accordance with the rules. Similarly, a local authority could not rely on the result of such an informal referendum for the purposes of avoiding holding a formal referendum in accordance with the rules.

<P>
We will introduce amendments to this Bill or the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill, which deals with electoral procedures and is currently before the House. The amendments will ensure that, once established, the Electoral Commission will play a part in ensuring that referendums abide with the general rules set down in the Bill. For example, a referendum question must be asked in a form of which the Electoral Commission approves.

<P>
In the light of those comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 154, in page 17, line 34, leave out ``In'' and insert ``For the purpose of''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: Government amendments Nos. 159 to 161, 166, 168, 171 and 172.

<P>
Government new clause 13-Approval of outline fall-back proposals.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will begin with new clause 13, which completes the provisions dealing with our policy on the fall-back options to be implemented in the event that local people reject the proposals that are the subject of a referendum.

<P>
The new clause is necessary to prevent the need for the Secretary of State to make regulations, under either clause 11(6) or clause 29, to enable new fall-back arrangements which would not be needed if the referendum approved the main proposals. These are affirmative instruments, and this is, therefore, a device to ensure that councils, the Secretary of State and Parliament do not waste their time on regulations that might prove unnecessary.

<P>
The new clause provides that a council may apply to the Secretary of State for approval of outline fall-back proposals of a type not permitted by or under part II
 at that time, but which could be made available
 as alternative arrangements or as executive arrangements.

<P>
Subsection (2) enables the Secretary of State to give directions about the form and content of such applications. For example, we intend to require that an application must describe how such arrangements would enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability-in a similar way to new clause 12, which we debated earlier.

<P>
Subsection (3)(a) enables a council to use, for a referendum under clause 26, any outline fall-back proposals which are of a type not permitted by or under part II at that time, providing that they have been approved by the Secretary of State and whether or not the necessary regulations have been made. Subsection (3)(b) provides that the timetable for implementation of detailed fall-back proposals shall be extended to the extent that there is any delay in making the regulations necessary for a council to operate such arrangements. This is to prevent the possibility of a council breaching its statutory duty to implement detailed fall-back proposals in line with the timetable included in the outline fall-back proposals, if there is any delay in making the necessary regulations.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 161, 166, 168, 171 and 172 are consequential on new clause 13, and will enable this element of the fall-back process to be replicated for all other types of referendum that may be required under part II-for example, following a petition, direction, order or change between forms of arrangements. I am sure that right hon. and hon. Members will agree that these are sensible amendments, which will prevent valuable time being wasted on unnecessary legislation.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 154, 159 and 160 are also included in the group. Amendment No. 154 is a technical drafting amendment, which clarifies that the purpose of consulting under clause 26(3) is for drawing up outline fall-back proposals. Amendments Nos. 159 and 160 are minor drafting improvements to tidy up the enabling power in clause 28(1). I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>

I call that the ``abandon hope all ye who enter here'' subsection, because it suggests that once the fateful step is taken, there is no way back, and councils are stuck with it. I hope that the Minister will explain that there are alternative emergency exits from executive arrangements if they turn out to be the kind of unmitigated disaster that we fear, at least with regard to some authorities.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I am merely demonstrating my wakefulness, and do not want to get too involved in grammatical etymology. However, I suggest to the Minister that the subsection's reference to a local authority ``which pass a resolution'' commits violence against the English language. Why not use the phrase, ``which passes a resolution'', as would 99.999 per cent. recurring of the population?

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that while the phrase that he quoted is bad, it is nowhere near as bad as the phrase in an earlier part of the Bill about a local authority ``which are'' operating executive arrangements?

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Government are grammatically challenged.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I am not surprised by the amendment. Conservative Members have taken every available opportunity to try to change the Bill to introduce the loophole of an option to revert to the status quo of the committee system, which they seem to love so dearly. The amendment would ensure that executive arrangements, once in place, can cease-presumably, given what Conservative Members have said during previous debates, so that councils can return to the committee system.

<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne presented the amendment as a sensible safeguard against the possibility that the executive arrangements do not work. I do not agree with him. It is important that we move to executive arrangements, which will make councils' decision making more open, accountable and efficient. One of the worst things that we could do-which would guarantee that the arrangements do not fulfil their potential for working sensibly and comprehensively across the country-would be to include a provision to allow councils to revert to the old system. Councils that do not want the new arrangements to work would perhaps do their best to ensure that that happened.

<P>
We cannot accept the amendment. It is important that the arrangements go forward without including a provision that would enable councils to go backwards. If councils find that the executive arrangements are not working well, or feel that the system could be improved, regulations under clause 28 will allow them to change to different arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I can hear the door clanging shut on those hapless authorities. This is a one-way street, with no way out. If I press the amendment, the Minister will ensure that we are outvoted, so, extremely grudgingly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I should like to explore a little the meaning of the clause, to which the Minister recently referred. Will the Secretary of State be able to make regulations that overturn arrangements that were put in place after consultation? As I interpret the clause, it will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations that bring to an end a mayoral term, which presumably will have been the subject of a referendum. The clause is rather opaque-for instance, it suggests that existing arrangements may be replaced by new arrangements. What circumstances will be involved, what are the arrangements that can be replaced and what are the criteria for determining that arrangements are not succeeding?

<P>
The Minister has been confident about the fact that the measures are important and that the status quo-the existing system-does not provide a credible alternative. This is the first real admission that the new arrangements can go badly wrong.

<P>
Although I want the clause to stand part of the Bill, I hope that the Minister will explain the circumstances in which the Secretary of State might intervene, or in which his intervention might be sought. What arrangements will be replaced, and with what new arrangements? If a local authority has appointed a mayor-perhaps after the Secretary of State required that a referendum be held-will that mayoralty be subject to change under the provisions?

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> That will not be the case. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not be disappointed if I say that chapter 17 of the guidance describes in detail several eventualities and the procedures that a council may need to adopt if the executive arrangement that it had adopted, by resolution, is not working. I refer him to page 103 of the guidance, which describes the procedures that could be used, under the clause's provisions, if a council feels that its arrangements are not working.

<P>
In a sense, the clause has nothing to do with the Secretary of State's intervention-it will simply provide a power, in line with the guidance, that will enable a council that is coming to the view that its arrangements could be improved or are not working as satisfactorily as they might to take appropriate action. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman agrees to this sensible provision. We have every confidence in the use of executive arrangements to improve situations. We must make appropriate provision for councils that feel that circumstances could be further improved. It is important to include such a provision in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The answer may well be in the guidance, but when there are changes to new arrangements, will those arrangements have to be prescribed in the Bill, or will the Secretary of State be able to permit a local authority to adopt a new form that is not prescribed? I refer to the famous flexibility clause that we are all trying to track down.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> The new arrangements would have to conform to the Bill's provisions. When we come to clauses 29 and 30, we shall discuss the situation in which there has been a no vote in a referendum and other alternatives, which are not consistent with the Bill's principles or with current legislation, could be allowed through the enabling power of the Secretary of State. The changes that are proposed by councils that feel that their executive arrangements are not working properly must, in line with the clause's provisions and the procedures that are set out in the guidance, conform with arrangements that are described in the Bill.

<P>

<H4><center>Alternative arrangements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 162, in page 19, line 23, after ``efficient'' insert ``transparent''.

<P>
The amendment simply inserts the word ``transparent'' into the description of decision making in the clause. We have already used the relevant phrase in other parts of the Bill and we propose to insert the word to make the description consistent throughout.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We are, once again, in the realms of little magic words, such as ``openness'', ``accountability'' and ``transparency''. No one, least of all the Conservatives, could take umbrage at the use of the word ``efficient''. However, I wonder what the meaning of ``transparent'' is, in this context. What has the word ``open'' done to offend Ministers to prevent it from being inserted into the clause?

<P>
With or without the word ``transparent'', will the provisions of the clause pass the hole-in-the-road test? When we have finished and the Bill has passed into law, will someone who has a hole in the road outside his house have a better idea of who is responsible and to whom he should address his legitimate complaints? I refer also to the Camden situation, in which Camden council, under pressure from the Conservative opposition, engaged in a thorough consultation about the sort of structures that local people wanted. The Minister always comes to life when I mention Camden; I suspect that that is because they voted 40-odd to zero against the Government's proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Forty-three.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> They were whipped.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Do not start that again.

<P>
The consultation in Camden did reveal that people are not necessarily particularly bothered about who makes the decisions, except in so far as that knowledge helps them to influence the decisions and those who are making them. The evidence given to the Joint Select Committee includes the following contribution from Councillor Aileen Hammond:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In my ward when I went into meetings, after the options had been presented by officers  the first comment which cam up was, ``We are not interested in knowing who is making the decisions. We are interested in influencing them'', and that was the overwhelming view.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
On the basis that Councillor Hammond's experience is no different from that of the rest of us, we wonder why the word ``transparent'' is being imported into the clause and not the word ``open''. Ministers may not necessarily understand the differences between openness, transparency and accountability. I pointed that out earlier.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We are not going to agree about this. I certainly do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's contention that people are not concerned about who is responsible for decision taking and simply want to know when the decision will be made and how they can influence it prior to that. People want to know who is responsible for a decision. When they feel that the holes in the road are not being mended-to use his analogy-they want to know very much the identity of the person responsible for ensuring that the work is done and the quality of their environment is reasonable. They do not want to thrash around contacting ward councillors and working their way through the labyrinthine systems of offices, without ever really getting to know who is responsible, because the committee system never tells them.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has made much, on a number of occasions, of the Camden consultation. Not everyone thought that that was a model for consultation, as far as the outcome was concerned. There are questions about how representative of the people of Camden the views eventually expressed were. He may be interested to know that, in evidence submitted to the Joint Select Committee, even representatives of Camden borough council said that it was clear that responses were not proportionately distributed across the borough. White, fairly well-heeled people from social classes 1 and 2 were grossly over-represented, and people from minority ethnic communites who live in poorer parts of Camden were grossly under-represented. In describing Camden borough council's consultation model as a comprehensive one that should be emulated, the hon. Gentleman does no service to the consultation principle.

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I see the point that the Under-Secretary is making, and I understand why she wants to rubbish the Camden consulation process. Will she point out an exemplary Labour-controlled borough of whose consultation standards she approves?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We have consistently said that few councils have participated in the consultation that the guidance will require, or implemented executive arrangements in the exact way that the Bill will require. Although we could identify one or two councils that have tried very hard-Lewisham would be one-the consultation that the guidance will require will be comprehensive. It will have to be demonstrated that everything has been done to ensure that the consultation process has reached the parts of the community that do not respond easily to it, but whose interest in the council's ability to improve quality of life is perhaps greater than others.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has criticised the use of the words ``efficient'', ``transparent'' and ``accountable'', but according to the principle of transparency, for example, people will know who does what in terms of decision making. The use of those three words reflect the Joint Select Committee's view of what decision making ought to be. Boroughs should aspire to a process that is efficient, transparent and accountable, and, in the light of those comments, I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept the amendment.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 29, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 30</center></H4>
<H4><center>Operation of alternative arrangements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 20, line 1, at beginning insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A local authority may not operate alternative arrangements unless required to do so by virtue of any provision made by or under this Part.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is another technical amendment. It makes it clear that, under the Bill, the alternative arrangements referred to in clauses 29 and 30 may be operated by a local authority only if required to do so by the provisions in, or under, part II. In other words, if made available by the Secretary of State, alternative arrangements can be operated only following a referendum defeat.

<P>
As we have said on a number of occasions, we believe that executive arrangements are the most efficient, transparent and accountable arrangements. It ought not to be possible for councils to operate arrangements without a separate executive, unless local people have specifically rejected such an option in a referendum in which an alternative was made clear. The amendment reaffirms that, under the Bill, councils will be assisted in interpreting the legislation, and I hope that members of the Committee will not oppose it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 20, line 28, after ``operate'', insert ``or cease to operate''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 250, in clause 32, page 21, line 25, after ``operate'', insert ``or cease to operate''.

<P>
No. 251, in clause 33, page 22, line 1, after ``operate'', insert ``or cease to operate''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall not detain the Committee too long on this amendment. Clause 31 deals with referendums following petitions. Yet again we are trying to be helpful and realistic in steering the Government away from the dogmatic one-way street of these changes. We want to open their eyes to the unpalatable, but possible, chance that the new arrangements may not work and that some people may seek to have them reversed subsequently.

<P>
The three amendments are the same and apply to clauses 31, 32 and 33. After ``the authority should operate'' we add ``or cease to operate''. Surely there is a case for equality of arms. If a petition can trigger a referendum in order to set up new executive structures, electors should have the right to petition for a reversal of such arrangements if they prove to be unpopular or unsuccessful.

<P>
Already, as we have heard, the Secretary of State has large powers to decide how and when referendums are held, what the question should be and what actions the local authority must take before and afterwards. We seek to complete the Government's equation by establishing what will happen if the arrangements do not prove satisfactory or acceptable to the electorate. I hope that the Minister will have no problem in adopting all three amendments.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know that these or similar amendments were debated on a number of occasions in another place. As my colleague, Lord Whitty, made clear, we do not accept that it should be possible for local people to force a referendum to abandon executive arrangements with an elected mayor through a petition. We certainly do not accept that the Secretary of State should have such power.

<P>
In such a situation, local people would already have approved the arrangements for an elected mayor twice. First, the arrangements would have been approved by a referendum, and, secondly, the mayor's mandate would have been approved through the mayoral election. It would be completely wrong for the Secretary of State to be able to force a referendum to abandon a mayoral system after not one, but two such expressions of public opinion.

<P>
The situation envisaged by the hon. Gentleman is, of course, somewhat different from that of a petition to move to arrangements including an elected mayor. In that situation, local people would normally have expressed their support through a referendum for the arrangements in operation at the time.

<P>
Opinion poll evidence repeatedly shows that many people favour arrangements with an elected mayor. I believe that there ought to be a referendum; that is the right way to proceed and the Bill provides for it. There is, of course, the possibility that local people could petition the council for a referendum to change the form of executive arrangements that the council is operating. Provided that five years have passed since the previous referendum, the authority will, of course, be able to act on such a petition.

<P>
In addition, as long as five years have passed from the previous referendum, it would also be open to the authority voluntarily to draw up proposals and hold a referendum to change from executive arrangements involving a mayor to different executive arrangements. They will, of course, have to judge whether public opinion is such that it would be right to hold such a referendum, despite the approval their existing arrangements have had from local people on at least two occasions.

<P>
Other considerations also argue against a system such as that proposed by the hon. Gentleman. In response to the Joint Committee we have put in place the arrangements for fall-back proposals for referendums to change to a form of constitution involving an elected mayor. Those arrangements will ensure that local people know the exact result of their votes. Vote ``yes'' and the main proposals will be implemented; vote ``no'' and the fall-back will be implemented.

<P>
Under the hon. Gentleman's proposed system, it is not clear what would happen if people voted to abandon the arrangements. As I explained, what the hon. Gentleman really wants is already provided for in the Bill and I do not believe that hon. Members would want to give powers to the Secretary of State to over-ride the express will of the people.

<P>
Therefore, I strongly urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 249 and not to proceed with amendments Nos. 250 and 251.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I will not force the matter to a vote, although the Minister's reply was not satisfactory. I was genuinely seeking to be helpful in her cause. Due to the novelty of the system, which involves a distinct shift of power, members of local electorates could be deterred from voting for such arrangements in a referendum if they cannot see an exit should they go wrong. Simply saying, ``Additional clauses come in after five years'' is not sufficient. The Minister's argument was that effectively there would have been a double endorsement for the new system, through a referendum and, de facto, through the election of a mayor. In that case, what about having a double requirement for a petition to force the exit-two petitions, or double the number of signatories required to show that the strength of feeling was sufficient among the electorate to justify a referendum? The provision smacks of favouritism for these systems; the same arrangements should exist for going into the new set-up and for abandoning it if it does not work.

<P>
The Minister ended by saying that if there were a vote to abandon the arrangement, it is not clear what would happen next. That is entirely the Government's fault. It is up to them to set out the ground rules for such a scenario. They cannot simply say, ``We have not thought about it because it is such a Doomsday scenario.'' The longer the system goes on, the more possible it is for that to happen if it proves not to be the panacea to all the ills of local government. It is the responsibility of the Government to provide clarity.

<P>
The Minister was simply repeating the argument that we have heard in another place and it has not improved. She has not made a sufficient case against our amendment, but no doubt we shall return to this on Report and in the meantime I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A referendum under this Part shall not be binding on the authority unless 40 per cent. of the persons entitled to vote in the referendum shall have voted in favour of the proposition set out in the referendum'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The amendments give the Government an opportunity to state their position on turnout levels at referendums-preferably briefly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall not be quite so brief. The spirit of our amendment is the same as that in those tabled by the Liberal Democrats. It concerns different thresholds. The amendment seeks to add to the referendum requirements a 40 per cent. threshold for voter turnout.

<P>
The idea of a directly elected mayor is supposed to revive flagging interest in local democracy and improve voter participation, but if turnout in a referendum proposing the appointment of a mayor merely mirrors that in the local elections, it can be argued that it has singularly failed to achieve that. The proposed higher threshold would ensure that there was broadly based support for fundamental change. It should be up to its proponents to demonstrate the desirability of the proposal to as large a number of the electorate as possible. A higher threshold related to the number of eligible voters rather than just to votes cast would have that effect.

<P>
As the Joint Select Committee pointed out, there are currently no specifications for turnout, so the decision could be taken on a tiny vote-hardly an endorsement of major change. If the new structures are to be given proper legitimacy, it is vital that there is a serious turnout. The Government will have to do much better than the 33 per cent. turnout that we saw for the London mayoral elections. In no way could that be construed as a vindication of the argument that London's electors were slavering at the mouth for the change that has now been imposed on them.

<P>
If we set a 40 per cent. threshold, the burden of proof in respect of a desire for change would fall on its proponents. It would be a more ringing endorsement if something at least approaching a majority of those entitled to vote, if not an actual majority, were in favour of the changes.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman is providing us with an interesting insight into where the Opposition are seeking to move. This morning he was extolling the virtues of Baroness Thatcher and her support for local government. She needed no threshold of any sort to abolish metropolitan councils and the GLC, so the Opposition are obviously revising yet another area of their policy. However, in response to the notable contribution from the hon. Member for Bath, I shall not pursue that.

<P>
The Government do not accept that there should be any thresholds for referendums held under part II of the Bill-whether based on those voting in favour, as in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, or on overall turnout, as in the other amendments. Moreover, the Joint Select Committee, referred to by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, considered the idea of thresholds, but did not recommend that there should be any. We do not believe that any threshold should be required, other than that of the majority of people voting in the referendum of course. There is little precedent for referendums in the UK. The only example that springs to mind is that of the Scottish devolution referendum held in the 1970s. The majority of those voting supported devolution, but the turnout threshold was not reached. The result was confusion for the electorate and a great deal of unnecessary political angst and recrimination. I suspect that subsequently the Conservative party suffered because people in Scotland did not feel that their voice was being listened to.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggests that moving to arrangements that involve an elected mayor is a significant change in local governance and should have widespread support in a referendum. I hope that that would happen. However, when there was a change in political control in one council where the turn-out was 6 per cent., I did not hear the hon. Gentleman complaining, yet that was significant for local governance.

<P>
There is, of course, no turn-out threshold for local elections, which makes me very frustrated, but I realise, having given it serious consideration, that it would create immense difficulties for local government. I have been tempted to apply a threshold, but I have to resist temptation on this occasion because I do not believe that it is in the interests of local government to begin to tinker with that. Our aim is to revive interest in local government in various ways and to persuade the electorate that it is worth turning out to vote. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 326.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister should realise, when reflecting upon a change of council control by by-election, that there is a difference between government and governance. She said that there had been a change of governance; there is no change of governance at all at a by-election. The council is ruled by exactly the same rules and principles, whoever is in control. That is not a change of governance in the slightest, but a change of government locally. The term ``governance'' is used constantly by this so-called modernising Government as a sort of mantra. Let us use it in its proper context instead of applying it in that slipshod manner.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham used a significant word-``legitimacy''. The rules that we are considering could mean that a petition representing 5 per cent. of the electorate, followed by a referendum representing even fewer citizens could effect a fundamental change in the way they are governed. What sort of legitimacy does the Minister think could possibly be claimed for the new arrangements that she is so anxious to bring in and to give a fair wind to, on the basis of results that could be engineered by a handful of local activists, to the almost entire indifference of a large part of the population? That is a serious problem and it is not purely academic. We all know of institutions where the people doubt the legitimacy of what is at stake. The European Parliament is one of them. One might even question the legitimacy of the referendum on the Welsh Assembly in Wales.

<P>
One should question whether it is right for councils to usher in new arrangements with such minimal expressions of interest. The Minister said that she had been tempted by thresholds. For once, she should succumb to her temptations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> She is a Methodist.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I realise that Methodists have difficulty with temptation, but if the Minister wants the new system to work, it should be demonstrated to have at least the same sort of support as a normal election-which is, after all, pretty modest. She could then claim as fair a wind as it is likely to get. When one is talking about 5 per cent. support engendering another 5 or 6 per cent., that is starting from practically nothing. People would have serious doubts about it and their confidence would take a knock.

<P>
When I first stood for the European Parliament, the turnout was 32 or 33 per cent. and I could tell myself that I had just as much legitimacy as a Westminster Member of Parliament who had been elected on a 70 to 75 per cent. turnout. Constitutionally I had, but in my heart I wished I had had that sort of turnout and won by a smaller majority because I would have felt that I had more oomph and welly-to use a Yorkshire expression-when I went to do my job. That is, after all, what councils need at the moment.

<P>
I invite the Minister to speculate on what the turnout will be at the second election for the mayor of London.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Clearly, the Minister does not wish to pick up the challenge from the right hon. Gentleman. I was surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman urging the Minister to give into temptation, particularly when, at column 221 in our deliberations on 18 May, he admitted that he was not just a Methodist but ``a Primitive Methodist''. Only three days ago, I was involved in a lengthy discussion of another matter concerning the value or otherwise of referendums and the turnout levels that should possibly be required. I do not intend to give in to the temptation to describe to the Committee where that took place or the details. Suffice it to say that as a result of that discussion, I am somewhat biased towards the Minister's view and I agree that it would perhaps be best on this occasion not to give in to temptation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I fear that Liberal Democrat Opposition colleagues have been bought off too easily by the Government on this. I am saddened that the Minister did not succumb to temptation. I was hoping for some sort of bargaining counter, so that even if she did not agree with the 40 per cent. threshold, she might make an opening gambit and we could come up with a deal in the end.

<P>
The Minister used the term ``tinkering with'' the idea of thresholds, which was telling. It is not tinkering. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon rightly said, it concerns the legitimacy of the new system. That shows that the numbers do not matter at all to the Government. They are so desperate to get this legislation through that they do not care how few people endorse it, as opposed to the vast majority who may well not turn up to do so.

<P>
If the Government are prepared to accept such a low mandate for this legislation, it does not bode well for other referendums that they may or may not be proposing on major constitutional issues, such as acceptance of the euro. What, if any, thresholds will be set for that? If this example is anything to go by, there will be no threshold at all and major constitutional change-affecting the whole country, not just local government-could go through by default. We have not been bought off. However, although we are not happy, we will not move our amendments.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(Approval of outline fall-back proposals)'.-[Ms Armstrong.]<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 269, in page 21, line 18, leave out ``and (unless regulations otherwise provide) is to be 5 per cent.'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and must not be less than 10 per cent.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would increase the percentage of electors needed to sign a petition to trigger a referendum from 5 per cent. to 10 per cent. As, I gather, also came out in the report of the Joint Select Committee, many authorities expressed a concern that a 5 per cent. figure is too easily achievable, with the result that a local authority and, hence council tax payers, might be put to great expense for a referendum supported by few people. We are trying to help by giving more credibility to the otherwise limp calculations that have gone into this part of the clause. As it stands, in any case there is nothing to stop the Secretary of State lowering the 5 per cent. threshold by regulations. Once he has done that, how much lower will he go to ensure that he gets the changes through? We do not want the sort of gerrymandering by the Government that it is suggested happened with the Ripon referendum on grammar schools. There needs to be a decent threshold that will trigger a referendum, otherwise all the problems expressed by local government may ensue.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Local people have a right to be governed in the way they want. This is not about what Government say, but how local people express what they would like when they feel the council is not listening to them. Opinion polls repeatedly show that the majority of local people, certainly in our cities, believe there should be referendums on the way forward in terms of governance. I apologise to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. He is absolutely right, I was being far too casual. None-the-less, a change of control in an area is significant, yet we allow that to take place on a turnout as low as 6 per cent.

<P>
If, following consultation, councils implement arrangements that do not reflect public opinion, there needs to be some way for local people to force their hand. That is what the petitioning process is all about. Hon. Members will know that there has been a Liverpool Democracy Commission, which had alongside it a citizens' jury and which undertook, extensive consultation throughout the city. It recommended a raft of changes. As there was conflict within the ruling group as to how to respond, the group has now said that it will not consider the changes until, I think, autumn 2002. I may be wrong, it may be autumn 2001-whichever it is, it is a long time from the initial consultation and recommendations. That is not fair to people who took a serious interest in what was going on. A delicate balance is to be struck between setting a threshold too high for local people to be able to reach it within a reasonable time scale and setting it too low so that councils would be forced into referendums at a cost to local taxpayers, which, if defeated, would be nugatory.

<P>
We believe that 5 per cent. is about right. It is not an insiginificant threshold. For example, in Birmingham it would be more than 35,000 signatures and even in small councils it would be many thousands. Ten per cent. would, in our view, be too high, particularly in large authorities. In the consultation on the draft Bill, there were those who advocated thresholds as low as 1 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> To take an exact parallel, why did the Government insist on a 20 per cent. threshold for a petition to force a ballot on the future of grammar schools?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That was a decision among a much smaller number of people. To raise even a 20 per cent. petition in Ripon was not a massively difficult exercise. To raise 35,000 signatures in Birmingham would represent a significant declaration of interest. That is where the argument lies. Many of those who advocate thresholds higher than 5 per cent. do not want to face
 a referendum at all. That only reinforces the Government's position that local people should not find it too difficult to produce a petition to trigger a referendum.

<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Moreover, the Joint Select Committee recommended that the threshold should be kept under review, which we readily accepted. Keeping such a matter under review implies that there must be the facility to act on the review's findings and increase or decrease the threshold of the light of experience. Therefore, the amendment is too restrictive and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Again, the Minister has not made a terribly telling case and she has certainly revealed inconsistencies. One always hears alarm bells ringing when a Minister grabs for the phrase, ``Opinion polls seems to show  '' However, she said that most people believe that we should have referendums, so there should be no problem rustling up the 10 per cent. of electors required to trigger a referendum or the 40 per cent. threshold that we have just suggested for the referendum.

<P>
This is a question of finding a balance that does not impose excessive costs on local authorities, particularly smaller authorities, which the Minister said will require several thousand signatures. We had no trouble obtaining 3 million signatures nationally on the petition against the Government's changes to benefit payments through post offices. In my constituency, we achieved several thousand with no effort whatever. Therefore, our proposal is not such a tall order. The Government have set the wrong figure and got the balance wrong. However, in the interests of returning to the issue on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> These are technical drafting amendments, which ensure that the enabling power in clause 32 for the Secretary of State to direct a referendum to take place in circumstances specified in regulations allows the direction to specify the form of executive arrangements to be the subject of the referendum. The amendments ensure that the enabling power is specific in that respect, to avoid difficulties in interpretation later. They simply clarify the scope of the power and I hope that hon. Members will accept them.

 32(2)(a). Why does the Minister want to be able to provide for the dates of referendums? Why should Ministers get involved in that? Does the Government, in a desperate attempt to bolster the policy, have it in mind to order that all referendums take place on the same day, backed by a massive publicity campaign funded by central Government?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman is interested in the issue, because he has tabled starred amendments. If I explain the problems with those amendments, I will also answer his question. He would delete the provisions that enable the regulations and orders to be made under the clauses to specify the date on which a referendum must be held. However, the ability to specify the date of a required referendum is important. Let us take the example of referendums required by order under clause 33. Depending on the circumstances in which an order is made, it may be sensible to provide for all the referendums to be held at the same time. That would help raise awareness about the fact that referendums were taking place, which the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon mentioned.

<P>
If an order required all London boroughs to hold referendums on having an elected mayor-I am not saying that we have this in mind-it would be ludicrous for those 32 borooughs to hold their referendums on different days over a three-month period, with two or three each week in different parts of the city. That would be somewhat confusing for readers of the Evening Standard. We are trying to ensure that people have information. Knowing that referendums are taking place, the electorate would find it convenient if all the referendums were held on the same day.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Clearly, the Minister is moving on to arguments that she will repeat in a few minutes on the next string of amendments. To save the Committee's time, I will ask her one question. Does she believe that all the referendums taking place on the same day-for all councils or a group of councils in the same category-will mean that the outcome is largely determined by what is, in effect, an opinion polling of people's views about the Government of the day and by media pressure? The outcome will not be based on the views of local people about issues that affect them locally.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That is always a possibility with local elections. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is one reason why the Government sought to introduce changes in electoral procedures to enable elections to be held on different days and so forth. The provision in the clause will allow my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to make provision for the date on which a referendum must be held. However, that does not mean that he would always ensure that referendums were held on the same day or that a class of authorities held referendums. The power simply exists.

<P>
We want to ensure that referendums are held at appropriate times. If an authority is forced into a referendum through a petition, but clearly does not want it to work, it could have elections on the first Thursday in May: but could hold the referendum 10 days later, or two days earlier. That would clearly undermine the intention of the petitioners that a referendum should be a serious effort to give people a say.

<P>
Conservative members will say that the electorate should comply with the date of the election. They want the election to be ordered for the convenience of the council, not the electroate. If a referendum is intended for spring, it should take place on the normal local election day. We want to ensure that that happens and that a council cannot be ``clever'' and stage it on another day in the belief that fewer people will know about it and come out to vote.

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We are talking about a flagship Government policy, through which the Minister hopes that many local people in different areas will enthusiastically pursue the option. Is she not worried about taking a mechanistic view in trying to avoid a referendum on a wet Thursday in Dudley, for example? It could be held on a Saturday or a Sunday in the hope of a better turn-out. Ultimately, people will either be enthusiastic or not. If not, they are likely to stay at home whatever day the referendum is held.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I agree that there is always a possibility that people will stay at home whatever, but if the referendum were called on Christmas eve, for example, I suspect that the turn-out would not be impressive, however keen people were to have a say. We are simply trying to build some sense and sensibility into the arrangements and not to be wayward as Conservative members tempt us to be once again.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> First, I should like to salute the British electorate. When the electorate has decided that it does not want to vote, it is determined not to do so. That is a healthy sign. Out of all the super-duper experiments, the only one that worked was when the vote was carried to the electorate on a plate-through a postal vote. I regret that, because voting is a special activity and it should require making a special effort. I do not agree with handing people votes like something out of a lottery posted in Amsterdam, which offers all sorts of wonderful goodies as long as one buys a special form of thermal underwear.

<P>
Underlying the Minister's remarks is a wonderful sense of governmental superiority, ``We have ways of mating you innovate'' [Hon. Members: ``Mating?''] No, I do not wish to be too topical; we should move away from that subject immediately. If people or the council do not raise a petition voluntarily, the Government are jolly well going to ensure that they raise it. They want to oblige people to hold the council to a referendum.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> That is what the clause states-that the Government will, by order of regulation, require referendums to be held. That is how I read it. I cannot understand how other meanings could be read from it. My key question is, what prompts the Government intervention?

<P>
At the outset of the Bill, I asked the minister if she would calrify, at the appropriate time, which councils should have the blessings of an elected mayor bestowed upon them. The Secretary of State would presumably take action to prompt a referendum. I still want an answer to my question. The provision would not be in the Bill unless the Government believed that it was appropriate for certain local authorities. Which local authorities does the Minister believe should have an elected mayor? Under what circumstances will intervention be triggered, with the Government assuming that they know best?

<P>
The clause is not one to pass through quickly. I do not want to sound like my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), but I have great sympathy with finding out what the provisions mean in practice. In clauses 32 and 33, I am unclear about the significance of the difference between order and regulation-the main difference between them. When, and for what purposes, will the Government trigger the clauses? How many local authorities will be involved? The measure is significant and will require people to act in a way that they might not choose otherwise.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will respond to the right hon. Gentleman, because it is important that right hon. and hon. members understand the clause. If the Government thought that they knew best, they would impose a system on any local authority that failed to comply with the legislation. The Government are not doing that.

<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
If a local authority has taken no action to comply with the legislation, the clause will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to direct an authority to hold a referendum on executive arrangements, which may take any of the forms set out in clause 11. The rgulations will specify the circumstances in which the Secretary of State can invoke the power to require a local authority to hold a referendum.. They will also include provisions on the timing of the referendum and the action to be taken by the local authority. The regulations will prescribe what an authority must do on receiving direction.

<P>
We have made available a draft of the regulations for England, to give the Committee a clear picture of the circumstances in which we envisage using the power. We would use it if an authority did not comply with the legislation or the guidance in drawing up its proposals, or if it did not have regard to the wishes of local people, following consultation. The power is necessary to deal with such cases of abuse and to avoid resorting to the courts when an authority has not complied with the legislation.

<P>
There is no hidden agenda behind the clause. It will deal with abuse or inertia on the part of local authorities when moving to executive arrangements. It is a safeguard to ensure that councils comply with the legislation and progress to new constitutions at a reasonable pace. We will not, and could not, use the power to arbitrarily require local authorities to hold referendums.

<P>
I understand the concern of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. He is right to voice it, but I hope that he is reassured. The Secretary of State will not impose a system, but if a council does not comply with the Bill, he will put the matter to the people of the area. However, he will not take precipitate action.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I apologise for speaking again, but I have not yet heard the answer to my question. Will the Secretary of State require the local authority to decide the form of the executive arrangements that it will offer to the electorate? How much time must pass before the Secretary of State concludes that the local authority is deliberately wasting time? After he reaches such a conclusion, how much time will be allowed for the local authority to produce its proposals, presumably after consultation, and for the referendum to take place?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Secretary of State will ensure that the council abides by the legislation. He could allow or encourage the council to draw up proposals in line with the Bill, following consultation. If the council refuses to do that, he could prepare proposals to be put in a referendum himself. We have no specific timing requirements, but we have made it clear that the local authority will have sufficient time to comply with the legislation. I mean a substantial amount of time, not a few months, but I have not yet specified how long because consultation will take longer in some areas. We need to be sure that public consultation is full and open.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If the council has been deleterious and the Secretary of State decides the form to be put before the electorate, on what basis will he decide?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> All that the Secretary of State can require is a referendum. The Bill provides that if the local people rejected the result of a referendum, certain steps would be taken locally. Clearly, intervention would take place only if serious concerns arose and it would be necessary to ensure that the local authority was working with the Government.

<P>
Perhaps I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. If a direction is made, within one month of it the authority must publish in at least one newspaper in its area a notice that sets out the terms of the direction. The notice must state that is has been received from the Secretary of State requiring a referendum; the constitutional change that will be the subject of it; that a referendum will be held; the date of it and any other factual information relating to the direction so far as it is presented fairly. We are trying to introduce a system in which intervention will not be necessary, but we must spell out what would happen if it was.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don. Foster:</B> I was happy to let the debate between the Minister and the right hon. Gentleman continue. Having reflected on what has been said, however, am I to understand that the circumstances in which clause 32 is likely to be invoked would be when a local authority effectively refused to take any action on the establishment of executive arrangements? In such circumstances, the Secretary of State's requiring a referendum under the powers in the clause is one part of the action. However, the Minister said that the Secretary of State has no powers to determine which of the various options-which of the models-are to be put forward in the referendum. Given that we are talking about a council that would have been unwilling to take such action, I think that considerable difficulty would arise. The Minister stated categorically that the Secretary of State would have no intention of intervening to resolve the problem, so how would it be resolved?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I said that we would intervene only when there were clear grounds for doing so, and that we would not intervene happily, as it were. The Secretary of State would have the power to determine what was put in the referendum for the people if the authority had not been involved in a consultation. Chapter 15 of the guidance suggests that the sonsultation could result in a proposal that the public supported but the council refused to implement. If that happened, the Secretary of State would direct that the option supported by the public was the option that should be put in the referendum. I hope that that clarifies the matter.

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It could be that the local authority had not acted or consulted, but the Secretary of State would have the power, according to the right hon. Lady, to determine the question that should be asked in the referendum. That is what I understood her to say. On what basis will the Secretary of State determine what form of executive arrangements he will put to the electorate?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We want to get to a position where the council acts and engages in consultation. It will, therefore, have to draw up plans for consultation and ensure that it is undertaken. The direction may well tell the council that because it has not done that previously, it must do so, and consult on this and this option. The referendum would then take place. Right hon. and hon. Members will see that the draft guidance lays out each set of requirements and that there are many varieties of content of a direction. I realise that they are questioning because they are anxious to understand the procedure. I hope that what I have explained, together with what is written in the guidance, will help them.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`always having regard to the requirement that no more than three local authorities shall be required by the Secretary of State to hold such a referendum within any one calendar year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>


<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The amendment gives us another opportunity to explore the same points in a little more detail. This is not so much in respect of the Secretary of State's ability to make regulations to force a referendum on an individual council but in respect of his or her potential power by order, as opposed to regulation, to require all councils to have referendums or a class of councils to do so, possibly all on the same day.

<P>
Amendment No. 288 comes back to consultation. It would make it a requirement on the Secretary of State, before going through the process, to consult in each relevant area. I think that the Minister is telling me that that will be a requirement anyway so I hope that she will accept the amendment. The other three amendments touch on the question whether it is sensible for all referendums to take place on the same day. Effectively the amendments would reject that, and say that no more than three should take place on any one day. If we had a super Thursday referendum, the decision would not be based on issues that affected each locality but would effectively be about the popularity of the Government of the day and any other major issues being debated. It would be significantly affected by the national media.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If many referendums were held on the same day, would not it be inevitable that the Government would urge a yes vote, the Opposition parties might urge a no vote and the ability to differentiate between a good case in one place and a bad case in another would be lost because it would naturally become a sort of national campaign?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Indeed, that is the point that I was making. The Minister has indicated her unwillingness to accept the amendments. It has just been pointed out to me that we are in difficulty if I do not shut up before 
<P>
<H5>7.30 pm.</H5>
<p> We may have an opportunity to come back to these issues. No doubt the Minister will reply briefly after which I shall seek the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. I am unable to accept the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> With the desperate hope, shared, I know, by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, that we shall be able to return to this important issue, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
