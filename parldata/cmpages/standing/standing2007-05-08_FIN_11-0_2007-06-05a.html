					<a name="07060559000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the two Government
amendments and I shall say a few words about what we are doing with
schedule 19. The amendments will make minor drafting changes. Amendment
No. 134 clarifies the fact that there will be no further charge to
inheritance tax on the death of a dependant where the left-over funds
in an alternatively secured pension&#151;ASP&#151;were chargeable
to inheritance tax on the death of a scheme member.
AmendmentNo. 135 ensures that the changes to remove an option
to transfer funds on death from an ASP fund will not affect any members
with ASPs who died before 6 April
2007.</div>
					<a name="07060559000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
shall briefly remind the Committee of the principles that we have set
out in relation to pensions tax relief. The key point is that generous
tax relief is provided to encourage and support pension saving that
will produce 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>an income in retirement. Pensions tax relief is intended neither to
support pre-retirement incomes, nor to support open-ended asset
accumulation or bequests. Pension savings are necessarily less flexible
than other savings&#151;they are locked away until
retirement&#151;which is why it is right to provide favourable tax
treatment for pensions
savings.</div>
					<a name="07060559000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005-06,
the tax incentives to encourage people to save for retirement totalled
about &#163;14 billion. The best way to secure an income in
retirement is via a scheme pension or an annuity. At the time of the
2006 pre-Budget report, we published a paper on the annuities market
that explained the underlying policy and the academic evidence base for
that policy, and responded in detail to the views of the Pensions
Commission on that
area.</div>
					<a name="07060559000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we developed
our proposals for the new pensions tax regime, the A-day regime, we
received a number of representations from groups with principled,
religious objections to the pooling of mortality risk in annuities.
Therefore, in the December 2003 consultation document
&#147;Simplifying the taxation of pensions&#148;, the Government
set out our proposals for the ASP. That option and the rules that apply
to the sums remaining on the death of member of an ASP were enacted in
the Finance Act 2004. Our intentions in doing that were very clear, but
it was apparent that some people wanted to use ASPs for uses other than
providing a
pension.</div>
					<a name="07060559000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some changes
were therefore announced in the pre-Budget report in 2006. I will
remind the Committee of what it
said:</div>
					<a name="07060559000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In line
with the principle that pensions tax relief is provided to produce an
income in retirement, the Government will bring forward legislation to
make changes to the rules governing Alternatively Secured Pensions
(ASPs). This will introduce a new requirement to withdraw a minimum
level of income each year from an ASP fund. The facility to transfer
funds on death as a lump sum to pension funds of other members of the
scheme will be removed from the authorised payments rules, with these
payments attracting an unauthorised payments
charge.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 68 and
schedule 19 change the ASP rules in line with the announcements that we
have made. I would be very happy to go through the detail of the
proposals, but for now I simply commend the amendments and the schedule
to the
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07060559000432"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con):
						May I, too,
welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Gale? It is a remarkable
testament to the lure of the Committee that my hon. Friend the Member
for Rayleigh, now the shadow Minister for Europe, has come back to
enjoy the proceedings for one last time. We look forward to the debut
of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire later this
week, who has joined our Front-Bench
team.</div>
					<a name="07060559000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
seems like only a year ago that we last discussed the taxation of ASPs.
I then debated with the Economic Secretary, and I had rather hoped for
a re-run, but I understand that he is currently in Luxemburg at the
ECOFIN meeting, so the Chief Secretary will be dealing with this issue.
It is quite remarkable that it is only a year since we last debated
these changes, and at that time the House and the Government had
settled views on what was the appropriate rate of taxation for ASPs,
yet here we are, a year later, with yet another U-turn on pensions
policy, discussing a different way of taxing ASPs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>
					<a name="07060559000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the nature of the Chief
Secretary&#146;s introduction, we are effectively having a stand part
debate here. I will ask him to respond to some particular issues in
detail later, but it is worth noting, by way of introduction, that the
issue of compulsory annuitisation and the role that ASPs play in
tackling it continues to create interest in this House and in the other
place. Indeed, on Second Reading of the Pensions Bill just before the
recess, Baroness Hollis, a former Minister at the Department for Work
and Pensions,
stated:</div>
					<a name="07060559000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
others have already said, given the growth of DC schemes we need a
fresh look at the annuities-at-75 rule, which is increasingly absurd.
After all, a man on median earnings, contracted in, after 40 years on 4
per cent. plus 4 per cent. contribution&#151;a very modest
scheme&#151;will have a DC pot of &#163;240,000, &#163;100,000
more than necessary to float him off income-related benefits if he
annuitised to that degree... So this is not&#151;I repeat,
not&#151;a matter only for the rich any more, but for those on
average earnings and a standard rate tax.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 14 May 2007; Vol. 692, c.
39-40.]</div>
					<a name="07060559000037"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: justify;">I think
that the noble Lady was right. In the past, the Government have
criticised moves to end compulsory annuitisation on the back of the
argument that it is there only to help the wealthy, but as she rightly
said, the growth of defined contribution schemes and the move away from
defined benefit schemes means that more and more people have an
interest in compulsory annuitisation at 75, and it will be a growing
issue. The Chief Secretary explained how the Government&#146;s
thinking on this issue has evolved over the last few months and rightly
highlighted the fact that the genesis of this measure came from the
theological concerns of the Plymouth Brethren, who objected to the
pooling of mortality.</div>
					<a name="07060559000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly, the Treasury
considered, in the regulatory impact assessment, ending the scheme or
restricting discrimination on the grounds of religion, but thankfully
that idea was dismissed. In looking at how this product should be sold,
at one stage, the Financial Services Authority considered, and issued
guidance, that financial advisers should inquire about the religious
beliefs of potential purchasers of ASPs. That indicates that the debate
that took place last summer and in the autumn became rather overheated
and rather too focused on the origin of the idea of why we should have
ASPs, rather than on thinking about how best to put the policy into
practice.</div>
					<a name="07060559000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could talk
about those arguments at some length, but I suspect that this is
probably not the occasion to do so. There may be an opportunity to
rehearse those arguments at a later stage. I want to concentrate
instead on the particular changes that are being made by schedule 19. I
understand the reasons for the Chief Secretary tabling the amendments
and I have no particular quibbles with them, but I want to focus on a
number of issues.</div>
					<a name="07060559000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first issue is how the schedule introduces new rules on the minimum
income that can be drawn down from a fund, as well as increasing the
maximum draw-down. It introduces a minimum of 55 per cent. and raises
the maximum from 70 to 90 per cent. Those are the Government
Actuary&#146;s Department rates, as set at the age of 75, but people
who have ASPs get older, and there is a serious argument to be made for
reviewing the rates that can be used so that the draw-down is based not
on GAD rates at 75, but on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>ASP member&#146;s actual age. As someone gets older, the opportunity
to withdraw funds from their ASP will increase and my concern is that,
by not allowing that flexibility to change or for people to draw down
more later in life, the unutilised pot that is left on death will
grow.</div>
					<a name="07060559000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government increased the rates used for the ages of 75, 85 or 95, that
would give the ASP holder the opportunity to withdraw more of their
income from the plan and to ensure that there was very little of it
left at the time of death. The Government&#146;s objective of using
tax-relief savings to meet income in retirement would be achieved more
fully than under their current
proposals.</div>
					<a name="07060559000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
comment that has been made about the draw-down rules is that for
unsecured pensions&#151;the situation that arises before the
age of 75&#151;the maximum draw-down is not 90 but 120 per cent. of
the GAD rate. There does appear to be a mismatch, or a discontinuity,
between the rules that apply for unsecured pensions and those for ASPs.
It would be helpful if the Chief Secretary addressed the reason for
that inconsistency between the draw-down rules for ASPs and USPs, and
also explained why there is not an uprating or revision of the maximum
draw-down based on someone&#146;s actual age, rather than the rates
set at the age of
75.</div>
					<a name="07060559000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point
is about the exit charge on death. Effectively, the Bill introduces an
82 per cent. tax charge on death when the member dies and there are no
financial dependants, or where the balance of the pot does not go to a
charity. The 82 per cent. charge arises because there is both an
inheritance tax charge of 40 per cent. and a charge of 55 per cent. on
the unutilised costs. The 55 per cent. charge normally applies where
the value of a pension fund exceeds the lifetime allowance. That
appears to be quite a high charge and has certainly caused some comment
among financial advisers as to why a 55 per cent. charge is applied in
addition to the 40 per cent.
charge.</div>

					<a name="07060559000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
understand it if the Chief Secretary said that, based on the
Government&#146;s principle that tax relief savings should not be
used to fund benefits or to enable a pension pot to be passed from a
person to members of their family, particularly where there are no
financial dependants, it is important to recover all the tax relief
gained or obtained by any pension fund member. I could accept
that&#151;it would be appropriate to try to claw back that tax
relief. I understand that that tax relief is clawed back at a rate of
about 55 per cent. That goes back to the situation in which the pension
fund value exceeds the lifetime
allowance.</div>
					<a name="07060559000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful if the Chief Secretary advised the Committee at what rate the
Government will recover the tax relief given on pension fund savings.
That is important when assessing what the right level of the tax charge
on death should be. There is, however, another inconsistency. I
referred earlier to USPs. In those, different rules apply on the death
of a member. If a USP member dies without drawing any pension benefits,
his pension pot is transferred to his nominated beneficiaries free of
inheritance tax. If he had started to draw benefits, a 35 per cent.
charge would be levied on that pot.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>
					<a name="07060559000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Legislation intended to simplify
pensions back in 2004 is now creating different tax charges depending
on when someone dies. Somebody who died aged 74 years 364 days without
having drawn their pension could pass their pension pot on free of tax.
If, however, they died a couple of days later, or even some minutes or
hours later, an 82 per cent. charge could be levied on their pension
pot. That does not strike me as a consistent set of regulations to
cover what is a difficult area.</div>
					<a name="07060559000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also like to ask what
the Government believe the impact of the 82 per cent. charge will be.
The regulatory impact assessment is silent about the additional revenue
that the measure will produce, or what impact it will have in saving or
protecting tax revenues. Given the wide interest in ASPs, it is
important that the Government are more transparent about what they
consider to be the revenue implications of introducing the 82 per cent.
charge, and what those implications would be if that charge were not
introduced and the rate agreed in last year&#146;s Finance Act
continued to hold. It would be useful if the Chief Secretary said what
modelling the Treasury has done to assess what would have happened if
those changes, particularly on the exit charge, had not taken
place.</div>
					<a name="07060559000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
would like to touch on three other matters of concern that have been
raised with me. The first is in paragraph 2 of the schedule. The
Finance Act 2004 introduced ASPs and led to simplification of the
pension tax system. It also allowed for annuity payment scheme pension
payments and payments from ASPs to be guaranteed for up to 10 years.
Therefore, if a member died within 10 years, the payments would
continue. Paragraph 2 withdraws that guarantee for ASPs, although it
remains in place for annuities and scheme pensions. I would be grateful
if the Chief Secretary explained why that change was made only for
ASPs.</div>
					<a name="07060559000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In paragraph 12,
there is a further change that has raised some concerns. When a member
of a small self-administered scheme, or SSAS, dies, the funds that he
has built up are distributed to other members as an increase in their
rights. That reduces the cost of the benefits to the remaining members
and to the employer, in the same way that in a large defined-benefit
scheme the cost to members is reduced by any savings coming from
deceased members. The SSASs are important for many small businesses,
and there is a concern that the changes set out in paragraph 12 of
schedule 19 will increase the cost to small and medium-sized
enterprises by levying a 55 per cent. charge on reallocations within
SSASs. Will the Chief Secretary confirm whether SSASs are caught by the
changes outlined in paragraph
12?</div>
					<a name="07060559000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On paragraph 20,
in cases where there is an unutilised pot at the time of death, that
ASP pot is top-sliced in the IHT calculation. In the pre-Budget report,
however, the nil rate band was to be apportioned between the ASP and
the rest of the estate. I would be grateful to the Chief Secretary if
he could explain why that change has taken place. Will he also confirm
that, where the rest of the estate does not exhaust the nil rate band,
the unutilised amount will be offset against ASPs, thus reducing the
IHT bill?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>
					<a name="07060559000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes in schedule 19 are
quite difficult and they will start to have two effects. As the
Government intend, they make life difficult for those who want to
exercise greater control over their pensions by increasing the exit
charge on death and restricting the draw-down of funds so that there
will always be a significant pot left on which the 82 per cent.
effective rate can be charged. The changes also create a degree of
administrative complexity, for example&#151;I have already touched on
this&#151;there are particular rules about the circumstances in which
pension pots are passed on to dependants, what happens when that
dependant dies and what rate of inheritance tax is applied to those
funds. We need to go back to the inheritance tax calculation of the
original ASP member. Changes such as those are quite complicated and
hard for people to understand. There is a niggling doubt at the back of
my mind that they are meant to discourage, and make life difficult for,
those who want to exercise control over the use of their pension funds
in retirement.</div>
					<a name="07060559000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reforms were not properly thought through in the first place. This is
the third significant U-turn on the pensions simplification announced
in 2001, and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government must be wondering why on earth her reforms are being
unpicked, almost on an annualbasis. There appears to be a
continual retrenchment away from the spirit of simplification in the
Finance Act 2004 towards a more complicated and difficult system. It is
remarkable for a Government who have embraced choice on schools, health
care and hospitals not to embrace choice on the release of pension
funds in retirement. Something is not quite right in the way in which
the Government are approaching the issue.</div>
					<a name="07060559000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude, I go back to the
comments made by Baroness Hollis in the pensions debate in the other
place. I suspect that she was right, considering how the rules have
evolved and become more complicated and the Government&#146;s
dogmatic opposition to an end to compulsory annuitisation, when she
said that</div>

Gale.</div>
					<a name="07060559000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Fareham has conducted his usual forensic analysis and
posed a number of searching questions. I have just three points to add.
First, I believe that the Government are in danger of losing touch with
the principle behind the rationalisation of the pension system that
came into effect last year. The guiding principle of the pension tax
simplification reforms was supposedly that, where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>there was a conflict between simplicity and unfairness, simplicity would
prevail. I am not sure that that is a desirable maxim for legislation
because the law tends to think that fairness should prevail over
rigidity, but having advanced it, the Government ought to have tried to
adhere to it for longer than simply one year.</div>
					<a name="07060559000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The complicated new provisions
for taxing residual ASP funds after a death are neither simple nor
clear. However, I am sure that the increased flexibility offered to
pensioners by allowing them to make use of the alternative secured
pensions regime is desirable. My concern is that the system was
developed in response to a specific inequity caused by religious
belief, and that Ministers have clung to that rationale despite the
problems that have resulted from it. It is strange peg on which to hang
wide-scale pension reform.</div>
					<a name="07060559000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not doubt the seriousness
of the problem experienced by the Christian Brethren&#146;s
repudiation of pooled mortality risk. However, the Christian Brethren
should perhaps have been mere beneficiaries of the introduction of
alternative secured pensions, not the cause of them. An article from
December last year in <i class="I">Pensions World</i>&#151;I am sure that the
Chief Secretary subscribes to it&#151;states quite
rightly:</div>
					<a name="07060559000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Religion
should not be a tax avoidance
issue.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
it should not be a cause for unnecessary complication either. The same
article cites a census estimate that there are 738 members of the
Christian Brethren. This seems to be a significant understatement,
because when the issue was debated in 2004&#151;I see the Chief
Secretary looking at me quizzically&#151;the figure cited was close
to 14,000. Even so, for perspective, some 942 of my constituents
described their religion as &#147;Jedi&#148; in the last
census.</div>
					<a name="07060559000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
suggesting that the Christian Brethren should lose the benefit of
alternatively secured pensions, but rather that ASPs should, from their
institution, have been seen as possessing wider relevance than to the
Christian Brethren. At least by acknowledging that there was a wider
ideological issue in play here, the Government could have avoided the
introduction of a new scheme and the subsequent familiar
clampdown.</div>
					<a name="07060559000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) tried valiantly
in 2004 to engage the then Financial Secretary, the right hon. Member
for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly) in such an ideological debate by
suggesting that ASPs should be seen in the wider context of the
trickle-down of wealth from one generation to another. In a colourful
debate, he quoted from both Corinthians and Timothy, but sadly the Book
of Ruth was a little less forthcoming in the response.</div>
					<a name="07060559000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend eventually
dredged up an actuarial relic in the form of a tontine, to try to get
to grips with some of the consequences of ASPs and how trickle-down of
residual lump sums might work in practice. Tontines, as I have found,
allow funds contributed by participating scheme members to devolve to
the last man or woman standing. They certainly captured the imagination
of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, who correctly
observed their crucial importance to Victorian and Edwardian murder
mysteries, due to the unfortunate habit of participants bumping each
other off in order to claim the funds. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>the ministerial pension scheme were run on that basis, there would
perhaps be fewer candidates for the Labour deputy
leadership.</div>

					<a name="07060559000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is that the Government
tried hard in 2004 to avoid engaging with the issue of the inevitable
trickle-down of wealth from ASPs. About as close as we got was the then
Financial Secretary&#146;s admission
that</div>
					<a name="07060559000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if we find that
people intend to use the alternatively secured pensions to bequeath any

head-on in 2004 is the reason for the draconian measures in this
year&#146;s

						I
would be heartened if the Government gave up on the justification of
&#147;principled religious objection&#148; and looked again at the
wider issue of allowing pension funds to be preserved and transferred.
If the provision of tax relief on pension contributions is to encourage
healthy provision in old age, it should follow that lump sum transfers
should be preserved for that purpose, rather than being wiped out by
punitive taxation. For example, allowing lump sum transfers to
non-dependent children, which would then count towards their own
pension&#146;s lifetime allowance, would encourage independence from
means-tested support and would still achieve value in return for the
income tax that the Government have
forgone.</div>
					<a name="07060559000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
second point also concerns inevitability. It was inevitable that there
would be plenty of takers using ASPs for non-religious reasons and it
was impracticable that any test of faith should be applied to them,
which the Government have at least admitted. There was a chorus of
warnings in 2004 and, rightly, a chorus of &#147;I told you
so&#148; now. However, it does not take too much Sibylline talent to
have predicted the use of ASPs to pass on wealth, so I would like to
ask the Chief Secretary to provide the Treasury&#146;s original
prediction of ASP uptake and what the uptake has in fact been? I am
sure that those figures are available in the old regulatory impact
assessment, but if he has them to hand, I would be grateful if he could
share them.</div>
					<a name="07060559000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My final
point concerns the change to the maximum draw-down from an ASP under
paragraph 2 of schedule 19. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member
for Fareham has already asked why the figure should now be set at 90
per cent. as opposed to a higher figure and, throughout our debate, he
has spoken persuasively about the need for consistency. However, I
would like to probe 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>the Chief Secretary further as to why the magic number for draw-down was
70 per cent. in 2004, but can be raised to 90 per cent. and no higher
in 2007.</div>
					<a name="07060559000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I presume
that the 70 per cent. figure was arrived at on the basis of an analysis
of the risk that some ASP holders would run out of capital. Indeed,
that appears to be the case. In 2004, the then Financial Secretary said
that, with maximum draw-down set at 70 per cent., only one in 20 people
could expect their income from an ASP to fall to a third of its initial
value; on the contrary, she said, if people were allowed a draw-down
equivalent to 100 per cent. of the maximum annuity, 30 per cent. of
people would be placed in a similar situation. I would therefore first
like to ask the Chief Secretary whether he believes that these relative
risks are still accurate, and secondly what has changed to justify the
increased draw-down and the consequently increased risk? Were the
Government wrong then and if so, why is the 90 per cent. limit correct
now?</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000437"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> Perhaps I should begin by expressing
congratulations&#151;I am sure I do so on behalf of the whole
Committee&#151;to the hon. Member for Rayleigh on his promotion to
shadow Minister for Europe. I think that he has already got a little
bit of business from the debate that we have just had. Nevertheless, we
are delighted that he is with us and we look forward to hearing from
him during the course of the morning.</div>
					<a name="07060559000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to the hon. Member
for Fareham, let me give a little more detail about what the schedule
does. We indicated in the pre-Budget report that we would require a
member of an ASP to be paid a pension of at least 65 per cent. of a
comparable annuity for a 75-year-old. We subsequently received a number
of representations about the level of minimum income, and that led to
the announcement in the Budget that we would reduce that figure to 55
per cent. This is not an exact science&#151;it is a matter of finding
a balance&#151;but we concluded that that was the right level in
order to reduce the danger of exhausting funds prematurely.</div>
					<a name="07060559000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the minimum income is not
paid, there will be a charge on the scheme administrator on the
difference between the minimum income requirement and the amount of
pension paid out in the year. The maximum withdrawal permitted from an
ASP fund will be increased to 90 per cent. of a comparable annuity of a
75-year-old. That figure was also mentioned by the hon. Member for
Fareham. The maximum withdrawal ensures that the ASP fund is not
depleted too quickly and will continue to provide a pension for the
remainder of the member&#146;s life. That is an important
consideration, and raising it to 90 per cent. provides a range within
which the member can choose to draw an income to suit his
circumstances.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000438"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Perhaps I am pre-empting remarks that the Chief
Secretary is about to make, but could he explain why 90 per cent. is
appropriate for ASPs but 120 per cent. is appropriate for
USPs?</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000439"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman is asking about the
arrangements for draw-down prior to the age of 75, when there is, as he
knows&#151;he has already commented on it&#151;a compulsory
annuitisation requirement. The arrangements set out here are those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>that apply in that post-compulsory annuitisation period, in which an
alternative route is now available. The considerations there are
different from those that apply prior to the age of compulsory
annuitisation. That is the reason for the difference in those
numbers.</div>
					<a name="07060559000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To deter
people from using pension funds as a tax-privileged way of accumulating
capital for bequests, an unauthorised payments charge will be imposed
on any ASP fund that is transferred to the pension pots of other
members when an individual dies. That will not prevent members from
providing pensions for their survivors. To pick up a point that was
made by the hon. Member for Braintree, remaining funds may be used for
a dependant&#146;s pension or paid to charity without attracting an
unauthorised payments charge.</div>
					<a name="07060559000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside those changes, the
clause and the schedule also introduce necessary consequential changes
to the inheritance tax rules, mainly to address the interaction between
inheritance tax and the unauthorised payments charge where both arise
on the same funds. In all cases, the inheritance tax nil rate band will
be set in priority against the deceased person&#146;s estate
excluding the ASP funds. That will be advantageous for the
beneficiaries of the estate in that it will speed up the process for
tax-paying estates and it will allow the inheritance tax position to be
settled on the ASP funds independently of the remainder of the
estate.</div>
					<a name="07060559000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should both
unauthorised payment and inheritance tax charges arise on the same
funds, the chronological order in which the charges arise will dictate
how each is determined. For example, where inheritance tax is due
first, the inheritance tax liability will be calculated by reference to
the gross value of the ASP fund. In recognition of the fact that the
ASP funds will be subject to an unauthorised payment charge in due
course, any inheritance tax nil rate band that remains available to be
set against them when inheritance tax is due will be grossed up by a
formula to prevent double taxation. The subsequent unauthorised payment
charge will then be calculated by reference to the value of the funds
net of inheritance tax. In all cases, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs will calculate the inheritance tax due, if any, on the
left-over ASP funds and send the bill to the scheme
administrator.</div>
					<a name="07060559000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have consistently made it clear that we do not wish to allow pensions
tax relief to be used for purposes other than to secure an income in
retirement. Some commentators have expressed the concern that if ASP
funds are paid in a manner not authorised bythe pension tax
rules, the combined inheritance tax on unauthorised payments charges
can in some circumstances reach as much as 82 per cent., the figure
named by the hon. Member for Fareham.</div>
					<a name="07060559000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two charges exist for
different purposes. The unauthorised payments charge recoups those
generous tax reliefs if pension savings have not been used as intended
to secure a retirement income, and inheritance tax is a separate charge
on wealth being passed on upon death, regardless of the form of that
wealth. Together, those measures reinforce the message that the purpose
of pensions tax relief is to support saving for an income in retirement
and not to help accumulate capital for bequests.</div>
					<a name="07060559000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, those who have
principled religious objections to annuitisation maintain the
opportunity to benefit from tax relief. I am disappointed that the hon.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div>Member for Braintree should take so lightly the religious concerns that
gave rise to the change. We are not talking about something on a par
with &#147;Star Wars&#148;, despite his rather discourteous
reference. I reassure the Committee about the views of those who have
religious concerns about the risk of pooled annuitisation. We have
discussed the matter with them, and they wrote to my hon. Friend the
Economic Secretary, after the announcements in the pre-Budget report,
saying:</div>
					<a name="07060559000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are totally satisfied with the revised provisions made by the
Government and are sure they will secure the desired result.&#148;
</div>
					<a name="07060559000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, the changes
should not undermine our intentions when we introduced the
alternatively secured pension. The hon. Gentleman cited my right hon.
Friend, the then the Financial Secretary, who made it clear at the time
that if we found that the arrangements were being used in ways that we
did not intend, we would introduce further changes. That is precisely
what we have done.</div>
					<a name="07060559000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Fareham
queried the need for compulsory annuitisation at the age of 75, and he
referred to debates in the other place. I say again that we have been
consistently clear about the fact that the generous tax relief given
for pension savings is to provide for an income in retirement. If one
attempted to set a threshold beyond which people could use the money as
they wished, and if the threshold used to obtain an annuity was set
high enough for one to be sure that it would provide an income in
retirement above the means-tested level throughout the remainder of the
person&#146;s life, however long they lived, only a very small
proportion of annuity pots would be large enough. At most, only the
biggest 5 per cent. of pension funds would be eligible to withdraw the
remainder of their fund as a lump sum if that approach were taken. In
reality, that is not viable.</div>
					<a name="07060559000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We set the maximum ASP rate by
reference to annuity rate for a 75-year-old. Insurance companies know
pretty well how long on average a typical pool of people will live and,
by pooling that risk at the aggregate rate, they can pay a secure
income to individuals for the remainder of their lives, no matter how
long that may be. However, alternatively secured pensions do not have
the benefit of such mortality pooling, so limits need to be imposed in
order to ensure that the fund continues to provide a level of income
for members, even if they live much longer than expected. To ensure
that, as I have said, the limit imposed by the rules is a maximum
withdrawal rate of 90 per cent.</div>
					<a name="07060559000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of positive remarks
have been made about the changes that we are making by people in the
pensions industry. Madeline Forrester, the head of UK distribution of
Threadneedle Investments
said:</div>
					<a name="07060559000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
delighted the Government has finally brought more clarity to what was
an area of some doubt. We think this makes the ASP a viable alternative
to an
annuity.&#148;</div>

Hoban:
						</b> Does the Chief Secretary not recognise that the
considerable doubt in the pension industry was caused by the statements
made by the Economic Secretary over the summer? A matter of weeks after
last year&#146;s Finance Act received Royal Assent, his comments
about further changes created uncertainty in the market. He also talked
again about the reasons why ASPs were introduced, saying that they
should only be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>taken up by people who had religious objections. The position was clear
when the 2006 Act received Royal Assent, but it became unclear after
the Economic Secretary made his
statements.</div>

							<a name="07060559000441"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I do not agree. I quote to the hon. Gentleman the
view of Citywire on 22
August:</div>
					<a name="07060559000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Providers
and advisers are ignoring ministerial warnings that alternatively
secured pensions... are only for those with religious objections
to annuities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention was very clear. We have safeguarded that by the changes we
are making.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000442"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> The Chief Secretary needs to reflect on the fact
that nothing in the legislation would prevent people other than
Christians or Plymouth Brethrens from using this. Although the Economic
Secretary said that it was only meant to be for people of a particular
religious view&#151;I respect those views and I understand their
objections&#151;there is nothing in law to prevent other people from
using ASPs. It is another example of where the Government have created
confusion where non existed
before.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000443"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> As long as people are using ASPs to draw an income
for their retirement, there will be no difficulty. The schedule
contains safeguards that ensure that the funds will be used in that
way, thereby maintaining the benefits that ASPs introduced. It was made
quite clear when we discussed the issue on Report last year that we
would take steps to ensure that ASP rules could not be used other than
as intended, to provide a pension in retirement. We are maintaining
that with this Finance
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07060559000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick up a
couple of the other points made, particularly by the hon. Gentleman.
The level of the reliefs within a pension fund depend on the particular
circumstances of the individual involved. We give very generous tax
reliefs for pension savings, and the unauthorised payment charge at 70
per cent. ensures that all those reliefs are recovered when
unauthorised payments are made. That is the appropriate
approach.</div>
					<a name="07060559000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman expressed concern about the wider impact on small businesses.
Paragraph 12 of the schedule applies to all schemes that provide ASPs,
but we have been clear from the outset that ASPs were not intended to
be a product taken up in the mainstream. The changes to the rules
strike a balance between the needs of those with principled objections
to annuitisation and the needs of the wider public being provided with
tax relief.</div>
					<a name="07060559000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that I have answered the point about unsecured pensions. The hon.
Gentleman also asked why the changes to set the inheritance tax
middle-rate band against an estate have been made and whether I can
confirm that the unused nil-rate band could be set against the ASP. The
nil-rate band change to top-slicing the ASP ensured that it is set in
priority against other assets so that non-ASP property inherited will
benefit from the full nil-rate band and bear less inheritance tax. The
inheritance tax will fall instead on the ASP. That change also met
requests made to us by the pensions industry. I can confirm that the
unused nil-rate band will be set against the ASP.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>
					<a name="07060559000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the hon. Gentleman and the
hon. Member for Braintree said that we were undermining pension
simplification by making these changes. I do not agree. The pension
simplification changes have proved to be extremely successful and the
initial optimism around them has certainly been maintained. The hon.
Member for Braintree read out what my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government said when the ASP was
being introduced. As that quotation showed, we have made it clear that
ASPs would be reviewed if used beyond their original intentions. That
commitment is being fulfilled in this schedule.</div>

Timms:
						</b>
						The tax reforms for pension
schemes and pension savings that came into effect last April remove the
complexity that had led over many years to different tax rules applying
across numerous types of pension scheme. As I have said, those changes
have been very successful. The long-term benefit is a streamlined
regime that is easier to understand and cheaper to administer, and
which was, and still is, broadly welcomed by the pensions and savings
industry.</div>
					<a name="07060559000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The regime
was put together after close consultation with the industry over a
number of years. That engagement has continued since the enactment of
the FinanceAct 2004. That continuing dialogue has proved to be
very useful and has led to a number of changes in this Bill to improve
further the benefits of the new regime. All the technical improvements
to the alignment of benefits are in response to representations from
the pensions industry. The changes have been warmly welcomed. Most of
them fall into one of two categories. Some are responses to either
regulatory or tax changes elsewhere. The other group is wider in scope
and covers a number of measures to eliminate undue restrictions on the
administrative practices of schemes, and so provide greater flexibility
for scheme members and administrators. Government amendments Nos. 136
and 137 belong to that second
group.</div>
					<a name="07060559000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
response to representations, amendment No. 137, on the rules of pension
commencement lump sums, will allow lump sums to be paid up to six
months before the pension commences so long as a pension scheme is
arranging for a pension to commence. That will allow schemes and
pension members greater flexibility in arranging a pension. It will
allow savers time to take advantage of the open market option and
choose the most suitable option annuity for them, and it meets
principles underlying pensions tax relief. The amendment will apply
retrospectively to A-day to ensure that those lump sums that have been
paid remain tax-free. It has been welcomed by the pensions industry and
would ensure that tax-free lump sums can continue to be paid in a
flexible way. I commend it to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07060559000452"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale, for clarifying how
you intend to deal with the clause, which is the first of two that
tackle stamp duty land tax avoidance schemes. It amends the Finance Act
2003 to counter two types of scheme&#151;those that use leaseholds
and those that use sub-sales that have been developed specifically to
avoid payment of the tax. Clause 71 is designed to counter schemes that
use partnerships as a way of avoiding tax.</div>
					<a name="07060559000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two schemes that the clause
tackles seek to avoid payment of stamp duty land tax by adding extra
stages into the sale of property by one party to another in such a way
as to remove the need to pay tax on the transaction. We have always
said that we will deal robustly with any avoidance effort along those
lines. We were first made aware of the schemes late last year. We
initially took action at the pre-Budget report by introducing
time-limited regulations that prevented those schemes. We acted quickly
because we took the view that it was unfair for those using such
schemes to benefit, while most taxpayers who paid stamp duty and land
tax could not use such complex avoidance arrangements. The regulations
have worked well, and the industry has, on the whole, been happy with
that. The clause replaces those regulations, which were introduced at
the end of last year, debated in Committee and approved by the House on
15 January. </div>
					<a name="07060559000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members might ask why we have included the clauses. First, we hope that
they will prove to be more finely tuned instruments than the
regulations that they replace. Not only do they target more effectively
those schemes that we want to stop but, in response to representations
about the regulations, they do more to protect those who are involved
in innocent transactions whom the regulations might have caught
inadvertently. Of course the clauses, unlike the regulations,
willhave permanent effect. In introducing the regulations, we
explained that they would have effect for only18 months from
the date on which they were made. That has given us a chance to consult
the sector and I am grateful to all those who took the time to discuss
the regulations with HMRC. We have tried to accommodate their comments,
and that has made for clearer legislation.</div>
					<a name="07060559000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the process, we have
been open to changes that will make it clear that legitimate
transactions will not be caught. For example, the Government amendments
are the result of further representations from the property sector.
Dealing with the avoidance of stamp duty land taxes is, in many ways,
different from dealing with avoidance in other areas of taxation. For
example, it is much harder to establish whether the main driver in a
developed scheme is avoidance of tax or not. It is also sometimes
difficult to establish who benefits from schemes, as they can be
arranged to benefit both the buyer and the purchaser. Therefore, where
we have deviated from what we have done in other areas of taxation to
prevent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>avoidance, we have done so simply because we have not been able to use
the same types of legislation to prevent avoidance in this
area.</div>
					<a name="07060559000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been
happy to listen to what groups such as the Law Society have had to say
about how the clause is drafted and, where possible, we have agreed to
changes that will protect those involved in legitimate land
transactions.</div>

							<b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): Does the Chief
Secretary agree that a transaction caught by proposed section 75A would
include the purchase of a long leasehold where the right to enfranchise

steps?</div>

							<a name="07060559000454"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I am not sure quite how the measure would apply in
the particular circumstance that the hon. Lady describes. Perhaps she
would like to give a little more detail about the precise type of
transaction that she envisages. The intention is to ensure that stamp
duty is paid on the full value of the transaction. Artificial
arrangements have been devised to try to avoid that; I do not imagine
that her example is one of those arrangements. However, that is
certainly the intention and I think that the effect of the clause, with
the amendments that have been tabled, will be that, in whatever
circumstances, the full value of the transaction will be captured for
stamp duty land tax
purposes.</div>
					<a name="07060559000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
Government amendments, we have made it clear that HMRC will only be
allowed to use the retrospective taxation powers if it favours the
taxpayer. We have clarified that only property investment partnerships
are covered by the clause and that, where separate parcels of land are
sold on as part of a transaction, we will use apportionment to reduce
the amount of tax that purchasers might have to pay.</div>
					<a name="07060559000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Making good anti-avoidance
legislation involves dealing with two opposing requirements. First, we
must ensure that the legislation is strong enough to stop the
avoidance. Secondly, however, we do not want to entangle law-abiding
businesses in its scope or make the overall tax structure any more
complex. That is a fine line to walk. In tabling the amendments, we
have shown that we will listen to concerns about the unexpected effects
of legitimate traders and that we will act on those. I will be happy to
give more details about each amendment, but I hope that, in these few
words, I have explained the intention behind
them.</div>

the full value of the transaction is caught for stamp duty land tax

intention is being delivered by the
changes.</div>

makes a fair point about complexity. The clause has to be quite
complex. Its aim is to counter schemes that involve the creation of
complex networks to avoid paying stamp duty land tax. HMRC has already
published detailed guidance on its website explaining what is and is
not affected by the clause, giving examples of how it will work. If
there are any uncertainties, it is happy to advise those who have
queries about complex transactions on a case-by-case

						My
understanding of the reaction that the provisions have provoked among
those affected by them is very much at variance with the Chief
Secretary&#146;s account of how they have been received. As ever, the
Opposition would support attempts to shut down abusive and artificial
tax avoidance schemes that would prevent stamp duty from being charged
on transactions. However, we are concerned about the very wide scope of
proposed section 75A. Although initially its provisions did not attract
a huge amount of attention, considerable concern has since been
expressed about their breadth.</div>
					<a name="07060559000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chartered Institute of
Taxation
states:</div>
					<a name="07060559000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
disappointing to note that despite a wide-ranging discussion of this
legislation in January 2007 which identified various practical problems
with its implementation, nothing has been done to tackle the major
defects in the legislation... In our view the drafting of section
75A is fundamentally deficient in a number of respects... Most
seriously... the section is drafted in such wide and general terms
as to be almost unworkable in practice. Its general application means
that it may apply to many common commercial transactions, and it
appears to cut across many areas where existing SDLT legislation
provides reliefs including, for example, charities and reconstruction
reliefs.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>
					<a name="07060559000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute of Indirect
Taxation, the Law Society and the Stamp Taxes Practitioners Group all
seem to share the CIOT&#146;s concern that innocent transactions
could be caught by proposed section 75A. The Law Society points
out:</div>
					<a name="07060559000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
uncertainty which this is generating is not simply the perception of a
number of anxious professionals who cannot interpret the legislation
and want a hand from HMRC.</div>
					<a name="07060559000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">Seasoned conveyancing and tax
professionals have pored over this legislation and want a hand from
HMRC, not with a view to picking holes in it, but with a view to
understanding it so that they can give advice to clients as to the
consequences of undertaking real estate transactions.</div>
					<a name="07060559000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">The fact that these
professionals are still unclear as to the ambit of the legislation is
testament to the fact that the legislation is
unclear.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, in a
letter to Crispin Taylor at HMRC, the Stamp Taxes Practitioners Group
stated:</div>
					<a name="07060559000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As a
matter of principle, anti-avoidance legislation should be proportionate
to the problem...The Stamp Taxes Practitioners Group consider that
s75A goes far beyond what is necessary to deal with the type of schemes
mentioned in the Technical Note issued by HMRC...and cannot on any
reasonable basis be allowed to be enacted without, at the very least,
major
revision.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments to which the Chief Secretary referred help to
deal with one or two problems and drafting errors, but serious issues
remain unaddressed and unresolved. A key concern is that many
high-street conveyancers and property lawyers who do not have access to
specialist and sophisticated tax advice are unlikely to be aware of the
risk that the transactions with which they are dealing could
behit by the provisions of proposed section 75A. There is a
risk of widespread but unwitting non-compliance.At the heart
of the problem is the fact that themere linkage of
transactions through conveyancing succession might trigger those
provisions.</div>
					<a name="07060559000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number
of examples of innocent transactions that might be caught by proposed
section 75A have been canvassed with HMRC. In its briefing notes for
the Committee, the Institute of Indirect Taxation set out the following
case. In it, V owns a warehouse, which it sells to A for
&#163;250,000, the market value reflecting the hope that planning
consent for redevelopment will be granted. However, consent is refused.
As a result, A resells the building a year later to P for its then
market value of &#163;200,000. Proposed section 75A could bite in
that situation because a series of transactions has taken place in
relation to the property, ending in its purchase by P, and P could be
liable for stamp duty on the higher original price of &#163;250,000
rather than the price that he paid.</div>
					<a name="07060559000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC has indicated that
proposed section 75A would not apply in that situation. However, the
section requires that only one person, V, disposes of property, and
that another person, P, acquires it, and that a number of transactions
have taken place in connection with the disposal and acquisition of the
property. The amount of SDLT payable in respect of those transactions
is less than would have been due on a notional direct transfer between
V and P. All those conditions would seem to be satisfied in the example
given by the IIT, so P might be landed with an unexpected bill for
extra stamp duty even though he had nothing to do with the earlier
transaction. It seems that virtually all sub-sales could be caught in
which A sells to B who then sells on immediately to C at a lower
price.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>
					<a name="07060559000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another example of the innocent
transaction that might be at risk is one that I gave to the Chief
Secretary&#151;a long lease that is enfranchiseable when the right is
exercised after the purchase of the lease. There is a sufficient
connection even if the purchase takes place some years later, as there
is no temporal restriction on the operation of proposed section 75A.
There is a connection between the original purchase of the lease and
the enfranchisement because if one had not purchased the original lease
one would not be able to enfranchise. That has the potential to be
caught by proposed section 75A. It is difficult to see how it could
qualify as an artificial avoidance scheme of the sort supposedly
targeted by the legislation.</div>
					<a name="07060559000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed section 75A does not
require the direct disposal from P to V, nor does it require that V
should have disposal to P in mind when entering the transaction chain.
All that is required is that P should end up with the interest
originally held by V, even if it arose because something else had
happened in a series of other transactions. As the Law Society points
out, wholly unrelated Vs and Ps could find themselves party to notional
transactions and thus to the application of the provisions of section
75A. There is no requirement that the transactions should constitute an
artificial scheme or that they should be motivated by a wish to avoid
tax. The mere fact that transactions occur one after the other could
turn them into a scheme under proposed section 75A. The danger is that
wholly innocent transactions could be caught simply because they
involve a series of steps.</div>
					<a name="07060559000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern becomes even
greater when one realises that those steps could take place over
several years and still trigger the operation of proposed section 75A.
The wide scope of the provisions is reinforced when one notes that
proposed subsection (2) makes it clear that not all of the relevant
transactions need to relate to
land.</div>
					<a name="07060559000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
am told that HMRC asserts&#151;this is in line with the response that
the Chief Secretary made to the example that I put to him&#151;that
the words &#147;involved in connection with&#148;, contained in
proposed subsection (1)(b), mean that the provisions will bite only
where V and P are party to the same arrangement. However, that is not
what the Bill says. The words &#147;in connection with&#148; give a
very limited and uncertain protection to those carrying out day-to-day
real estate transactions. Both the Institute of Indirect Taxation and
the Stamp Taxes Practitioners Group have expressed serious concern
about the lack of clarity surrounding the phrase on which HMRC seeks to
rely to ensure that its legislation does not have an impact on innocent
transactions.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07060559000386"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07060559000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving aside
the infelicitous nature of the term &#147;involved in connection
with&#148;, considerable ambiguity is attached to the phrase. The
question that is difficult to answer is how substantial a link is
needed for HMRC to be able to show that proposed paragraph (b) is
satisfied and the required connection is established between the
transactions and the acquisition by
P.</div>
					<a name="07060559000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The words
&#147;in connection with&#148; have been interpreted in different
ways by the courts. Mr. Justice Nourse in Emery <i class="I">v.
</i>IRC thought that it meant a &#147;definite causal link&#148;.
In Johnson and Johnson, Lord Justice Somerville thought it meant merely
&#147;having to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>do with&#148;. In one of the more recent cases, in HMRC <i class="I">v.</i>
Barclays Bank, Lady Justice Arden took a wide interpretation of the
term and also emphasised that it could mean different things in
different contexts, and that it had to be read in
context.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The phrase
&#147;in connection with&#148; provides an inadequate safeguard
because it does not require the deliberate and consequential link
between the transactions, which groups such as the Institute for
Indirect Taxation believe is vital if proposed section 75A is not to
hit a range of innocent transactions. The Stamp Taxes Practitioners
Group points out that the
term</div>
					<a name="07060559000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is seemingly
capable of including... a merely causal or historic
interpretation&#151;without a time limit, motive connection or even
knowledge of the other parts of the
&#145;scheme&#146;.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inclusion of &#147;involved in&#148; seems to offer no effective
additional
protection.</div>
					<a name="07060559000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need
something stronger than just the words &#147;involved in connection
with&#148; to separate artificial avoidance schemes that should be
restricted from normal, everyday transactions, which should not. That
is why I tabled amendment No. 213. As well as introducing a purpose
test, it would require amuch closer link between the
transactions in issuethan is required by the original drafting
of proposed section 75A. The purpose test that the amendment would
introduce is similar to those that we have already discussed. They are
not without their problems, but they have become a regular feature of
our tax law. The Government propose to use purpose tests twice in the
Bill in other contexts in relation to their targeted anti-avoidance
rule on capital losses and in relation to sideways loss relief in
schedule 4.</div>
					<a name="07060559000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment takes on board the discussion that we had in relation to
capital losses and the TAAR rule, and proposes to cover not just those
schemes motivated by a wish to avoid or reduce tax, but those aimed at
securing or increasing a tax repayment. I am seeking to insert not only
a requirement of a real connection between the different transactions,
but an element of deliberation in carrying out a sequence of
transactions.
</div>
					<a name="07060559000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment would remove the risk that the mere fact of a number of
transactions taking place sequentially in relation to the property
would trigger the operation of proposed section 75A, even where such
transactions were years apart and had nothing to do with stamp duty,
stamp duty land tax, or a holding tax. The amendment would introduce a
concept of a pre-ordained series of transactions that amount to a
scheme or an arrangement. Both those ideas draw on case law. The
concept of a pre-ordained series of transactions was considered in a
line of cases running from Ramsey <i class="I">v. </i>IRC and Furniss <i class="I">v.
</i>Dawson. It requires such a clear and well established link between
the transactions that they are, in effect, a single composite
transaction. That type of close link is missing in proposed section
75A.</div>

							<a name="07060559000462"></a>Mrs.

understand that there have been troubling examples of artificial
avoidance schemes that have fallen outside 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>the scope of proposed section 75A. Not only has it the potential to hit
innocent transactions, but it is not effective in catching all the
non-innocent ones.</div>
					<a name="07060559000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The term &#147;scheme or
arrangement&#148;, which is also utilised in the amendment, is
familiar from case law. It echoes the wording used in a number of
contexts in our tax law, such as sections 137, 139 and 140B of the
Taxation of Capital Gains Act
1992.</div>
					<a name="07060559000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
the view of the IIT, introducing the term &#147;scheme or
arrangement&#148;&#151;a phrase that it describes as commonly used
and well understood&#151;creates the consequential link that is
needed and remedies the problems that occur when reliance is placed
solely on the &#147;in connection with&#148; test. Confining the
operation of proposed section 75A to instances in which that type of
scheme or arrangement is entered into with the main purpose of avoiding
tax, rather than for a bona fide commercial reason, would be a much
more effective way to tackle the avoidance that concerns HMRC without
imposing collateral damage on a range of transactions that have nothing
to do with avoiding tax, and, critically, without imposing significant
uncertainty and cost on those buying and selling property. The general
approach taken in the amendment is broadly in line with
representationsmade by the Institute of Indirect Taxation, the
Law Society, the CIOT and the Stamp Taxes Practitioners
Group.</div>
					<a name="07060559000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
214 would also help to deal with the problems that I have outlined, in
particular the issues connected with the absence of any time limit for
the operation of the provision. It would provide that transactions
taking place more than three years before the acquisition by P should
be disregarded for the purposes of proposed section 75A. That would put
a temporal limit on the scope of the operation of proposed subsection
(1) which would significantly clarify the legislation, otherwise HMRC
could in theory look back many years at transactions that happen to
have been carried out in relation to a particular item of property.
Like amendment No. 213, it would answer the very serious concerns
raised by the representative groups to which I have referred.</div>
					<a name="07060559000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">In responding to calls for the
scope of proposed section 75A to be tightened and for a motive test to
be inserted, HMRC have responded that that is not necessary because
uncertainties can be ironed out using the code of practice 10 clearance
procedure. It is welcome that HMRC has indicated that access to the
procedure will be extended indefinitely instead of being restricted to
the early years of new legislation, as would normally be the
case.</div>
					<a name="07060559000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, access
to the procedure does not provide all the answers to the problems that
I have outlined. For a start, it does not amount to the full clearance
procedure for which organisations such as the CIOT and the IIT have
called. The Law Society points out that if the Government want to
introduce a mini-general anti-avoidance rule for SDLT in proposed
section 75A, they need to have HMRC officials able and willing to
provide the necessary clearances within a commercially acceptable
timetable. An adjudicator under the COP10 procedure can give guidance
only on what transactions are caught by proposed section 75A. He cannot
disapply it to a transaction&#151;even a wholly innocent
one&#151;if the law says that it applies.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>
					<a name="07060559000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society put the position
best in relation to the limitations of the COP10 procedure. It said
that</div>
					<a name="07060559000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HMRC will have to
take a view as to the &#147;innocence&#148; or otherwise of a
transaction in deciding whether the legislation should apply. COP10
rulings are not given on what the legislation intends to hit; they are
an interpretative provision, where a matter of tax law is unclear,
allowing the taxpayer to receive clarity as to how the legislation, as
it is laid down, should be applied to a particular set of facts. Our
experience is that the complex transactions unit takes a very
legalistic view towards legislation, and we have no doubt that
transactions which are innocent will get negative COP10 rulings because
on the face of the legislation, it applies to them when it was never
intended to.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society went on to highlight a further problem with the procedure by
saying:</div>
					<a name="07060559000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Taxpayers
are reliant on HMRC&#146;s executive view as to what is an
&#145;innocent&#146; transaction such that two taxpayers in very
similar circumstances could be taxed differently at the whim of the
HMRC officer to whom a COP10 clearance request is
made.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover,
application for such rulings takes time and generates costs, which is a
problem. I have received representations about transactions that fell
through because it was impossible to get a COP10 ruling quickly enough.
Switching from the idea of precise and targeted legislation to a system
more similar to US-style rulings has constitutional implications that
should be properly debated. The implications for HMRC resources also
have to be considered in light of the need for the prompt turnaround of
applications.</div>
					<a name="07060559000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
argument put forward by HMRC, which echoes some of the points made by
the Chief Secretary, is that we do not need to amend proposed section
75A because interpretive problems can be resolved using guidance. To
that end, it has published a so-called white list of transactions that
it does not believe should be covered by proposed section 75A. I am not
keenon that phrase; I prefer cleared list. However, leaving
aside what one should call it, its publication does not solve the
problems with proposed section 75A. The Stamp Taxes Practitioners Group
points out, with justification, that the white list approach is not an
effective substitute for significant revision of the legislation. It
identifies particular problems with the white list approach in this
context because of the fact that the proposed section needs to be
considered in relation to virtually all conveyancing transactions.
Relying on non-statutory guidance is difficult enough in narrow
specialist areas such as group relief and real estate investment
trusts. However, it is much more difficult in relation to legislation
that might have an impact on all conveyances and home
purchases.</div>
					<a name="07060559000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
solicitors do not have in-house expertise or research staff who can
regularly monitor HMRC&#146;s website for guidance. Certainly, an
average high-street solicitor is highly unlikely to have access to such
resources or expertise. It will also be very difficult to come up with
anything like a comprehensive white list. There are even more
fundamental constitutional concerns at issue,
however.</div>

amend paragraph (c) of proposed section 75A(1). That would deal with a
problem that has been raised in a number of representations, which is
that, as the clause is drafted, there is no need for the three
paragraphs in proposed subsection (1) to be read in conjunction with
one another. The amendment would clearly tie together proposed
paragraphs (a) and (c) and ensure that they are read together rather
than separately. Without that change, there would be an ambiguity about
the chargeable interest to which the word &#147;its&#148; in the
last line of proposed paragraph (c) refers. The amendment would ensure

then B agreed to sell, via a sub-sale, one third of the land to three
purchasers, C, D and E, for &#163;1 million each, there is a danger,

forthe insertion of the phrase &#147;scheme

Subsection (5) refers to</div>
					<a name="07060559000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the largest amount (or aggregate
amount)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07060559000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That does not give rise
to a problem so long as &#147;or&#148; is interpreted in the normal
way; in other words, disjunctively, so that the tax is payable on
either the largest amount or the aggregate amount. However in some
legal contexts &#147;or&#148; has been interpreted conjunctively to
mean &#147;and&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07060559000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My three
amendments would help to remove the problem by moving the reference to
the amount to match the relevant paragraphs. The term &#147;largest
amount&#148; seems focused on paragraph (a) whereas the only relevant

<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>context for the application of &#147;the aggregate amount&#148; is
the situation set out in paragraph (b). The amendments make it plain
that either (a) or (b) applies and not
both.</div>
					<a name="07060559000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
238 is a simple amendment to resolve the problem that I drew to the
Chief Secretary&#146;s attention. It makes it clear that exercising a
statutory right of enfranchisement, extension or enlargement of a
leasehold interest cannot trigger the operation of proposed section
75A. Without this change, there is a real danger that someone who buys
a lease and later exercises a statutory right to extend it could be hit
by proposed section
75A.</div>
					<a name="07060559000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
amendment No. 239 and section 75C, the Law Society expresses the
concern that the statutory carve-out for reliefs in subsection (2) of
proposed section 75C will be restrictively applied. The question here
is whether the reliefs and disregards that would be available in
relation to the actual transaction will still be available in relation
to the notional one. A key problem here is that subsection (2) applies
only to reliefs.</div>
					<a name="07060559000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
important SDLT rules that reduce the liability of the taxpayer are not
reliefs in a technical sense. They are simply computational rules,
exemptions or disregards. If they cannot be applied to the notional
transaction under proposed section 75A, this will involve a significant
increase in the SDLT bill faced by taxpayers. It would turn section 75A
from an anti-avoidance provision into a simple tax increase.</div>
					<a name="07060559000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Stamp Taxes Practitioners
Group is also concerned that there is no clear mechanism provided for
crediting SDLT that has been paid in relation to transactions earlier
in the chain against the SDLT charged on the notional transaction.
Considerable uncertainty surrounds this point and any clarification
that the Chief Secretary could give would provide significant
reassurance to people who are potentially affected by these
provisions.</div>
					<a name="07060559000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 239 to subsection (4) of proposed section 75C would deal with the
specific problem of group relief. It is a concern that the SDLT group
relief rules have been excluded from the list carried over into section
75C and thus available to relieve liability under proposed section 75A.
Group relief plays an important function in this context and its loss
would disrupt many significant commercial transactions. Again, unless
this problem is dealt with, section 75A looks much more like a straight
tax increase than an anti-avoidance provision. If the Chief Secretary
will not accept the amendment, I hope he will at least explain why
group relief provisions on SDLT contained in part 1 of schedule 7 of
the Finance Act 2003 should not apply to notional transactions under
section 75A.</div>
					<a name="07060559000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
concluding, I would like to flag up two general concerns about proposed
section 75A. As I said to the Chief Secretary, there could be a number
of instances where there could be more than one transaction in the same
case that could fall within the definition of a notional transaction
for the purposes of these provisions. It is not clear how section 75A
is supposed to operate in this situation. It does not surprise me that
the Chief Secretary was unable to give me an answer on that point. I
should be delighted to take him up on his invitation to address the
query to HMRC, but it is a concern that we do not have a clear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>answer on that yet. In particular, how will a decision be made as to
which transaction to select as the notional one?</div>
					<a name="07060559000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Another
concern is that it might not always be possible to ascertain who is P
for the purposes of new section 75A(1). In a recent article for
<i class="I">Taxation </i>
						<i class="I">Magazine</i>, Jeremy de Souza, a lawyer for Blake
Lapthorn Tarlo Lyons, pointed out that in many cases there may be a
number of potential Ps in the conveyancing chain. He concluded by
stating of these provisions
that</div>
					<a name="07060559000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;warning flags
should be flying over many property transactions from now
on.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, new section 75A as drafted is simply too wide-ranging. It
will have to be considered in virtually all conveyancing transactions.
Thousands of high street legal and conveyancing practices across the
country will have to grapple with these highly complex provisions. It
is highly likely that many will be unaware of the application of the
new section and hence of the need to make an SDLT return. Even if they
are aware of the rules, it may be difficult in practice to get
holdof the information needed to ascertain
whetherlinked transactions have occurred, sufficient to
trigger section 75A. This provision could add a significant
conveyancing headache for thousands who just want to buy a new home. I
hope that the Chief Secretary will reassure me that those fears are
unfounded.</div>
					<a name="07060559000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is particularly harsh to impose complex, unclear and hard-to-understand
tax provisions in a self-assessment system, where taxpayers themselves
have to determine whether the provisions apply. One expert told me that
these rules could leave transactions open to re-examination by Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, potentially backdating 21 years.
The provisions are so unclear and uncertain that it will be difficult
for HMRC to apply them consistently. The upshot is that significant
extra costs will be imposed on the property market and on home
buyers.</div>
					<a name="07060559000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to

such transactions are generally not. STPG members have reported
experience, in relation to transactions in the pipeline at the time
when the Regulations were introduced, of funding offers either being

increased interest

						The
Chancellor has significantly increased the burden of stamp duty during
his term of office at No. 11. Only a few weeks ago, we had the home

again before he imposes further costs and uncertainties on the property

serious
defects.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000463"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I hope that I can persuade the hon. Lady that her
amendments are unnecessary. We have seen the text of them before,
because they have been suggested 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>by some of those involved in the property sector. As she knows, we have
accepted quite a number of her proposals&#151;they were in the
Government amendments that we discussed a few minutes ago. We have
rejected this particular group for good reason. Some of the amendments
would reopen the avoidance opportunities that the clause is designed to
shut
down.</div>
					<a name="07060559000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Understandably,
the hon. Lady spent most time discussing amendment No. 213, which
would, as she said, replace the clause&#146;s objective test with a
different set of tests. First, there would have to be a
&#147;pre-ordained series of transactions&#148;. The problem is
that it is often easy for the parties to arrange things so that the
steps are not &#147;pre-ordained&#148; because they might or might
not happen, so it is quite easy to avoid that test. A test of purpose
is difficult to apply to a transaction tax such as stamp duty land tax,
because the main purpose of the transaction is likely to be the
commercial one of transferring economic ownership of the property from
vendor to purchaser, so I do not think that the approach in this
amendment works. It would not give greater certainty to those not
engaged in tax avoidance
either.</div>
					<a name="07060559000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In most cases
where a transaction is financed by borrowing, the lender is most
concerned to have certainty about the tax consequences, but it is
unlikely that lenders could satisfy themselves as to the purposes of
the parties to the transaction. The answer, therefore, is that
certainty can be secured through clear guidance from HMRC, both
generally and in relation to specific transactions. As I have said,
there is a firm commitment to giving that guidance.</div>
					<a name="07060559000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also hope that members of the
Committee will be reassured to note that the Government have already
responded constructively to representations made both during the
original drafting of the Bill and in relation to the Government
amendments that we discussed this morning, and we will continue to
listen carefully to representations in the future. If it still proves
to be the case that transactions that are not tax avoidance
transactions are likely to be caught, we can and will help innocent
taxpayers who are inadvertently caught. We can do that by using the
power that the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet referred to, in new
section 75C(10), which can disapply the application of new section 75A
in specific circumstances.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000464"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> Is HMRC contemplating using new section 75C(10)
on an individual basis for individual taxpayers? It seems most peculiar
to draft wide-ranging legislation and then implement secondary
legislation to exempt specific
individuals.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000465"></a>Mr.

says:</div>
					<a name="07060559000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Treasury may by order provide for section 75A not to apply in specified
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
do not think that it would be usual for the &#147;specified
circumstances&#148; to apply to just one individual transaction, but
the wording does not make that impossible.</div>
					<a name="07060559000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
214 would assist those avoiding payment of stamp duty land tax by
restricting the application of clause 70. It would disregard
transactions occurring more than three years before the ultimate
acquisition of the property by the purchaser. The intention 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>there is understandable, but there is no reason why purchasers should
have to make the inquiries that the amendment would spare them. As long
as they are planning to pay stamp duty land tax on their purchase in
the normal way or they qualify for a relief such as charities relief,
the anti-avoidance provisions in the clause will not apply to them.
Incidentally, the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet queried whether
charities relief and reconstruction relief would be affected. Those
reliefs are expressly preserved and are not
affected.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000466"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for his
clarification, which I accept entirely and very much welcome. I would
like to ask him about the three-year time limit in amendment No. 214.
His answer to my concern about enfranchisement of the leasehold
interest was that there had to be sufficient connection between the
transactions so that they happened very close together. He therefore
seems to envisage that new section 75A should apply only when
transactions are relatively close together. If that is the case, why
does he not accept the amendment, have the three-year cap and reassure
people who are very worried about this
legislation?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000467"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> Because it is not needed. As I have said, as long
as the parties involved are planning to pay stamp duty land tax in the
normal way on their purchase or they qualify for a relief, they will
not be affected. It is only where their involvement results in a
reduction of the tax that would normally be payable that the clause
will be likely to affect them.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000468"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The issue is that people may not know that
transactions way back in history are affecting their SDLT liability, so
they may be planning to pay the SDLT that they think is due&#151;I am
sure that they would be. The concern is that, if HMRC can look back on
a string of transactions in previous years, the party concerned will
simply not know that that affects their current
liability.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000469"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> It may be of some reassurance to the Committee to
know that transactions that occurred before 6 December 2006, when the
regulations that preceded this clause were laid, would be disregarded
in any event, and a provision such as that set out in the amendment
would not have any effect until 2009 at the earliest. I do not think
that there is a problem that needs to be fixed
here.</div>
					<a name="07060559000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the
purpose of amendment No. 234, but, again, I think it is unnecessary,
because it is clear from the context that the interest referred to in
subsection (4)(b) is the same as the interest disposed of by V in
subsection (1)(a). Amendments Nos. 235, 236 and 237 do not add
anything, and would in fact reduce the effectiveness of the
anti-avoidance provisions by changing the circumstances in which the
section could be applied. They would lead to the clause not being
applied fully in circumstances where any one person gave consideration
in the form of more than one transaction, and that would allow tax to
be avoided by breaking the consideration into a series of transactions,
only the largest amount of which would be liable to stamp duty land
tax&#151;which is precisely what we want to prevent.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>
					<a name="07060559000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 238 would mean
that newsection 75A would not apply to the exercise of a
statutory right of enfranchisement&#151;the point raised with me by
the hon. Lady earlier on. That would create an opportunity for
avoidance, however, because it is not possible to rule out the exercise
of such a right as a step in new types of avoidance schemes. I want to
reassure those involved in legitimate transactions that, in most cases,
the exercise of such a right would not be one of a number of
transactions involved in connection with a disposal and acquisition, so
it would not be affected by new section
75A.</div>

							<a name="07060559000470"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I may have misunderstood, but would not much of
the discussion be academic, as stamp duty land tax would never be
payable anyway? If we talk about leasehold enfranchisement for many
houses in the west midlands, for example, we may note that they were
sold originally on a 99-year lease, and the usual multiple was 11 times
the annual ground rent, which as I understand it would not get anywhere
near stamp duty land tax. I am not saying that no transactions would be
caught, but many of the average transactions of our constituents, using
the Leasehold ReformAct 1967, would not be caught at all
anyway, as they are below the stamp duty land tax
threshold.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000471"></a>Mr.

						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and the
increases that we have made in the stamp duty land tax threshold have
helped in this
context.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000472"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The problem is that the enfranchisement cost is
unlikely to be above the SDLT threshold in many cases, but if new
section 75A bites, the cost of the original lease would have to be
taken into account, which could well take the combined cost above the
threshold, so it is relevant even where the enfranchisement cost is
below the
threshold.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000473"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> Finally, amendment No. 239 would exclude from the
application of new section 75A any consideration paid under a
transaction that qualified for group relief. We have, I am afraid, seen
a number of avoidance schemes in the past that made use of group relief
as part of a series of transactions, so I would not at this stage want
to exclude considerations paid under a transaction that qualifies for
group relief. Again, I can reassure the Committee that if there are
specific categories of legitimate transactions involving group relief
where it is appropriate to disapply newsection 75A, we would
be prepared to consider exercising our powers under new section
75C(10). I hope that that is helpful to the hon.
Lady.</div>
					<a name="07060559000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
that the Opposition amendments would allow, inadvertently I am sure,
some of the very schemes that the clause aims to end, to carry on
unchecked. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will not accept
them.</div>
					<a name="07060559000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will pick up
one or two further points made by the hon. Lady. The schemes that this
clause is designed to prevent are wholly artificial, and those using
them must expect that we will act to prevent their use, as they pose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>a significant threat to Exchequer revenue. For example, before the
pre-Budget Report, Revenue and Customs was aware of two transactions
using these schemes, which alone were worth a combined total
of&#163;850 million. We had no option other than to act as
quickly as we could to counter those schemes, hence the laying of the
regulations at the time, and the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07060559000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
suggested that, if those involved in the transaction did not intend to
save any stamp duty land tax through the transaction, the provision
should not be applied. However, it is often difficult to establish what
the motivation in any transaction was, and there is a real danger of
leaving a gate wide open to those wishing to avoid tax.</div>
					<a name="07060559000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady was concerned
that mere linkage through conveyancing succession would be caught by
proposed new section 75A. I assure her that that will not be the case.
There must be more connection than mere succession, as is implied by
the phrase &#147;involved in connection with&#148; in proposed new
section 75A that she referred to. The acquisition involvement means
more than mere temporal succession. When drafting the measure, we
looked at the phrase &#147;involved in connection with&#148;. Our
legal advice was that the terms are not too vague, as she suggested,
and that they will not create any difficulties of interpretation. In
any case, as I have said, we will be issuing guidance to ensure that
the meaning and intent of the legislation are clear.
</div>
					<a name="07060559000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady made
the point that code of practice 10 rulings cannot disapply legislation.
Of course that is true, but a code of practice 10 application might
result in the Government exercising their disapplication power under
proposed new section 75C(10), potentially with retrospective
application. She was concerned about the speed of those rulings. HMRC
aims to turn them around within 28
days.</div>

							<a name="07060559000474"></a>Adam
Afriyie:
						</b> I thank the Chief Secretary for his generosity in
giving way. Will he make it absolutely clear why there is no exemption
for long-term leaseholders who may choose to enfranchise and buy the
freehold, in cases in which that purchase exceeds the limit? Why is
that not very clearly spelled out somewhere? I sensed a slight
hesitancy in his response, even to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West.</div>

							<a name="07060559000475"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I accept that there are some good intentions behind
these amendments, and no doubt behind others, but in drafting the
legislation we must avoid opening a new opportunity, or leaving open an
opportunity, for avoidance because, sadly, there will be plenty of
people piling in to take advantage of such openings if they are
provided. That certainly applies to a number of the amendments tabled
by Opposition Members, and one can envisage other blanket exclusions
that could have the same effect. That is why we are being very cautious
about the wording we have adopted.</div>
					<a name="07060559000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady was concerned
about double counting under proposed new section 75A(5). Subsection (5)
will add up the amount paid by any one person or received by the
vendor. It is aimed at identifying the true purchase price, which might
be artificially split up, and ensuring that the full amount 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>of tax is payable. She was also concerned that there was no clear
mechanism to credit to the notional transaction stamp duty land tax
paid earlier in the chain. Proposed new section 75C(9) contains
precisely such a mechanism, so that issue is
addressed.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
in contrast with the concerns expressed by Opposition Members, let me
refer to some of the comments made when the regulations that precede
the clause, which I think have worked well, were made. Sue Taylor, head
of real estate tax at Eversheds, said that
this</div>
					<a name="07060625000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will catch most of

						The Chief Secretary may
believe that the provision is designed to target a few wholly
artificial schemes, but the reality is that the Government have not
succeeded in focusing in on that target, and they are going to hit
other innocent transactions as well.</div>
					<a name="07060559000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the Chief
Secretary for confirming on the record that mere linkage through
conveyancing succession does not satisfy proposed new section 75A. That
is very welcome. I am not sure whether it is consistent with what the

of interpretation by the
courts.</div>
					<a name="07060559000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I continue to
be concerned by the approach that the Chief Secretary seems to have
confirmed today, which is that the intention is to create a broadly
worded provision that can, if necessary, be disapplied in certain
circumstances if it operates in an unintended way and applies to
innocent transactions. That raises some constitutional concerns about
the legislation.</div>
					<a name="07060559000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
also grateful for the Chief Secretary&#146;s reassurance on the
operation of proposed newsection 75C(9) and credit for earlier
stamp duty land tax paid. Given that relevant transactions can also
include share transactions, it would be useful to clarify whether

							<a name="07060559000503"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> As I indicated earlier, clause 71 amends the
Finance Act 2003 to counter known schemes that attempt to avoid stamp
duty land tax by moving property tax-free into a
partnership&#151;that is, by the ceding of partnerships. The clause
will prevent tax avoidance schemes that we initially dealt with by
regulations in the pre-Budget report 2006. The two amendments that I am
tabling are directly in response to representations from the property
sector.</div>
					<a name="07060559000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The first
amendment is merely to rectify an omission from the clause; it is a
minor omission, but if it was not rectified we would run the risk of
confusing those trying to interpret the law. The second amendment
follows some late representations suggesting that the clause could have
an adverse effect on investment structures that use partnerships but
are not engaged in avoidance. We have been lobbied to include a
transitional provision, so that the provisions that will create the
change do not apply where all the property in a partnership was
acquired before Royal Assent and stamp duty land tax was paid in full
on the gross market value of the property, and that is what the
amendment
does.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07060559000389"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07060559000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have taken
on all the suggestions we could that will facilitate those involved in
legitimate, innocent transactions without creating further opportunity
for those seeking to avoid tax. Of course, those developing avoidance
schemes will keep on looking for new ways to avoid stamp duty land tax
and we will respond by closing avoidance schemes quickly. We have a
duty to the majority of taxpayers to maintain a level playing field for
everybody, and of course we will keep this area under review.</div>
					<a name="07060559000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000504"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I would like to address some of the
issues surrounding the clause at the same time as addressing the
amendments, to obviate the need for a separate clause stand part
debate.</div>
					<a name="07060559000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that there are avoidance risks in relation to partnerships, which have
not always proved easy to tackle in the past. However, there seems to
me a significant risk that clause 71, like the clause that we have just
discussed, could have some unintended consequences in relation to
innocent transactions.</div>
					<a name="07060559000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Again, some
general concerns about the operation of the clause have been expressed
to me by the Institute of Indirect Taxation. It believes that
transactions that a taxpayer might contemplate without professional
advice, such as gifts, could be affected by clause 71. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07060559000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
surprised that a Labour Government should take the view that a family
that cannot afford professional advice should not expect to be able to
make straightforward gifts without triggering tax
consequences.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>
					<a name="07060559000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to raise two points
in relation to the scope of clause 71, and I do not think that they are
addressed by the Government amendments. One of them is partially
addressed, but some remain and it would be excellent if the Chief
Secretary could help to answer
them.</div>
					<a name="07060559000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first issue
concerns the deletion of the requirement of consideration. Under the
old law, the relevant partnership anti-avoidance provisions did not
bite on gifts, so they did not apply to a transaction where no
consideration was given. The Law Society has expressed concern about
the removal of the requirement of consideration by clause 71, pointing
out that the consequence is that a gift of a partnership interest from
individual to individual is now subject to a market value charge based
on the value owned by the partnership. It should also be noted that
that is a charge on the gross value of the land owned by the
partnership rather than the real value of the gift, which could be
considerably less where the partnership has borrowed to invest in the
land. So the SDLT charge here could be quite a high one. The Law
Society expressed concern that a gift of a partnership interest
attracts a charge when a gift of the underlying property would not. It
would be useful if the Minister could provide greater clarification on
that point and explain the reasons behind the proposed deletion of the
consideration
requirement.</div>
					<a name="07060559000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point is rather more worrying. It concerns one of the effects
that are partially caused by the deletion of the requirement of
consideration, but it also interacts with other changes made in clause
71, and it involves property investment partnerships. The point is best
explained by looking at the example given by the Law Society in its
briefing to the Committee. It concerns a relatively simple case, where
A, B and C are in partnership, sharing income and profits equally, with
partnership property of &#163;450,000. Each partner is deemed to own
&#163;150,000-worth of property. Further property is purchased by the
partnership, using its assets. If another person then joins as a new
partner, providing &#163;150,000 in cash, the value of
everyone&#146;s interest will have stayed the same, at
&#163;150,000. I am told that before section 75A, it was accepted
that the addition of a new partner did not trigger an SDLT
charge.</div>
					<a name="07060559000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendments to paragraphs 14(1)(b) and 36 contained in clause 71 would
throw that into doubt. Will the Minister confirm whether the enactment
of clause 71 will result in SDLT being payable in that situation? It
seems that it would be. If so, it could have a significant impact on
property investment partnerships.</div>
					<a name="07060559000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The practice
of second closing&#151;bringing a second wave of investors into a
partnership some months after it is first set up&#151;is common. The
changes proposed in clause 71 would result in SDLT being payable if the
partnership had acquired land between the first and second closing,
even though it was bought with money put up by the original investors.
If second closings are now to trigger an SDLT charge, it could severely
restrict the use of open-ended property investment partnerships.
Similar problems occur when partners redeem their partnership
interests. Coupled with a further concern, such problems could render
partnerships almost unusable in the property investment field. I hope
that I am wrong, and that the Chief Secretary will reassure
me.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>
					<a name="07060559000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My other
concern is about changes in the profit sharing ratio in a partnership.
The old law made it plain that, if a partner sold his interest for a
consideration to another person, it would give rise to an SDLT
liability. However, clause 71 would significantly expand the scope of
SDLT by applying it not only in that situation but whenever the profit
sharing ratio in a partnership changed.</div>
					<a name="07060559000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That could
give rise to significant problems, as profit sharing ratios can change
automatically under the original partnership agreement. A common
example might be an agreement that entitled the operator of a
partnership to an increased profit share if the partnership reached a
particular level of return. When that relevant level of profits was
reached, the partnership shares would change. Under the old paragraph
36, there was no SDLT problem because no consideration had been given
to changes in profit shares, and a partnership interest, as it was
previously understood, had not been transferred. It now seems that SDLT
will have to be paid in every case when a profit sharing ratio changes,
even if it was provided for in the original partnership agreement,
because of the new definition of what amounts to an interest in a
partnership and the removal of the need for
consideration.</div>
					<a name="07060559000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
development funds using partnerships will typically include a provision
to call for more money from investors: it is a well-known fact that
developments frequently run over budget. Such calls are not compulsory;
some investors may take them up and others not. However, in such cases,
we again see that changes in the partnership ratios that to date would
not have triggered an SDLT would now do so. Again, the
Minister&#146;s guidance on whether that is the case would be useful.
The same problem occurs where an investor defaults or goes
bankrupt&#151;another occupational hazard in the property development
business. Until now, the resulting change in partnership ratios did not
trigger SDLT. It now seems that it
would.</div>
					<a name="07060559000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have received
representations that, if my analysis is correct and SDLT is payable,
partnerships will no longer be used for property funds. That is
significant, as such partnerships have played an important role in
property investment. A solicitor who contacted one of my colleagues
about the problem described the change as lunacy, although I would not
go that far. I am willing to hear the Chief Secretary&#146;s
justification, but I want to know whether that effect was intended by
the Government when drafting clause 71. If so, what was their
justification for making such a significant change?
</div>
					<a name="07060559000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">What avoidance
problem was caused by property investment partnerships that justified
penalising them in the way that clause 71 seems to do? What assessments
have the Government carried out on the impact that the change will have
on the property investment market? I would be interested to hear
whether the Chief Secretary is prepared to publish the
Department&#146;s research on the impact of the change. To what
extent will the amendments assist in solving the problem? They are
helpful in some contexts. In particular, they help to tackle the
unfairness that the change in the law creates for people who are
committed to partnerships on the basis of the existing law. However,
they seem to cover only partnershipsthat bought land between
December 2003, when the SDLT regime was introduced, and commencement of
clause 71.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>
					<a name="07060559000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">While it is useful to give
assistance in relation to those transactions, the Government amendments
provide a very limited lifeline. In particular, they do not seem to
solve any of the problems in relation to partnerships that want to
carry on business in future, nor do they permit new partnerships to set
up start-up arrangements in the property investment businesses. As the
Chief Secretary has confirmed, they are merely transitional
arrangements to ease the change that is being introduced.</div>
					<a name="07060559000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">A way should be found to
address concerns about avoidance in this area without such radical
restrictions on the use of property investment partnerships. In the
debate on REITs, the Government have repeatedly stated that they wish
to encourage collective investment in property. If that is the case,
why are they effectively shutting down an important vehicle for doing
so&#151;the property investment partnership? The Committee should
consider the likely consequences of that shutting down. The onshore
alternative structures that might substitute for property investment
partnerships are limited. Not all enterprises are suited to REIT
status; as we debated at length in this Committee last year, REITs are
usable only in certain circumstances. In particular, many property
enterprises may not be large enough to justify the cost of the listing
that is required for REIT status. I am concerned lest the net result of
the changes is simply a shift of property investment into offshore unit
trusts. I cannot believe that that is really what the Government
want.</div>
					<a name="07060559000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chief
Secretary referred to Patrick Cannon&#146;s comments on section 75A.
I, too, would like to draw to the Committee&#146;s attention to some
comments by Mr. Cannon, who is a barrister. They appeared in
<i class="I">Property Week</i> a few days ago in an article helpfully entitled,
&#147;Latest tax clampdown is shoddy and rushed&#148;. Let me close
with a quote from the article, which
states:</div>
					<a name="07060559000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
SDLT partnership provisions are an unfortunate example of just how bad
tax legislation can get when you have layer on layer of anti-avoidance
amendments built on to basic provisions. The provisions seem to have
been worked on at different times by different draftsmen, some of whom
do not seem to have a full grasp of how property partnerships
function.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060559000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say,

Chairman:
						</b> Before we progress, the hon. Lady has, perfectly
reasonably, broadened this into a stand part debate. As the Committee
knows, I have no problem with that so long as we do not try to cover
the ground twice. However, I listened fairly attentively to what she
has been saying and it strikes me that she might have placed the Chief
Secretary in a slightly difficult position, because she has commented
on one or two things that would otherwise have been raised under the
next pair of amendments. If the Chief Secretary wishes to respond now,
he might find it necessary to curtail his remarks on the next pair of
amendments.</div>

							<a name="07060559000506"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I had anticipated that you might turn this into a
broader debate, Mr. Gale. The hon. Lady has got me totally
confused&#151;perhaps my right hon. Friend can help me. I had thought
that stamp duty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>land tax bit on land, but the hon. Lady has talked about changing profit
shares in a partnership. I did not think that stamp duty land tax had
anything to do with that, so I should appreciate some
clarification.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000507"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> That would be the impact of clause 31. If a
partnership holds land and one of the situations that I have outlined,
such as a new partner joining, occurs it will be subject to an SDLT
charge on that land. That is the connection between the land and a
partnership.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000508"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I understood that part of the argument. I am not
sure that I agreed with it, but I understood it. However, I did not
understand at all what the hon. Lady said about changing profit share.
I hope that my right hon. Friend can clarify that.</div>
					<a name="07060559000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point that I should
like to make to my right hon. Friend is that it is often,
understandably, prayed in aid in this Committee that the Chartered
Institute of Taxation says at paragraph 29.1 of its submission that the
proposed changes to the Finance Act 2003, schedule 15, are welcome in
that they eliminate some of the anomalies in schedule 15. That is all
that it says.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07060559000509"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con):
						I welcome
the remarks that the Chief Secretary made in introducing the
amendments, which attempt to establish some clarity for partnerships
that would be caught incidentally. In other words, they would remove
genuine partnership transactions that are not seeking to avoid stamp
duty land tax, which is clearly the thrust of the schedule and clauses.
However, I am not sure that he has done his job as well as the
Committee would normally expect him to do. I am concerned that there
are incidental consequences for members of existing partnerships that
go beyond the special purpose vehicle type of partnerships that he
seeks to
catch.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000390"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07060559000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
appreciate it if he could give the Committee some clarity here and
confirm that the Government amendments do not apply to those
partnerships where property interests are held incidentally to the
activity of the partnership rather than specifically, and interests in
those partnerships change over time. My hon. Friend the Member for
Chipping Barnet, in her thoughtful contribution, showed that by
changing the definition of consideration in the Bill, a partnership
gift interest from one individual to another, such as a gift from a
partner to his spouse, his children or a family interest, could
potentially trigger a stamp duty land tax charge if the partnership
happens to hold property. That is quite clearly not the intent of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07060559000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that the Government amendment is sufficiently clear. We do not have a
definition of a property investment partnership although it may exist
in the Finance Act 2003. I apologise to the Chief Secretary for not
having seen such a definition if it does exist. Perhaps he could put us
straight on that. The second point on which I seek some clarity is
whether it is intended to catch gifts in the manner that I have just 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>described if they arise in partnership interests. If a property is held
outside a partnership, such a gift would not attract stamp duty land
tax whereas if it is held within a partnership it would. Is that the
Government&#146;s intention? If so, I think that it is quite
inappropriate.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000510"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> As I have indicated already, the clause aims to
prevent tax avoidance schemes that were initially dealt with by
regulations at the pre-Budget report. As with the previous clause, the
regulations were time-limited and so now need to be replaced using the
Finance Act. But the opportunity we have had to revise the legislation
has been helpful. Not only has it allowed us to make changes to ensure
that a variation on the schemes that we did not know about when we
drafted the regulations can be dealt with, it has allowed us to
consider whether there are any changes we can make to ensure that
legitimate transactions are not affected by the
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07060559000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as
the clause itself is concerned, I believe that we have been able to
reassure most in the property sector that it will be clear,
proportionate and effective. My hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West is right to draw attention to the views of
the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which were communicated to all
members of the Committee. It welcomed the amendments and the clause.
The clause brings fairness to the property sector for taxation by
ensuring that transactions using these complex avoidance schemes will
be taxed in the same way as they would have been if they had been
straightforward land transactions between two
parties.</div>
					<a name="07060559000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
should again point out that significant sums are at stake here. Until
the PBR, when we made the regulations, only relatively few transactions
had used these schemes, but the loss in stamp duty land tax yield is
significant. These are major commercial transactions. The number would
have certainly continued to rise. Closing this scheme alone will bring
extra combined revenue for the years 2006-07 to 2009-10 respectively of
&#163;10 million, &#163;25 million, &#163;25 million and
&#163;25 million.</div>
					<a name="07060559000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that we have taken on all the suggestions we could that will
facilitate those involved in innocent transactions without creating
further opportunity for those seeking to avoid payment of the tax. As a
result, we have certainly achieved a clearer and more effective clause,
which hits our target of preventing avoidance without unduly affecting
legitimate land
transactions.</div>
					<a name="07060559000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said during the debate on the previous clause, those developing
avoidance schemes will, of course, keep on trying to find new ways to
avoid paying stamp duty land tax and we must be ready to respond by
closing avoidance schemes quickly, and we will. We have a duty to the
majority of taxpayers, who are not using elaborate avoidance schemes,
to ensure that there is a level playing field for everybody, so we will
be keeping this area under
review.</div>
					<a name="07060559000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to respond specifically to some of the points raised by Opposition
Members. A concern was raised about charging when partnership interests
are gifted between individuals, or by an individual to an unconnected
company. I think that it was implicit in what the hon. Members asked,
but I need to make it clear that charging applies only to cases where
there are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>property transactions. However, in such cases, I do not think that there
is any reason why such a transaction should be dealt with more
favourably than other transactions where tax would be due.</div>
					<a name="07060559000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the concern about
gifts of partnership interests now being chargeable, again they will be
chargeable only where the partnership is engaged in property dealing or
property investment. Other forms of trading partnership, such as
farming partnerships, are not affected. Indeed, partnerships where land
ownership is incidental are also unaffected by the
clause.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000511"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. Could he also clarify whether, in the case of an
investment management partnership that manages property portfolios as
part of its activity but not as its core activity, such a partnership
would be
caught?</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000512"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I imagine that it would depend on the extent of the
property interest, but I think that the answer is, quite rightly, yes.
If the hon. Member wants to raise a more specific question with me, for
example in a letter, I would be happy to provide him with an answer.
Let me also make it clear that it is not the case that gifts of
property from parents to children will be made liable to stamp duty
land tax by the clause.</div>
					<a name="07060559000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are substantial sums at
stake. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet asked about the addition of
a new partner who contributes cash. She is right that there will now be
a charge, because the previous provisions were being used for avoidance
purposes and it was necessary for us to ensure that that opportunity
was blocked. She also asked about what happens when the profit share
ratio between partners changes. Again, this applies only to property
investment partnerships, but we think that it is right that there
should be a charge where a partner acquires an increased right to
income from the property.</div>
					<a name="07060559000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a complex area, but the
balance that we have struck in the clause, with the amendments that we
tabled, is right. Certainly, the changes that we have made have been
warmly welcomed. I hope that the Committee will support the clause,
with these Government
amendments.</div>

							<a name="07060559000515"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> Schedule 21 introduces changes that will remove
obstacles to competition and expand choice in the trading of financial
instruments in the UK. They change the stamp duty and stamp duty
reserve tax reliefs so that institutions in the City of London can take
advantage of the liberalisation of market structures being introduced
across Europe by the markets in financial instruments directive, or
MIFID.</div>
					<a name="07060559000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rules on
intermediary relief are being changed so that, from 1 November, it will
no longer be necessary to report and exchange transactions in shares
that are admitted to trading on a regulated market such as the main
market of the London stock exchange. That will allow providers of
transaction reporting services to enter the market more easily. In
February, we announced our intention to extend that approach to include
shares that are admitted to trading on multilateral trading facilities
such as the AIM that are operated by the London stock exchange and
other similar markets. Before proceeding, however, we are allowing the
Financial Services Authority time to consider fully any regulatory
implications. We will provide an update on progress at the time of the
pre-Budget report.</div>
					<a name="07060559000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rules on intermediary
relief are also being changed to allow persons who provide an
over-the-counter service and who are not exchange members to apply
directly to HMRC for approval as intermediaries.
</div>
					<a name="07060559000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendments will
remove an unnecessary condition from the stamp duty and stamp duty
reserve tax intermediary reliefs. From 1 November, intermediaries will
be able to benefit from MIFID, the new regulatory regime. As MIFID
contains provisions for making public transactions in shares that are
admitted to trading on regulated markets, we have decided that it is no
longer necessary for such provisions to be a condition for intermediary
relief. The amendments remove the requirement to make public
transactions in regulated market shares for shares that are admitted to
trading only on a multilateral trading facility. Transactions will
still qualify for relief only if reported to the market, so the changes
are consistent with the written ministerial statement of 20
February.</div>
					<a name="07060559000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
taking the opportunity to make a technical amendment to the definition
of a European economic area state to ensure that it has the same
meaning as the definition in the InterpretationAct
1978.</div>
					
					<a name="07060559000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060559000516"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> In contrast to what I said about the last two
clauses, I welcome the schedule. It is important that the reliefs
available for intermediaries at the London stock exchange be extended
throughout the variety of platforms that will open as a result of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>MIFID. Access to exchanges from other countries in Europe will also be
opened up. The Treasury has worked constructively with industry players
such as the London Investment Banking Association to get this
complicated set of changes into reasonable shape. I understand that
there are a few glitches, but I hope that they are of the sort that can
be resolved satisfactorily using guidance.</div>
					<a name="07060559000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having spent two years of my
life on MIFID, I am pleased that the Government are pressing ahead with
implementation. Giving birth to MIFID was a long and painful labour.
However, I had the pleasure of working hand in hand with the Treasury
on many aspects of the negotiations. I am not sure that what we
produced was necessarily a great result, but I hope that it might be of
significant benefit in the future, both to consumers, by ensuring lower
costs with savings and investments, and to the City of London, by
opening access to markets across the European Union.</div>
					<a name="07060559000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay tribute to the Government
for transposing MIFID on time. Sadly, the rest of Europe has chosen not
to do the same. It is a concern that, although market participants who
are preparing to implement MIFID might comply with UK legislation
because it will have been transposed, they will have to deal with
multiple systems across the rest of Europe because our European
partners have been somewhat slower to
implement.</div>
