announcements. It is not very warm in here today, but if hon. Members
feel inclined to remove their jackets, they are welcome to do so. Could
all hon. Members ensure that their mobile phones, pagers, et cetera,
are turned off or switched to silent mode during the Committee’s
sittings? As a general rule, my fellow Chair and I do not intend to
select starred amendments that have not been tabled with adequate
notice.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000007">&#160;</a>

everyone is familiar with the process for taking oral evidence in
Public Bill Committees, so it may help if I briefly explain how we will
proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme
motion on the amendment paper, and debate on that motion is limited to
half an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to report written
evidence, and then to a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in
private in advance of the oral evidence sessions, which I hope we can
take formally. Assuming that the third of those motions is agreed to,
the Committee will then move into private session. Once the Committee
has deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public will be
invited back into the room and our oral evidence session will begin. If
the Committee agrees to the programme motion, the Committee will hear
oral evidence this morning and this afternoon, as well as on Thursday
morning and Thursday
afternoon.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000008">&#160;</a>

Ms Greene, how will the Bill help Royal Mail? Do you think that it, as
drafted, will provide a solution to the issues facing Royal Mail? Are
there any ways in which it could be significantly improved? This

think would make the Bill even more
effective.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000021">&#160;</a>

Greene:</strong>
                           </em> Good morning. My name is Moya Greene, and I
am the CEO of Royal Mail. I think that the Bill will substantially help
matters, in relation to Royal Mail and the stable provision of the
universal service. Royal Mail has faced three important challenges. The
first is the ability to go forward with the modernisation programme,
which is already under way. That requires capital, which is the first
thing that the Bill will do for Royal Mail—it will give us
access to capital.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
Royal Mail has suffered for many years under the crushing strain of the
pension liability, which is completely disproportionate to the size of
the company. The Bill will lift the historical
liability.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third way in which the Bill will be instrumental, as far as the
universal service and its stability is concerned, relates to the
regulatory framework. The regulatory framework has been very important
for creating competition, and I think that everybody knows that a
universal service provider must accept a regulatory framework. However,
the one that we have had in Great Britain has been a significantly
greater burden than those that exist for other universal service
providers in Europe. There is a need now, given the dramatic change in
the market, for that regulatory burden to be relaxed and to be more in
line with what has happened in the market. I think that the Bill is a
very positive development for Royal Mail in those three
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
improvement, I believe that the Government, Mr Davey and the
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills have gone a long
way to understand what is necessary to preserve a high-quality
universal service in Great Britain. They have certainly understood very
well the dramatic changes in the market and the effect they have had on
Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not have specific proposals for amendments but, on the change of our
regulator to Ofcom, although it is true that the Bill paves the way in
every important respect for a relaxation of the regulatory burden, I
think that we need to see that happen fairly soon. Time is of the
essence in this business, given the dramatic changes that have taken
place, and we have been waiting at Royal Mail for a considerable period
to see that relaxation take place. I ask you to keep that in mind as we
go
through.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000026">&#160;</a>

Greene:</strong>
                           </em> I think that if the Bill does not go through,
you will see a continuation of what have been chronic problems for
Royal Mail. Any company needs to have access to capital. This company
is in a dramatically changing market. It needs to modernise and the
pace of that modernisation needs to accelerate, and that has everything
to do with the access to capital. Everything that has been said about
regulation, by the Secretary of State for Business and the proposing
Minister Mr Edward Davey, captures it very well. So much has happened
in the market. We have seen volumes decline considerably in the past
five years. We have seen, with the access regime and price control
around access, that that contraction in the market has had an even
greater effect on Royal Mail, with more and more of the bulk mail
business going to our competition.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So, I think
that failure to understand just how much competition is there, and the
need for Royal Mail to be given a fair opportunity to compete for the
business that is there, will further erode the viability of Royal Mail.
The consequences for Royal Mail will be negative in terms of its
financial viability. The consequences for the universal service will be
even greater, because the truth is that we are very proud at Royal Mail
to be the universal service provider in Great Britain, but
the company needs to have a fair opportunity to compete in order to
provide the very high quality service that Great Britons have a right
to expect from us. So, if it did not go through, you would see a real
peril introduced into the quality of that universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000032">&#160;</a>

Greene:</strong>
                           </em> Well, there are other postal administrations
around the world that are owned by Governments, but I do not think that
they are the highest-performing postal operations. I do not think that
they are necessarily the most innovative and the best service
providers. I have led another postal operation, as you know, in Canada,
which is Government-owned. I can tell you that the modernisation
programme that is under way here—I thought that I had led a
really terrific modernisation programme at Canada Post until I got to
Royal Mail—is truly excellent. The issue of Government ownership
is really a problem of having a normal shareholder. When you are in a
business such as this, which is in a market 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                           </div>undergoing dramatic change, you need to have access to capital
continuously to keep up with it. Governments are not normal
shareholders. They have many things on their plate, at any time, to
deal with. Hearing that a company as big as Royal Mail needs capital is
not an ordinary question for a Government shareholder—it is for
a normal shareholder, but not for a Government shareholder. It is a
problem for a Government shareholder, because we have to compete with
so many other Government funding requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So,
there are real problems with having Governments as providers of capital
to big companies such as this one. The proof is in the pudding. A very
large study was done of postal operations around the world. The ones
that were owned by Governments had the least access to capital, the
least timely access to capital, and when the market is changing as fast
as it is in our world, we need almost continuous access to get the
modernisation accelerated. So, I do not think that Governments are,
generally speaking, the best shareholders for commercial enterprises,
and certainly commercial enterprises that have to undergo a lot of
change to meet the
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000035">&#160;</a>

the Minister was saying on the media this morning. He has been on the
BBC, on television and on radio, confirming the funding that has been
announced to the Post Office of £1.34 billion and also the
Government strategy to support the Post Office and change the shape of
the network. The reason we had closures under the financial and policy
regimes of previous Governments was to change the cost basis of the
Post Office. The Post Office in the majority of cases has been
unprofitable for its operators and has been very difficult to operate
economically for Post Office Ltd. The new approach gives us an
opportunity to transform the network. What is absolutely important in
this new approach is that there will be no closures whatsoever. We have
moved away from any pressure on closures, which is why I wanted clarity
on your first point.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000039">&#160;</a>

revenues in terms of front-of-office services through Government and
also through financial services. Some 80% of customers now can access
other bank accounts through the Post Office, so there are tremendous
opportunities for us in the privatisation of Royal Mail and the
separation of the Post Office. It enables us to capitalise on the

exciting things about what the Minister has announced is that it gives
us more flexibility to put in the right operating models into
communities. We operate a number of different models at the moment.
There are approximately 550 franchises already: WHSmith and the Co-op
run post offices for us and they are some of our most successful
operators because they are good retailers who implement very high
standards. The other thing that moving to different models of post
office will do is to enable us to open for longer. We are currently
piloting a model called Post Office Local, which itself has extended
opening hours between 40% and 60% for customers. So there are some real
upsides for the Post Office in
this.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000042">&#160;</a>

of the answer that you gave to my colleague when you mentioned
pensions. How much would be saved on Royal Mail’s current
pension payments as a result of the Bill? Is there any other option
than to transfer the liabilities to the Government? Are you satisfied
with the pension provisions within the Bill and do you have any
examples either in the UK or internationally of best practice in terms
of pension
protection?<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000043">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In terms of pension protection, I think this
is best practice. These pension arrangements make it very clear to our
people that their retirement income will be protected. There are other
cases in the world where postal administrations have had relief on the
pension side. Deutsche Post is an example and I believe the Austrian
post is as well. The United States postal administration is another.
This is not the only example of this kind of relief. What is proposed
here, however, is a signal of great security to our people around their
retirement
income.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of what it will do on the cash side for the Royal Mail, the extra
provision that we have to make to the pension to deal with the pension
deficit costs around £300 million a year right now, but that is
because we have been given an extraordinarily long period of time to
pay off our pension deficit. If that pension deficit were required to
be retired in a shorter period of time, the amounts would, of course,
be much higher. Even at £300 million a year, you can imagine, in
addition to the regular payments to keep the pension going, that this
is a liability—the deficit now stands at more than
£8 billion—on the company that is completely
disproportionate to its size.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000045">&#160;</a>

significant move, and the Government have made a very important
initiative. The provisions in the Bill for the transfer of the pension
are clear: they give security to our people; they help us in terms of
improving what has been a crushing load to the balance sheet of the
Royal Mail; and in the round, they are very
positive.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000046">&#160;</a>

universal service in Great Britain. We are not seeking changes to the
universal service at all. The universal service is protected in this
Bill, and that is very important. At six days a week, the universal
service in Great Britain is a strong service, and it also covers the
full array of products. We are not seeking any change to the universal
service. What we have pointed out and, I think, has been recognised by
the Government is that the regulatory approach on the economic side has
been a different and, I would say, more restrictive approach than has
been applied in most other
countries.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
in many countries, for example, only universal service products are
regulated. That is not true in the UK where almost everything is
regulated. Of the revenues of the Royal Mail, 86% is regulated. The
breadth of the regulatory regime is certainly more
extensive.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the areas in which price control obtain are greater. What we have been
saying is that we need to compete on a level playing field. There is a
huge number of pressure points in the market to keep prices within
reasonable bounds. Those are the competitive pressures that exist in
the UK market. The amount to which prices are controlled is a
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
and perhaps most importantly, we have a regime that mandates that our
competitors have access to our network at any point and that they have
access with a margin that is protected for them, which is the headroom
price
control.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
those three areas, you will find that the regulatory approach that has
been applied in Great Britain has been great at generating new
competitive pressures, which I fairly and fully expect should be there.
We should be subject to competitive pressures, but we are at a stage
where the competition in the market is very robust. Now, as the only
participant that is regulated in this way, we need a fair and level
playing field on which to compete.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000054">&#160;</a>

private sector operators in postal markets have some of the lowest
prices in the world. I think that we are going to be able to hold
prices down through two methods. The first is the modernisation
programme, which is well under way in Royal Mail and has generated
significant change and improved the efficiency of our operation. It is
a huge thing—this is a very large company. We are probably
mounting a modernisation programme faster than anywhere else in the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I know a
little about this, because when we were designing the modernisation
programme for Canada Post, I took the opportunity to visit other postal
services around the world that had planned and implemented
modernisation programmes. I feel like I have seen what other countries
have done. I look at what Royal Mail has been able to do in just two
short years, when they finally got access to capital, and it has been
amazing. We have been able to consolidate 10 mail centres. We have been
able to introduce innovations, such as 47,000 new PDAs for all of our
letter carriers. We have been able to introduce 10 new world-class mail
sites. I invite you all to come and visit them—they are now
being recognised internationally as some of the best mail processing
centres in the world. So, the first thing that will allow us to cover
the cost of the universal service is to accelerate that modernisation
programme and help us restrain the cost burden that comes with the
quality of service that we have in Great
Britain.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000057">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I mentioned earlier, many other factors are present in the UK market
that serve to restrain prices. There is a great deal of competition in
the packets and parcels business in the United Kingdom. There are
around 49 other players in that business. In terms of
competition in the letters business, you will all know well that we
have lost 60% of bulk mail customers to our competitors in a very short
period—just four short years. I think that many factors are
going to contribute to holding prices within reasonable bounds, but the
most important is the modernisation programme that is already well
under way.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000058">&#160;</a>

impact on job losses. I do not think it matters at all where your
capital comes from—whether it is from the Government or the
private sector—how many people the business is able to employ.
What drives the amount of employment in a business is firstly, its
success in the markets that it is in and secondly, the stage that the
business is at in terms of modernising. Over the past five years in
Great Britain, you have seen a Royal Mail that has had to reduce the
numbers of people who are employed at Royal Mail. Automation has that
impact, and that has been going on at Royal Mail now for the past five
years. With the agreement that we now have in place with our unions, we
are able to continue that modernisation. I have had some of the best
discussions 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 9<a class="bkMark" name="Column9">&#160;</a>
                           </div>I have ever had with our union leadership on modernisation since I have
been in the United Kingdom. I think that our union leadership really
understands our business. It understands that we must modernise, and we
have a very good agreement in place to that effect. Modernisation,
because it means automation, means that Royal Mail will probably be a
smaller employer than it is today, but we will go along with the
support of our people at a pace that they can absorb according to the
agreement that we have with our unions. At the end of the modernisation
programme we will be a more successful company than we are
today.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000060">&#160;</a>

think that the best guarantee of good working conditions is to be a
successful company. If you look at how modernisation has improved our
safety record, in some facilities we have improved by as much as 50% or
60% year over year. The most important thing that we can do to ensure
that working conditions remain favourable at Royal Mail is to be
successful, and to go apace, with our people and our unions with us, to
continue the modernisation. The modernisation brings a lot of benefits
to working conditions, the most important of those on the safety

                           </em> I don’t think so; no. It really
depends on how and from where capital comes into the company. I do not
see any state in this market where there will be less competition. I
think there will be more competition, because it is a much broader
market than the traditional mails market. It is a broad communications
market. We are losing a great deal of our traffic to the electronic
side of the communications business. These disruptive technologies are
probably going to be a more important mainstay of the competitive
feature of the market going forward. So I do not really see the source
of the capital into the UK as being the main driver of how much
competition exists in the
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000069">&#160;</a>

particular statement, but what happens is that operators will close
their post offices early to try and make them economically viable. If
you are a sub-postmaster and you are running a convenience
store—Budgens is a good example—they will have post
offices with fixed counters in them that will close down at half-past 4
or 5 in the afternoon, so that they can manage their
staffing costs. We are planning to change the shape of those operating
models, so that we can actually consolidate the post office on the
counters. What I would not want the Committee to understand is that
8,000 post offices are not viable. They are entirely viable if we can
put the right operating model in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000073">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Let me talk about the modernisation first.
The modernisation really got under way in earnest about two years ago.
It took an amazing amount of planning. You really have to think about
how big the estate is: 66,000 routes; 155,000 people; 69 mail centres;
the biggest fleet in all of Great Britain; the biggest network to cover
of any company; 11 regional district offices and about 1,200 delivery
offices. That is a massive estate, and you are talking about
consolidating that estate based on your best predictions on where
volumes are going. At the same time, you will be changing the entire
delivery apparatus of the country. You will be ensuring that people can
use PDAs, for example, to introduce new technology. Some 47,000 PDAs
were introduced in one
year.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
two short years, we have introduced world-class mail, and believe me,
they are truly world-class facilities. I want all of you to come to see
those facilities. We have managed to consolidate from 69 mail
processing facilities to 59. By the end of next year we will have gone
from 11 district offices to three. We have outfitted the
entire delivery operation with new technology to meet the challenges
and the change that we see in the market. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 12<a class="bkMark" name="Column12">&#160;</a>
                           </div>That is a massive amount of change. We have taken out about 4.5% of our
operating hours in the past year and a half. We have reduced by about
10% the number of miles covered by our network. So it has been a
massive programme. For people to get that programme up and running and
to where it is now in two short years is, in my experience—I
have looked at modernisation programmes mounted in other parts of the
world—simply laudable, and I say that as someone who has been at
the company for 14
weeks.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where
is this going? We still have a long way to go, because it is such a
large estate, and we are trying to build it, not for the next five
years, but for the next 20 years. We still have a good five
years to go before the estate comes to the size that we want, and the
network covers the area that we want. Every one of those 66,000 routes
will have to be restructured, which is an amazing undertaking for any
company. I do not think that any company in the United Kingdom faces a
challenge that is anywhere close to that faced by Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Do
I think that the company has value? I think that the company has huge
value, and I have been so impressed. I have been to Cardiff and
Glasgow, and I have been on the night shift at Mount Pleasant. I have
seen the absolute best mail processing centres in the world, and I have
also seen the worst, in which mountains and mountains of mail are still
handled manually—the people have their heart and soul in the
business, but the mail is still handled manually. We still have a long
way to go, but if you see the heart and the amount of change that this
company has absorbed in two short years, you have to say to yourself
that, absolutely, this company has huge
value.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000090">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the company sell? I certainly hope so. We need the capital, and I think
that we have a great story to tell. I think that the people who will be
interested in this business will look at the modernisation plan that
has been driven by one of the best transformation executives in the
United Kingdom—my partner, Mark Higson, has been driving the
change in our company—and they will say, “That is a story
unlike any other in all the transformations that all such businesses
have had to
undergo.”<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Should
we wait? I think we should sell the company and get it the capital that
it needs as soon as we can. I hope that that will be some
time in 2012, when we will be through this legislative process and the
other factors that are important to a sale, such as a signal on how
much regulatory relaxation will be available for the company and for
investors to turn their minds to. Yes, I think that it will sell,
mostly because it is a great company with a great
mission.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000092">&#160;</a>

there more to do? Does this give us a framework through which you can
secure the best possible value for the company? Is there a need to
progress further with the modernisation process before you can secure
best value? Should we wait? Should we sell the company in five years,
at the end of the period of modernisation that you have

of benefits to Royal Mail from the Bill. I would like to focus on the
area of capital requirements. Obviously, there are a number of
variables that you have to deal with, but in your base case
assumptions, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 14<a class="bkMark" name="Column14">&#160;</a>
                           </div>what do you think the extent of the capital requirements for Royal Mail
will be over the next five years? What proportion, do you think, will
the group be able to raise with its own resources? I think you
mentioned—you may want to confirm this—some of the
concerns you have about relying on the Government for accessing that
needed capital, but do you have concerns about accessing private
capital and what that might mean for the group? In particular, given
that on the Post Office Ltd side there is an approach towards
mutualisation, what thoughts do you have on the Royal Mail side about
extending employee ownership beyond the Government’s
proposals?<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000106">&#160;</a>

have a precise amount. We are in the process of doing that work now,
but I have a general amount. I would like to see the company
have between £2 billion and £3 billion of capital to
accelerate the modernisation, to diversify the revenue stream and to
improve the technology estate of the company.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On whether I
have concerns about private capital, no. I have worked for great
Government-owned companies and I have worked for great companies that
have been owned by the private sector. It has always been my view that
the source of the capital is not a determinant of whether a company is
a good company. It is access to capital when you need it and access to
a shareholder who is concerned only about the success of a company that
are the important things for a successful company. I have to say that I
think it is easier to find that kind of single-minded view about the
success of the company and continuous access to capital where that is
what the shareholder actually does. We know that Governments are asked
to do many things and they have competing priorities on their tables,
so I do not have concerns about private capital. In fact, some of the
best postal operations in the world are privately owned.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000108">&#160;</a>

share ownership, the signs in the Bill are very positive. In every
company that I have ever been associated with, employees having a stake
in the success of the company has been a positive development. It helps
align our people with their own futures and the things that you have to
do as a company to keep that future secure and keep the company in a
good place, as far as the competition is concerned. In my personal
experience, employee share ownership has been very positive.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000109">&#160;</a>

progress that has been made in modernisation and therefore, in some
ways, access to capital. You were very complimentary about the progress
made in the past couple of years. Are you surprised that that could be
delivered through an organisation that is basically state-controlled?
You then talked about hopes for a potential 2012 sale, but also about
being slap-bang in the middle of a modernisation programme that might
last for another two or three years after that. At that point, how much
investment would that new buyer have to put in to complete that
modernisation process? We have discussed the fact that you cannot
modernise once 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>and stand still; you have to move the business forward. Do you think
that future modernisation processes will be even deeper and quicker
than that of the past two years, or the one from 2008 to
2015?<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000111">&#160;</a>

                           </em> May I answer the first part for her? The
modernisation that has taken place so far is a remarkable achievement,
but it is very late. Compared with any other postal operator of quality
or substance in the world, the Royal Mail is at the end of the queue in
its modernisation, and Hooper said so in his report. One of the reasons
is that it took one and a half years to negotiate the £1.2
billion needed for modernisation. In the world of private capital, a
board could take that decision quickly and execute it perhaps within a
month. One and a half years to negotiate the money, terms, strings and
implementation slows the entire process
down.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000112">&#160;</a>

important is that five or six years ago, nobody anticipated that the

report actually predicted growth in the postal markets only a few years

relatively fixed-cost business, you are getting killed if your revenue
is falling. You have to be flexible and quick. A system that takes a
year and a half to agree to get capital to do things just does not

service that is being provided can be provided with a level of
investment that will give them a return. Where does that intersect with
the modernisation? Our investors in the future need to know that we can
do it. They need to know that we have a reasonable game plan that is
achievable. I think that by 2012 we will have completed a sufficient

First, we have a very strong commercial relationship with Royal Mail
and that is something that both businesses would want to continue, so
as we transform the post office network we will make it into something
that Royal Mail will want to use. It will not want to go anywhere else
because first of all we have the massive rural reach which it would be
very difficult for it to get somewhere else. It will get all this
through one distributor. We will be able to extend our opening hours.
Royal Mail will be interested in this if we can provide the right
service for its customers, such as things like Post Office Local, which
can open at 6 o’clock in the morning and close at 10 or 11 at
night. The post office services will be open for all that time,
serviced in a way that is economically viable for the operator. Those
are the sorts of service-level agreements that we would be discussing
with Royal Mail. I do not see other retailers as a particularly serious
threat, because Post Office has an enormous amount of expertise in this
area, and with the reach and the way we will change the network I am
very confident

the Post Office. Here is a group of people—the best and
strongest network in the country, by any yardstick, with 11,900
outlets—who are committed to and want to sell our products. This
was something that came up in a conversation very early on when I first
met Mr Davey. To me it is unthinkable that we would ever have anything
but the very strong relationship that we have now with the Post Office.
I admire our other partners like WHSmith; of course I do. But that is
not the Post Office. The Post Office is everywhere with a great brand.
It is a group of people who are committed to postal products, who know
postal products, who offer a fantastic service in their communities, a
larger range of service in their communities than any other retail
operator—<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000139">&#160;</a>

out there who are potential competitors and rivals. I appreciate your
tremendous dedication to the post office network, but Royal Mail may
move on and other people who do not have the same view may come in and
take your place. Is there any way that a private company can be
obliged, other than through a voluntary agreement, to be in a contract
with a particular provider rather than having the choice to go to

no, they are not related at all. The problem with Government ownership
is what I have mentioned in the past. Neither one of us is able to
pursue the business in a timely way with the kind of competing
priorities that Governments have to deal with. So I do not think that
that is the answer. I think the best answer is for both of us to be
successful. If both of us are successful—if the Post Office
continues to be successfully embedded in many communities across Great
Britain, to be knowledgeable about Royal Mail products and to be
desirous of selling Royal Mail products along with other sources of
revenue to keep them viable, which is what Mr Davey and his colleagues
in the Government have placed at the heart of the policy statement on
the Post Office—then the relationship will for ever be strong
and as strong as it is today, because it is very useful for Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000142">&#160;</a>

say something that probably only a foreigner is well placed to say. I
think that the UK mail situation, in which Royal Mail is your universal
service provider, is excellent. People in the United Kingdom enjoy a
six-days-a-week service, and they enjoy that service with overnight
delivery. They enjoy universal service protection, which covers the
full panoply of products from letters to packets, registered mail and
insured products. They enjoy access to postal services that is very
good indeed, with 11,900 post offices across the

six-days-a-week requirement, and we did not have such a large battery
of postal products protected as part of a universal service. I am going

provider, and I invite

were giving that encomium to Royal Mail, it struck me that we seem to
be privatising a very successful Government-owned industry. On the
second more important point, I was interested that you mentioned
Deutsche Post. Is it the case that Deutsche Post has to work under a
set of criteria which protect the number of post offices, and that
various access criteria are actually written in statute? In the Bill,
as it stands, there are no such criteria. Is that the
case?<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000162">&#160;</a>

Vennells:</strong>
                           </em> That is because the access criteria that
apply to the Post Office are separate from the Bill. The Post Office is
run separately, and we are accountable to Government separately for
access criteria which, in the announcement that Ministers made, do not
change. So 99% of the population in urban areas still need to be within
a mile of a post office. In rural areas, that is 95%, and postcodes in
certain areas are protected as well. That remains completely unchanged.
Any threat to the post office network has been taken away by the
funding in the Government policy statement on the Post Office, which is
separate from the Bill. The Bill helps the Post Office, because of the
potential separation, and enters us into a different area. We can start
to look for more business, which the Government have talked about, in
terms of front office for Government, and how we restructure our
network. The network access criteria remain

end of this plan, because we will have changed the way they work. Let
me try and paint a picture for you. If you run a post office today in a
convenience store, you have two or three counters that are separately
staffed. They are surrounded by fortress glass, so they are very
difficult from a customer service point of view, and they probably take
up too much space in your convenience store. If we are able to put in
the new main post office models, or the post office local models, those
agents will be able to change their staffing to make it much more
flexible to use the same staff across the different areas. They will
gain back more space in their retail outlet to give over to whatever
they see as more profitable for that space. They will be open longer
for their customers, because the staffing is more flexible, so
customers will get a better deal. Our suppliers, both in terms of

joke about the success of Royal Mail but actually, if you think about
our people, we have got a fantastic work force. I have never met, up
and down the country, a work force that are more dedicated to their
customers and those they serve. They are going through phenomenal
change. Almost every single person in Royal Mail is having their job
changed one way or the other. Nobody likes change. Asking everyone to
change the way they work, the way they operate and the conditions in
which they operate—in the knowledge that there is probably going
to be less than there are today—is incredibly difficult. Yet our
people go out day after day after day and deliver 68 million items
every day, six days a week. That is why we talk about it as a
successful company. I sometimes get just a wee bit depressed, because
there is a sort of national hobby of knocking Royal Mail. But if 95% of
all the first class mail arrives the next day, even if you posted it at
6 o’clock or 5.30 at night, and if we hit targets in the higher

powerful role in the market. They need to, because markets are
certainly not always able to provide stable service. That is where
regulatory approaches and finding the right balance between regulation
and the number of participants in a market to make sure that services
are stably provided comes in. I do not think that you necessarily need
to have Governments owning commercial businesses as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000174">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to go back to Paula Vennells on some of
the points made about the post office network. With the resolution of
some of the business issues that you have identified within the network
plan, do you think that that might make the Post Office attractive to
new entrants? Presumably, the Post Office brand is still one of its
great assets. Retailers that want post office counters within their
business presumably do so because they believe that they make a
positive contribution to the performance of the whole business. If
there are cost elements that can be restructured, do you think that
there will be more people coming to you saying that it now might be
viable to open a new
one?<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000177">&#160;</a>

Vennells:</strong>
                           </em> Yes. I think this comes back to
Mr Banks’s question as well. If we have the funding
and we can sort the network out, I cannot see why you could not put
post offices in more locations. We would certainly have more commercial
partners interested in it. There are volumes in this. There are models
that currently work very well. WH Smith runs a fantastic business and
so does the Co-operative. Martin McColl, in several of its stores,
makes good returns from the Post Office. You have to have models that
are flexible to different
locations.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000178">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of new entrants to the market, I would make a play that the
Government and local government have to be within that category. We are
already piloting a number of different approaches. The Minister, who
has been incredibly supportive, and a number of Government Departments
are now realising that the Post Office can actually save them money.
They can put more customers and more footfall through the post offices
to keep them sustainable. This is a real win-win situation for
us.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000179">&#160;</a>

projects themselves that will fix what needs to be fixed. It is in
place now in 10 of our facilities. It has been a huge tool to help our

evidence, and I think he is right that nobody should underestimate the
scale of change that is going on in Royal Mail. It is huge. I think it
is probably more change over a sustained period of time than any other
company in the UK has had to deal with from an employee point of view.
We need to recognise that the pace of change can only be dictated by
what people can cope with, if you are going to do it right. We have to
spend more time making sure that employees get input into the type of
change that happens at local level. I do not think we have got that
right at the moment. It is still a little bit too much command and
control from management, and we need to get the balance right in how we
implement the changes locally. For me, the choice is not whether or not
we are going to change. I think people have bought into the fact that
we need to change now and that is right across the company. Not
everybody likes that, because it is a lifestyle change for many people.
But I think we could do it better if we were to engage employees more
in shaping the change at local
level.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000203">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Where we probably differ from the view of the
Government is about what the problem is that we are trying to solve.
With due respect to the Government’s position, and that of
successive Governments, they have not always asked the right question.
They have been quick to put forward a solution. But if you examine the
problems in the company, we are convinced that all the problems,
although the challenges we face are great, can be overcome within the
public sector. Let me explain how that can be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
there is a misconception about the modernisation programme and the
funding for it. As far as we understand it from dialogue that we have
at a strategic level with the business, the programme is fully funded.
The agreement we have reached, which brings in new machinery, new
equipment and new methods, is a fully funded programme. What is also
not understood about that agreement—again, I respectfully say to
the Committee that it would be good as you go through your evidence
over the next few weeks to look at what it says, because it addresses a
lot of the fundamental questions—is that it is about changing
the shape of the
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
accept that the digital revolution is out there and is a challenge for
Royal Mail. This agreement is going to change the shape of Royal Mail
in order for us to respond to the opportunities that exist in the
digital revolution. I do not believe that privatisation will do that. I
think that delivering that agreement properly would do that. When it
comes to the question of the need for further access to capital, I
think we would accept that the company clearly needs to be able to
access capital. Our point is that there are other ways of achieving
that. If you are going to proceed with this type of Bill, the starting
point of that debate needs to be a bit clearer about how much and what
for. I do not think that those questions have been properly answered at
the moment. What we hear is the company saying that there is volume
decline. Let us be clear; yes, there is volume decline. Sometimes, we
disagree on the extent of it, but the fact of the matter is that the
modernisation programme takes it into account. It is built on an
agreement that will produce profit margins of something like 7%, where
currently it is 1% over turnover. That agreement delivers significant
new profits for Royal Mail over a period of three or four
years.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000208">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the pension
deficit, the Government have accepted that they will try and deal with
it, which we welcome, but we have serious concerns about the detail,
and our lawyers are looking at that at the moment in respect of
members’ pension entitlements. However, if you take away the
pension deficit, the fact is that it throws up potentially £300
million a year that the company has said that it could afford, in an
agreement with the trustees, which could now be reinvested back into
the service. So, that is part of the solution of access to capital
going forward.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly, if
you change the access regime, or the regulatory regime—I think
most people would accept that that is not a fair regime to Royal Mail.
I think Postcomm got it wrong in the way that it did the balancing act
between providing the universal service obligation—with a level
playing field—and introducing new competition. The truth of the
matter is that Royal Mail is subsidising its competitors, which can use
downstream access while Royal Mail has to pick up the final mile. There
is no way that that is going to be cost-effective if you are providing
a universal service. If you change that and fix those problems, that
throws up further money.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our argument
is that you are going to have to change those things to attract private
investment. You could then change the Treasury rules, which is
something that the Government are considering around NHS foundation
trusts. Why can that not be considered for Royal Mail? Our view is that
Royal Mail could still borrow on the open market, and we understand
Donald’s point that you need to get that money more quickly. We
simply say that the Government haven’t looked at the
alternatives. Modernisation is the real exam test, not privatisation.
We are genuinely concerned, and I believe that the work force are
concerned about the debate that is taking place now in relation to
whether what the Government are doing is truly going to support the
agreement that we have reached.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000211">&#160;</a>

                           <em> </em>I would find it surprising that a
private company coming in and looking at the bottom line would not want
to look at reducing its cost and scope. Why do I say that? My view is
based on international experience. For example, TNT, which runs the
Dutch postal service and is much vaunted as the company we should look
at, has called the universal service “Jurassic 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 27<a class="bkMark" name="Column27">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Park”. It is looking towards reducing its services now, as we
speak. The only thing that prevents some aspects of the service being
reduced is, of course, European regulation, which requires a five-day
service. TNT, a real-life example, is looking to reduce the services,
so I just cannot see it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have also got the regulator within 18 months looking at the USO. There
is provision re-examining the USO, and I would be amazed, if Royal Mail
is privatised and in the private sector, that the private sector would
not look to reduce services. All the evidence is there internationally,
and I am sure that that will be the case in the UK. We have a very good
universal service in the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
is also an innovation in the Bill—it was not in the previous
Bill—is the ability to have a number of USO providers, not just
one. What tends to happen in a liberalised market is that the USO
provider is normally deemed the operator—that is TNT in Holland,
Deutsche Post in Germany and so on. What is in the Bill is absolutely
unique. I have never seen in any other privatisation or liberalisation
the ability to have a number of USO providers, not just Royal Mail. So,
in an area such as Birmingham, for example, it could be deemed that the
USO provider for a service could be TNT or UK
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
privatisation, and looking at the remit, the imperative will be the
bottom line. There is evidence of that already, even in the discussions
that we have had informally: why do we have to provide this service? In
respect of Post Office Counters, 30% of the revenue comes from Royal
Mail. It is all very well to say, “We will make an
agreement.” As I understand it, there is now no commitment to
any five-year or 10-year deal. It will be in the prospectus, we are
being told. The imperative will be, why should we use that company, if
it is too
expensive?<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Already
Royal Mail, as recently as this week, has asked all its suppliers to
reduce their costs by 20%. That is now. When Post Office Counters is
separated, it will be a supplier. So, first off, there will be a 20%
reduction. Look at the hidden subsidies: a lot of post offices,
particularly in rural areas, have what are called scaled payment
delivery offices—tiny little delivery operations. All that will
be under examination. The bottom line will be, “Let us reduce

heard earlier. It seems that the modernisation programme has been a
great success. It is coming strongly from the Royal Mail CEO that it
has been a great success. Moya Greene’s argument about why we
must go ahead with privatisation despite that great success seemed to
boil down to one of two arguments. One was that the company needs
access to capital. I wonder whether you could comment on

so far as it is being rolled back in relation to Royal Mail, I find it
very curious with the Bill that the Government are saying, “Yes,
we need the private sector to sort Royal Mail out, but we’ll
keep Post Office Counters in the public sector.” Ed Davey, the
Minister, has talked about post office closures. Well Ed, Tooting
sub-post office on London road has closed in the past few weeks and we
are told that there are not going to be any more closures. If you
listen carefully to what has been said about closures, you will hear
that they talk about a programme of closure and there will be more
closures of post office counters once you separate Royal

on record my grateful thanks to the CWU representatives—the
regional secretary and the many workers from the sorting office in

to extend employee participation on the Royal Mail side through a 10%
employee participation, and on the Post Office side through
mutualisation. I would be interested to hear from each of the three
representatives what they think about this extension of employee
participation and whether, particularly on the Post Office side, if the
Bill is passed and Royal Mail is privatised, the employee
representatives or unions would be interested in extending employee
participation. One of the most important things for employees through
this Bill is to have certainty for their long-term employment, and a
broader role for employees in the ownership of participation in the
management of these businesses might be most welcome to them in
providing that
certainty.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000230">&#160;</a>

has been working on the mutualisation concept for more than two years.
In fact, we are very supportive of the Post Office eventually becoming
a mutual company. However, the company has to be worth mutualising. As
it is at the moment, Post Office Ltd is, financially, a basket case and
many thousands of sub-postmasters are, as we speak, hanging on by their
fingertips. So there is a lot of work to be done before the funding
package really kicks in in April 2012, because we have 18 months of
sub-postmasters being up against very strong headwinds to survive and
keep their office alive in the
community.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000231">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Certainly,
as a concept, mutualisation would work. In fact, I would go further: if
Royal Mail Group is privatised, I think there is a case for the postmen
and the staff to own 20% of Royal Mail Group; for that to be mutualised
as a concept so you do not sell your shares when you leave the company
but leave them behind; and for the CWU to be on the board of the new
Royal Mail Group. So I see it not just for Post Office Ltd. I see it as
let’s do it right within Royal Mail Group. If it is going to be
privatised to bring in private capital, there is a case for making it
20% of the shares, which are not sold on. You make sure that the
company is headquartered in Britain and it is an IPO—initial
public offering—so it is the British public who buy the shares,
initially at
least.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000232">&#160;</a>

employee ownership of Royal Mail, we think why stop at 10%? George says
20%. That is a fair argument. We would go as far as saying what about
49%? Why not give the employees a real share in it, an element of real
ownership of it? We could say 49% employees and 49% Government or
private perhaps if we go down that road, or it could be 51% Government.
If there is a 49:49 split, it could be 2% for
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000234">&#160;</a>

The John Lewis model is the one that has been talked about in terms of
the Post Office. The John Lewis model is a very effective model from
the retail perspective, but John Lewis or the person whose name escapes
me—he did not have the first name of John, but the second name
was Lewis—handed over his company to the employees when it all
started, which meant real involvement, real ownership and real
participation. The employees had that sense of belonging. But we think
the Government are making a mistake and failing with the 10%
limit.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000235">&#160;</a>

First, do you have a view or would you make a recommendation to
Government on what model of mutualisation should be developed, if you
could design it or recommend it? Secondly, in the previous witness

Government’s gift to do that. They absolutely have to deliver
new Government work, including

show of faith, that that contract comes to the Post Office. We have had

lose that contract at a time when the Government are talking about
putting new work through our

we go beyond the 12,000 or 11,900 post offices that we have at the
moment? One or two MPs touched on that. We have to be careful. We did
not get everything right, but a lot of Government money has been spent
in the last 10 years closing branches. We can argue about whether that
was a good or a bad thing, but the real reason for it is that society
is changing and people’s shopping habits are changing. There is
less shopping on the high street, and customer numbers have drifted
down from 28 million 10 years ago to 19.5 million or 20
million. So we have to be careful, if we go beyond 12,000 post offices
and maybe have 1,000 or 2,000 more, that we do not cannibalise the ones
that are already there and just come back to the problem of closing
post offices down. If the work is disappearing and there is not enough
new work, there cannot be a logical case to open more than 12,000 post
offices. If the Government step up to the plate and deliver the
promised work—we have been promised work for a long time, I
might add, and we need it to be delivered—there could be a case
for having a network larger than 12,000, but I am not

one expects a little bit of churn within the network. As I have seen in
my constituency, someone running an independent business, such as a
village shop or a community shop, may retire or may be unable to
continue their business, so their counter could be lost. We want the
flexibility in the network, and for the proposition to be attractive
enough, so that someone else would happily come in and take on that
business. So, even if the sub-post office moved location, the community
could still have some sort of service. The proposals for mutualisation
potentially make it more attractive for new agents to come in and make
up such gaps in the

are struggling to sell their post offices in many cases is that a post
office franchise as we speak is not particularly profitable and is not
particularly attractive, so in certain parts of the country it is
taking six, seven or eight months, or even two years, to sell a post
office.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000243">&#160;</a>

are really struggling, because they do 80% of the work over the
counters, and yet last year our income was only £430 million. Do
the sums. We, including the SNP, were responsible for generating
£800 million of the income, yet we only received
£430 million of the pay. Post Office Ltd has to get a
grip on its fixed costs as well, because, quite frankly,
sub-postmasters cannot continue with not enough money to keep their
post offices open. Something’s got to give, because we are
facing a crisis. Mutualisation will help, but the Government have to
deliver on new revenue streams

or most small sub-post offices are part of a larger business, many of

really struggling on their own with just a load of cards and
stationery, it would make more sense to merge them with another outlet,
such as a convenience store or a good newsagent, in that village or
town, if there is one. That would make sense, because you would then
have a sustainable business model that utilises both the shop side and
the post office side. That is the way to ensure long-term
sustainability. Where you have only one post office in a village and
nothing else—a little bit of groceries in the post
office—there will probably still need to be a continuing subsidy
to keep that post office open. Certainly where you have a choice, with
perhaps two shops in a village—one being a post office that is
doing very badly and one being a convenience store that is doing
okay—it would make sense for politicians, such as local
councillors or the local MP, to go for one sustainable, robust shop and
post office in that town or village. That would make more sense than

towns and rural areas have a shop-post office combination. The owner of

to go under, there are to be no more closures, so presumably another
post office operation will come in. I am asking you, in your opinion,

look at putting more Government work through the post office network.
When it comes to the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland, in many cases they have been given 100% rates relief
to help them stay in that community. I know that in Scotland, for
example, some people are saving £4,000 or £5,000 a year,
which is a massive help—saving £100 a week—to keep
their business on the local high street. So, whatever we can do—
Local authorities also have a major role to play to put more work
through the post office network. Local councillors are very good at
telling us how important post offices are when they are closing down,
but unfortunately many local authorities do not put very much work
through the post office network. We do not just want people to talk the
talk, we want people to walk the
walk.

                        <p class="tabbed">This is a
really important question. Again, I am going to put forward evidence
here about the Government’s position. They haven’t asked
the right question. What is this about? What are we trying to actually
achieve by the 10% employee share offer? If we accept that what we are
trying to achieve is to motivate and engage employees to make sure that
they feel more involved in the decisions of the company, we want that.
We agree with that. That is why we have reached the agreement that we
just have. But I have to say that I fundamentally disagree with
Donald’s statement that employees are going to be cheering from
the rafters when they get their first dividend. There are so many more
important issues that you have to deal with if you want to achieve
employee engagement and motivation. The way to do that is to apply the
terms of the agreement that we have reached.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is about
changing. The first thing you have to do is change the command and
control culture of management in this industry. What we have in this
industry is too many people supervising people and not enough managing
people’s problems in the right way. I also believe that we have
too much budget control that bears no resemblance to what actually
happens at a local level. So it comes back to the point of people
having a fair and manageable work load. Our members will cheer from the
rafters when they get treated properly and when they feel that they are
properly involved—not by shares, but by what happens daily in
their work place.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would also
suggest to you that we have pushed for a completely different approach
from the HR procedures in the company. That is key to changing the
culture in a company. You have to have HR procedures—rather than
what I believe happens at the moment, which is that they are based on
almost punishing people—that are actually about correcting
things and reconciling people’s problems, rather than just
saying, “We’re going to punish you for
this”.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Communications—you
cannot change the culture in a company unless you change your
communications strategy. What have we had in recent years? We have had,
to be fair, Royal Mail and CWU competing over communications with the
employees. I honestly believe that the company has put out a lot of
mixed messages in that time. You cannot engage people if you treat the
people like robots, if you stand in front of them reading out messages.
When the noise comes back, “Well, actually we want to talk about
this issue”, you go, “No, we’re not talking about
that today, because we’re delivering our message.” They
are fundamental things that change a company.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Now, where are the employees on
this? Well, why not ask them? We are not afraid for the Government to
ask. We’ll be asking them about where they are. I’ll tell
you what the employees will tell you honestly. They know that there are
no free gifts. They know that, in giving them 10% of shares, there is
every possibility that that comes out of the same pot of money that
protects their pensions and increases their basic pay. Ed, I wish
you’d asked us before you made up this policy. I don’t
think you understand the agreement that we’ve reached.
I’m going to keep coming back to that point, because that is the
biggest chance of changing the culture in the company. If you want to
incentivise people, you take the incentive down to local level; you
don’t have it up here. If you want evidence of that, have a look
at colleague share. That was something like £1.2
billion, which the Government earmarked for Allan Leighton to offer to
employees. It didn’t change a single thing, that is the evidence
and that is the truth. If it had done that, we wouldn’t have had
the disputes we’ve had; we wouldn’t have had the
agreement that we’ve just reached. I am sorry, I believe that if
you share money with an army of private investors—because that
is what the dividend is about—then you are taking money away
from the employees who really care about the
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000257">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why
not put employees on the board? It doesn’t have to be the trade
union. Why not change the governance structure? Why not encourage
customers to come in? Our point is this: there are far better ways of
achieving that aim, than 10% employees’ shares. If you introduce
the Bill, of course at that point we are going to say that we would
rather have more control for employees—that’s just common
sense. We are saying that we are coming up with the wrong solution
without exploring all the questions. We will ask the employees whether
they believe that is the right solution. I do not believe that they
will support

taxpayers’ interests when we are looking at further capital
investment into the Post Office. We have a very willing audience here

represent employee rights. I would ask this direct question of the CWU:

fund has been guilty of bad decisions in the past, as has been
suggested by the Secretary of State for Business? Mr Fuller mentioned
the pension deficit. It has been suggested that it is as high as
£10 billion, or mid-ground £8 billion—for various
reasons it looks as if it is being recalculated down. I think that is
something we should not lose sight of in these discussions: the state

about the members’ pension entitlements? We do not really know,
we are not convinced at this stage from the information that we have
seen, we are checking this out with experts in pensions and with our
lawyers, and we are also in the early stages of consultation with the
Shareholder Executive. We are not convinced that this is as good a deal
for people, in terms of members’ pension entitlements, as the
way that it is being presented. What you have to think about is what
assets of the scheme are going to be left. Are they going to be
sufficient to fund the scheme going forward? I do not think that we
have had the answer to that question
yet.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000266">&#160;</a>

you split POL, you split the pension scheme. You are talking about
three potential divisions in the assets. First, the Government are
going to take the assets. Secondly, they have to decide how
much of the assets will be left to fund the Royal Mail scheme going
forward. Thirdly, they have to decide how they split that between the
Royal Mail scheme and the POL scheme. With due respect, this is our
members’ money. This is the money that they have paid in year
after year—active members, deferred members, retired members. We
do not think that enough consideration has been given to
people’s pension entitlements, so we are going to be looking at
that a lot more closely in the coming
weeks.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000267">&#160;</a>

from six to 10. From what you were just saying, you were indicating

was modernisation, which we have addressed, and that can only be

taxpayer—or each successive Chancellor—has used Royal
Mail as a cash cow. When Royal Mail made profits, it was not allowed to
reinvest them because of the external finance link. Looking at it in

how we can maintain the universal service and the nationwide network of
post offices. That is the way the Government pose the question. Our
argument is that privatisation is not the answer. You could easily
point the finger at us and say, “Well, you would say that; you
are a trade union and you are in a public sector organisation.”

denial about the challenges that Royal Mail faces. We passionately
believe that every one of those challenges can be resolved by logic and
by fact without endangering the future of the universal service. We
also believe that it does not matter what you say; if you privatise a
company, at some point the service standards of the universal service
will be at risk. They will be at risk in rural areas, and in other
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000275">&#160;</a>

the sole provider of the universal service; it should be. If you want a
universal service, Royal Mail is the company to provide that, but you
have to allow it to compete on a level playing field. Privatisation is
not the test here; it is modernisation aligned to resolving some
challenges that can be resolved in the public sector.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000276">&#160;</a>

currently blinkered in their approach to what the answers might be.
Everybody wants a sustainable Post Office and Royal Mail, a universal
service and a uniform tariff. If privatisation takes place, over time
the universal service will deteriorate and be reduced—not next
week, next month or next year, but it will happen in time. The uniform
tariff will change and there will be different prices for different
parts of the country; those are all negatives and the results of
privatisation, and we would say that there are alternatives.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If you look
at the Post Office, as part of the Post Bank Coalition, we asked BIS or
the Government to set up a working party to look at creating a bank at
the Post Office, and they downright refused. The announcement this
morning was also a refusal. We are asking them to look at it, cost it
and examine what would happen, because it could sustain the post office
network in future, if dealt with properly. The best example that we can
find is Kiwibank, which is run through a post office network. I cannot
afford to go, but I am told that you go to a post office counter in New
Zealand, and you buy a stamp, do a recorded delivery or a banking
transaction. There is not a separate network; it is there and they fund
each other. That is the issue with the Post
Office.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000282">&#160;</a>

believe that privatisation is not the answer; modernisation is taking
place, but there is still a long way to go. The World Class Mail
programme was mentioned in a previous panel contribution, and it is a
very good thing in Royal Mail. It makes people feel committed and feel
part of the solution, not part of the problem. It makes them involved
in what they are doing in the workplace, but I have two criticisms of
World Class Mail. One is that it involves relatively small
numbers—it may be in 10 places, but it is a start—but it
also takes the organisation back to where it should have started from
in the ways of working, the way that the kit was prepared before it
started and the way it was maintained. It is not something
groundbreaking or new in that regard. It takes it back to what it
should have been all the time. There is a long way to go on that. We
think that the approach in the Bill—privatisation—is
blinkered; there are other options. The same result can be achieved
through other means.<a class="bkMark" name="10110944000283">&#160;</a>

would be a company called Royal Mail Holdings, so we had security. We
need security for sub-postmasters; they have £2 billion of their
own money invested in this business. If you were a company investing
