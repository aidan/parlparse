<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000522"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jacqui Smith):</b> Welcome back to the

Chair, Mr. Chope. I hope that you have noted the splendid progress we

made this morning. We worked jolly hard and had just got to

amendmentNo. 100, which was moved by my hon. Friend the

Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor). He rightly made the argument that

the impact of a school&#146;s closure will be felt beyond that

school.</div> <a name="0604267000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

concerns the effect of the closure of a rural primary school, and the

ability of other local schools and authorities to continue to perform

their duties in relation to education. That goes to the heart of the

new role for local authorities as commissioners of education services.

I agree with my hon. Friend that local authorities will need to

consider the impact on other schools, parents, pupils and the community

as part of their important strategic role in planning education

provision. That will inform their decisions in planning how many

schools their area needs, where and how big they should be, what kind

of schools would serve their area best, and who the schools should

serve.</div> <a name="0604267000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local

authorities will draw up strategic plans for the pattern of schools in

their area as part of their children and young people&#146;s plans.

To do that, they willmap what is needed in their area

according to demographics, diversity and demand for high standards.

They will ensure that there is a sufficient supply of places by letting

popular schools expand or federate, closing schools that are poor or

failing to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>improve, and inviting proposals to open new schools in some of the ways

that we have discussed. We expect local authorities to work with

schools in a spirit of partnership as they manage their schools. The

best local authorities already do that, and the new role for local

authorities as commissioners of education services will extend that

throughout the country.</div>

<a name="0604267000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that reassures my

hon. Friend regarding the strategic context for local authorities

within which individual closure proposals will be made, and that he

will therefore withdraw his

amendment.</div><a name="0604267000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to

amendment No. 31, to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton(Mr. Gibb) spoke. I understand the difficulties

of closure decisions for some parents. Any decision to close a school

is often worrying for parents, and the subject of considerable concern

and argument. However, as I said when I talked about the factors that

need to be considered, transport considerations must already be

considered when the final decisions on proposals are made.</div>

<a name="0604267000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a rural primary school

closes, the transport costs for displaced pupils will, in many cases,

have to be met by the local authority, which has a duty to provide

transport for children who attend their nearest suitable school if it

is beyond the statutory walking distance of 2 miles for primary-aged

pupils under eight, and3 miles for children aged eight and

over. Local authorities also have to make arrangements to transport

children who live within walking distance but for whom there is no

route to walk in reasonablesafety. Provisions elsewhere in

the Bill will extend rights to transport to children from low-income

groups, including, for this age group, an entitlement to transport

where the school is more than 2 miles from the child&#146;s home.

Therefore, when a rural primary school closes, parents who live nearby

and drive their children to school might gain an entitlement to free

travel for their children under the arrangements outlined

above.</div> <a name="0604267000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the

potential economies of scale of a local authority organising transport

instead of parents driving their children to school, the amendment

could, by requiring a consideration of overall transport costs, have

the perverse effect of shifting the balance of the argument towards

closure.</div><a name="0604267000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000523"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I wonder

whether the Minister has taken into account the provisions of the Bill

that could give local authorities the right to charge some categories

of parents for school transport? That, in essence, is a cost to the

community, albeit not to the local authority. It is a cost to somebody,

and it will have to be met, but the clause does not allow that fact to

be taken into account.</div>

<a name="0604267000025"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000524"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> The provisions that the hon. Gentleman refers to

relate to the suggested pathfinder proposals, under which local

authorities will be able to develop better school transport for

everyone within their area. Although that is an important development,

it is not a fundamental change in the charging regime. In fact, the

balance is likely to be as I suggested. Although I am sympathetic to

the implications for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>individual parents&#151;and they should of course be borne in mind

when making decisions about school closures, particularly of rural

primary schools&#151;I am not convinced that the amendment would

achieve the objectives that the hon. Gentleman set out. Indeed, it

could potentially have a perverse effect on the decision. I therefore

hope that he will not press the amendment.

</div><a name="0604267000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000525"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): I am grateful to my

right hon. Friend the Minister for that clarification. However, the

clause remains unsatisfactory inasmuch as it gives specific attention

to rural primary schools. It lists a number of the criteria that should

apply to rural primary schools but does not list them all because, as

my right hon. Friend pointed out, the question of standards, parental

preference and diversity are also factors in closure decisions.

However, the criteria that apply to rural primary schools could apply

equally to urban primary schools or secondary schools.</div>

<a name="0604267000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">A powerful argument can be made

for including in the Bill the criteria that apply to all school

closures, primary and secondary, rural and urban. It would help the

process. It would assist with the plans of local authorities and

governing bodies, with the publication of closure notices, and in a

public understanding of the reasons for schools closing. Generally, the

process would be more efficient as a result. However, in light of my

right hon. Friend&#146;s clarification, I beg to ask leave to

withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000528"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> What a great pleasure it is, Mr. Chope, to serve

under your chairmanship. I shall rely on our intimate familiarity to

guide us through our proceedings.</div>

<a name="0604267000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments give us the

opportunity to return to the subject of special educational needs.

Those tabled in the names of my hon. Friends and myself, and those

tabled in our names and those of Liberal Democrat Members, are relevant

to the capacity of the Secretary of State to alter special needs

provision, and to the proper consultation that should take place with

parents on his decision to alter such provision. The clause deals with

precisely those matters, but it needs to be seen in context. So, I make

no apology for re-amplifying our real doubts about the commitment to

special schools.</div> <a name="0604267000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was

lucky enough last night to have dinner at the Athenaeum with a

distinguished group of experts in that field, including parents of

special needs children, head teachers at mainstream and special needs

schools, academics, educational psychologists and others. Over a

splendid meal, we had the opportunity to discuss those matters. The

conclusion that emerged from our discussions, which were wide-ranging,

was that educational need must be the key determinate in matching

provision and children. Yet that was not always taken as an a priori

assumption.</div> <a name="0604267000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">During

discussion on the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001,

Baroness Blackstone said that

the</div><a name="0604267000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;commitment to

inclusion has been strong and constant...The potential social,

moral and educational benefits are

significant.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 19

December 2000; Vol. 620, c.

635.]</div><a name="0604267000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The order in which she put

those benefits is interesting. Of course, we are concerned about the

social, moral and cultural interests of people with learning

difficulties, but their educational needs will, at times, be more

significant than any cultural concerns that we might have.</div>

<a name="0604267000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is critical that the effect

on the educational potential of individual children is the key factor

in assessing the adequacy of special needs provision. We are concerned

that this part of the Bill might facilitate the process by which the

number of special schools could be further reduced. I do not think that

that is the intention, and I do not claim that the

Governmentare malevolent in that respect, but without the

clear recommitment to special schools, which our amendments would

provide, that doubt will

remain.</div><a name="0604267000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was some

debate about that in earlier discussions, so I thought that it might be

useful to have a look at some Government figures, which I did over

breakfast&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Where

was that?&#148;] In a small Italian caf√(c) on the junction of

Great Peter street and Great Smith street&#151;it serves exemplary

scrambled eggs. The Government&#146;s figures show that there were

approximately 93,000 children attending special schools in January

1999, but that by January of last year, that number had declined by

about 8 per cent. to 85,540. I think that the Government remain

committed to a policy of including as many children as possible in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>mainstream schools. I shall wait to hear what the Minister says about

that. That policy has resulted in the closure, since 1997, of 93

special schools. I do not blame the Government alone for that&#151;it

was the prevailing orthodox thinking after the Warnock report and the

following Act that was passed, of course, under a Conservative

Government.</div><a name="0604267000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness

Warnock, whose report in 1978, as I mentioned, started the bandwagon

for inclusion, said recently that the policy had backfired and left

&#147;a disastrous legacy&#148;. Of course, the survey, about which

we have talked, of teachers and head teachers, suggests that many of

them know that the legacy has indeed been disastrous. In that survey,

conducted by <i class="I">The Times Educational Supplement,</i> they concluded

that as many as one in four children with special needs integrated into

the mainstream would have been served better by education in a special

school. It is therefore vital that in the Bill we reaffirm our

commitment to the continuance of special schools, and that we use this

debate as an opportunity to celebrate their work and their

excellence.</div>

<a name="0604267000482"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

pm</div><a name="0604267000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee

will know that one such special school threatened with closure, which

might be protected by legislation that reaffirmed the role of schools

in the way that I describe, is the Nuffield speech and language unit.

My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) has been a great

champion of that place. The unit was part of the Royal National Throat,

Nose and Ear hospital and, therefore, of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS

trust. It has been in existence since 1971 and provides intensive

teaching and therapy for children aged four to seven

withsevere speech and language disorders, for whom there is

no provision of comparable quality in mainstream schools. It is

recognised as a centre of excellence. Between 1998 and 2003, 41 per

cent. of the children leaving the unit returned directly to mainstream

education.</div> <a name="0604267000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point

about that school is that it is evidence of the fluidity that can occur

when children spend time in special education and are then better

equipped to take advantage of opportunities in the mainstream. We do

not have to see the matter as static. It should be a dynamic process in

which children&#146;s needs are catered for most appropriately at

each stage of their time in education. A child might well start off in

a special school and then move to a mainstream school, as those

Nuffield children have done&#151;7 per cent. of children return to

local language units and 38 per cent. transfer to the Meath school, a

specialist school for children with specific speech and language

difficulties.</div> <a name="0604267000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

total cost of running the unit is some &#163;300,000, whereas the

expenditure of the trust is in the order of &#163;300 million. The

trust gives as the main reasons for its decision to recommend closure

the Government&#146;s inclusion policy and the preference of the

local education authority for inclusion. The Committeewill

understand, therefore, why we have tabled the amendment. Although we

accept that the Government are not malevolent, we fear that we are all

still suffering from the misassumptions about special educational 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>provision that prevailed following the Warnock report and the

legislation to which it gave rise. No such provision for children from

four onwards can be found anywhere else. The fact is that the children

with the most severe disorders need specialist intensive help, which

units such as Nuffield can provide.</div>

<a name="0604267000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The school is

critical, partly because the Government are keen to reduce the number

of statements and partly because many LEAs, for ideological or

financialreasons, are reluctant to issue statements before

the age of five, and even when they do so, they are loth to finance

out-of-area placements. I would go further: it is not enough simply to

defend existing special schools; where we identify good practice, we

should look to expand that kind of provision if the need warrants it. I

want to see a new generation of special schools if that is what

children need and parents want&#151;that is the critical

determinant.</div> <a name="0604267000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

brings me to the other amendments in the group. Parents of children

attending a community or foundation special school should be key

consulteesin the case of any direction that requires the

discontinuance of that school. Amendment No. 33 would, therefore, add

them to the list. Furthermore, we ask in amendment No. 34 that the

Secretary of State should give reasons for any such

directions.</div> <a name="0604267000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first

purpose of the amendments is to make a bold case for schools that

provide excellent educational opportunities for disadvantaged children,

and there are few children more disadvantaged than those with stated

special educational needs. Units such as the Nuffield speech and

language unit deserve the support that the amendment would give them.

The second purpose is to ensure that the people most directly affected

are properly involved in the process.</div>

<a name="0604267000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make no apology for speaking

to the amendments at some length, because the matter is important and

they would add quality to the Bill. They will undoubtedly be accepted

by the Minister in precisely that

spirit.</div><a name="0604267000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000529"></a><b class="B">Annette

clause 16(1), to which the Conservatives have proposed amendments. If

we are being logical, my hon. Friends and I should opposethe

provision. I should like to probe the Minister on the clause, which I

imagine would be used only in a most extreme case. I am slightly

puzzled&#151;if a school was in such a dire state that the health,

safety or welfare of pupils was being affected, why on earth would the

local authority not close it down? Do we really have local authorities

that are so crass that they would not do that? Is there something

extreme that might come up in an Ofsted report that would require the

provision? I ask the Minister those questions with a view to supporting

the clause if I can be convinced that it is very

significant.</div><a name="0604267000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

confused about the Conservatives&#146; amendments. We keep hearing

that they do not like the Government&#146;s policy of closing special

schools, but here we have an amendment that actually asks the Secretary

of State to intervene. It is slightly strange that they ask for a

direction from the Secretary of State when they have argued all along

that she has been engineering closures.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div><a name="0604267000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a further question on

amendment No. 255. I recall that, the last time I was upset about the

closure by a Conservative Administration of a special school to which

some of my constituents went, there was a process whereby an

adjudicator was brought in. Does that make the amendment unnecessary?

The case was lost, but I recall a number of parts of the process. Will

the Minister comment on

that?</div><a name="0604267000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments to

which my hon. Friends and I have added our names are very sensible. If

the extreme measure under the clause is taken by the Secretary of State

because of health, social and welfare reasons, the parents of the

children should be involved and the reasons for the closure should be

stated. We support the amendments wholeheartedly, but I have asked

questions on the issue because I am not yet entirely sure of the

significance of the

clause.</div><a name="0604267000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000530"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): In considering

the amendments, we should examine the work that parents have to do to

secure provision from a local education authority for a child with

special educational needs. As those of us who are parents know, a week

is a long time in the life of a child at school, and two or three years

is a very long time for a child to have special needs. The age at which

most special needs manifest themselves is about seven, and it can take

parents two to three years to secure the provision of specialist help

that their children need, in a maintained school, a non-maintained

school or a special

school.</div><a name="0604267000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nowadays most

parents who manage to secure the right provision for a child with

special needs must go to the special educational needs and disability

tribunal. The tribunal is free at the point of access for parents. I am

trying to illustrate what a parent must go through to get a child into

specialist provision and explain what the consequences would be, where

the child would go, and the process that would have to be undergone to

secure subsequent provision, should the provision secured for the child

then close. Although parents do not have to pay to go to a tribunal,

most local authorities nowadays employ a barrister and parents are

expected to present professional reports about their child&#146;s

needs. We have heard about the cost of the tribunal to a

parent.</div><a name="0604267000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000531"></a><b class="B">Ms

Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): Are not

most authorities keen to settle a tribunal before it takes place? The

records prove that. Are not authorities also obliged to offer a free

advocacy service to all parents who want to go to a

tribunal?</div><a name="0604267000060"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000532"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. We are in danger of straying from the

theme of the amendments, which is about the discontinuance of special

schools, rather than what happens when they

continue.</div><a name="0604267000061"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000533"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I shall shorten my account, then, and merely say

that it takes huge effort by parents to have a child statemented and to

have their special needs met, as MPs of all parties know, I am sure.

However, there are areas where special needs schools have closed. The

Select Committee heard in evidence that Newbury no longer has any

special needs schools&#151;it states that all 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>its children will be educated in inclusive programmes in maintained

schools. However, the statistics show that that is not true, and most

of the children with special needs in Newbury are being sent out of the

borough.</div> <a name="0604267000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many special

schools now take children from far afield. I have no special school in

my constituency and children from there attend special schools as far

away as Cheltenham; they must board away from home. If there are

children with special needs in a school it will not be a simple matter

to secure additional provision for them. Not many maintained schools

will willingly take on a huge number of children with statements of

special needs. It is not correct to assume that on the closure of a

school children who have special needs can be placed in alternative

education in the same way as children without special needs.</div>

<a name="0604267000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of the difficulty for

parents in securing specialist provision for their children in

maintained or special schools, how does the Minister think parents will

cope on the closure of a school when there is no additional provision?

How, given that most special schools now have long waiting lists and

reduced numbers, would the required provision be

supplied?</div><a name="0604267000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000534"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Rob Wilson</b> (Reading, East) (Con): I want to speak briefly

in support of amendments Nos. 32 and 255. There has for some time been

concern about special educational needs&#151;hence the recent Warnock

report and the Ofsted and Audit Commission reports. It is widely

recognised by those who work in special educational needs that there

are significant problems. It is my view that the Government are failing

to take a strong strategic lead in the matter. I am not sure now

whether they back their 1997 policy of inclusion. Some Ministers have,

certainly, suggested that it is now up to local authorities to decide

their own framework. Wide variation in quality of and access to

provision will continue while that happens.</div>

<a name="0604267000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 32 would provide a

belt-and-braces approach so that any future closures could be

thoroughly questioned, at least by the Secretary of State and her civil

servants. Some special schools can and should be closed, but others are

closed in the teeth of local opposition. Amendment No. 255 would ensure

that alternative provision was made. Sometimes that has not been

thought through when left to LEAs. Those two important amendments would

offer parents support in accessing a quality service, which sometimes

they do not receive at the

moment.</div><a name="0604267000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

pm</div><a name="0604267000066"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000535"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> It might be worth while my beginning by explaining

what clause 16, to which most of the amendments in the group relate, is

designed to achieve, as no one seems particularly clear about that. The

hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) at least

had the honesty to ask what it is

about.</div><a name="0604267000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause gives

the Secretary of State the power to direct an LEA to close a maintained

special school on a specified date when it is considered that that is

inthe interests of the health, safety or welfare of the

children. It re-enacts provisions in existing legislation and

complements other provisions whereby the Secretary of State can

withdraw approval from an 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>independent or non-maintained special school, which would lead to the

school&#146;s closure. In other words, the clause ensures that the

Secretary of State&#146;s power in this case is equivalent to the

Secretary of State&#146;s power in respect of independent or

non-maintained schools. It is a reserve power, intended to be used only

when pupils are considered to be at risk. The clause provides the power

to take emergency action to protect pupils in special schools, some of

whom, as hon. Members know, are among the most vulnerable members of

our society.</div><a name="0604267000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 32 does not relate to the health, safety or welfare of pupils,

which is the subject of clause 16. The amendment would require the

Secretary of State to authorise, by issuing a direction, the

discontinuance of any maintained special school that catered for pupils

with moderate or severe learning difficulties. I will go into more

detail about how the system works now in relation to other amendments

in the group, particularly the amendment to clause 18, but let me say

that we believe that the current system provides an objective and

independent balance between proposals made by local authorities and the

needs of the local

community.</div><a name="0604267000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) said that the amendment would

provide a belt-and-braces approach. That is an interesting approach to

decision making in government. Unlike the many people who argue that

government should be slimmed down, the hon. Gentleman wants

belt-and-braces government. The amendment would introduce an

unnecessary additional layer to the decision-making

process.</div><a name="0604267000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">No member of

the Committee is unaware of the emotive issues and difficult decisions

that surround the closure of some special schools, but we should also

acknowledge that there have been other closures on which there was

local agreement&#151;for example, where one or more special schools

have closed to move to a more modern facility. I do not think that

there would be any very good reason why such decisions should be

referred to the Secretary of State, so I hope that the amendment will

not be

pressed.</div><a name="0604267000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

33 relates to the requirement to consult parents. As I said, clause 16

provides a reserve power for specific circumstances, which are likely

to be emergency circumstances. It already allows for consultation

of</div><a name="0604267000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other persons as

the Secretary of State considers

appropriate&#148;,</div><a name="0604267000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">and

I think that that provides sufficient safeguards. We expect

&#147;such other persons&#148; to include parents

ofchildren attending the school, but we should take note that

the clause provides the power to take emergency action to protect

pupils. We are talking not about a process whereby statutory proposals

are published fora school&#146;s closure, but about a

situation in whichemergency action may need to take place

very quickly and the normal length and scope of consultation may not be

appropriate. I hope that hon. Members recognise that increasing the

number of specific statutory steps that need to be taken in such

exceptional circumstances might act against the welfare of the children

and young people being considered.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div><a name="0604267000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to amendment No. 34.

The clause requires the Secretary of State to give notice in writing of

a direction to a school&#146;s governing body and head teacher.

Before the direction is issued, there is consultation with interested

parties, and the reasons for considering the direction will be well

known. We would clearly expect a letter giving a direction to give the

reasons for that

direction.</div><a name="0604267000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 255 would require the Secretary of State to be satisfied that

acceptable alternative provision had been made for children before a

school was closed by direction. The clause specifies that a direction

must give a date for discontinuance. One factor to be considered in

setting that date will be the alternative placement of the children at

the school, but we are clear that it should not be the determining

factor. As I suggested, pupils&#146; welfare must take priority in

the grave situation where the Secretary of State is considering closing

a whole school because of concerns about the pupils&#146; health,

safety or welfare.</div>

<a name="0604267000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is, of course, an

important safeguard. Children attending a special school will have a

statement of special educational needs setting out the provision and

placement that apply to them. Local authorities are under a duty to

amend a statement if changes are proposed to that provision or

placement, and that will involve consulting parents,

otherschools and possibly local authorities with which the

child might be placed. Local authorities would automatically have to

amend the provision in a statement where a school was under threat of

closure. I hope that that gives some reassurance on the alternative

provision. In the exceptional circumstances in which the reserve power

would be used, we would not necessarily want to delay a decision to

ensure that alternative provision was in place at that particular

moment, but the statementing process is an important way of ensuring

that provision is made.</div>

<a name="0604267000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We take the aims of promoting

and safeguarding pupils&#146; welfare extremely seriously. It is

important that the Secretary of State has power to act when emergency

circumstances arise. That is the correct step to take, and that is what

the clause achieves. I suspect that hon. Members will be relieved to

know that it has not been necessary to use that power since the School

Standards and Framework Act 1998 introduced it. However, they will

agree that were it necessary to use that power, it would be important

to use it not only appropriately, but in a way that safeguarded the

children in a school as quickly as possible. For the reasons that I

have given, therefore, I hope that hon. Members will not press their

amendments to clause 16.

</div><a name="0604267000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 35

relates to clause 18, which is a more general clause about prescribed

alterations and in many ways the more appropriate place to discuss the

process of alterations to particular schools, although it does not

relate to the emergency proposals covered in clause 16. As has always

been the case, changes will continue to be made to individual

schools&#151;both special and mainstream&#151;in the light of local

needs and demands.</div> <a name="0604267000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) referred to

the research that he had done over his breakfast, but perhaps he should

have spent slightly longer over his breakfast. The figures that he gave

for maintained special schools and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>the number of pupils are correct, but consideration must be given to the

number of pupils in non-maintained special schools and independent

special schools, where the number of pupils with statements is

increasing. The key point, however, is that although the numbers have

decreased, there has also been an overall decrease in the pupil

population. In fact, whereas the proportion of children in maintained

special schools in 1997 was 1.1 per cent., remaining at that level up

to 2003, and in 2005 the figure was 1 per cent. The proportion of

children placed in maintained special schools has been stable for the

past eight years, which gives the lie to the proposition that there has

been a radical change and that a large proportion of children cannot

now access and take advantage of those special schools.</div>

<a name="0604267000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman suggested

that we should use today as a celebration of the contribution of

special schools. I am more than happy to celebrate and praise the

contribution that special schools make both to the children with places

in them, and increasingly&#151;this is a key element of Government

policy&#151;through their work with mainstream schools, sharing that

expertise and ensuring that children get the best facilities, support,

teaching and provision, whatever school they attend. That is at the

heart of what we mean by inclusion: looking at the needs of each child

and ensuring that they receive the best provision and support, wherever

they are educated.</div><a name="0604267000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">When

it comes to making decisions about the organisation and structure of

special needs provision, local authorities and schools themselves are

best placed to respond to the needs of pupils in their areas. That is

why amendment No. 35 is unnecessary and undesirable. In terms of its

intention, it is an example of a centralising amendment. While certain

values remain paramount in dealing with children with special needs,

those needs and the demography of children with special needs will

change over time. Local authorities that reorganise their special

educational needs provision quite often do so because they recognise

that special schools need to cater for the growing population of

children with severe and complex needs, and mainstream schools need to

have the capacity to teach children with moderate learning difficulties

who in many circumstances would not be appropriately placed in special

schools. As I suggested, that close collaboration between special and

mainstream schools is also being

promoted.</div><a name="0604267000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local

authorities are also developing resourced provision within or attached

to schools as another way of providing specialist help to pupils who

need it and of including them in mainstream activities. That would be

prevented by any moratorium or if local authorities could not examine

how they organised their provision. That is what some hon. Members

opposite want, but it is not what we want, which is a continuum of

provision to meet the range of needs.</div>

<a name="0604267000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course the hon. Member for

Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) is right that parents feel passionately

about ensuring that their children receive the best provision, which is

at the heart of the Government&#146;s approach to developing special

educational needs provision. However, let me correct a couple of her

other comments&#151;perhaps she would like to listen to this. She

said that most parents of children with special 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div>educational needs have to go to SENDIST, but that is just wrong. Not

only does the number not constitute most parents, but the number of

appeals to SENDIST has fallen markedly, by 9 per

cent.</div><a name="0604267000083"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000536"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> Could that be because most parents cannot afford

to go to a

tribunal?</div><a name="0604267000084"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000537"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> No, it could not. Of course the statementing

process is important, but the proportion of statements written within

the required 18 weeks now stands at 92 per cent., up from 82 per cent.

five years ago. Of course the system is not perfect, but to suggest

that the vast majority of parents and children are not receiving

important support is to misjudge and misrepresent it in a way that does

not help mature

debate.</div><a name="0604267000484"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

pm</div><a name="0604267000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

would remove one of the key flexibilities in the continuum of provision

that we want to achieve. Clause 18 is not about the opening or closure

of schools, but about the alteration of existing schools and the

circumstances in which proposals need to be published. Sometimes in

order to alter or establish a certain type of special needs provision,

often in new and improved facilities, other provision in unsuitable

accommodation needs to close. We do not want to impose from the centre

a planning blight on local authorities so that they cannot develop

provision to meet changing patterns of need in their areas. How local

authorities publish proposals for appropriate provision must be up to

them.</div> <a name="0604267000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not for

the Government to say, for example, &#147;You&#146;ve got to have

five special schools, two pupil referral units, or so many special

needs units attached to mainstream schools.&#148; Those are rightly

matters for local decision based on local needs. I hope, for the

reasons that I have given, that amendment No. 35 will not be

pressed.</div> <a name="0604267000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

provisions that we have made are the right approach, and I hope that

hon. Members who have tabled amendments in the group&#151;whether to

clause 16, which relates to a reserve power in specific emergency

circumstances, or to clause 18&#151;will not press

them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000538"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister has comprehensively assessed the

clause and the amendments. I shall deal with each in turn.</div>

<a name="0604267000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the right hon.

Lady&#146;s point about amendment No. 34, which was that in the case

of the closure of a special school in the emergency circumstances that

she described, the reasons for such a direction would be given in

writing as a matter of course. Furthermore, I accept her advice that

those consulted would include all appropriate people, which would by

necessity include parents of children attending the school. On that

basis, it seems to me to be entirely unreasonable to press either

amendment No. 34 or amendment No. 33. I also take her advice that the

clause provides a reserve power to be used in exceptional circumstances

andwill, in effect, give life once again to the power in

the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>1998 Act, which has not been used because such emergencies have not

occurred. On that basis, it would be inappropriate to press amendment

No. 32.</div> <a name="0604267000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the

right hon. Lady made one or two points about alternative provision that

were less convincing. I accept that the circumstances in which the

clause would be used would necessarily be exceptional. However, it

would be odd if acceptable alternative provision for children affected

was not a critical part of the process. She said that the statement

would be amended if necessary and that proper consideration would have

to be given by force of law, because there is a statutory duty to

provide an education in line with the statement that would remain

regardless of the closure of the school concerned. None the less, it

would be useful to accept amendment No. 255 as it is highly desirable

in such emergency, albeit rare, circumstances that alternative

provision is a central element of what the law expects. The right hon.

Lady was less convincing on that topic.</div>

<a name="0604267000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was pleased that the Minister

took up my challenge to celebrate the work of special schools. I am

concerned that <i class="I">The Times Educational Supplement </i>survey suggests

that 90 per cent. of head teachers thought that their schools did not

receive enough support to ensure the success of inclusion and that two

thirds of teachers have received less than one day&#146;s training on

how to teach children with special needs. Those are matters of profound

concern.</div> <a name="0604267000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are

going to include children in the mainstream&#151;there are many

children for whom that is the right course&#151;we must ensure that

those who are responsible for educating them are equipped to do so, as

the Minister said. I do not in any way deride the good work of schools

or the good intentions of the Minister, but I am not sure that the

evidence suggests that that is always the case. I want to re-amplify

those worries here today. Notwithstanding the Minister&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000561"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss

Government amendments Nos. 108 to

127.</div><a name="0604267000123"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000562"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> These amendments are intended in the main to

correct technical drafting flaws in the Bill and in some cases to

preserve and clarify its original intention. I will provide the

Committee with a brief overview of their effect, dealing first with the

purely technical amendments.</div>

<a name="0604267000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 108, 112, 119,

121, 122, and 127 are designed to correct and clarify cross-references

in the Bill to other legislation, including references to other

sections of the Bill and to the Learning and Skills Act 2000.</div>

<a name="0604267000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other main

&#147;sub-group&#148; is amendmentsNos. 110, 111, 113,

120, 123, 124, 125 and 126.They are all designed to clarify

at various points in the schedule that the requirement to link

proposals for consideration, determination or referral to the

adjudicator applies only when those proposals are yet to be

determined.</div> <a name="0604267000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 117 and 118 will widen the circumstances in which prescribed

bodies such diocesan authorities, promoters of new schools and, in some

circumstances, the governors of a school or the Learning and Skills

Council may refer an objection to a local authority's decision on

proposals to the adjudicator. As the Bill stands, such objections may

be referred only when proposals have been rejected, which could mean

that there would be no mechanism for appeal if a local authority

approved proposals for an independent school to join the maintained

sector despite concerns about the impact on community cohesion. The

amendments change the wording so that objections may also be referred

when proposals have been determined.</div>

<a name="0604267000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also allowing the local

authority to comment on proposals when they are referred. That was

always the original intention of the legislation, as was indicated in

the White Paper, which made it clear that providers who were

dissatisfied with a local authority decision would be able to appeal to

the schools adjudicator. Amendments Nos. 117 and 118 fulfil that

commitment fully.</div>

<a name="0604267000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 107 is designed to

clarify the intention when a local authority is required

torefer proposals to the schools adjudicator. As the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>Committee will be aware, when proposals are referred, the local

authority has no role in determining them. Amendment No. 107 makes it

clear that the local authority will not be expected to undertake any

consideration of such proposals.</div>

<a name="0604267000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 109 corrects an

original intention of the legislation. As the Bill stands, regulations

would prescribe the changes that local authorities may make to

proposals before they are determined. We do not think it necessary to

prescribe such changes, because local authorities must be given the

freedom to consider and respond to differing local circumstances and

concerns. The amendment therefore removes the reference to prescribed

alterations.</div> <a name="0604267000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 114 removes the requirement on a local authority automatically to

refer its own proposals to discontinue a school to the schools

adjudicator if objections are received from any party. If this

amendment is not made, the net result could be a massive and

unacceptable burden on the schools adjudicator, as most proposals would

be likely to end up at the adjudicator's door. Our intention was always

that proposals should be referred only at the request of the types of

organisation that I mentioned earlier&#151;for example, those

represented on the school organisation committee. The amendment

corrects the Bill to achieve that intention.</div>

<a name="0604267000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 115 provides for

regulations to allow that where a local authority refers to the

adjudicator its own proposals or those concerning a trust in which it

has a minor interest, objections to those proposals may also be

referred.</div> <a name="0604267000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

members of the Committee agree that the amendments are helpful not only

in tidying up some of the current drafting in the Bill, but in making

our policy intentions clearer in some areas and providing useful

additional provision in others.</div>

<a name="0604267000133"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000563"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am delighted that some of the amendments take us

back to the vision of the White Paper, which is the driving force

behind most of our amendments. However, I have a few points to raise

regarding amendments Nos. 109, 114, 117, and 122.</div>

<a name="0604267000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister explained that

amendment No. 109 does not correct a drafting error. I assume,

therefore, that the phrase &#147;of a prescribed kind&#148; in

paragraph 8(4)(c) of the schedule was originally intended to be

included, as I would have expected, so that where schools are

established under the procedures inclauses 9 or

10&#151;that is, outside a competition&#151;local

authorities&#146; powers to alter proposals would be more limited

than with proposals under clause 7, which involves proposals that local

authorities have invited. If that is the case, why has the Minister

changed her position? Why does she now want to give local authorities

more say over proposals for new schools that they might not have had

any involvement in initiating, unless the procedure was according

toclause 9(1), in which case they would have to seek special

permission to initiate from the Secretary of State? A response to that

point would be extremely

helpful.</div><a name="0604267000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the

Minister confirm that the effect of amendment No. 114 together with

amendment No. 117 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>would be to prevent the objections to school closures of people other

than those listed resulting in a referral to the schools

adjudicator?</div><a name="0604267000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 122, will the Minister explain why paragraph 14 of the

schedule will not be included in the amended list in paragraph

18(3)(a)?</div><a name="0604267000485"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

pm</div><a name="0604267000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000564"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): If I may do so with your

agreement, Mr. Chope, I shall make a couple of brief comments on the

amendments before making general comments on part 4 of the schedule,

rather than speak in the debate on clause stand

part.</div><a name="0604267000138"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000565"></a>The

Chairman:</b> That seems very

fair.</div><a name="0604267000139"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000566"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Thank you, Mr.

Chope.</div><a name="0604267000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the

fact that the Government are giving more freedom to local authorities,

as amendmentNo. 109 does. I have some queries about part 4 of

the schedule. Have the Government considered the possibility of

transferring assets to a trust with a leasehold rather than with a

freehold? That would partly deal with the concern of many hon. Members

that a trust might damage the value of an asset and prevent a local

authority from having any overall strategic management of it. It would

ensure that, if any serious alterations to the building were needed,

the trust would have to notify the freeholder before making them. It

would allow some element of

protection.</div><a name="0604267000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the

Minister confirm that playing fields are excluded from being

transferred to prevent their sale and their loss to an area?</div>

<a name="0604267000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not clear to us why, as

set out in paragraph 28(4), the local authority should pay the costs of

a transfer to a trust. Will the Minister clarify the intention behind

that? When any other asset is sold, the person buying or gaining it

would pay the costs. The local authority may incur considerable

costs.</div><a name="0604267000143"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000567"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I shall first answer the points madeby

the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I will look

carefully at what he said on amendment No. 109, but I do not

necessarily accept his interpretation of it. It relates to the extent

to which a local authority can modify proposals when making a decision

on them. The amendment will mean that such modification does not need

to be constrained to a prescribed alteration. A local authority will

not be able to make radical changes; the intention is that the shape of

the original proposal must remain but that there should not be

artificial restrictions on the nature of the modifications that a local

authority can make.</div><a name="0604267000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 114, if the hon. Gentleman was asking me whether it would

limit those who could require a local authority to refer to an

adjudicator, the answer is yes, as I spelt out in my earlier comments.

As originally drafted, the implication of the Bill was that if there

were any objection to a proposal it would have to be referred to the

adjudicator. That was neither the policy intention nor the current

position, and no member of the Committee would think that a

proportionate approach. Our proposal is that those 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>who are currently represented on the school organisation committee, for

example, would maintain their ability to refer proposals for

adjudication.</div><a name="0604267000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

afraid that I slightly lost track of the last point that the hon.

Gentleman raised, but I will write to him with a

response.</div><a name="0604267000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) referred to part 4 of the

schedule. I can perhaps provide her with some reassurance. The guidance

that I have issued alongside clause 34&#151;I think that it has been

sent out to members of the Committee&#151;spells out in detail the

different circumstances of the transfer of assets when a school takes

on foundation status, the various protections afforded to both the

school and the local authority and the adjudicator&#146;s role in

mediating in certain circumstances; for instance, if there is

disagreement about the nature of the land to be

transferred.</div><a name="0604267000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

point that the hon. Lady made about leasehold, the disadvantage of

negotiating potentially 24,000 different leasehold agreements is that

it would be time-consuming, burdensome and bureaucratic. We believe

that the transfer of freehold, the protections outlined in schedule 4

and the guidance to which I have referred are the most effective ways

in which we can ensure what I think she is getting at&#151;the

suitable protection of publicly funded land. I think that if she looks

at the guidance and the schedule, she will see the sort of protections

that we

envisage.</div><a name="0604267000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I

can reassure the hon. Lady, not on her specific point, but with respect

to playing fields, that there is nothing in the legislation or the

transfer of assets that would undermine the protection of playing field

land put in place by&#151;if my memory serves me right&#151;section

77 of the School Standards and Framework Act. Under the Bill before us,

that protection will remain in place. With those reassurances, I hope

that hon. Members will feel able to support schedule

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000570"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman says, &#147;Hear, hear!&#148;

about that provision. When we discuss school organisation committees,

we will come to a provision that the hon. Gentleman will no doubt

regret, also established under that

Act.</div><a name="0604267000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under current

legislation and this Bill, there is no right of appeal for such

decisions. The only recourse for aggrieved parties is the costly and

limited judicial review process. A judicial review of a decision by a

school adjudicator can cost about &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000. The

Bill before us extends significantly the powers of the school

adjudicator, and we believe that natural justice requires that there be

an appeal process from those decisions. We have opted for that appeal

to be to the Secretary of State, who is, of course, accountable to

Parliament and the

electorate.</div><a name="0604267000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

concern that the school adjudicator and his regional representatives

are very much part of the education establishment, which is responsible

forthe current problems in our education system and under

which a quarter of secondary schools are underperforming. There is a

concern also that in reality they are not as independent as they were

established to be. In their seminal work for Policy Exchange:

&#147;More Good School Places&#148;, James O&#146;Shaughnessy and

Charlotte Leslie wrote

that,</div><a name="0604267000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;although the

Adjudicator is supposed to be independent, it is unfortunately not

always so, as Rose Bugler from the Lowick Primary School in Cumbria

explains&#148;.</div><a name="0604267000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cumbria

education authority wanted to close the Lowick school. Rose Bugler

said:</div> <a name="0604267000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The LEA

said to us that they had decided early on that there was no need for

any new schools in the county. End of

story.&#148;</div><a name="0604267000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">She went on to

say:</div><a name="0604267000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We finally

got to the Adjudicator, who we thought would be independent. However,

the Adjudicator has to take note of what the LEA says and of course

that must be the &#145;truth&#146;. It was all tied up in political

knots.&#148;</div><a name="0604267000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">O&#146;Shaughnessy

and Leslie provide other examples of the adjudicator&#146;s decision

making that demonstrate why it is crucial for there to be an appeal

process against his or her decisions. They cite the example of Brighton

and Hove Montessori school, a not-for-profit independent school. For 12

years, it had been trying to become the first state Montessori school

in the United Kingdom. In 2004, the Department for Education and Skills

approved its capital funding bid to buy land and to build a voluntary

aided school. Because it was a voluntary aided school, the school had

to find 10 per cent. of the capital. As O&#146;Shaughnessy and Leslie

comment,</div>

<a name="0604267000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Initially, the local

authority, Brighton and Hove City Council, supported their bid but,

despite the DFES&#146;s enthusiasm, soon became far less

co-operative.&#148;</div> <a name="0604267000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Brighton and Hove school organisation committee refused the application

for voluntary aided status on five grounds and the school appealed to

the schools adjudicator. The grounds for the objection were: the

educational standards of the proposed school; the source of the capital

funding; the fact that there were surplus places in the area; a lack of

parental demand; and the school&#146;s unhappiness with the admission

arrangements. To counter those criticisms, the school pointed out that

surplus places cannot be used as an argument in rejecting an

application by a proposer where there is a strong case based on

parental 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>preference and standards. The school had a full waiting list and a

700-name petition calling for it; it had followed the advice of the

admissions team at the DFES; and its Ofsted reports were

good.</div> <a name="0604267000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The adjudicator

found against the school on the capital funding issue. The DFES

guidance prevented him from approving the bid on the condition of the

remaining funding being found. Meanwhile, the LEA&#146;s opposition

to the school had discouraged the bank, with which the school had been

negotiating for the other 10 per cent., from approving the loan. The

bank was unwilling to go ahead without a more positive input from the

LEA. It became a vicious circle. DFES guidance states that the

presumption should be to approve a new bid. The grounds on which the

bid was contested were very dubious, and the decision of the

adjudicator was predicated on caution and maintaining the status quo.

In his conclusion to the case, the adjudicator

said:</div><a name="0604267000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

not...possible to be certain that present qualities&#148;

&#151;</div><a name="0604267000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">the high quality of

education provided when the school was in the independent

sector&#151;</div><a name="0604267000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would

apply to the proposed school. I must if anything err on the side of

caution.&#148;</div><a name="0604267000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a

statement echoing the attitude of the Deputy Prime Minister to this

Bill, he said that, with its new facilities, the new maintained

school</div> <a name="0604267000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;might prove

attractive to more local families who might indeed find places to be

available. If that were to be the case, then the anxieties expressed by

the LEA, schools local to the proposed site and other objectors would

prove to be well

founded.&#148;</div><a name="0604267000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

report demonstrates the challenges faced bypromoters in

establishing new schools. Where promoters face opposition from existing

schools and the LEA, they can find it difficult to proceed. The

adjudicator in that case reinforced the erroneous objections. His

decision explicitly recognised the success and popularity of the new

school, but his comments on the impact that the school would have on

existing schools demonstrated a reluctance to challenge the position of

those schools.</div><a name="0604267000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

was, therefore, a case for an appeal against the decision of the

schools adjudicator even before the Bill was published. The new,

increased range of decisions to be referred to the adjudicator under

the Bill makes the case for an appeal process even more

compelling.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000571"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b><b class="B"> </b>I shall listen carefully

to the Minister&#146;s arguments in response to this Conservative

amendment, but we on the Liberal Democrat Benches instinctively see the

amendment as attempting to undermine the independence of the schools

adjudicator. Our instinct is to oppose it, but we will listen carefully

to the Minister and to what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton says in

reply.</div>

<a name="0604267000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<a name="0604267000183"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000572"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> As we have heard, the amendment would give schools

and the proposers of new schools a right of appeal to the Secretary of

State on decisions of the adjudicator. The instincts of the hon. Member

for Brent, East are right; it is a slightly surprising amendment, given

what I thought was a reasonably recurrent theme of Conservative

policy&#151;the need to cut back on the power of Government and the

Secretary of State.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div><a name="0604267000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Bognor Regis

and Littlehampton wrongly sees the adjudicator as being a creature of

government. He disparagingly dismissed those who carry out that

important role as being part of what he called an educational

establishment that has failed badly&#151;a sweeping deprecation of

large numbers of hard-working people who have achieved some

considerable improvements over the past eight years.</div>

<a name="0604267000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,

I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the eight adjudicators,

including Dr. Philip Hunter, the chief adjudicator, all had a wide and

diverseexperience of education before being appointed. That

is important when making independent decisions about complex

educational issues. Three were chief education officers, three were Her

Majesty&#146;s inspectors of schools, one was a diocesan director of

education and one was a civil servant who now also serves as a

parliamentary commissioner. They were appointed for their ability to

act impartially, independently and objectively, taking account of the

case presented by each party, the evidence presented to support that

case and any general guidance issued by the Secretary of State.

Adjudicators areindependent of the Secretary of State, and

base their decisions on the merits of each case.</div>

<a name="0604267000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the merits of the case

for the amendment, I am unpersuaded. Although my right hon. Friend the

Secretary of State would always take decisions on the merits of the

cases that came before her, the possibility has to be considered that

not all holders of her office would do so. At one time, many changes to

schools came to the Secretary of State for a decision. One reason for

stopping that and devolving decision making on school organisation to

the local level was to ensure that such decisions were taken without

national political intervention.</div>

<a name="0604267000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">On balance, we think it right

that local decisions should be taken locally whenever possible. That is

why, as I suggested after the 1997 election, we introduced the school

organisation committee, which we will discuss later, that will

represent local stake holders; and we are now introducing a new

framework, with the local authority as the commissioner and assurer of

education provision.</div>

<a name="0604267000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we appreciate that in

some circumstances there may be a local clash of interests&#151;a

school proposed for closure by the local authority may have different

ideas, or a school may wish to expand to offer greater choice to

parents. There may be circumstances such as outlined by the hon.

Gentleman, notwithstanding the fact that he thought the adjudicator had

not made the right decision in those circumstances, where a proposer

might make a proposition that the local decision maker turned

down.</div> <a name="0604267000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such

circumstances, we think it right that there should also be an appeal

against the decision of the local authority. That is why we have

provided the right to appeal to the adjudicator. That right of appeal

is the second stage of the process. There will already have been a

local determination, with all the consultation and consideration that

we have previously discussed in relation to other measures in the Bill.

However, there will come a time when appeals must come to an

end&#151;a time when enough is enough. An appeal againstthe

appeal is, I would argue, unnecessary in such 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>circumstances. Adjudicators are independent, and their decisions are

based on the merits of the case.</div>

<a name="0604267000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">In extreme

circumstances, as the hon. Gentleman himself pointed out, a judicial

review of an adjudicator&#146;s decision is possible. The system is

now, but will be even more so under the Bill, made up of an important

process of local decision making and accountability alongside an

ability to refer disputed decisions to an independent adjudicator. That

is an appropriate balance. Having a further right of appeal,

particularly one to the Secretary of State and central Government, goes

against theprovisions and direction of the Bill and the

efficient operation of school organisation at a local level. For those

reasons, I oppose the

amendment.</div><a name="0604267000191"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000573"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> There is widespread concern outside this place about

extra powers being given to the adjudicator, particularly because there

is no right to appeal from the adjudicator. Let me pick any page of the

Bill: page 115 in schedule 2 contains paragraphs entitled &#147;Duty

to refer to adjudicator proposals made by...relevant

authority&#148; and &#147;Duty to refer proposals to adjudicator in

prescribed cases&#148;. On the next page are paragraphs entitled,

&#147;Duty to refer proposals to adjudicator in pursuance of

direction by Secretary of State&#148;, &#147;Duty to refer

proposals to adjudicator where determination delayed&#148; and

&#147;Reference to adjudicator at request of aggrieved

person&#148;. I have not even touched on the admissions section of

the Bill, in which the adjudicator has a large role.</div>

<a name="0604267000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should be a right of

appeal. That is all that the amendment says, and I am surprised that

the Secretary of State cannot bring herself to insert into the Bill,

perhaps through a Government amendment, some form of right of appeal

from the adjudicator. I very much hope that the Liberals will support

us on this, because there might be problems if we do not give this

right of appeal&#151;perhaps not in all circumstances, but certainly

in some. In light of that, I should like to press the amendment to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000598"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The amendments are paving amendments for new

clause 6, which we have tabled to explore further the model that the

Government have in mind for trust schools, and to offer a particular

model based on collaboration. Elements of our concerns and our reasons

for tabling the amendments have been picked up in the guidance and the

helpful document that was circulated at the end of this

morning&#146;s sitting. However, there are other elements that we

want to probe further, and we would like to place on record why we

favour a more collaborative model.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div><a name="0604267000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me first place the issue in

context. As we have said in Committee and on the Floor of the House, we

are not opposed in principle to external partners being involved in

education provision. However, we have sought to put on record, both

here and elsewhere, details of the safeguards governing the types of

organisation that would be involved. We have also said that we would

not want an external partner to usurp the direct accountability that

parents currently enjoy through the governing body. We will discuss

some of those issues shortly when we come to the amendments in the name

of the hon. Member for Bury, North. We are also unhappy about giving

schools greater freedom on admissions, although we are happy to give

them greater financial freedom and would like all schools to have

greater freedom in dealing with the curriculum, as academies currently

do.</div> <a name="0604267000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Critically, any

model should include collaboration, and that is why we tabled the

amendments. On page 4 of the document that was circulated at the end of

our morning sitting, the Government make provision for a group of local

schools to work with a trust, and that touches on many of the issues

that we are raising, but we would like to broaden that provision. It is

important that a trust involves collaboration between schools or

between schools and colleges or other providers. In that way, the trust

will be embedded in the local community, rather than just being part of

a national chain, in which case its concerns and objectives might

relate more to the national brand and the national profile than to what

was good for the local community.</div>

<a name="0604267000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The model that we propose would

have the benefit of preventing cherry-picking. It would prevent trusts

from coming into an area and picking off the good schools, rather than

working to benefit all the schools in the

area.</div>

<a name="0604267000233"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000599"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Does that mean that the Liberals oppose the very

good work of the Mercers&#146; Company, which has a range of schools,

and which would benefit very much from being able to establish further

schools under its brand nationwide? The schools in the Mercers&#146;

Company family that I have visited are fantastic and include the Thomas

Telford school, which is the best comprehensive school in

Britain.</div>

<a name="0604267000234"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000600"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> What I am saying is that we particularly favour a

model of collaboration. Certain people&#151;the hon. Gentleman has

alluded to one example&#151;have a track record of involvement in

education, and that would be a different matter. We are concerned about

particular trusts coming into an area, picking off the best schools and

moving across boroughs, rather than working in collaboration for the

benefit of all schools in the area. Given the focus on league tables

and exam results, there is a danger that chains of schools will have an

incentive to become elitist and to use their freedom on admissions to

exclude difficult or under-achieving pupils.</div>

<a name="0604267000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">If trusts are to be involved in

several schools, that implies that there will be a much greater

commitment to the local area. As outlined in the guidance that the

Minister circulated, such trusts could be made up of several partners.

The vision that we have laid out would allow organisations other than

just schools to be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>involved in forming partnerships. For example, external partners such as

youth services providing child care or youth, social or family support

could link with learning providers. There could also be links with FE

colleges, as we discussed at considerable length during this

morning&#146;s sitting.</div>

<a name="0604267000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point about

collaboration is that it would ensure that the trust model provided

greater diversity in the curriculum and greater choice for young

people. The benefits would include the ability to share teaching

expertise, which will be vital if we are to work towards providing for

Tomlinson or even just the rather limited version of diplomas that are

offered in the Bill.</div>

<a name="0604267000237"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000601"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The model that the hon. Lady

outlinesis interesting. Would she include in it private organisations

that might play a role in management or education provision

itself?</div>

<a name="0604267000487"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

pm</div><a name="0604267000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000602"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Another possibility could be work-based learning

providers that were private companies. That is precisely the kind of

vision that we are trying to draw out. The point is that a trust would

be based in a local area, rather than spread throughout the country,

with favoured schools being cherry-picked. Our proposal would provide

for a model of integrated learning involving further education

colleges, work-based learning providers and any other expertise that

could be offered in an area. It would allow schools, particularly

disadvantaged ones, to overcome, for example, shortages of specialist

teachers in subjects such as science, maths and

languages.</div><a name="0604267000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is notable that the shortage of specialist teachers occurs particularly

in disadvantaged areas. Let usconsider the statistics. Only

about 4 per cent. of teachers throughout the country lack specialist

status, but in many central London boroughs the figure can be as high

as 15 or 16 per cent., so the disparity is huge. It might be

interesting to consider our model for those

areas.</div><a name="0604267000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such

collaborations may happen already. However, we are concerned about the

rhetoric behind theBill. Admittedly, we have not heard that

rhetoric in Committee, where this Minister is leading on the Bill, but

there has been rhetoric from No. 10 about picking off different

schools&#151;about schools operating inisolation in a

competitive model. Our concern is that there will be a disincentive to

the kind of collaborations that can happen already and that some of the

good collaborations that have happened in many areas and that are

helping to drive up standards will be

broken.</div><a name="0604267000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our model would

strengthen the collaborations that can already happen, but they would

happen in the context of the safeguards that we dealt with in relation

to earlier clauses and that we will come to in the next string of

amendments.</div><a name="0604267000242"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000603"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Let us be clear about what the new clause would do.

It states:</div><a name="0604267000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

new foundation may not be established unless it contains

either...at least two secondary schools within six miles of each

other, or...at least two primary schools within six miles of each

other.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div><a name="0604267000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">This proposal is another example of the

position that the Liberal party has adopted on the Bill, which is deep

hostility. That position is as mistaken as the position that the

Liberal party took on the Iraqi war&#151;a position that Lord

Ashdown, its former leader, also believes was a

mistake.</div><a name="0604267000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause

would completely destroy the central tenet of the Bill, which is trust

schools. It would confine the establishment of such schools to the

situation of a local federation and it would restrict foundations to

controlling groups of schools in a local area. It would rule out two

possibilities. First, it would rule out the possibility of a national

educational organisation trying to set up a nationwide chain of

schools, as the hon. Lady admitted. That would rule out companies such

as the Mercers&#146; Company, a City of London guild, which has a

fantastic track record in the provision of education in this country.

When the hon. Lady is out of Committee and has time to go to the Thomas

Telford school, as I did just before the Committee started, she will

see an example of how education in this country should be run. That

school provides all the vocational education that she and her

colleagues have talked about, but it also has very high standards of

academic

education.</div><a name="0604267000245"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000604"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> It is unclear why the hon. Gentleman argues that

the proposal would prevent trusts with a national reputation from

building a national chain of schools. The new clause proposed by the

hon. Member for Brent, East simply says that they should build

federations of schools. A federation is at least two schools. There

would be nothing to prevent an organisation that wished to build a

network nationally from doing so, but it would be building a network of

federations rather than individual schools. According to the arguments

that the hon. Lady has

put&#151;</div><a name="0604267000246"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000605"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. That is long enough for an

intervention.</div><a name="0604267000247"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000606"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> First, the hon. Lady explicitly ruled out such

national organisations in her remarks. Secondly, the new clause

explicitly

says:</div><a name="0604267000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A new

foundation may not be established unless it contains either...at

least two secondary schools within six miles of each

other&#148;</div><a name="0604267000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on. A

particular company may well not have two schools, or may not want to

have two schools, within six miles of each other. The schools may be

spread nationally&#151;throughout the country. However many it had

then, it would fall foul of the amendment. That would prevent the

establishment of such branding-type organisations, although they would

be an effective way to inject innovation and high standards into the

education system. That is a basic element of the Bill, which is why it

will be effective when it reaches the statute

book.</div>

<a name="0604267000249"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000607"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Will my hon. Friend make it absolutely clear that

it is perverse to suggest that the Mercersor the

Leathersellers&#151;another guild involved in education&#151;could

be competent and proper people to establish two schools but not one?

Perhaps my hon. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>Friend will explore why people say it. Might it be a slightly

disingenuous policy on the part of the Liberal Democrats and

others?</div><a name="0604267000250"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000608"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, which I had not

mentioned: there is a requirement in the new clause for two schools,

which would rule out foundation status for individual schools. That

would be a huge disappointment. It would also rule out the possibility

of individual schools acquiring a bespoke trust design to meet their

specific needs. The amendments would hinder the main objective of the

Bill, which is to raise the quality of education available to

children.</div>

<a name="0604267000251"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000609"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that the thrust

of the amendment is to promote collaboration rather than competition?

Cannot collaboration raise standards

effectively?</div><a name="0604267000252"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000610"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am in favour of collaboration, and other

provisions in the Bill encourage it. We debated earlier a clause

imported from previous legislation that is all about federations of

schools&#151;clause 11. However, I understood from the remarks of the

hon. Member for Brent, East that the new clause specifically rules out

the Mercers&#146; Company approach to education, which is, I think, a

basic principle of the Bill. I think that that will be very successful

when it is up and running in the years ahead. I rest my case there, and

urge the Liberal Democrats to withdraw their amendment; if they do not,

I urge hon. Members to vote against the new

clause.</div>

<a name="0604267000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000611"></a><b class="B">Greg

Mulholland</b> (Leeds, North-West) (LD): I find some of the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments a little extraordinary. His tangential

remarks about the Iraq war were more to be expected from the hon.

Member for South Holland and The Deepings; perhaps some influence is

being exerted. We are clear that the amendments and new clause are

setting a challenge to us all. We consider that there is not sufficient

collaboration at this stage and that competition will prevent

collaboration. We also feel that the foundation idea does not involve

enough in the way of local connection. That is what we are trying to

explore. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s

comments.</div><a name="0604267000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of our

reason for tabling the amendments and new clause relates to the

academies that we have discussed already. Academies are supposed to

replace failing schools. The Government insist that the sponsors

involved in academies are philanthropic. However, the Committee has

agreed, from the evidence of the handful that are up and running so

far, that admissions and exclusion policies are being used to weed out

the more difficult, ill-disciplined and hard-to-teach

children.</div> <a name="0604267000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the

educational climate as it is, focusing on exam results, league tables,

Ofsted reports and nationwide comparisons, it is natural that those who

run schools will focus on improving their standing in those areas on

which they are publicly judged. The key point is that, by contrast to

what applies to academies, trust sponsors are not even obliged to

sponsor a failing or coasting school. Where is the incentive to get 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>involved with a school that is failing? For those reasons we believe

that there should be collaboration, and in the community learning trust

model, with groups of schools, the problem is

avoided.</div><a name="0604267000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment,

we rely on the good will of those setting up foundations. Surely it is

better to have some safeguards to protect against such cherry-picking.

The Secretary of State said on Second

Reading:</div><a name="0604267000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Bill will help us to raise standards in our schools, especially the

under-performing schools in our most challenging

communities.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 3 March 2006; Vol.

443,c. 1474.]</div><a name="0604267000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

unlikely to happen if foundations are able to cherry-pick the best

schools with which to work. That would merely solidify a two-tier

system, with foundation schools at the top and LEA community schools at

the bottom.</div> <a name="0604267000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further

potential problem is one that we have seen with academies, which is

that an LEA has a vested interest not in a particular school but in

promoting the achievements of all schools in its area, whereas a trust,

even one set up in a poorly performing school, may be tempted to

improve its results at the expense of other schools in the area by

cherry-picking

pupils.</div><a name="0604267000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why are we so

afraid of federation and collaboration? As my hon. Friend the Member

for Brent, East said, sharing teaching expertise wouldhelp

failing schools. We could also share school management. In my

constituency, the excellently performing school Prince Henry&#146;s

grammar school, a comprehensive school, has lent its head teacher to a

famous school in Bradford, yet the school&#146;s leadership remains

excellent. Both schools have therefore benefited. There is a shortage

of head teachers, so why not use that model of

collaboration?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000612"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s passion

for that sort of sharing. Both he and the hon. Member for Brent, East

made some good points about extending that to other agencies, other

providers and others with an interest in education. However, I do not

understand why that would exclude support for a single school. As my

hon. Friend said, some who want to get involved with education at the

moment want to get involved with a specific school, but that is not

necessarily a principle for

collaboration.</div><a name="0604267000261"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000613"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I think that is long

enough.</div><a name="0604267000262"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000614"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but

more than one institution has to be involved or it cannot be a

federation. It could be a primary and a secondary school, or a

secondary school and a further education college. There are different

ways of doing it, but that is a necessary principle.</div>

<a name="0604267000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to a subject that I know

interests the hon. Gentleman&#151;special educational needs

provision. Not all schools can afford or even find sufficient SEN

support. Again, why cannot schools work together? We accept that

collaboration happens now without the need for formal relationships. We

believe that formal relationships via a community learning trust would

ensure that trust schools could not opt out of existing informal

arrangements, which would guarantee such relationships where they

currently do not yet exist.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div><a name="0604267000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I turn to governors. It

is a question of accountability. I am sorry, Mr. Chope, but that

subject comes under the next group of amendments.</div>

<a name="0604267000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am surprised at the comments

of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We suggest an

approach that involves collaboration, that enshrines local connection

and that has far more local accountability. Those are the principles

that the Liberal Democrats are trying to bring to the

Bill.</div>

<a name="0604267000267"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000615"></a>Ms

Angela C. Smith:</b> I shall try to be brief. I challenge the

notion suggested by the Liberal Democrats that collaboration is

necessarily prevented by schools running in an independent fashion. We

should remember that further education institutions are already

independent, and the Liberal Democrats have never once suggested that

FE institutions are not capable of working in collaboration with local

schools. Indeed, they say that it already happens. Collaboration can be

just as effective with a group of schools working independently as it

is in the local authority community model that we are using at the

moment.</div> <a name="0604267000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the

model that we should have in mind when discussing this clause is that

of a strategic framework developed by a local authority, the

commissioner of local provision. Within that collaborative strategic

framework, we need to have schools working with outside partners to

develop expertise, to innovate and, perhaps most importantly&#151;it

is certainly the most important point for me&#151;engaging employers

in the work of our schools.</div>

<a name="0604267000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has taken

us a long time to get to grips withthat difficulty.

Nationally, we have businesses thatdesperately want to engage

with the education system and schools that say, &#147;We want

employers to take more of an interest in our work. We need our young

people to be engaged with employers and to have meaningful work

experience that develops career pathways through to employment.&#148;

However, neither of the sectors has ever quite managed to achieve its

ambition. Trust schools are perhaps the means by which real

collaboration between employers and schools can develop.</div>

<a name="0604267000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Sheffield,

we already have a model similar to that. We have a collaborative

framework that tries to engage employers directly with schools by

taking employers&#146; representatives on to governing bodies.

However, that has not proved to be enough, so we need to go a stage

further. A strategic framework, if it is properly managed and if the

political will is there, can also cover special educational needs,

looked-after children and exclusion and behavioural issues. There is no

reason to believe that charitable trusts will be opposed to ensuring

thatproblems relating to behaviour and exclusion are equally

shared around a local authority area. If the political will is

there&#151;and commissioners who have to ensure thatit is

there are knitted into the strategic framework&#151;there is no

reason for it not to

work.</div><a name="0604267000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to

broaden the idea of what a trust can be. Everybody is imagining that

the trusts will be restricted to private enterprise and to

McDonald&#146;s-type outfits. The way to denigrate a model is to

apply the lowest common denominator. Let us just think more

imaginatively and creatively.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div><a name="0604267000272"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000616"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> I am sure that the hon. Lady realises that

broadening the concept of trusts is precisely what we seek to do with

this new clause and amendments. Does she not accept

that?</div><a name="0604267000273"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000617"></a>Ms

Smith:</b> All I see is an attempt to denigrate trusts and the

possibility of their working in a collaborative manner. In my city we

have Sheffield Theatres, a charitable trust, which could work well with

our performing arts specialist schools. That could do effective work

for children in our city. We also have a sports trust, which runs some

of the best international sporting facilities in the country and most

of our leisure centres. There could be very exciting opportunities for

employment, sports science and the development of expertise among our

young people if that trust were to work with our sports specialist

schools.</div> <a name="0604267000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">More than

anything else, we need an engineering trust in Sheffield. Our city

desperately needs engineering skills for the future. It was built on

engineering and I am confident that most parents and other citizens

would welcome an engineering trust.</div>

<a name="0604267000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000618"></a><b class="B">Meg

Hillier</b> (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op): This

might not be connected to an engineering trust, but does my hon. Friend

see the scope for a co-operative school to be established following

models that exist under co-operatives and social

enterprises?</div>

<a name="0604267000276"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000619"></a>Ms

Smith:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that important point. I

would not rule out any possibility in terms of forming charitable

trusts so long as it fell within the framework of our guidance. We have

to be creative.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000620"></a>Ms

Smith:</b> I will now move to a conclusion. I think that I

have made the case for viewing the trust model in a perhaps more

creative and imaginative way than has been recognised by the Liberal

Democrats. I shall finish by making another point about special

educational needs, because the trust model should apply equally to

special schools.</div><a name="0604267000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

possibility of bringing innovation and best practice into the system is

more relevant to the special needs population and to special needs

education than any other. We need to personalise learning for children

with special needs as much as we can. That area of practice needs

innovation. So many charities are working in the field of special

educational needs that it cannot be beyond the realms of possibility to

imagine charitable trusts that are set up to exploit and use the

expertise that is available out there in the special needs

sector.</div> <a name="0604267000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want

to tie particular charities down to an arrangement that I have not even

discussed with them, but if we think things through, the National

Autistic Society, for instance, could engage with our schools to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>use their expertise successfully. The society is in touch with parents

and the professionals, so let us think through what we can do with the

model. It offers a way forward that will help to personalise learning

for children and expand the opportunities available to them, including

their career opportunities in the long

term.</div>

<a name="0604267000282"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000621"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I am pleased to follow my hon. Friend the Member

for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith). She has injected precisely what

we need in this Committee, which is a bit of inspiration, creativity

and excitement about what the proposals in the Bill and the next stage

of reform could mean. I thank her for

that.</div><a name="0604267000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The combined

effect of amendments Nos. 353 and 354 and new clause 6 would be to

provide that the governing body of an existing foundation or foundation

special school could publish or implement proposals to acquire a trust

only if it met certain conditions on involving other schools in the

trust. Specifically, all proposals by an existing foundation or

foundation school to acquire a trust under the Bill would have to

contain either at least two secondary schools within six miles of each

other or two primary schools within six miles of each other.</div>

<a name="0604267000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 6 would allow other

organisations to be partners in a trust. Although I recognise that the

list in the new clause is not exhaustive or prescriptive, there are

nevertheless a number of obvious omissions, such as parent and

community groups, businesses and the interesting examples that my hon.

Friend identified as potential partners. The hon. Member for Brent,

East has made it clear that her intention with amendments Nos. 353 and

354 and new clause 6 is to probe&#151;I hope that it is only to

probe&#151;the extent to which trusts would support collaborations.

My criticism is of the narrow view and the constraining effect on the

ability of trusts to contribute to schools and standards in the way

that we would want them to.</div>

<a name="0604267000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals relating to

collaboration are unnecessary. A wide range of collaborations between

different types of schools are already flourishing, as many hon.

Members have mentioned. Schools are already collaborating effectively

to deliver a broad 14-to-19 curriculum. We have promoted collaboration

through, among other things, the excellence in cities programme. Soft

federations are developing in local areas. As the hon. Member for

Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) rightly said, there are some very

effective head teachers working with other schools to drive up

standards&#151;not just in his constituency, but throughout the

country, and quite often supported through some of the Specialist

Schools and Academies Trust&#146;s projects&#151;and, of course,

academies and trusts will be encouraged to collaborate, and support and

challenge each other, in the same way as are

schools.</div><a name="0604267000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

do not think that any Member has argued against the potential benefits

that a wide range of collaboration can bring. The amendments, and the

approach behind them, are fundamentally wrong. It is not undesirable

for a number of schools, primary or secondary, to work together in a

trust. Far from it; that could be an excellent model. We have suggested

previously, as an example of good practice, that a charitable

incorporated trust could provide the necessary long-term relationship

and framework to allow a network of schools to collaborate in order to

help to raise standards and share best practice.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div><a name="0604267000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">In case the hon. Member for

Brent, East comes back at me and says, &#147;Well, you have just

identified a whole range of ways in which schools are already working

collaboratively,&#148; the problem with trusts is that too often

those collaborations are based on ad hoc arrangements. Sometimes heroic

individuals have helped to form that collaboration, and when they move

on they take with them that expertise. One of the big contributions

that the trust model could make would be to enable a more permanent

route through.</div><a name="0604267000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

Second Reading, the Secretary of State referred to, and I think that I

did too in an earlier part of the Committee stage, a presentation in

Downing street from a group of headteachers who are working already in

successful schools, but helping also to drive up standards in schools

performing less well. They suggested that that is why federation could

be an important way of raising standards for children, and an example

of how trusts might be of great

benefit.</div><a name="0604267000289"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000622"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The right hon. Lady is making a persuasive case for

why we need a diverse approach to a diverse range of needs. She said

that it would be useful, sometimes, to use trust schools to make

permanent the best features of collaboration, but will she accept that

sometimes there is a need for a particular counter-dynamic and so

collaboration would be right sometimes, but less relevant or pertinent

later on? The flexibility that she described works both

ways.</div><a name="0604267000290"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000623"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman is right. Trusts

might well be an important way in which to bring permanence to

collaborations, and enable us to bring in external partners for

support.</div> <a name="0604267000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not

arguing, however, that they would be the only way in which schools

could collaborate. Trust schools might well be engaged in other local

collaborations&#151;perhaps a 14-to-19 collaboration that was not

part of a trust arrangement. So developing a trust arrangement, even in

collaboration with other schools, would not limit their ability to work

in partnership with other schools, perhaps locally or with other

networks of which a school might be part.</div>

<a name="0604267000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trouble with the amendments

is that not only would they require certain types of partnerships

between schools in all cases involving a trust, but they would prevent

a number of potentially positive collaborations. For example, isolated

rural secondary schools that might be more than six miles from the

nearest other secondary school would be denied the opportunity of

working together in a trust. They would rule out also the possibility

of trusts supporting a network or partnership of schools at opposite

ends of the country using perhaps IT links to share good practice; and

the option also of a trust involving one primary and one secondary

school. Headteachers in some areas are thinking about what the hon.

Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole described as vertical

federations. We could envisage the possibility of vertical trusts, but

that would be ruled out by the

amendments.</div><a name="0604267000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,

valuable as can be the possibility of having another school as an

external partner in a trust, it would not be the most appropriate model

for all 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>trusts. I do not think that it should be for central Government to try

to second guess or pre-empt local decisions. Dare I say to the hon.

Member for Brent, East, who has been making that case in relation to

other amendments, that the decision on what kind of trust would be most

appropriate to the individuals of each school is one that is best taken

locally by the governing body of that school? Of course

withinthe decision-making process there will be local

accountability, which we have set out in considerably more detail in

the statutory guidance to decision makers that I made available to the

Committee this morning. The matter is best taken in a way that does not

assume that one size fits all, and that fulfils our desire to ensure

that all children can access an education tailored specifically to

them.</div><a name="0604267000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

pm</div><a name="0604267000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rationale

behind trusts is to allow schools to raise standards by strengthening

collaboration and drawing on the expertise and energy of their partners

to support strategic leadership. They will be backed by an organisation

that shares their aspirations for their pupils, knows their community,

can support their continuing improvement and provides them with

governors. There will not be a single model for ensuring that that

happens; schools need to be able to choose with whom to work and how,

in order to support the needs and aspirations of their pupils and local

communities.</div><a name="0604267000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Different

bodies will of course bring different perspectives, experience and

skills to support certain aspects of a school&#146;s mission. We have

spelled out in the other document that I have made available,

&#147;What trust schools could offer&#148;, quite a few scenarios

showing types of partnerships that could benefit schools. Without being

exhaustive, I shall give a few examples.</div>

<a name="0604267000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">There could be a partnership, as

we have heard, between a successful school and a weaker school,

offering opportunities to both parties to enhance leadership skills. A

trust could be formed by higher education institutions and

universities, using their particular expertise to help schools better

to prepare young people for advanced study, to provide important

progression routes to or help schools to tap into subject specialisms

in the institutions.</div> <a name="0604267000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

group of schools spread throughout the country could work with a single

trust and incorporate a business or charitable foundation, or follow

examples such as the Mercers&#146; Company or others that hon.

Members have identified. A national network of schools could provide

expertise in developing specialist subjects in the curriculum.

Employers could play a role, as my hon. Friend the Member for

Sheffield, Hillsborough rightly said, in the ways that she identified

in her examples and by talking locally about the contribution of

theatres and sports trusts.</div>

<a name="0604267000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">A trust could be established by

businesses and local partners to support schools across a community,

for example in a regeneration area, to bring in links with regeneration

work and create new opportunities for children to help to meet their

individual needs.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div><a name="0604267000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">All of those possibilities are

examples of collaboration, for which the hon. Member for Brent, East

has argued but which would be ruled out by the tightly constrained way

in which her amendment is written. There may be many circumstances in

which it would be best for more than one school to have a shared trust,

but not all schools will find it necessary or appropriate to work in a

trust with others. For example, Southend-on-Sea borough council is

working in partnership with Prospects college, a vocational training

provider, to establish in Southend a trust school with leading-edge

vocational specialism. It is an exciting initiative, bringing together

vocational provision on one site. It links only to one school, but it

is precisely the sort of contribution to vocational provision, in a

school that has had a difficult time, that I would have thought would

be welcomed by the hon. Lady. Her amendment would rule it

out.</div><a name="0604267000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course I take

seriously the concern that the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Leeds,

North-West identified as cherry picking. We are completely clear that

the benefits of trust status must be used to drive improvement and

provide support and capacity for the schools and children that most

need it. That is why the schools commissioner will play a key role in

ensuring that schools in disadvantaged areas are able to benefit from

trusts; in encouraging potential trusts to focus their interest on

weaker schools and those in disadvantaged areas that are in the

greatest need of support; and in encouraging schools in disadvantaged

areas to think about how a trust could not only be beneficial to the

school and its pupils but bring about wider changes and gains for the

local community. As I have said, for schools wishing to work with other

schools, trusts will be one option that we hope they will consider, but

there will continue to be other

options.</div><a name="0604267000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand

that these were probing amendments, and I take the hon. Lady&#146;s

assurance that she can see the benefits that can come from trust status

and from the external support and drive that we believe it will bring.

I hope that she recognises that her amendments would limit that

innovation and creativity and will, therefore, withdraw

them.</div><a name="0604267000302"></a>

Teather:</b> We tabled the amendments and new clause 6 to

probe what the Government meant by their trust model and how committed

they were to a model of collaboration, rather than a highly competitive

model. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarifications and I

accept her point that the amendment has been drafted so tightly that it

excludes some of the things that we particularly wanted to include.

However, its intention was to generate debate and to get on record the

commitment that the Government have to a collaborative model, and many

of the Minister&#146;s comments were

helpful.</div><a name="0604267000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

entirely satisfied that there is not still rather contradictory

rhetoric coming from different parts of Government about a

collaborative versus a competitive model for education. We remain

rather concerned about rhetoric surrounding independence and whether

this may be taken to be a disincentive to collaboration. However, I am

grateful for the Minister&#146;s reassurance and I take seriously the

technical criticisms that she made about our amendment. Therefore, we

will go away to consider whether we wish to bring forward 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>some of our points in a different format on Report. I beg to ask leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000626"></a>The

<a name="0604267000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 101, in clause 17, page 12,

any change involving an increase in the number of pupils that may be

governing body of any other school maintained by that authority, from

performing and carrying out the duties and functions in relation to

education imposed upon them by this or any other

enactment.'.</div><a name="0604267000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.

governors of that

school.'.</div><a name="0604267000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.

102, in clause 19, page 14, line 14, at end

approval of any alteration involving the expansion of a school in any

case in which such expansion may be considered detrimental to the

opportunities available to the local education authority or to the

governing body of a maintained school in its area to satisfy

obligations imposed by this or any other

enactment.'.</div><a name="0604267000310"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000627"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> The amendment deals with the capacity of an

existing foundation school to change its status to a community school.

It would delete the text in clause 17 that prevents that from

happening. That would have been entirely logical and rational if the

Bill reflected the unadulterated, pure spirit of the original White

Paper, which prevented local authorities from opening new community

schools, meaning that foundation schools would not be able to transfer

their status to become community

schools.</div><a name="0604267000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

the situation is different now. The Government have, in my view,

listened carefully and sensiblyto those who argued that there

was a case for local authorities to open and build new community

schools, and my right hon. Friend the Minister has set out carefully

the criteria by which local authorities would be able to do that. She

has also outlined conditions that would go further than that, which

would require local authorities not to hold competitions for certain

new schools. Now, given that local authorities have been

giventhe capacity to open new community schools, we are

accepting implicitly that the community school is avalid

model, which can deliver as effectively as other schools the higher

standards that we all seek, and it is contradictory, therefore, to deny

certain foundation schools the right to become community

schools.</div><a name="0604267000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Realistically,

I do not think that many schools with foundation status would choose

that option. However, the possibility must exist. Certain circumstances

in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>some parts of the country might lead foundation schools to welcome the

option: for example, where a foundation school was struggling; where

the governors were demoralised or inadequate, or both; where the

management and leadership had not delivered the right vision for the

school, had not succeeded in driving up standards and did not have the

immediate prospect of attracting more pupils; and where the foundation

school was located in a high-performing local authority. I have said

before that I am slightly sceptical of the argument that there is a

direct relationship between the quality of an individual school and the

quality of its local authority. However, in those circumstances, it

would certainly be logical for the foundation school and governing body

to have the right to apply for community status.</div>

<a name="0604267000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 101 takes us back

to the implications of the expansion of individual schools. I do not

want to go through the arguments that were made when we discussed a

previous group of amendments. This amendment would simply mean that any

proposal to expand the numbers in an individual school must be set

within the context of the impact on the local authority and on

neighbouring schools. Amendment No. 102 deals with the same issue in a

subsequent clause.</div> <a name="0604267000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

have demonstrated how the future expansion of one individual school

cannot be seen in isolation. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton gave us an interesting anecdote about the attempts of the

Montessori school in Brighton to expand. His view would be different,

but I think that we have to accept that the decision was probably the

result of a lengthy period of local consultation and the culmination of

the considered view of all other schools in the area, as reflected by

the local authority, that there would be damaging consequences if that

school were allowed to expand.</div>

<a name="0604267000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to take account of the

instability that can be injected into the system if one school

exercises an automatic right to increase its numbers. Of course, the

local taxpayer faces wider costs if that has a damaging effect on

neighbouring schools. The Government have already accepted that such

decisions cannot be taken in isolation. I welcome the commitment in the

further education White Paper, to which my hon. Friendthe

Under-Secretary referred this morning, to the presumption of expansion

in favour of sixth-form colleges to counterbalance the presumption of

expansion of sixth forms in schools, as well as the opening of new

sixth forms in schools. I am not sure what happens when we have two

simultaneous presumptions in favour of mutually contradictory

objectives, but that is a matter that the Government will have to

resolve as the policy progresses.</div>

<a name="0604267000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">What would happen in the case of

a single-sex school that was hugely popular and wished to increase its

numbers? Is it not obviously the case that if that school increased its

numbers, it would have a direct, distorting effect on the balance of

the sexes in at least one neighbouring school and probably more? That

seems to me the most obvious example of where plans to expand should be

set within the wider context. That is why amendment No. 101 makes it

clear that expansion plans should not be permitted if they would

prevent other schools from carrying out their duties.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div><a name="0604267000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I want to refer to the

question of those schools that select wholly or partly by ability. The

Government have said explicitly on previous occasions that schools that

select wholly by ability will not be able to expand. My recollection of

the debate on Second Reading is that my right hon. Friend the Secretary

of State said that schools that select partly by ability will not now

be able to expand. First, where in the Bill is that restriction made

clear? Secondly, for those schools that select partly by ability, does

the embargo on future expansion apply to the total numbers admitted to

the school or to the percentage of those admitted who are selected by

ability?</div><a name="0604267000491"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

pm</div><a name="0604267000318"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000628"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> With the exception of the amendment tabled by my

hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), this group of

amendments is yet another backdoor attempt to thwart some of the

Bill&#146;s main principles. In moving amendment No. 188, the hon.

Member for Bury, North claimed that it was the logical conclusion of

the concessions that were made on enabling local authorities to propose

a community school. He wants to take that concession one stage further,

which should be a lesson to the Minister, because if she gives people

an inch, they will want to take a mile.</div>

<a name="0604267000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving paragraphs (c) and (d)

out of the list of alterations that may not be made to a school would

simply make it possible for a voluntary foundation or voluntary school

to go back to being a community school. Given that the overwhelming

majority of schools are community schools, that would be a retrograde

step. There are 10,961 community primary schools and 2,193 community

secondary schools, but there are only 3,754 voluntary aided primary

schools and 559 voluntary aided secondary schools. Overall, community

schools represent 63 per cent. of the total. If we want to create a

more diverse range of schools, the last thing we should be doing is

creating more of the schools that already dominate.</div>

<a name="0604267000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government were right to

create a one-way, Yale-lock system for the adoption of foundation

status. Subject to all the safeguards in clause 23 about removing a

foundation, we support the Government&#146;s policy in that regard

and therefore oppose amendment No.

188.</div><a name="0604267000321"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000629"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> If 50 parents submitted a request for a

foundation school to revert to being a community school would the hon.

Gentleman not wish to support their

request?</div>

<a name="0604267000322"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000630"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> No, because the purpose of the Bill, and the

direction in which the Government seek to move education

policy&#151;a direction with which we agree&#151;is to create a

more diverse range of schools. Allowing more community schools to be

established would contradict a direction of travel that will lead to

the higher standards and higher quality of education that we all want

in our

schools.</div><a name="0604267000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 101 and 102 would prevent a school from admitting more pupils or

expanding its 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>premises if, in the opinion of the local education authority, that would

prevent other schools in the area from performing their existing

functions and duties. Again, the amendments would prevent or limit the

expansion of good schools. They would undo the measures in the Bill to

sweep away the bureaucratic and entrenched interests that have until

now been highly successful in preventing good schools from expanding.

They would not so much reintroduce a surplus places rule as reintroduce

school organisation committees, or at least the effects that SOCs had

in terms of atrophying the system.</div>

<a name="0604267000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that we do all

that we can to make it easier, not more difficult, for good schools to

expand if they wish to do so. We have a shortage of places for pupils

at good schools, and instead of endlessly debating how we allocate

those places, we should all be working out how to increase the number

of good schools and the number of places at them. That is why I am so

astonished that anyone should table amendments to make that objective

more difficult. The Conservative party wants more good schools and more

places at good schools. We will therefore oppose amendments Nos. 101

and 102 if they are pressed to a

vote.</div><a name="0604267000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point

about whether changes that are made to one school will impact on

others, it would be helpful if the Minister could clear up an issue

that has emerged from our reading of the draft guidance to decision

makers, which was circulated at the end of this morning&#146;s

sitting. Paragraph 3 states that one factor to be taken into account in

deciding whether to acquire a trust should be</div>

<a name="0604267000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Concerns that the Trust

will have a negative impact on school

standards&#148;.</div><a name="0604267000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">On page 8,

under a heading relating to the factors that local authorities need to

consider when deciding whether to refer a proposal for a trust to the

adjudicator, the guidance similarly states that one factor will

be</div> <a name="0604267000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Concern

that the Trust will have a negative impact on

standards.&#148;</div><a name="0604267000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, under

the next heading, which relates to the factors that the school&#146;s

adjudicator or the school governing body needs to consider when

deciding whether to acquire a trust, the guidance states that one

factor will be whether the trust</div>

<a name="0604267000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will contribute to raising

standards at the

school&#148;.</div><a name="0604267000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question,

therefore, is whether the first two phrases that I quoted refer to

standards at the school acquiring a trust or whether they need to

reflect the possibility that the acquisition of a trust in that school

will impact on standards in other schools. I had not thought that they

meant that until I saw the wording on the bottom of page 8, which

specifically refers to standards at the school. Some clarification from

the Minister on this point would be helpful.</div>

<a name="0604267000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that the decision by

one particular school to acquire a trust should have no impact on

standards at other schools. If it makes a school better or increases

standards, that is very welcome and is the whole objective of these

measures. If by raising standards the school becomes more popular, that

again is the objective. There is an underlying current of opinion among

some Labour rebels&#151;there are indications of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>this among the Liberals too&#151;that the problem with trying to

create schools with higher standards by, for example, acquiring a trust

is that it creates a two-tier system and that because a two-tier system

must be wrong, we should not attempt the reform.</div>

<a name="0604267000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">We already have a two-tier

system in the state sector. There is a wide gap between the two tiers:

there are the excellent and good schools on the one hand and the

underperforming and coasting schools on the other. The reforms in the

Bill will help to narrow that gap by raising standards, and the trust

school element of the reforms is crucial to

that.</div>

<a name="0604267000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0604267000631"></a><b class="B">Dr.

Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I shall

speak briefly to amendments Nos. 101 and 102. These are probing

amendments to try to test whether those proposing a trust would

consider the likely impact of the trust, particularly if it would

expand, on neighbouring schools. I want to thank my right hon. Friend

the Minister for sending round the guidance for decision makers who are

proposing trusts. It is enormously helpful. We can see from the

guidance that the impact not only on neighbouring schools but on other

bodies that are likely to be affected by the trust is something that

those proposing trusts must consider.</div>

<a name="0604267000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister agree that in

many instances&#151;I can give examples from my

constituency&#151;schools are likely to pursue trust status with

partners with whom they have already developed a relationship? For

example, where there is a centre for vocational excellence it is likely

that the school will build on those partnerships. The guidance is very

helpful in that regard and should allay some of the concerns that

people have about

trusts.</div><a name="0604267000333"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000632"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I want to speak very briefly in favour of

amendment No. 188. As the hon. Member for Bury, North said, it does not

appear to be logical, given the other concessions that the Government

have made, for them to continue to constrain schools so that they

cannot reverse their foundation status if they sowish. As the

hon. Gentleman said, there may be circumstances in which parents are

very unhappy with the way in which the school is being governed and

about the management of the school. They may wish to revert to

community status. It does not seem logical for those schools then not

to be able to do so.</div>

<a name="0604267000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister tell us how

the proposals in clause 23 apply here? I know that they come later in

the Bill but they are relevant to this amendment. I hope that she will

use the opportunity to discuss those proposals here. I am very

sympathetic towards the intention behind amendments Nos. 101 and 102.

There is a need to balance the effects of excessive expansion of a

particular school on those in the surrounding area. We know that if

school rolls begin to fall, particularly if they begin to fall

dramatically, there is a financial impact on those schools. The school

can then spiral into decline and that may have dire consequences for

schools that may otherwise be popular and good schools. It leaves the

students at those schools in a difficult position. We support amendment

No. 188 and are very sympathetic towards amendments Nos. 101 and

102.</div>

to follow the hon. Member for Bury, North when he moves an amendment.

As we were walking down the Committee corridor to the Division earlier,

I said that he and I were the two outriders in the Committee. I like to

think that he is a man of principle who has a certain vision. I must

admit that my vision is slightly different from his. No doubt that

plays into the hands of the Minister because she can say that it shows

that she has it right: she represents the middle way or the third way.

<a name="0604267000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Bury, North

will forgive me if I do not support his amendment, even though I can

understand the logic of what he is trying to achieve throughout the

proceedings on this Bill. He believes&#151;I hope that I am not doing

him a disservice&#151;in democratic control of the nation&#146;s

schools, which he thinks is best vested in democratically elected local

authorities. That is a perfectly logical point of view. Sadly, that

model has not worked.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000636"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman says

that. As we were walking together, precisely at the moment when we

reached the Lobby, I was about to explain to him exactly what I did

believe, which is not quite what he says I believe. Perhaps that is a

discussion for another

occasion.</div><a name="0604267000340"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000637"></a>Mr.

Mr. Chope? We are now desperate to know the end of the conversation. It

is not for me to say what the hon. Gentleman believes in, but I can say

what I believe in. My vision is of maintained schools becoming

independent charitable trusts&#151;all of them. Therefore, I cannot

support any amendment that seems to make it easier for those schools

that have more independence, namely voluntary aided schools and

foundation schools, to become community schools. Anyway, as my hon.

Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, given

that63 per cent. of schools are already community schools,

there is no point in any more schools becoming community schools

because&#151;this is where I support the Minister&#151;we want to

create choice and diversity.</div>

<a name="0604267000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 339 relates to

subsection (4). It gives the Secretary of State power to make

alterations and, as I said in similar circumstances in an earlier

there is an omission from the list of categories. Why is it that,

apparently, the Secretaryof State can make alterations to the

admissions criteria of a school? Why are those crucial admissions

criteria not listed? Is it just an oversight, or is there a hidden

agenda?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div><a name="0604267000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment would prevent the

Secretary of State from ordering any change to the admissions criteria

of a school unless the governing body of that school agreed to it. Why

is that important? Unless the amendment is accepted, the Secretary of

State will have the power&#151;the Minister can deny this when she

rises; that is why these debates are useful&#151;to order a school to

impose a certain catchment area; to apply a test of parental

commitment; or to cease to apply a test of ability for admissions, as

is done for grammar schools. We already know that the Minister does not

want the existing 164 or 165 grammar schools to expand. Could there

be&#151;I am sure that the Minister will deny this, in which case my

amendment will have served some purpose&#151;some power now vested in

the Secretary of State that allows her to interfere in the tests of

ability that apply in the few remaining grammar schools?</div>

<a name="0604267000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is well known that while the

Conservative party recognises that there is unlikely to be any great

expansion of grammar schools, we are certainly not opposed to the

excellence.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000638"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend is right, of course, to celebrate

the excellent work done in grammar schools, including those in his and

my constituencies. However, he may have hit on an even more ingenious

point than he supposes, because presumably a future Secretary of State,

at some indeterminate point in time, could, by the same means,

encourage schools that do not at present do so to select by academic

ability. If the power to remove that capacity exists, the power to

impose it must logically exist. All members of the Committee, including

the hon. Member for Bury, North, can therefore support the amendments

with

alacrity.</div><a name="0604267000346"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000639"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> If I were the hon. Member for Bury, North I should

be extremely worried about that. Could there be a hidden agenda to work

in the opposite way? There is something curious, is there not, about

the list in subsection (4)? It seems quite comprehensive&#151;for

instance, given what I said earlier, I am very pleased about paragraph

(a) under which no change</div>

<a name="0604267000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the religious character of the

school&#148;</div><a name="0604267000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">may be made; I

believe that schools should be able to preserve their ethos. However,

just as important to many parents&#151;perhaps more important than

religious character if we are considering all schools&#151;are the

admissions criteria. Those have been at the heart of political debate

for half a century, so we need to know why there is no mention of

admissions criteria in the Minister&#146;s

list.</div>

<a name="0604267000348"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000640"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> It is worth remembering that clause 17 deals with a

range of prescribed alterations and subsequent clauses deal with the

processes for proposing alterations. We have had a broad discussion

about the possible range of the prescribed alterations. I shall discuss

the reason for not including admissions in the clause towards the end

of my remarks.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div><a name="0604267000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a certain amount of

truth in the accusation by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton that when we agreed that, in the case of new schools,

there might be an argument for a community school in some

circumstances, we opened the door slightly to the case made by my hon.

Friend the Member for Bury, North for amendment No. 188. I disagree

with my hon. Friend that the logic of our position on new schools

implies the logic of his amendment.</div>

<a name="0604267000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have, of course, established

arrangements to deal with the circumstances of new schools. We think

that those are the right arrangements and that the decision about entry

into the competition should be for the Secretary of State. The

amendment, however, does something rather different. It would make it

possible to change the category of an existing foundation or voluntary

school, which it was planned would continue in operation, to that of a

community school.</div> <a name="0604267000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

have, I think, made it pretty clear, and I have certainly made it clear

in debating the relevant provisions, that our vision and policy is for

the local authority to enhance its new role as a commissioner, rather

than a direct supplier, of education services, and for the school

increasingly to enhance its role with the support of external partners

and the bringing in of similar capacity; the impetus that comes from

the self-determination of a foundation or voluntary aided school is

likely to help it to focus on improvements that need to be made for its

pupils and in its work in with the community. That has been the

objective of the Bill and the

reform.</div><a name="0604267000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,

my hon. Friend used the example of a failing school. He talked, I

think, about demoralised governors, and suggested that as a possible

justification for changing from foundation or, presumably, voluntary

aided status to that of a community school. I think that if a

foundation or voluntary aided school is in such a state that it needs

greatly increased local authority control, a change of category is

unlikely to be an adequate or appropriate solution. If the failure is

very extreme, as we will discuss later in the Bill, a better solution

might be for the school to close and to make a completely fresh start.

Although there might be an option for it to be a community school, it

does not necessarily follow that a community school would be the best

solution. A competition might be just what was needed to bring in a

range of possible approaches that would increase dynamism and a sense

of possibility in the school.</div>

<a name="0604267000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case of the

high-performing local authority to which my hon. Friend referred, as

the Bill makes clear, it is able to work in that school improvement

role with all schools, regardless of their category. A school would not

need to change from foundation status to community status in order to

benefit from a high-performing local authority that put an emphasis on

standards, which drove improvement through the way in which it

operated.</div><a name="0604267000354"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000641"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> It is clear from the draft guidance which my hon.

Friend circulated this morning that in the case of a trust school, that

is, a foundation school with a foundation, that collapses completely,

the assets and the functioning of the school will revert automatically

to the local authority. If we accept that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>the local authority should take over responsibility fora

school that faces complete collapse, is it not inconsistent that the

local authority should not have a role in the case of a school whose

governing body is trying to prevent complete collapse by asking to be

taken back into the local

authority?</div><a name="0604267000355"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000642"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> The position with respect to assets is that if the

relationship with the trust were broken the assets would revert to the

governing body of the foundation school. Those assets would revert to

the local authority only in the case of complete

closure.</div><a name="0604267000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend

is conflating two separate issues: the correct protection in the long

run of public assets, as spelt out in the arrangements with respect to

a trust school, and the various approaches that could be taken to a

school that was failing or was challenged. In those circumstances, a

decision by the governing body to change its status is not the

appropriate way to deal with failure or its lack of morale. With the

support of the school&#146;s commissioner, looking to a trust that

might be able to support and reinvigorate the leadership and governance

of the school is more likely to be an effective way forward for the

school.</div><a name="0604267000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want

to labour the point further. We envisage a new framework for schools

and local authorities in which the local authority is the champion of

parents and assures the quality of provision rather than being the

direct supplier. We propose a more dynamic system of self-governing

schools with the confidence to take charge of their own development,

and the amendment runs contrary to it. That is why I oppose the

amendment.</div><a name="0604267000358"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000643"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Does the Minister accept that there may be other

circumstances in addition to those outlined by the hon. Member for

Bury, North where the school may be failing? There may be other

circumstances in which parents are unhappy with the ethos or direction

of the school without it necessarily failing and they may wish to

change that ethos by bringing it back under the remit of the local

authority. Are those not valid concerns, which they should be allowed

to

pursue?</div><a name="0604267000359"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000644"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> In those circumstances, if the parents were unhappy

with the school&#146;s trust partner, there are the proposals in

clause 23 that enable the removal of that trust. We have identified a

range of ways in the Bill to give parents a stronger voice in what

happens within schools, including a duty on the governing body to

respond to parents. I do not believe that the change to community

status would assuage parents&#146; concerns in the sorts of

circumstances that are under discussion, and this would certainly run

counter to the new role we envisage for local authorities.</div>

<a name="0604267000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to amendments Nos. 101

and 102 on expansion, we are determined to transform the school system

so that it responds better to parents&#146; needs and aspirations. We

want every parent to feel confident that the system is delivering for

their child, and that they can choose a place at an excellent school

that is more dynamic, with weak schools replaced quickly by new ones,

with coasting schools pushed to improve, and with the best schools able

to spread their influence and success throughout the system.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div><a name="0604267000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my right hon. Friend the

Secretary of State made clear in her letter to the Chairman of the

Education and Skills Committee, we are also aware of concerns about how

the expansion of individual schools fits in with the strategic role of

the local authority. We believe that schools that are popular with

local parents and that wish to expand should normally be able to do so.

That is why there is currently a presumption in statutory guidance that

proposals for the expansion of successful and popular schools should be

improved.</div> <a name="0604267000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is new

in the Bill are the decision-making powers reverting to the local

authority, as opposedto the school organisation committee.

School organisation committees will be abolished, and their powers will

be transferred to the local authority. Guidance to local authorities

will make it clear that there should be no arbitrary obstacles

preventing good school expansion. However, school expansion will not be

a free-for-all; it will be for local authorities to make decisions on

whether a school&#146;s proposal to expand should be approved. In

reaching any decision, the local authority&#151;or the adjudicator,

if it is referred&#151;will consider the impact on overall standards

in an area. The school may appeal to the adjudicator, who will consider

the individual merits of the case on the basis of statutory

guidance.</div> <a name="0604267000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me now

respond to the point of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton. My view on the guidance is clear; notwithstanding what I

have said in respect of expansion&#151;that the local authority may

want to consider that, and it is the role of the local authority to

address standards throughout an area&#151;the governing body, which

is the decision maker in respect of determining whether to take on a

trust, will want to make that decision on the basis of the impact on

standards within a particular school. That is the clear intention in

this guidance, which is for decision

makers.</div><a name="0604267000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me now

return to expansion. Expansion will not be the answer for every good

school. Reasons such as the size of the school, the nature of the site

or parental wishes may mean that expansion is not the right option.

That is why we accept that schools could spread their expertise in a

different way. They could form joint ventures, or federate with other

local schools to share best practice, to pool resources or to offer

pupils and staff a wider range of opportunities.</div>

<a name="0604267000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I move away from

expansion, let me cover the specific point made by my hon. Friend the

Member for Bury, North about wholly selective and partially selective

schools. We will make clear in guidance to decision makers the route

through which expansion proposals are represented; that is not a

legislative route. The presumption should be that there will not be an

expansion of schools that are wholly selective. Because we have been

clear that we do not want new selection by ability, for schools that

are partially selective expansion would be limited to expansion of

non-selective places. That would lead to a reduction in the proportion

of selective places in a school, if the number of places

expanded.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000645"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Does that not provide an interesting precedent

for the policy towards wholly selective schools, by allowing such

schools to expand, but only on condition that they expand with a

non-selective intake?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div><a name="0604267000367"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000646"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> That is an interesting challenge.

That would involve a complete change to their admissions arrangements

which would take us considerably further beyond simply proposals in

respect to expansion. In legislation as well as guidance to decision

makers,they are clearly in a different category of school. A

distinction is made in law between schools that are wholly

selective&#151;the guidance is clear that they should not

expand&#151;and schools that are partially

selective.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000647"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I would be grateful if the Minister helped me with

the definition of &#147;expansion&#148;. Reorganisation might take

place in my area, with the age of transfer decreasing from 12 to 11. By

definition of the grammar school system, more pupils will be in the

selective system after the change in the age of transfer. Is that

covered by her statement that there will be no more

selection?</div><a name="0604267000369"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000648"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> That is a very interesting point. Perhaps I could

get back to the hon. Lady about that. I can say, though, that the other

driver for expansion&#151;access to the capital pot that we have made

available to fund the expansion of popular and successful

schools&#151;will not be available to selective schools or for

selective places in partially selective schools. The two routes for

determining expansion, which are guidance to decision makers and

funding, are clear in those

circumstances.</div><a name="0604267000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">My worry

about the amendments is that, although I hope I have given hon. Members

some reassurance, I would not want a situation in which a school

expansion that made sense could effectively be prevented by a local

authority. Of course it is important that local authorities consider

the wider implications, but schools should not be held back

artificially and the choice of parents

restricted.</div><a name="0604267000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

commissioners of educational services, local authorities will need to

act as the champions of pupils and parents to promote choice and

diversity with respect, as we have discussed, to earlier provisions in

the Bill, and they will have an important planning role. That will

inform their decisions when planning how many schools their local area

needs, where and how big those schools should be, what schools would

serve the area best and whom they should

serve.</div><a name="0604267000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local

authorities will draw up strategic plans for the pattern of schools in

their area as part of their children and young people&#146;s plan.

They will map what is needed in their area, considering demographics

and the balance of provision with respect to gender. That might address

the issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North raised. If I

remember correctly&#151;I will write to the Committee to correct

myself if necessary&#151;sex discrimination legislation now requires

that during the planning process, local authorities ensure equal or

relatively equal access to single-sex schools. That would have to be

part of the strategic planning in the circumstances that my hon. Friend

spelled out. Although I have disagreed with him on those circumstances,

I hope that I have been sufficiently persuasive for him to withdraw his

amendment.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div><a name="0604267000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the

other outrider on the Committee and speak to amendment No. 339 on

admissions. Clause 17, to which the amendments apply, provides for

regulations to set out the changes to maintained schools, requiring the

publication of statutory proposals called prescribed alterations in the

legislation. The clause does not deal in any way with schools

admissions, because those changes do not fall under the category of

prescribed alterations, or the regime for dealing with them to which

theclause relates. That is because a school&#146;s

admissions arrangements can be altered under three

differentprocesses.</div><a name="0604267000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

first process is the normal annual consultation and determination for

school admissions as set out in section 89 of the School Standards and

Framework Act 1998. Admission authorities consult on their

arrangements, determining them in the year prior to which they are to

apply and including any changes that they may decide upon. In the case

of foundation and voluntary aided schools, the governing body is the

admissions authority; for community and voluntary controlled schools,

it is the local

authority.</div><a name="0604267000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second

way in which a school&#146;s admissions arrangements can be changed

is under the adjudication regime. Following consultation, the statutory

consultees&#151;broadly speaking, other schools in the area, the

local authority, the admissions forum and, in certain circumstances,

parents&#151;can object to a school&#146;s admission arrangements

and the adjudicator will then reach a binding decision on the

objection. We are also extending the adjudicator&#146;s power to

consider a school&#146;s admissions arrangements in their entirety on

submission of an objection, and for that decision to be binding for two

years, rather than for one year as at

present.</div><a name="0604267000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the

routes through which changes to admissions procedures can be made. I am

aware, not least from other amendments that he has tabled, that the

hon. Member for Gainsborough would rather that only schools themselves

had the power to change admissions arrangements. However, it is clear

from a minority of persistent cases that some schools seek to set

admissions arrangements that are in the interests of the school itself

rather than the interests of local children. It is important to put a

strong adjudication process in place to ensure that all schools adopt

fair admissions arrangements that increase choice for local

parents.</div> <a name="0604267000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">Requiring

changes to be agreed with the school&#146;s governing body, as the

amendment does, would regrettably not ensure in every case that the

interests of parents and children were

upheld.</div><a name="0604267000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

regulations made under the Bill will set out procedures under which

admissions arrangements can be modified to bring them into line with

the admissions code as part of the approval process for statutory

proposals to enlarge schools or to establish new

ones.</div>

<a name="0604267000379"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000649"></a>Mr.

in saying that no Minister can use clause 17 to change admissions

criteria?</div><a name="0604267000380"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000650"></a>Jacqui

clause 17 to change admissions 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>arrangements, because it relates to prescribed alterations and

admissions arrangements do not come under that category. I shall quit

<a name="0604267000391"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000654"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> In the same way that the first of the previous

set of amendments dealt with some inconsistencies that I thought were

present in the policy towards community schools, this group of

amendments deals with a similar set of inconsistencies in the attitude

to parental involvement and influence. It is those issues that I wish

to tease out.</div><a name="0604267000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 187 calls for a block on reducing the proportion of elected parent

governors on school governing bodies. Amendments Nos. 218 to 223 would

prevent a majority of the governing body from being given to one set of

governors. New clause 17 would do the same, but in a slightly different

form.</div> <a name="0604267000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is now nine

minutes past 7 o'clock, and the Whip has indicated that we have to

continue to complete consideration of clause 18. I spent some time on

the previous amendment, so I shall be

brief.</div><a name="0604267000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Had the original

White Paper, the Government&#146;s argument in favour of it and the

Bill when finally published not put such emphasis on the importance of

parent power, the amendments might not have been necessary. However, if

we are to be consistent and if we 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>are saying that the new system will be far more driven by parents than

the current system, and that parents&#146; voices will be heard and

given more attention, it seems illogical to squeeze them out of school

governing bodies.</div><a name="0604267000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

30 years, the governing bodies of most schools in the United Kingdom,

although not all&#151;I accept that the majority of the governing

body of some schools is allocated to one set of individuals, or one

group&#151;have operated on the basis of a partnership between the

representatives of parents, staff, the local authority and the wider

community. Nobody is unaware of the difficulties of continuing to

enthuse people to take part in their school governing body. It is

sometimes extremely difficult to encourage parents to play a full role,

but the partnership model seems to work well. It has wide support and

it ensures an adequate line of accountability from the school and the

local authority, and also between the school and the wider body of

parents.</div><a name="0604267000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems

illogical, therefore, that it will be possible to reduce the proportion

of parents on a governing body and hand it over to a foundation, in the

case of a governing body deciding to go down the trust school route. If

the Government are insisting on that approach and on the importance of

the foundation having the majority on the governing body, we need more

compelling arguments than have yet been put and evidence that schools

that already have a foundation providing the majority on the governing

body have automatically been able to deliver higher standards. Where is

the evidence of a direct relationship between that composition of a

governing body and higher

performance?</div><a name="0604267000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that

spirit and with those few arguments, I support the

amendment.</div><a name="0604267000398"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000655"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Amendment No. 187 would prohibit a reduction in the

proportion of elected parent governors on a school governing body. As

members of the Committee know, the proportion of governorsof

varying categories&#151;whether parent, staff, LEA, community or

foundation&#151;is governed by the School Governance (Constitution)

(England) Regulations 2003. According to paragraph 7.4 of the

regulatory impact assessment, trust school governing bodies will have

the same model as voluntary aided schools. The size of the governing

body is determined by the instrument of government but must be no fewer

than nine and no more than 20 governors, excluding sponsor governors or

additional foundation

governors.</div><a name="0604267000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

regulations also state that one third of governors of foundation

schools shall be parent governors, but, according to the regulatory

impact assessment, trust schools for which the trust appoints the

majority of governors will have fewer elected parent governors than

trust schools for which the trust appoints a minority of governors. The

reason&#151;this is an important quote&#151;is

because</div><a name="0604267000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is not

feasible to provide for both (a) the Trust to appoint a majority of

governors, and (b) the governing body to comprise one third elected

parents (plus other categories of governors) without the governing body

becoming unmanageably

large.&#148;</div><a name="0604267000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">That can

be demonstrated by a simple numerical example. Let us suppose that the

instrument of government for a trust school provides for the bare 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>minimum of LEA and staff governors&#151;just one and two respectively.

The trust then must determine the composition of the governing body in

accordance with regulations that state that the number of foundation

governors must outnumber the other governors by two. If the amendment

was accepted, one third of the governors would have to be

elected.</div><a name="0604267000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,

if one does simultaneous equations, the minimum number of governors

needed to satisfy the requirement would be one LEA governor, two staff

governors and&#151;if parent governors are to represent one third of

the total number of governors and foundation governors are to outnumber

the other governors by two&#151;eight parent and 13 foundation

governors. One plus two plus eight plus 13 equals 24. Twenty-four

governors would be unwieldy, and the number is four more than the

maximum in the

regulations.</div><a name="0604267000494"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000656"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I am impressed by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

maths, but I am afraid that the matter is even more unwieldy than that,

because he has left out of his equation staff governors and, I think,

community governors. When they are included, the number becomes even

larger than

24.</div><a name="0604267000403"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000657"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I thought that I had included both those categories,

but we can debate the maths later. Either way, it is an unwieldy

number. With a governing body numbering fewer than either my 24 or the

number that the Minister comes up with, it is mathematically impossible

for the trust to have a majority of two and for one third of the

governors to be parents.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000658"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> This is something of a circular argument. Surely

the simple solution if we want to give priority to parent governors on

the governing body is not to have a majority of governors appointed by

the

trust.</div><a name="0604267000405"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000659"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> That goes to the root of the Bill. If we do not

allow foundations to have a majority of governors, a lot of trusts will

not be established. Perhaps that is the purpose of the amendment and

the reason why the hon. Lady supports the amendment, if indeed she is.

The effect of amendment No. 187 would be to create unwieldy

trusts.</div> <a name="0604267000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment Nos.

218 to 223 would remove the right of a foundation to appoint the

majority of the governing body, which would drive a coach and horses

through the whole objective behind trust schools, which is to achieve

diversity in the ethos and management of schools. It would also

severely limit the number of charitable trusts that would come forward

to set up trust schools.</div>

<a name="0604267000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally&#151;I am aware of the

late hour&#151;I ask the Minister to confirm one or two things in the

draft guidance that she circulated at the end of this morning&#146;s

sitting. Paragraph 8 of the draft guidance, on page 2, says:</div>

<a name="0604267000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Government does,

however, wish to ensure that a number of safeguards around Trusts are

put in place. All Trusts 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>will be charitable and will have to have specified charitable objects

around the advancement of

education.&#148;</div><a name="0604267000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a good

thing to have in the guidance. Will the Minister confirm that the

Government do not intend to remove education as a charitable objective?

To do so would make the whole guidance meaningless. Education should

continue to be one of the tenets that make up charitable objectives in

the Charities Acts.</div><a name="0604267000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister cites two statutory instruments in paragraph 8, both of which

are dated 2007. When are they likely to be published in

draft?</div><a name="0604267000410"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000660"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I shall speak briefly in support of the

amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bury, North, which go to the

heart of accountability. We believe that governing bodies should be

representative of parents and the local community. The hon. Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton implied that we cannot have trusts

without giving them majority control of governing bodies, but I do not

see why that should necessarily be the case. We would never argue that

the majority of the governing body of a community school should be LEA

representatives. Instead, we would argue that a substantial proportion

of governors should be parent governors and other representatives of

the community. I do not see why that case should not be made for trust

schools and new foundation schools.</div>

<a name="0604267000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument that there would be

an unwieldy number on the governing body is entirely circular. Surely,

of all the people to whom a school should be accountable, the most

important are parents whose children attend that school. The provisions

for parent councils are a mere sop; they do not give them the real

accountability for decision making that we want the governing body to

have. We hope that the hon. Member for Bury, North will press the

amendment to a vote. If he chooses not to, we will oppose its

withdrawal.</div><a name="0604267000412"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000661"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> There has been some interesting discussion on the

amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North focused his

concern on the role and engagement of parents. I will come back to how

we will ensure that that is maintained.</div>

<a name="0604267000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for Brent, East

and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton have come at the issue from

different directions, but both focused on the implications of the

amendments, which is to prevent the charitable foundation of a trust

school from appointing the majority of governors. The hon. Lady argued

that that is her intention: it is what she wants to happen, but that is

a fundamental problem with the amendments. We believe that appointing

the majority of governors is one way in which a charitable foundation

can strengthen the leadership and governance of a school. We want to

extend to all schools the freedom to shape their own destiny that has

helped voluntary and foundation schools to succeed.</div>

<a name="0604267000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend accepted the fact

that voluntary aided schools currently have a majority of their

governors appointed by a charitable foundation. Such schools are doing

well. He did not accept that point, but asked me to provide evidence of

the impact of that process. We have already provided evidence to the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>Education and Skills Committee that they are doing particularly well,

including in the most disadvantaged areas. In voluntary aided schools

where more than 20 per cent. of pupils are on free school meals, 47.6

per cent. achieve five or more A* to C GCSEs, rather than 40.6 per

cent. in other schools. Such cases represent one piece of evidence that

could support the argument that the impact of the external charitable

organisation having a majority on the governing body has helped improve

quality.</div>

<a name="0604267000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important

point is that we are not arguing that any school has to take on a

trust, nor are we arguing that having taken on a trust, or by

considering taking on a trust, any school must allow a trust to make up

a majority of the governing body. We are arguing that there may be many

circumstances in which that is the most appropriate way to ensure the

most effective delivery of the support for leadership and governance in

the school and the contribution that the trust can make to that

governance, which is at the heart of what we are trying to achieve in

the trust proposals.</div>

<a name="0604267000416"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000662"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister will accept that once she argued

precisely that. The White Paper

says:</div><a name="0604267000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At the

heart of this new vision are Trust schools. We will encourage all

primary and secondary schools to be self-governing and to require a

Trust.&#148;</div><a name="0604267000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">When and why did

she change her

mind?</div><a name="0604267000418"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000663"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I have not changed my mind. I am making a

distinction between compulsion and flexibility and enabling. The

legislation is all about allowing schools to move in the direction that

we believe to be the most effective, which is spelled out in the White

Paper. Some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleagues wanted to promote

a compulsory approach to trust schools, but by building on the

arguments about school autonomy that have previously been so important

to Opposition Members, we are providing schools with that

decision-making ability. We argue that where a school believes that the

needs of pupils will be better met by the additional drive and

enthusiasm that the appointment of the majority of a school&#146;s

governors a trust can bring, we should not deprive pupils of that

opportunity.</div><a name="0604267000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

repeatedly made it clear that no school will be forced to acquire a

trust or to allow the trust to appoint a majority of its governors. The

legislation is enabling rather than prescriptive in this regard because

we believe that such decisions are best made locally, in accordance

with local circumstances and the particular needs of each school. It

will be for the governing body of a school to decide whether to acquire

a foundation and whether that foundation should appoint the majority of

governors. That will happen in accordance with the statutory guidance

that I have made available to the Committee today, which will place the

process in an important context of local accountability and the

transparency of the proposals. The process will make clear the criteria

that the decision makers&#151;in this case, the governing

body&#151;should bear in mind when making that particular

decision.</div> <a name="0604267000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked a couple of questions

about the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>guidance. I can reassure him that one of the reasons for choosing the

advancement of education is that it is a charitable object and will

remain so. His second question concerned the regulations mentioned in

the guidance. That is a reference to sets of regulations that I have

already distributed to the Committee. They are the illustrative

regulations relating to clauses 17 to 22 and to clause 31. We are

determined to ensure that that governing bodies have the choice of

allowing their trusts to appoint the minority or majority of governors

if they believe that that is right for their

school.</div><a name="0604267000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North raised an important point on

trust school models that also relates to what was said by the hon.

Member for Brent, East. That model retains the stakeholder model of

governance that has been at the heart of governance of maintained

schools. It is part of the reason why conflict between a majority of

foundation governors and other governors arises, because we are clear

that there should continue to be elected parent representatives and

local authority representation, and that there should continue to be

community and staff representation, even in circumstances in which the

foundation has a majority on the governing

body.</div><a name="0604267000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether there is

a majority or a minority, parents will continue to play an important

role, both as members of the governing body&#151;whether elected, or

appointed by the trust&#151;and on parent councils. We need to

recognise, however, that it is not always that easy to get parents to

stand for election to governing bodies in the numbers that we want, so

we need to have a wide range of ways to engage parents and hear their

voices&#151;not just in trust schools but in schools more

widely.</div><a name="0604267000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents

will continue to constitute one third of the governing body in a trust

school, as in all maintained schools. If a trust appoints the majority

of governors we shall require trust schools to establish a parent

council with an advisory and consultative role. The governing body will

also have a duty to consult the parent council on the conduct of the

school. So we are protecting the interests of parents in trust

schools&#151;arguably we are actually broadening parents&#146;

ability to have an impact, because parent councils in particular will

provide an important forum for parents to contribute to their own

child&#146;s education and to contribute in improving the school

system. The evidence suggests that they are a more accessible way to

involve parents in decisions about the school because they are more

informal and involve less commitment, and can involve more parents than

the governing

body.</div><a name="0604267000424"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000664"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Does the Minister not recognise that there is a

difference between the onus to consult parents and a vote on a

governing

body?</div><a name="0604267000425"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000665"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Of course there is, but does the hon. Lady accept

that two or three elected parent governors, important though they might

be, should not be the beginning and the end of parental representation

and engagement in our schools? My point is that we need a range of ways

for parents to be engaged, and our proposals on trust schools will

provide more 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>opportunity for parents to have an impact while maintaining important

roles on the governing

body.</div><a name="0604267000426"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000666"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> It sounds as though there is a trade-off between

the parents&#146; council and the number of parent governors.

Personally, I am very supportive of parent councils, but I do not like

trade-offs whereby we have fewer elected parent governors. Why can we

not have

both?</div><a name="0604267000427"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000667"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Let me go back to first principles. Let me first

remind hon. Members that a third of governing bodies must be composed

of parents, regardless of the status of the school. I explained to the

hon. Lady why it is not possible to have both a majority of foundation

governors on a governing body and at the same time have all of the one

third as elected parent governors. To some extent the hon. Lady is

right, but we are increasing parents&#146; ability to engage in

schools where the foundation is able to appoint a majority of the

governing

body.</div><a name="0604267000495"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.30

pm</div><a name="0604267000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made the

arguments as to why there will be cases when the trust, having the

majority of the governing body, will be crucial in helping to drive the

governance of the school. Alongside that, we are ensuring that the

realistic ability of parents to have a voice and to contribute to the

school is protectedand, in many cases, enhanced. Of course,

parental engagement is one issue that governing bodies will consider

when deciding whether to become a trust school. Governing bodies must

have the flexibility to make those choices in light of local

circumstances.</div><a name="0604267000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we

have discussed previously and will no doubt discuss again, we have

built in safeguards in respect of trust acquisition and of trusts

appointing a majority of the governors. For the first time, we are

providing in legislation for a governing body to be able to remove a

trust or to move from a trust appointing a majority of the governors to

a trust appointing a minority of the governors if there is

dissatisfaction with how the trust is

performing.</div><a name="0604267000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

provisions in the Bill are well balanced. They provide the right level

of flexibility for schools to take the right decisions about the best

model for them. The necessary safeguards are built in, including a

mechanism for removing a trust or its ability to appoint a majority of

the governing body if the governing body feels that that is best. I

therefore hope, not least because my voice is becoming a little weak,

that my hon. Friends will agree not to press the amendments, which

would be unnecessarily

restrictive.</div><a name="0604267000431"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604267000668"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I shall make two points in reply. First,

underlying the debate is the anxiety that some people would have about

why the trust needed a majority on the governing body. By and large,

governing bodies have operated on the basis of a degree of consensus.

Those with particular views about the direction of a school or about

the staffing policy in a school have been forced to persuade a majority

of the governors to agree to the policy. The fear is that, with a

built-in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>majority, there will be no need to persuade; there will be a need simply

to assert and vote. I am sure that the Minister would accept that that

concern is

legitimate.</div><a name="0604267000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other

point is that, as the Bill is written, the outgoing governing body

would decide, first, whether the trust option was to be pursued and,

secondly, if the trust option were pursued, whether the trust should

have a majority or a minority on the new governing body. In one

respect, the outgoing governing body, which presumably by definition

has failed to give leadership to the school, is the group of people

least well qualified to decide what the future composition of the

governing body should be. Perhaps the Minister will consider whether a

wider group of people needs to be involved in the decision. If there is

to be the majority option for the trust, a wider group of people needs

to be involved in the decision. Perhaps at the point of decision, both

about trust status and about the trust having a majority on the new

governing body, the wider group of parents should be involved. However,

I leave that for the Minister to

consider.</div><a name="0604267000433"></a>
