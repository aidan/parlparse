<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)—
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for reminding me that I was about to intervene to ask whether he might give some examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> To set the example in context, I remind the Committee that clause 26 exempts information the disclosure of which would or would be likely to prejudice relations between any two Administrations in the United Kingdom. The clause has a prejudice test: it is not a blanket ban. The commissioner may order disclosure if she finds that the information would not prejudice relations between Administrations. Clause 13 will apply, thereby ensuring that even if information would prejudice relations between Administrations in the UK, it would none the less be released if the public interest test favours release, which would be a recommendation from the Minister.
<P>
Let us suppose that an E. coli outbreak takes place in one of the Scottish regions and that a civil servant from the Department of Health in London writes a report to his Minister in this Administration, perhaps relying on information provided by the Scottish Executive, which may be highly critical of the handling of the outbreak and of how the Scottish Executive is handling health issues generally. If that information were to be disclosed before the Scottish Executive had had an opportunity to consider it, respond to it and make appropriate preparations for its being made public, that may jeopardise our good relations with the Scottish Executive.
<P>
Hon. Members asked whether the test is designed purely to avoid embarrassment. In such circumstances, disclosure would not be justified if it would purely embarrass Scottish Ministers If it would, but would cause no further mischief, the information should be disclosed. Nothing in the Bill allows information to be withheld on grounds of embarrassment. However, if disclosure would cause a breakdown in relations between the UK Government and the Scottish Executive by disclosing at that point, such that future information of that nature would not be freely exchanged between Administrations, it is right that an exemption founded on the prejudice test and subject to clause 13 should be available.
<P>
Such information would be covered under clause 26 because disclosure before the Scottish Executive has had a chance to consider and respond to the report would prejudice relations between any two Administrations in the UK. It would not be right for the Scottish Executive to learn about such a document's existence from a national newspaper, having found that it had to be disclosed as a result of an application made in London.
<P>
That is not the end of the story by a long way. If the exemption is properly claimed—if it were not, the Information Commissioner could order disclosure—the public authority, in this case, the Department of Health, must under clause 13 consider whether the public interest in disclosing the information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption. If it does, the information will be disclosed under clause 13. Again, we are dealing with hypothesis, but I should like to illustrate a point.
<P>
If the information shows that the mishandling of the outbreak led to its spreading further, it may be considered that the public interest in disclosing the information outweighed the fact that disclosure would prejudice relations with the Scottish Executive. The information would then be released under clause 13. However, we need to retain the exemption. Material may be held by the Government or by other public authorities that is critical of one or other of the Administrations and prejudices our relations with it.
<P>
It is not unreasonable that such information should be protected. What about any views that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions may have on the Scottish Executive's proposed reorganisation of local authorities? We may wish to have an input, or to comment publicly on the matter, but we would not want to release a report that made a stinging criticism of the proposals as it might prejudice our good relations with the Scottish Executive. We may wish instead to comment constructively.
<P>
That is not big brother tactics; we do not seek to subvert the Scottish Administration, the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly or the National Assembly for Wales. That is standard practice in other freedom of information legislation in countries with a similar need to preserve good interstate relations. It is right to retain the Bill's protection of that category of information. The clause should therefore stand part of the Bill,
<P>
I hope that my explanation provides the reassurance that the hon. Gentleman needs to be sure that the clause is not concerned with embarrassment but with genuine issues of prejudice.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 26 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I have now had an opportunity to consider the record of our proceedings on Thursday 20 January. At column 212 of Hansard, I inadvertently suggested to the Committee that information under clause 21—that is information supplied by or relating to bodies dealing with security matters—was subject to the public interest test under clause 13. I was in error in suggesting that. Under clause 13(1)(a)(i), it is exempted from that test. I apologise for misleading the Committee and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) for pointing it out. I have written to all members of the Committee to point out my error in making that assertion at the end of a long Committee sitting.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Lock We now come to clause 27.
<H4><center>Clause 27</center></H4>
<H4><center>The economy</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 132, in page 14, line 22, leave out from first `would' to end of line 26 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) harm the ability of the Government to manage the economy, prejudice the conduct of official market operations, or lead to improper gain or advantage, or
<P>
(b) prejudice the assessment or collection of tax, duties or National Insurance contributions, or assist tax avoidance or evasion'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The exemption in clause 27—another contents exemption— is too widely drawn. The amendment seeks to substitute the words in clause 27 with words used in the code of practice to provide a general exemption for matters relating to the economy. The clause is drafted in such a way that it will catch all information relating to the economy. That is much too wide an exemption. It goes beyond what is necessary or reasonable and should be much more tightly drawn.
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I shall give a couple of examples. The clause would exempt any information
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if its disclosure . . . would, or would be likely to, prejudice—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the economic interests of the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a vague term and capable of wide application. Similarly, in subsection (1)(b), the exemption applies to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the financial interests of any administration in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The administrations are listed in clause 26—the United Kingdom Government, the two Assemblies and the Scottish Parliament. Subsection (1)(b) is equally wide ranging and we are uncertain about its application.
<P>
There is a case for an exemption in relation to the economy, but we need to be much more specific about which aspects of the economy or financial interests are to be the subject of that exemption. We believe that the code had it right. We should be concerned about the release of information that, in the words of the amendment, would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``harm the ability of the Government to manage the economy''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a perfectly straightforward and obvious position to take, and similarly, if the release of such information would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prejudice the conduct of official market operations''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In schedule 1, part VI, which lists the organisations that are not public authorities in terms of being Government organisations, but which are public authorities none the less, such as the Bank of England, there is a clear exemption for the conduct of official market operations in respect of the Bank. It is right to extend that exemption to ensure that no information is released that could lead to improper gain or advantage. Beyond those restrictions, we cannot see how such a vague description as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the economic interests of the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
can be justified. Why have the Government gone way beyond what was in the White Paper when such an exemption could be much more tightly focused and defined?
<P>
We could agree with the Government if disclosure of information would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prejudice the assessment or collection of tax, duties or National Insurance contributions or assist tax avoidance or evasion''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a standard principle in tax legislation. We cannot see why the exemption in the Government's version in clause 27 needs to be anything like as extensive as it appears.
<P>
Our amendment is much more tightly worded and adds a sense of purpose to why exemptions are required. The definition of potential damage or harm is clearly much more tightly drawn and would mean that the exemption would not be used more liberally. It would restrict the exemption only to those specific matters that should be exempted in the public interest. It shows much more clearly what the clause would exempt, so I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The amendment seeks to identify the interests that are covered by clause 27 and to provide greater clarity with regard to the types of information protected by that clause. However, its effect is to provide less protection than the clause.
<P>
Clause 27(1) exempts information the disclosure of which would, or would be likely to, prejudice the economic interests of the United Kingdom, any part of the United Kingdom, or the financial interests of any administration in the United Kingdom, including the UK Government, the Scottish Administration, the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>
Some of the information cited in the amendment is covered by the clause, while some is covered by other clauses in the Bill. For example, the attaining of improper gain or advantage is covered by the exemption for commercial interests in clause 41.
<P>
Furthermore, clause 27 protects the interests of specific sectors of the economy and regional economies, in addition to the national economy. The amendment would remove the protection for both of those. Nor would it offer protection for information, the disclosure of which would, or would be likely to, prejudice the financial interests of the Scottish Administration, the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly or the Welsh Assembly.
<P>
We saw earlier today that the necessary protection afforded to regional government in this country is under threat from the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). If in the future, those Administrations were being run by members of his party, I wonder whether he would still consider it appropriate to give such wide disclosure of their activities. Is his approach determined by the present incumbents of those Administrations? We believe that whoever runs the Administrations, they must do so properly and efficiently, so there has to be a measure of protection balanced by pubic interest.
<P>
The freedom of information regime should not require the disclosure of information that would harm the economic interests of the United Kingdom generally, or a part of the United Kingdom. Let me give the Committee an example of the effect of the amendment. Public authorities, such as the Department of Trade and Industry, may hold documents setting out the advantages and disadvantages of investing in different regions. If such information was disclosed before a region was aware of it and before it had a chance to comment on or rebut a suggestion that it was the worst region in which to invest in the United Kingdom, it could put someone off contemplating setting up a factory in a part of the UK that was not favoured in the report. The amendment would not exempt such information from being disclosed at the time when the document came into existence, which may be well before the time when it would be appropriate in the public interest for the document to be disclosed.
<P>
The Government have decided on a general definition in the clause to guard against prejudice to the economy. To take a different approach, and to limit the sectors applying for exemption, as the amendment would do, runs the risk that certain information might not fall within the specific words of the exemption, but the disclosure of which would, none the less, prejudice the operation of the UK economy. That cannot be a sensible position for any Government to take. For those reasons, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> On this occasion, we shall have to study the Minister's response. I am not suggesting that we are talking at cross-purposes, but I certainly felt that, at times, the Minister was responding to what I might say rather than what I said. The example of investing in different regions would be covered by our amendment which would insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``harm the ability of the Government to manage the economy''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is all part of managing the economy of the United Kingdom as a whole, if we want to attract inward investment. To some extent, the Parliamentary Secretary almost let the cat out of the bag; he seemed to imply that the Bill was tailor-made should we decide to have regional assemblies for England as well as the Parliament in Scotland and the Assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland. Clauses 26 and 27 clearly give us reason to ponder the relationship between those bodies and the implications for the release of information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that when I mentioned regional government I was referring to those parts of the United Kingdom of which the citizens had decided in a referendum that they would like a measure of regional government—and not beyond that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not wish to incur your wrath, Dr. Clark, by straying beyond the amendment and delving into a debate about regional assemblies and the attraction or otherwise of other parts of the United Kingdom having similar assemblies to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>
In his initial response, the Minister seemed to indicate that it might be suggested, for instance, that investing in the north-east and in my constituency, which is in the overlap between Yorkshire and Humberside regions, might not be such a good idea, but that people could be persuaded to go to sunny Wales because everything was excellent there. I appear frequently on north-east regional television discussing the state of the economy of the north-east and the difficulties caused by this Government's policies, such as the loss of manufacturing jobs.
<P>
The Bill should not create all kinds of widely drawn exemptions. It beggars belief that they might have a practical purpose. However, we shall come to a view. I shall study what the Minister has said, and we may as a consequence revisit the matter on Report in a slightly more focused way. The purpose of the amendment was to register the fact that those two exemptions are so widely drawn as to be unacceptable.
<P>
Although it is important that the Bill should make provisions on economic interests, the collection of taxes and so on, clause 27 goes way beyond what is necessary. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) agreed this morning that the provisions of clause 26 should not be included in the Bill. We have discovered from this evening's exchanges that the second half of clause 27 is of a similar nature, and we shall need to consider it again on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 27 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 28</center></H4>
<H4><center>Investigations and proceedings conducted</center></H4>
by public authorities
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 14, line 31, leave out `has at any time been' and insert `is'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 57, in page 14, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice any of those purposes.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 69, in page 14, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`so long as a decision as to whether to charge any person with an offence arising from any investigation is still under consideration, or any proceedings referred to in subsections (1)(a) to (1)(c) have not been concluded.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I support amendment No. 57, tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher), but I shall not trespass, at least initially, on the hon. Gentleman's turf.
<P>
The effect of amendments Nos. 68 and 69, tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome, is best described as removing the indefinite element of the exemption for information about investigations and proceedings. It has the backing of not only the Campaign for Freedom of Information, but the Law Society.
<P>
As the Bill stands, information reclaimed in connection with an investigation into a possible offence would be permanently exempt, even after any proceedings had been completed. There will be no harm test and no time limit for the exemption, which is unattractive and unacceptable. It means that information gathered in connection with, say, the Paddington rail crash could never be revealed under the Bill. Following an investigation into a major disaster, many bodies, including the police and the Health and Safety Executive, would hold information.
<P>
Once the police have decided whether a criminal investigation will take place, that information should be made available, or at any rate be available, to the families of the bereaved and other interested parties, subject only to a harm test. Only with access to such information could families decide whether to bring an action against those who may have some responsibility for the disaster. Alas, there have been too many disasters in recent years, such as the Marchioness, Zeebrugge and Hillsborough, when access to information held by the police that would have been vital for the families of the dead could have been withheld under the Government's proposals.
<P>
It is clear that access to information may also be vital in seeking to establish whether there is a continuing systemic problem within the authority holding the information or about which information is held by another body. An example might be a series of deaths in custody. Again, there have been far too many such cases recently. Once a decision on whether to prosecute has been taken, information which could establish evidence of a systemic problem should be available. Access to information might show that the training of police or prison officers in restraint techniques should be reconsidered. There might therefore be a benefit not only to individuals, but to the general public interest.
<P>
The blanket exemption in clause 28 is also at odds with the Woolf reforms of the civil justice system. One of their principle themes is to avoid unnecessary and costly litigation by encouraging parties to resolve disputes at the pre-action stage. Pre-action discovery lies at the centre of the Woolf initiative. Above all, we need to avoid litigating for the primary purpose of obtaining information and amendments Nos. 68 and 69 are designed with that in mind. The Bill clearly works against the Woolf initiative. The effective resolution of disputes at an early stage requires those concerned about the conduct of public authorities to be speedily provided with wide disclosure of material held by the public authorities. Much litigation against authorities arises out of secrecy and inadequate information in the early stages and members of the public who are aggrieved by a public authority's conduct frequently resort to legal proceedings to pursue their grievances, in some cases unnecessarily. The amendment would thus allow class exemptions to stand, but only while the decision to prosecute is still under consideration or any prosecution has not been completed. Thereafter, such information would be disclosable, subject to the prejudice test set out in clause 29.
<P>
I have probably said enough to enable the Minister to deal with the principal issues that I want him to consider.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): My amendment adds a harm test at the end of subsection (1), using—the Minister will be glad to know—the word ``prejudice''. Our earlier debate showed how unprejudiced critics of the Bill are in some respects. I moved the amendment and I hope it will get support from members of the Committee because the class exemption in the clause is wide. It is wide in terms of the important authorities that it covers—the police, the prosecuting bodies, presumably the Health and Safety Executive, trading standards, and planning and probation authorities—and it would be helpful if the Minister gave a comprehensive list of those that would be covered or, if he cannot do so today, would circulate one later. I suspect that, by the nature of the clause, the bodies concerned are of enormous power and importance and it would be helpful for us to know what they are.
<P>
The exemption is also wide in terms of its time scale and scope. It refers to the exemption of information that was held ``at any time'' for use in an investigation or a prosecution. That is, of course, reasonable during the crucial period of a prosecution, but the words ``at any time'' mean that information could be exempt indefinitely—after an authority recognises that an offence has been caused and that it will not bring charges, for example, when information is recognised as marginal or incidental to any investigation that may take place, or, indeed, when a prosecution has been completed. The whole thing can be settled and buried and still, under the clause, information would be exempt. Such a wide and surprising exemption is surely worrying.
<P>
An example of the dangers of such an exemption is the fairly well-known case—I do not know if the Minister has heard about it—of the terrible death of a young man on Oxford station three years ago. He was running for a train, something happened with a door and he was killed. The circumstances have never become clear, there have never been any prosecutions and information has never been provided by the rail operator, which I believe was Connex. The case has been a running issue in the Oxford, and indeed the national, press ever since. Understandably, the relatives of the young man, especially the father, continue to be distraught and their grief is aggravated enormously by the fact that they simply do not know what happened. As we do not know, how can a similar occurrence be avoided in future? As there is no information, we do not know whom to blame. Were the operating conditions of the company to blame, and if so, will it happen again?
<P>
When information is exempt and frozen, not only is there an enormous grievance but such an instance is not conducive to solving the problems. I shall not list other examples such as Paddington. It seems likely that there will be no prosecutions in that case, but those who were injured, their families, the relatives of the dead and the public want to know what happened. The reason for legislation such as the Bill is that they have a right to know. Given the number of people who commute in and out of our capital every day, the subject is of enormous public interest. The exemption would prevent the release of such information for all time. Surely the Bill is designed to try to open up those matters and ensure that people get that information.
<P>
The Committee and the Parliamentary Secretary have the drift. I am talking about cases such as those of the Marchioness and Konrad Kalejs. The Macpherson report into the Stephen Lawrence inquiry urged
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``vigorous pursuit of openness and accountability across Police Services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We see no logical grounds for a class exemption. for the police''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Select Committee evidence criticised this aspect of the Bill. The Commission for Racial Equality and others said in no uncertain terms that the freezing of exemptions over investigations was simply not satisfactory. The Government appear to have moved a little on the subject, but they are open to enormous criticism. Whatever we decide in Committee, this will be a closely and unhappily argued clause on the Floor of the House and in another place.
<P>
I do not want to labour my point. The case for reconsidering the exemptions is so strong that even if the Parliamentary Secretary's brief says, ``Resist today'', he and the Committee know that something will have to change.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We may part company with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) on the matter. If I understand correctly, as I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will confirm, we are probably content with the need for the clause. Whether the wording could be improved is a separate matter.
<P>
We are talking about information held by a public authority that has a duty to conduct inquiries with a view to bringing criminal prosecutions. That is not the same as the duty to investigate the cause of an accident. We are likely to part company with the Government on clause 29, which contains a contents exemption and a harm test. That clause is probably too widely drawn.
<P>
In the amendment, the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross is trying to change the line of demarcation so that only information potential criminal proceedings is held, and information should be released once the decision has been taken not to bring those proceedings. If that information related to an incident of high public interest, such as a serious accident, I can understand the view that some of it should be made available, and I think that in all probability it would be.
<P>
A series of investigations must be carried out into an accident such as the Paddington rail disaster. I am not an expert in the non-police issues involved, but the police must consider whether a criminal offence was committed that led to or caused the accident—is the driver guilty of manslaughter, for example? If Parliament decides on the recommendation of the Law Commission to introduce an offence of corporate manslaughter, the police will have to consider whether that offence has been committed—whether the directors of Railtrack are to some extent criminally culpable for how they managed the company and how train drivers were trained and given guidance and whether that led to criminal activity. Even if at some point an inquiry determines that it does not have sufficient evidence to proceed, and does not intend to press the matter, the possibility remains that further information will come to light or that further evidence will be received that would change the scope of possible criminal proceedings.
<P>
If the intention of clause 28 is to limit that complete contents exemption to criminal investigation—for want of a better phrase; it embraces what the Government intend—evidence that might eventually lead to a criminal prosecution, those matters need to be the subject of a class exemption. However, that is not the same as concluding that that therefore means that any information relating to what caused the Paddington rail disaster, for example, will never be released, because that is simply not true. The Health and Safety Executive, in collaboration with Railtrack, released an interim report within days of the accident, such was the public clamour for information about what caused it. Public hearings would take place, and the information will be available through those hearings. If clause 28 would have the adverse consequences suggested by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, we would be worried, but I do not believe that it will, because the information that they want to be made available would be made available in other ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, because the body charged with the duty of investigation may in its wisdom or as a matter of policy decide to release information, those who are interested in the matter need not have any right that information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No, I am not saying that. My interpretation of the exemption is that it relates only to public authorities that have a duty to investigate incidents with a view to bringing criminal proceedings. That is not the same as an organisation that is investigating what has happened with a view to finding out what went wrong and making public reports on the cause.
<P>
If I may, Dr. Clark, I shall trespass for a moment into clause 29. The point that the hon. Gentleman is making is covered there. The contents exemption in clause 29(1) relates to information that might prejudice—we would prefer the word ``harm''—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2)(e) states that the purposes referred to in subsection (1) include:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the purpose of ascertaining the cause of an accident''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although there is a harm test, that exemption would cover the health and safety Executive, a public inquiry or any other body set up to investigate, for instance, the cause of the Paddington rail crash, and all that information would be made available.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It stands to reason that much of that information might touch on potential criminal proceedings. Given that the hearings will have been held in public, it is likely that some of that information will already be in the public domain. I understand that that is not what we are discussing in clause 28. If the police or any other organisation with criminal investigatory duties investigates an incident with a view to deciding whether a crime has been committed, to the extent of deciding whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute an offender, information that is placed before it should be the subject of the exemption.
<P>
I believe that the exemption is drawn without limit because information often takes a long time to come to light, and it could be several years before the police had sufficient evidence to bring a prosecution. I am sure that my next comment will not be sub judice. A high-profile murder trial is just about to draw to a conclusion, and some of the charges go back many years. Some of those charges involved the personal records of the patients of a medical practitioner.
<P>
I understand that, in that case, the exemption would exempt that material and provide the police with the opportunity to consider that evidence without worrying that, sooner or later, they will have to release that information. If amendment No. 57 is agreed to, that is precisely what would happen, but it is not acceptable to put the police under that pressure. It is a quite separate matter that the public would want to know what had caused a serious incident, who was to blame and so on. I believe that that situation would be covered by clause 29, but we have concerns also about that.
<P>
I hope that elaborating our own thoughts on the amendment has helped. Our view is that the objective of the Bill should be to release as much information as reasonably possible. We ought also to have regard to the fact that the police and the handful of other organisations with responsibility for criminal investigations should not be hampered by freedom of information legislation. Equally important, those who are the subject of the criminal investigations should be protected from information about them being released in a haphazard way, as would happen if a time limit was put the scope of the exemption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for missing his earlier remarks and he may already have answered my point. Any fair-minded person would accept that there are problems that need to be reconciled, but does he agree that one cannot justify exemptions lasting forever, even when investigations are concluded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am at one with the hon. Gentleman in wishing to ensure that information about the cause of an accident is released, but that is covered by clause 29, on which our concerns are similar to his. He is attempting to put clause 28 on to the same footing by introducing a harm test, but when we discuss clause 29 I suspect that we shall find that the hon. Gentleman feels that the scale of the exemption that it provides is far too all-embracing.
<P>
Clause 28 is much more narrowly focused on criminal investigations. On balance such investigations deserve to be protected from unhelpful requirements to publish information, which could undermine and be detrimental to the conduct of the investigation and the long-term interests of justice—ensuring that appropriate people are successfully prosecuted and convicted and, equally, that the innocent do not find that information about them is released with virtually no opportunity to refute what is alleged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> This has been a mature and thoughtful debate on an important element of the Bill. I invite the Committee to look in the first instance at the exact terms of clause 28(1)(a). The hon. Member for Ryedale rightly asked to which public authorities it refers. It refers to three types and three occasions—firstly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any investigation which the public authority has a duty to conduct'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
secondly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any investigation which is conducted by the authority and in the circumstances may lead to a decision by the authority to institute criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and thirdly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore a reasonably narrow exemption, dealing with certain specified conditions as set out in the clause.
<P>
I understand and have sympathy for the points made by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. I appreciate that a delicate balance needs to be struck to ensure that the right information is disclosed at the right time and that no information is disclosed which should not be. As we have heard in the debate, there may be circumstances in which the balance proposed in the amendments would lead to problems.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central asked whether we could produce a comprehensive list of bodies to which the exemption is intended to refer. We will attempt to produce as full a list as possible of those bodies where we are aware that it would be habitually used. It is impossible to say that every single body in every single circumstance concerned with every single Act that may come within the exemption would be included on that list, but I shall ensure that officials attempt to provide a list of those where it will be habitually used.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for responding in such a positive way. Nobody will hold him and his officials to such a list because there is no definite list, but in that case he may wish to reconsider his view that the amendment is `narrow' and `limited'. He will see a long list of important public authorities whose actions will fall within those three paragraphs to which he referred—subsection (1)(a) to (c)—all dealing with serious matters.
<P>
<B>Mr Lock:</B> I hear what my hon. Friend says. The narrowness of the exemption refers to the types of activities that are within the exemption rather than the number of bodies which may carry out this important, albeit somewhat narrow, class of activity.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 would apply the class exemption relating to criminal investigations and proceedings to information relating only to current criminal investigations.
<P>
Amendment No. 57 would make clause 28 a prejudice-based exemption instead of a class exemption.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 would limit the application of clause 28(1)(c) to information that relates to a decision whether to charge someone with an offence where that decision is still being taken, or where the investigations referred to in subsection (1)(a) to (c) have not yet been concluded. Amendment No. 69 is therefore complementary to Amendment No. 68, thus reducing the scope of the exemption to ``live'' investigations and proceedings.
<P>
Clause 28, as the hon. Member for Ryedale has explained, exempts information held at any time by an authority for the purposes of investigations specified in that clause. By applying the exemption only to live information, amendments Nos. 68 and 69 could cause information to be released relating to investigations which have been concluded, or which may have a bearing on future investigations which have not yet begun, or which relate to cases where a decision has been taken not to charge an individual with an offence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale, who I note from reading ``Dod's'' is a former police officer, well understands that investigations are never entirely closed when there is no satisfactory result for the police. It would therefore be impossible for many prosecuting authorities to conclude that an investigation that had not reached a satisfactory conclusion was none the less closed, albeit that it was somewhat dormant at the time. I agree with and adopt his analysis of the practical problems.
<P>
Removal of the class exemption for such information would, of course, bring the additional problem that it might undermine the effectiveness of the police and prosecution services because it might affect the type of information that they were able to receive in the first place if the sources of that information knew that at some time in the future it would be made public. There is a clear public interest in ensuring that the information provided in the course of those important investigations be kept to the maximum possible and that people should be free to provide opinions and accurate information to those conducting the investigations.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 57, the Government believe that a class exemption is essential in relation to such information in order to ensure that future criminal proceedings are not jeopardised by the premature disclosure of information and, in relation to investigations not proceeded with and to information not produced in court, to preserve the criminal courts as the sole forum for determining guilt. Information that is disclosed in court is, of course, in the public domain.
<P>
It is important to note that clause 28 will not prevent the disclosure of information about criminal investigations when that is in the public interest, because clause 13 applies to the operation of clause 28. Public bodies carrying out these investigations, particularly investigations that are not live, will therefore have to carry out the balancing act referred to in clause 13. Applicants would be entitled to go to the Information Commissioner to seek her view on the disclosure and obtain a recommendation on whether the public interest justified disclosure. There is, therefore, no suggestion that information provided in these investigations will be kept secret for ever. There should be a public interest test on whether disclosure is appropriate. That is what the combination of the class exemption in clause 28 and the operation of clause 13 provide.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I also make it clear that general information about the conduct of investigations, as opposed to information relating to particular investigations, is not covered by this class exemption, and the commissioner can, therefore, order the disclosure of such information if she, not the police or the Crown Prosecution Service, believes that disclosure would not prejudice the investigation or prosecution.
<P>
Reference has been made to the Paddington train crash inquiry and whether the information in that inquiry—or inquiries of that type—would come within the Bill. The inquiry was established by the Health and Safety Commission under section 14 of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. It will, therefore, be conducted in public. All documents submitted to it will be public documents and its findings will be published. Therefore, I assure the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross that our enquiries will be public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): I hope that I shall not try your patience if I stray out of order, Dr. Clark, but there seems to be a connection between clauses 29 and 28. If the logic of the Bill is to be understood, they seem to have to be considered together. It struck me, in trying to summarise how it would be interpreted, that clause 28, which concerns only criminal investigations, is about investigation and then decision. It concerns the information that is required for an investigation, and an investigation and the power to decide. What is being sought, I think, is an exemption to ensure that there is no inhibition on decision making. Clause 29, which is drawn more widely, is equally investigative, and the information would be disclosable because it would ultimately be background information to decision-taking, which is a different way of looking at it.
<P>
If that is what the Minister is saying, I can see how the clause has been drawn, and it ties into our earlier debate about factual information being releasable when it is behind decision-taking and policy formulation. That, however, is a separate debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I agree with that analysis of clause 28. The exact inter-relation of that analysis and clause 29 is perhaps a matter for a future debate.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross suggested that the clause is contrary to the spirit of the Woolf reforms. I know something of those, having been involved in them from a departmental perspective, and I do not believe that that is the case. Woolf is concerned with avoiding delay in civil litigation and providing parties with the right to get the maximum information from the opposing party to litigation before the case begins. That is the purpose of pre-action protocols. Nothing in the Bill will restrict or prevent the disclosure of information by a party to litigation before the proceedings have commenced, or will disapply the pre-action protocols provided for in the Woolf procedures.
<P>
Clause 28 deals with the investigations. A party who genuinely wished to commence proceedings and sought information legitimately to pursue a civil claim would be entitled to such information as was disclosable under the rules of court in the usual way and would not be hamstrung by clause 28. I hope that that gives the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks.
<P>
This is a difficult matter. I accept that a balance must be struck between the interests of investigating properly and the need to provide parties with the right to obtain the maximum information from the opposing party. There is a public interest in ensuring that, once the information is no longer required to be kept secret, it is disclosed. The right balance is struck in clause 28 by the operation of clause 13. I hope that, with that explanation, the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross will feel free to withdraw his amendment and my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central will not press his amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> On at least one earlier occasion, I expressed annoyance at the negative response that I received from the Parliamentary Secretary, but on this occasion I concede that the issues involved are difficult. I divine that it is the purpose of all who have spoken in the debate to try to get the matter right. However, I listened carefully to what the Parliamentary Secretary said and I am not satisfied that the problem has been totally surmounted. I shall study carefully what he has said. I am not entirely sure that I have grasped every point that he made.
<P>
With regard to the Woolf reforms, I simply reflected the view of the Law Society, and, to some extent, set its authority against the Parliamentary Secretary's judgment that this is not a good point. It seems, however, that if parties have to go to court to initiate proceedings for judicial review against an investigating authority, for example, to obtain disclosure, the purposes of Woolf are set at nought. If it were argued, for instance, that the Health and Safety Executive was not doing its duty by virtue of the fact that it was not acting in a timeless fashion, which is not entirely fanciful, that the only way to pursue the matter was by seeking a judicial review and that to substantiate the case it was necessary to extract information that was exempted under clause 28, that would defeat the Woolf purposes. Such thinking lies behind the Law Society's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the structure of the Woolf reforms is such that—whether in judicial review or ordinary damages claims—those authorities that do not give free action discovery when they ought to do so under the protocols, whether they are public authorities or not, will be subject to the usual sanctions of the courts, including costs orders. Structures are available to encourage timely disclosure of appropriate information.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> That is a point to which we shall want to return. I bare to the Parliamentary Secretary my difficulties with what he has said. There appears to be an element of obscurity in the drafting of clause 28(1)(a). Many of the bodies that might hold information that could be claimed as exempt under the clause might not have embarked upon the investigation to ascertain whether someone should be charged with an offence, or, necessarily, with the duty to prosecute that inquiry if, in the course of their inquiry, they discover evidence of a kind that might lead to it being thought appropriate to pursue a person for an offence.
<P>
I am not clear from the clause whether it is the Government's intention that even an initial inquiry that is required into some happening, which it is certainly not the duty of the inquirer to take to the point of prosecution, would be brought within the clause. For example, if someone died in hospital, the health authority would properly institute an inquiry if it were thought that, instead of the death being due to natural causes it was due to an over-prescription of a drug. If that were thought by the health authority to have been the case, it would not lie with the health authority to inquire into whether there were criminal or other reasons for the over-prescription.
<P>
The uncertainty is whether that authority, which held critical information, could be determined within the ambit of clause 28(1)(a) to have a duty to conduct an investigation with a view to it being ascertained whether a person should be charged with an offence. If it were possible to assert that the duty of the health authority to consider whether the death as a result of over-prescription did fall within the ambit of the clause, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central would undoubtedly be right. The clause would be extremely wide in its operation. If it were simply the prosecuting authorities, or at least those who had been subsequently called in to look at the circumstances uncovered by the original investigating authority, that would perhaps sustain the Parliamentary Secretary's argument.
<P>
Let me give another instance for elucidation of what the Government seek to do in the clause. In the event of there being a breach of a requirement of a nuclear installations inspectorate by, shall we say, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, it would fall in the first instance to the nuclear installations inspectorate to judge whether the breach had taken place. Whether that breach gave rise to imputation of criminal intent or strict liability, or whatever, would properly fall to another authority to determine. If, however, all investigations by the nuclear installations inspectorate into possible breaches of regulations having taken place led to a further conclusion that there was criminal negligence, that again would be a very wide operation under the clause.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> May I provide the right hon. Gentleman with some reassurance? I shall take his example of a health authority. If a health authority conducted an investigation in the course of its usual business to look into why an elderly patient died, perhaps following a complaint from a relative, then clearly it would be carrying out that investigation in accordance with its statutory duty to investigate complaints. If it did that, then its investigation would not prima facie be within clause 28.
<P>
However, if the investigation was with a view to a criminal charge or prosecution and the health authority had a duty to carry out that criminal charge or prosecution, than it would be within clause 28. So in the usual case, following a complaint, it makes an investigation. It discovers the information to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, which suggests that there may be a criminal case. It then passes that information on to the police. If it were conducting an investigation in connection with a complaint, it would not be within clause 28, but the information would be within clause 29 and, therefore, subject to a prejudice test.
<P>
I shall give the right hon. Gentleman another example. If a social services department starts an investigation into a children's home under its investigative powers, purely to find out what is going on, then during the course of that investigation—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Parliamentary Secretary goes too far in his second example, I remind him that this is an intervention so he might like to come to a conclusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I apologise to the Committee. In the second example, the social services would not be within clause 28, but they would be within clause 29 if the information they had could lead to a case of prejudice. It all depends on the statutory purposes for which the investigation is carried out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his reply. I find the position even more difficult to unravel than I thought, because it seems that in the case of the health authority, as he exemplified in his first illustration, the same information is likely to be held by both the health authority and by the police investigating authority. Whereas the health authority would not be debarred from disclosing the information under clause 28(1)(a), because it does not lie in its hands to investigate the prosecution or to investigate whether or not there has been an offence committed, the same information passed to the police or another investigative body could be debarred from disclosure under that subsection—even at the same time.
<P>
A member of the public could be told by the police, ``Sorry, you can't have this. We might be using it.'' If that person went to the health authority, the defence against disclosure could not be invoked. There might be other reasons for non disclosure. The matter requires further thought.
<P>
Furthermore, in the event of a fatal accident inquiry, the authority specifically charged with the investigation into the accident may or may not uncover criminal behaviour, so the position is extremely obscure. If an inquiry is set up into an accident such as the Paddington disaster, it is automatically presumed that the inquirers will uncover criminal behaviour, or that it is their duty to isolate criminal behaviour. Whether criminal behaviour has occurred will be considered subsequently. I am not clear whether, under clause 28(1)(a), information that is held by the inquiry could be withheld from the public because it might lead to further investigation into whether criminal behaviour has taken place. Can the Parliamentary Secretary reassure me about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I shall try to do so briefly. If the inquiry were not carrying out an investigation for the limited purposes set out in clause 28(1)(a), (b) or (c), it would not be able to take advantage of that exemption. Depending on the circumstances, it may come under clause 29 if criminal offences are disclosed, but not under the exemption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary and will consider the point further. There is, however, a wholly discrete point that also causes me concern about the clause. That is another reason why I have tabled the amendment in my name and that of the hon. Member for Ryedale. As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, and the Parliamentary Secretary confirmed in an interesting cross-party agreement, investigations into potential criminal behaviour or actions are often inconclusive. In some jurisdictions, that is perhaps more common than the alternative. Consequently, as a matter of public policy, absolute priority is given to the possibility, however remote, that at some date a prosecution might be mounted. That is given priority over any other public policy consideration. As I suggested in my initial remarks, there is a pattern of behaviour that ought to give rise to investigation. I instanced the investigation of death in custody, which could quite possibly involve behaviour that had been investigated by the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> May I draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the effect of clause 13? The logic of his argument would be consistent if clause 13 provided that clause 28 did not apply to the balance of public interest test. But that test does apply, and therefore his argument that the information, once obtained, would be shut away for ever—there may be an overriding public interest in that—is not a good one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> This is about an exempt category of information. I am suggesting that it should not necessarily be exempt. After a time the usefulness of the information becomes spent for the purposes of the prosecution if there has been no prosecution or if the prosecution has been conducted, the case has been heard and the proceedings are over. That argument has strength, and it is wrong to insist that that category of information should be exempt and we should still make the necessary application under clause 13 to ascertain where the balance of public interest lies. That is where I take issue with the Parliamentary Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman develops his argument, I am trying to understand what he is driving at. The long-standing and unconcluded case of Susie Lamplugh comes to mind. At what point does the information that was gathered in that investigation become spent? Recently, there was a revival of interest in the case after more than a decade, when there appeared to be new information. How long should it lie on the file as potentially relevant? It might help to clarify the issues if we look at that example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I agree—it certainly does help. That deals with one leg of my amendment because, had there been a prosecution and had someone been found guilty, information surrounding the case would have been spent. That issue does not lie between us. The question is whether at some point the police or prosecuting authorities would want to say, ``We have taken this as far as we can. We can usefully go no further. Other investigations or inquiries might be assisted by our releasing to the public such knowledge as we already have. We are not continuing to conduct this as a policing matter.'' It would then seem reasonable that the police should determine that their interest in the matter was finished. It could, of course, be revived by the appearance of new evidence. The Susie Lamplugh case usefully exemplifies the sense of the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> As my hon. Friends and the Parliamentary Secretary have said, this is an important debate because all the circumstances that Committee members have speculated might be covered are potentially embarrassing or awkward for public bodies or Government Departments. Investigation and possible prosecution occur only when, for whatever reason, things have gone badly wrong. Then the public want and have the right to, but have always lacked, statutory access to such information. Surely it is the Government's aim to ensure that we are better informed by opening up what goes wrong in our society, to avoid similar problems occurring in future.
<P>
I accept the argument of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary that the public also have a proper interest in prosecutions if they are necessary. It would be counterproductive for this desirable legislation—if it were to work as is intended—to stymie those prosecutions. I agree with the hon. Member for Ryedale, who has been a professional policeman and understands these matters, that it is not easy. The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) made the good point that police matters in particular, but others too, can lie dormant for a long time. Some of the best crime novels are based on exactly that premise and it is a reality. No one pretends that these are easy matters or that there are ready solutions.
<P>
I listened with great interest to the Parliamentary Secretary when he drew our attention to the interaction of clauses 13 and 28. Potentially, the seeds for resolving some of the difficulties that we face are there. I want to read what he said carefully, take further advice from people more eminent than myself who understand the law and consult some of the bodies that will be affected. There could be an acceptable approach to some of the problems, so I thank the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The way to test the provision examine specific circumstances. If clauses 13 and 28 interact, will it lead to the discretionary release of information that all of us want? That is the way out of what is a dangerous impasse. For example, in the recent case of Konrad Kalejs, would all the information about the extent and possible inadequacies of the inquiries be exempt? The Parliamentary Secretary knows that journalists who have studied that case doubt whether the Government made the right inquiries in due time with the United States authorities. It would not be desirable to cover up such inquiries.
<P>
I referred to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, which the Macpherson report trawled over. Would information on the inadequacy of the police inquiry over a number of years into the murder of Stephen Lawrence be protected by disclosure, or would the interaction of clauses 13 and 28 allow the commissioner to require that information to be blocked? Where does the balance of power lie? Would the police in the Lawrence inquiry have been able to stand on the wording of the clause and say, ``Nope, I'm very sorry, Mr. Lawrence, we have great sympathy for you''—perhaps I have put that too strongly—``but the law is clear. Parliament has passed this excellent Freedom of Information Act. It says this is exempt''? If Mr. Lawrence then went to the commissioner and said, ``Surely, commissioner, clause 13 applies because the Minister said in Committee that would. You should consider releasing the information'', where would the balance lie?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> May I make two things clear? First, my hon. Friend refers to investigations that go wrong. The vast majority of investigations that are protected by the clause will have nothing to do with public authorities and will involve the investigation of criminal offences that are outside their jurisdiction. Secondly, in case there is any confusion, it is not in the public interest for documents to be restricted to prevent the embarrassment of anyone whose job it is to act in the public interest, which is in favour of disclosure. The purpose of clause 13 is not to prevent embarrassment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary says that, but it begs the question: what is clause 28 for?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is simple.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it is simple, but clause 29 makes clause 28 otiose. I may be wrong, but anything that the Parliamentary Secretary wants to achieve in clause 28 would be satisfied by clause 29, which is draconian and wide-ranging. I seek your guidance, Dr. Clark, but it is difficult to test clause 28 without referring to clause 29 because of the way in which it interacts with clause 29. I realise that I may be stretching your tolerance too far.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think not. I am content for the hon. Gentleman to refer to clause 29, but only if he does not take too long. I believe that we shall reach the clause some time this week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I take the velvet rap on the knuckles. I did not feel that I was being long winded, but perhaps long-winded people always feel that way.
<P>
Clause 29 seems to make clause 28 redundant. Once we have reached clause 29, it will be difficult to refer back to clause 28 if I am not satisfied. Will the Minister explain why I am mistaken in thinking that subsections (1) and (2) of clause 29 especially make clause 28 redundant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I sense that the Parliamentary Secretary will have to respond again, so I wish only to make a point and to ask him a question. There is no problem with clause 28, although there may be one with clause 13 and with the powers of enforcement—we shall come on to the matter. I am satisfied that clause 13 is intended to deal with the difficulty.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central raised the Stephen Lawrence case. The police and Crown Prosecution Service may make a clear conscious decision not to prosecute in a case. Will the Parliamentary Secretary or the Under Secretary confirm that the interaction of the two clauses will not prevent the release to the victim of information—such as evidence and statements—that might assist the person in bringing a private prosecution? I think that he will say that clause 13, which contains the public interest test, should compel the police and prosecuting authorities to release information.
<P>
The Minister will be aware from his professional career that the CPS sometimes decides not to prosecute—in motoring offences involving a death, for instance. The police might decide not to prosecute in a case, but the victims or their families might wish to bring a private prosecution. The Committee should be assured that evidence and statements available to the police would be available to such people so that they may bring a prosecution.
<P>
The Government have clause 28 right, but I need more convincing that clause 13 and the enforcement mechanisms in clauses 48, 50 and 52 are strong enough to ensure that information will be released. That is the only matter outstanding, and I shall not detain the Committee further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> If the police conducted an investigation and it was decided not to prosecute a case, the information would be within the class exemption under clause 28. If an individual, especially a victim, applied for its release, the provisions of clause 13 would come into effect. It is impossible to speculate on the police's reaction because that would depend on the facts of the case.
<P>
I am speaking generally and without reference to any other exemption that might relate to information collected. If the information was personal, it might come within the Data Protection Act 1998; information provided in confidence might come under clause 39. Disclosure might be justified by the public interest in some cases. I cannot give carte blanche and say that, in every case, if the police decide not to prosecute, they will pass the statement on to the victim, because it will depend on each individual case. However, the hon. Gentleman is right in his analysis of the operation of the legislation. At that point, the public interest would come into effect, which, as we have seen in clause 13, stresses the interest in disclosure.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central asked why we need clause 28 at all. Clearly, there is some overlap between the two clauses, but it is right that the statutory bodies that are given specific duties to carry out investigations should be able to carry out those investigations and collect information in such a way that they can assure anyone who provides information that, in certain circumstances, it will be kept confidential, subject to the public interest test under clause 13. That is why it is a class exemption, as opposed to information under clause 29, which is a prejudice exemption. I cite in particular the example of information provided by informants, who might be highly reluctant to provide information, important though that information may be for the pursuit of criminals, if they knew that disclosure of the information was subject to a prejudice test, because they might fear that they would not be able to establish that prejudice. Clause 28 is focused on those bodies that have a duty to carry out their work, as opposed to bodies that merely happen to have information that could be used in criminal proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> We have had a discursive and useful debate. We shall have to consider carefully what the Ministry has said. I remain unclear about quite what the scope of the authorities is in terms of the numbers that might be covered. I refer again to the example of a health authority, which could uncover matters that might lead to prosecutions as a result of its duty to conduct investigations. I want to reinforce what the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said about the desirability of having some precision on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The right hon. Gentleman's point about health authorities is very potent. On behalf of a constituent, I am pursuing a case in which a woman feels that she has been sexually abused and that the inquiry by the health authority was wholly inadequate. The records are now lost and the woman's life has been destroyed. Not to be able to see the information about what happened is terrible.

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I hope not only that we will consider the points made by the Parliamentary Secretary, but that he will consider the points that we have raised. By mutual consent, perhaps, we might even think it appropriate to return to these issues at a later stage and not to consider them spent during this debate. With that aspiration, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 92, in page 15, leave out line 10 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) its disclosure under this Act would be likely to
<P>
(i) prejudice the obtaining of information from confidential sources, or
<P>
(ii) prejudice the safety of any individual who has (or who is associated with or related to an individual who has) provided information in confidence to a public authority for any such purpose'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary has just referred to this amendment in anticipation. Clause 28(2) contains a class exemption for all information relating to the obtaining of information from confidential sources. It applies not only to the police but to a wide range of bodies, some of which are referred to, from the Charity Commissioner to the Health and Safety Executive. The confidential sources involved are not just police informants but whistle-blowers of all kinds. The exemption does more than just protect the identity of confidential informants; it covers any information about the obtaining of information from informants, including administrative guidelines, such as those that deal with rewards offered to informants for information leading to arrests or the recovery of stolen property, or which describe whether our authority will guarantee anonymity to whistle-blowers.
<P>
The case for disclosing such information should be self-evident. Indeed, some potential whistle-blowers will not be prepared to come forward at all unless they are satisfied that such guidelines exist and are adequate. As it stands, the exemption might sometimes deter whistle-blowers from contacting public authorities. I suspect that the Parliamentary Secretary's intentions and mine on the desirability of containing information of that sort are probably the same. In an earlier allusion, he suggested that this amendment might have a contrary effect, so I look forward to hearing his arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The amendment relates to the protection that the Bill affords to informers. This is an important area, which is currently covered by the class exemption in clause 28 for information relating to the obtaining of information from confidential sources.
<P>
The amendment would, primarily, have the effect of removing this protection for such information and replacing it with a prejudice test. It would also introduce a prejudice test for information the disclosure of which could prejudice the safety of any individual, or the associate or relative of such an individual, who has provided information in confidence for any of the purposes outlined in subsection 2(a). I shall address that part of the provision later.
<P>
First let me deal with the proposal to lessen the protection afforded to this information by changing to a prejudice test. The Government's view is clear on this point. We believe that it is vital to retain the current class exemption for information relating to the obtaining of information from confidential sources. To subject such information to a prejudice test would not be a sufficient guarantee to those people who act as informants or witnesses—whether or not they are paid for their information—that such information will not be released into the public domain. The need to guarantee confidentiality in this area is vital, so we must provide sufficient protection for such information. We will not lessen protection in this area and must retain the class exemption.
<P>
I come now to the second issue raised by the right hon. Gentleman relating to a list of prices paid to informants by the police for certain types of information. That information, in the wrong hands, could have an undesirable effect. It is one thing for the police to pay specified and reliable informers a rate to provide information about which they can be confident, but it is another to publicise a tariff of prices for information that the police might be interested in receiving. That would publicise the fact that money could be made out of providing information to the police, whether that information were reliable or not. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman agrees that publishing a tariff would not be in the public interest.
<P>
The second limb of the amendment relates to the prejudice test for information which, if disclosed, could prejudice the safety of an individual, or associate or relative of that individual, who has provided information in confidence for one of the purposes that is outlined in clause 28(2)(a). We agree that such protection is necessary, and it is provided in clauses 28(2) and 36, which provides an exemption for information if its disclosure would or would be likely to endanger the safety of an individual. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman agrees that the second limb is unnecessary.
<P>
The amendment in the first instance would remove the vital protection for informers, which is unacceptable. In the second instance, it would provide protection for information that is protected elsewhere. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman is sufficiently reassured to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 15, leave out lines 12 and 13 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which is held for any of the purposes or functions set out in subsections (1) or (2) if, or to the extent that, compliance would or would be likely to prejudice any of those purposes or functions'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) allows an authority to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of information that falls within either of the class exemptions that precede it. They cover information that has been held at any time for the purpose of an investigation, and information that has been obtained from confidential sources. That could result in unnecessary secrecy. For example, the Health and Safety Executive would not have to disclose whether it had begun to investigate a fatal accident and a planning authority would not need to say whether it had received a complaint about an illegally erected structure, The amendment would allow an authority to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of information only if that would prejudice the functions that are set out in clause 28(1 ) and (2). I commend the importation of a harm test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The amendment would restrict the circumstances in which the obligation to confirm or deny does not arise to instances in which compliance would or would be likely to prejudice the purposes of the functions that are outlined subsections (1) and (2). The purposes of those functions relate to criminal investigations and proceedings. The Government take the view that it is better in the circumstances to provide a class exemption rather than a prejudice test, which we discussed in our debate on the previous amendment. Substituting the class exemption with a prejudice test could risk the effectiveness of the law enforcement agencies and undermine public confidence in criminal investigations and proceedings. Such information should not be available as a right.
<P>
The amendment would make it extremely difficult to persuade witnesses to provide information to investigations and proceedings if there was a possibility that such information could be disclosed under freedom of information legislation, which would include confirming or denying whether such information was held. The protection in the Bill for information that relates to investigations and proceedings must guard against the release of information that could identify a confidential source, disclose information that is provided in confidence or jeopardise a future investigation or proceeding. A class exclusion from the duty to confirm or deny does that and provides the desired certainty. For example, should there be a statement from a named witness in proceedings? It would be in the interests of the authority that is conducting the investigation to be able to say, ``We do not need to say whether we have a statement from a named witness or not.'' There could be good and varied reasons why that would be appropriate without subjecting it to a prejudice test.
<P>
However, a class exemption will not prevent the disclosure of information about criminal proceedings and those proceedings where it is in the public interest for such disclosure to be made. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that clause 13 continues to apply. The Information Commissioner will be able to recommend disclosure in such circumstances, but it is right that the final decision should be left to the police, the Crown Prosecution Service or other investigating authority because they will have the clearest idea about the impact of disclosure.
<P>
Let me also make it clear that general information about the conduct of investigations, as opposed to information that relates to particular investigations, is not covered by the class exemption. The commissioner can order the disclosure of such information if she—not the police or CPS—believes that disclosure would not prejudice law enforcement. It is right that we provide protection, but it would be weakened if, as a matter of course, it was part of the public authority's duties to identify the documents that were not to be disclosed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary's answer was predictable as, perhaps, was my argument. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 16, line 1, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any lawful measures taken, or proposed to be taken, for the purpose of'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is based on a wise and sensible amendment that was tabled to section 37(2) of the Australian Freedom of Information Act 1982 which was passed by the Senate. It, too, wanted to take the cautious approach of exempting law enforcement, but, at the same time, we must ensure that we do not exempt unlawful enforcement. Clause 29 does not distinguish between lawful and unlawful actions by law enforcement bodies. The amendment makes that distinction by specifying lawful actions.
<P>
It strikes me that information about unlawful actions, such as unlawful stop and search, the entrapment of a witness, illegal surveillance, acting without a warrant, fabrication of evidence, obtaining a confession under duress, or not observing due process in taking evidence in police custody will be exempt. That is surely not the Parliamentary Secretary's intention. We do not want to exempt actions by law enforcement bodies that are wrong and that might be criminal. The point is simple—the Australian senate spotted the important distinction and made corrections, and I would be grateful if the Minister took it seriously. I do not expect that he will have much difficulty with it.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for having raised this important issue. I have considerable sympathy with the intention behind the amendment. He is right—the Bill should not provide a shelter behind which public authorities, or individuals within authorities, might hide unlawful actions. However, the amendment would not have the intended effect and, as I shall explain, I fear that it might have several unhelpful consequences.
<P>
The amendment would restrict the application of the exemption to information that would prejudice lawful measures taken for specified purposes. However, the exemption is not concerned with measures taken. It is rightly concerned with the effect, or the likely effect, of disclosure on the matters specified and not with lawfulness. Even if the information requested did not relate to a measure that had been, or that was to be, taken, its disclosure might prejudice the specified matters. It would be artificial to search for a measure to be prejudiced rather than for the matter, such as prevention or detection of crime, itself.
<P>
The principle behind the amendment is just—no one wishes to see public authorities adopting unlawful measures. However, the amendment is based on the assumption that information may be neatly divided between that which prejudices lawful measures and that which prejudices unlawful measures. Authorities should not adopt unlawful measures, but the amendment would not be effective in exposing them if they did. Disclosure of information is highly likely to prejudice all measures taken in relation to the specified measures, whether the measures were lawful or unlawful. The authority, when asked, would simply point to the legitimate uses to which the information might be put and rely on the prejudice to them, rather than be required to focus on the pre-existent lawfulness or otherwise by which the information was collected.
<P>
If the amendment is intended to lead to the public disclosure of an unlawful act, it will be necessary to be clear about its consequences. It might become impossible subsequently to take action against an individual or authority because premature disclosure of information might prejudice the case. In such a case, the information should be disclosed not at large but to the relevant prosecuting or investigating authority.
<P>
It is not best to address the issue of the policing of the activities of public authorities in the Bill. However, the Bill does provide a mechanism for such issues to be exposed. An authority has to explain its reliance on the exemption to the applicant and the commissioner can test that. That can include the commissioner requiring the public authority to provide information to her to justify the reliance on the exemption. Clause 51 provides that power. Where it is relevant, the fact that the information could only relate to unlawful activity should come to light as a result of that process and can be taken account of by the commissioner in taking her decision. If the commissioner felt that it was in the public interest to make the information public, she could pass such information to relevant prosecuting or investigating authorities.
<P>
Clause 13 has a role too. If the public interest requires disclosure, clause 13 will ensure that that occurs. All the complex issues involved would have to be considered by the authority in making that decision. Again, the commissioner could require information from the authority to assess the basis on which the authority reached its decision that it was not in the public interest to disclose. It may be that the right decision would be to disclose evidence of unlawful acts to the police or other appropriate authority rather than to the applicant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's points, but the amendment is directed not at unlawful acts but at information gained by unlawful means. There is an important distinction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> There is certainly an important distinction, which has been the subject of lengthy litigation in several countries. My hon. Friend is right to focus on false imprisonment, if, for example, it is alleged that a confession taken from a suspect is extracted in circumstances which are not in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It could be suggested that that confession had been obtained in an unlawful manner, but the right forum in which to test it is the criminal courts in which the prosecution proceeds, and the evidence is adduced, rather than seeking to adjudicate within the context of a Freedom of Information Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Surely, if someone were following the line that the Minister suggests, he or she would need evidence, and it would be a circular problem: he or she would not be able to get at that evidence, which may have been achieved by unlawful means, because it would be covered by the exemption in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I appreciate my hon. Friend's point, but the answer is to focus on the disclosure provisions within the court proceedings, rather than try to solve the problem within freedom of information legislation. The disclosure provisions, public interest immunity and other issues that apply within disclosure and court proceedings, are the right means for extracting the information in suitable circumstances from the police, rather than a freedom of information regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Is that not an enormously cumbersome way to proceed? The only way in which information meant to be covered by the clause but deemed to be unlawful—extortion of information or evidence, for example—can be removed from the exemptions in the clause is by taking the matter to court. That is an expensive and wasteful procedure when, as I detected from the Parliamentary Secretary's initial remarks, he is not unsympathetic to the amendment. He could achieve his aim without people incurring the expense of going to court. It is often beyond people's means when what is involved may be a simple piece of information. I am happy to concede that the drafting of the amendment may not be precise, but if my hon. Friend is genuinely concerned about the distinction between unlawful and lawful means and does not want to taint all information that grows from unlawful means, perhaps he will table his own amendment, which would avoid the problems that seem to have been caused by my amendment. That would achieve both our aims.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I shall certainly reflect on my hon. Friend's observations. We agree that, as drafted, the amendment does not achieve his aim.
<P>
A further issue is that the disclosure of information, even if it has been obtained under situations that are a breach of the civil law, may, none the less, have serious effects on law enforcement. We must distinguish between the unlawfulness by which any information has been obtained, by which I mean a breach of the civil, as opposed to the criminal, law, and the damage that would be caused if that information were subsequently disclosed. That is subject to the prejudice test in clause 29 and ultimately to the public interest balance requirement in clause 13. I shall reflect on my hon. Friend's observations. Given the way in which the debate has progressed, and that there is common ground between us that my hon. Friend's amendment does not achieve his objective, I invite him to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> As a skilful lawyer, my hon. Friend has put words in my mouth. I said that I did not make any great claims for the amendment's drafting; I was not actually saying that it was wholly deficient. There was not entirely common ground between us. However, we understand each other. I understand from the Minister's final reply that he will ponder on the measure. In doing so, I hope that he will invite his officials to draft an amendment which achieves the aim that we both want: that information achieved by illegal means should not be treated in the same way as information achieved by legal means. It is not an easy matter, and the Minister made a nice point in his previous answer. However, it would be most unsatisfactory if the clause inadvertently protected information that had been achieved by illegal means, not just in the civil law, but in the criminal law.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee at this late hour, but I said during our debate on clause 28, when it was concluded that we were generally in agreement with the Government, that we were not happy about clause 29.
<P>
There are one or two points about clause 29 that are not easily amended by deletion. We concluded that, in the case of some of the class and content exemptions, it was better to express our anxieties in the clause stand part debates rather than by amendment, which could, if carried, destroy the purpose of some of the clauses.
<P>
Why, in clause 29, is it necessary to provide such a blanket exemption as that in subsection (1)(g), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the exercise by any public authority of its functions for any of the purposes specified in subsection (2)'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when, in subsection (2), we discover, among other things—this was a cause of concern to the hon. Members for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross—the purpose of ascertaining the cause of an accident. In the spirit of openness, I should have thought that any information related to the eventual conclusions of a public authority that had sought to ascertain the cause of an accident should be made public. I fail to understand why the Government seek to include that exemption.
<P>
Other purposes are listed. Paragraph (g) relates to charities. Paragraphs (i) and (j) provide:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(i) the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare of persons at work, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(j) the purpose of protecting persons other than persons at work against risk to health or safety arising out of or in connection with the actions of persons at work.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If those persons are in some way at risk, surely they should be told rather than their discovering that the clause provides a huge blanket exempt as a result of the weak prejudice test that we talked about this morning. We fully endorse the Government's attitude and opinion on the need for investigations and law enforcement generally, but we believe that the clause goes beyond what is reasonable and in the code. I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to reflect on the extent to which it is necessary if we are to achieve openness. This is a classic clause, containing an exemption for almost everything one could imagine.
<P>
Given our earlier debate, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept our concerns about the clause, and we might want to return to it on the Floor of the House in the light of what he says in reply.

<P>

<B>Mr Lock:</B> I shall be reasonably brief. I have been asked to reflect on the extent of the exemptions in subsection (2), and I will do so. However, under subsection (1) it is important to recognise that not all information relating to accidents is exempt. Only information that is likely to prejudice the exercise by that public authority of its function of ascertaining the cause of an accident is exempt. If a public authority generates documents while it is still in the process of ascertaining the cause of an accident, and if release of those documents at that stage would be likely to prejudice the inquiry into the accident, it must surely be right at that point—I stress that—for the authority to be able to complete its investigation without being required on a drip-feed basis to disclose every piece of information half completed while the investigation is continuing.
<P>
Lest it might be thought that an inquiry could continue for ever half completed, I point out that clause 29 is subject to the public interest balance test under clause 13, so that an applicant could seek disclosure of information even if the inquiry was only half completed. The clause covers only information that prejudices an inquiry, and it is subject to the public interest test. That is the justification for the wide exemptions in clause 29.
<P>
I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman and that he will allow clause 29 to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary said that he would reflect on the clause. I urge him to examine it. We, too, will reflect on what he said, and we do not seek to obstruct the inclusion of clause 29 at this stage.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful, Dr. Clark, for your guidance on what has been determined between the business managers.
<P>
This debate will, in some ways, bear a passing resemblance to the debates on the previous two clauses in that they are similar in content and relate to matters that, on first reading, are similar in nature. However, important distinctions can be drawn.
<P>
Clause 30 deals with court inquiry and tribunal records. Documentary evidence—documentary material associated with court inquiry and tribunal records—is increasingly important as we move from matters being progressed by oral argument in open court towards more emphasis being placed on case management, writ submissions and matters being progressed and determined otherwise. Alternative dispute resolution and arbitration play an increasing role, not to mention inquiries into issues of public importance and, indeed, into the conduct of Government in some instances. It is an area of concern that is growing rather than diminishing.
<P>
Amendment No. 94 would insert a prejudice test into the class exemptions in clause 30(1), which protects information contained in court or tribunal documents relating to particular proceedings. The exemption, as drafted, applies to such records held by a public authority, not to the records of courts or tribunals themselves. It includes, but is not limited to, proceedings to which the authority is a party. Only clause 30(1)(b) applies in that situation, so paragraphs (a) and (c) apply to court documents held by a public authority in other circumstances.
<P>
We are dealing with matters that are very often matters of public inquiry because they may relate to matters of public interest. Court proceedings include not only the proceedings of inquiries but post mortem details, which can often be of substantial importance in trying to deal with a pattern of events.
<P>
Amendment No. 94 would permit access to those documents so long as disclosure would not prejudice the proceedings in question. Separate exemptions would protect information if disclosure could prejudice the administration of justice or civil proceedings under paragraphs (c) and (h). Documents relating to criminal proceedings brought by the authority are covered by subsection (1). The clause introduces a prejudice test that would inform the decisions on exempt information of court proceedings held by another body.
<P>
One effect of the clause would be to allow access to documents such as military board of inquiry reports held by the Ministry of Defence, subject of course to the other provision in clause 24 that exempts information that would prejudice defence. At present board of inquiry reports into fatal accidents are available to the next of kin of the deceased, but not to anyone else. That has caused problems in some instances where an earlier accident may or may not have been caused by a similar problem. As the report is not available to those affected by the later incident, they cannot establish a pattern of events that would be of value to them in discovering the reason for the incident. There is no access to board of inquiry reports into non-fatal accidents.
<P>
Amendment No. 95 would again insert a prejudice test into the exemption in clause 32 that protects documents relating to a statutory inquiry, regardless of the effect of disclosure. It is curious that under the Bill as presently drafted even a final report would be exempt, despite the fact that it could not possibly prejudice proceedings. The Under-Secretary referred to that in his reply to the debate on clause 13 on 18 January. He clearly said that the provision would not apply to information exempt under clause 13. My right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross put to him as an example, board of inquiry reports into child abuse. He was happy to ignore that and simply dealt with the assertion that clause 13 covers court records to which the normal rules should apply. He said that if an applicant requires disclosure of information contained in court records, it is for the courts to determine what should be made available. He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``For that reason, if an authority is established that information falls into that class, there should be no reason for the authority to consider further whether to release it in the public interest. That is a matter for the courts''.—[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 18 January 2000; c.135.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is correct, up to a point, but it is a very narrow view of the scope of the provision. It does not apply only to courts and matters on which courts have decided to allow disclosure or otherwise. That is clear from the most perfunctory reading of the clause.
<P>
The amendment that we propose, introducing a prejudice test, is sensible in that context. The test would also apply in other areas and the Minister needs to persuade me that there is any reason why it should not apply here.
<P>
Amendment No. 96 makes the corresponding change to clause 30(3), which allows an authority to refuse to confirm or deny whether it holds a record relating to the proceedings of a court, tribunal or inquiry. We have just debated about why that provision should be in the Bill in a different context—it is a matter to which we continually refer—but I am at a loss to understand why an authority should refuse to acknowledge the existence of documents that it has received as the result of inquiries. What possible public interest could be served by a Government Department for instance, refusing to admit that it held such documents? We are talking about matters that are not currently under investigation, but are historic, in that decisions have been reached. I find it difficult to understand why that provision should be in the Bill, but no doubt the Minister will enlighten us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has set me a challenge and even at this late hour I will rise to it The amendments would remove the class exemption set out in the clause and replace it with one based on a prejudice test.
<P>
Essentially this is an issue of separation of powers. The courts control the documents that are before them and it is right that our judges should decide what should be disclosed. For example, we might consider the Paddington rail disaster in relation to the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act, which makes specific provision for a judge to conduct a public inquiry that is governed by the disclosure regime established under that Act, and for documents to be made public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Before the Parliamentary Secretary develops his argument, I should point out that clause 30 makes a blanket exemption, rather than identifying what information a court or tribunal should declare open for inspection. Surely the clause should make that distinction.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> With great respect, I am coming to that point.
<P>
Those who tabled the amendments have misunderstood the purpose of the exemption, which covers information held by a public authority only by virtue of it being contained in court records held by that authority. The clause will remove such information from the provisions of the Bill, which is why reference is made to the absence of a need to disclose whether information is held. Therefore, clause 13 does not apply to clause 30. Such information is removed from the regime of the Bill entirely. Should the courts and tribunals themselves be excluded, that provision is a necessary corollary, and forms part of the structure of the Bill.
<P>
Although the courts are not covered by the Bill, according to it court records may be held on a court's behalf by public authorities. Therefore, the Court Service, which is an executive agency of the Lord Chancellor's Department, holds some Crown court records. Magistrates courts committees hold records on behalf of magistrates courts. Statutory inquiries have a status similar to courts, and their records are usually held by the department that established the inquiry.
<P>
The clause therefore ensures that the courts can continue to determine what information is to be disclosed, and that such matters are decided by the courts and fall within their jurisdiction, rather than the jurisdiction of this legislation. Of course, it is not to be assumed that such information will not be disclosed merely because the Bill will not require it to be disclosed. Such information is controlled by the courts, which constitute a separate regime. The courts have their own rules, and they will decide if and when court records are to be disclosed. The Government do not believe that the Freedom of Information Bill should circumvent the power of courts to determine their disclosure policy. The issue is the separation of powers, and the jurisdiction to determine the information that courts should provide will be left to the courts themselves. In a court case, it is for judges and courts to determine when it is appropriate for court records to be disclosed.

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I entirely understand the point that the Parliamentary Secretary makes about the separation of powers and the prerogative of a court. However, as it is phrased, the clause will not provide for the circumstances he describes. It will allow an authority to apply a class exemption to material derived from judicial or other proceedings, irrespective of the decision of a court or tribunal on whether that material may be released. No signpost is provided for a member of the public who seeks information from an authority that decides that it cannot release a document until a judge or a chairman of an inquiry permits, because it is their prerogative.
<P>
There are gaps in the terminology of the clause, which does not allow for the entirely proper circumstances in which an authority might act in accordance with the terms established by a court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, that is the point. If there are documents under the control of the court, whether they are held by the court or by the Court Service on behalf of the court, the jurisdiction for the release of those documents lies with the court. If, under the court rules, they can be disclosed, the Court Service can disclose them. If, under those rules, they can be disclosed only with the authority of a judge, it is up to the applicant to apply not to the Information Commissioner under this regime, but to the judge who has jurisdiction over those records. That is why there is a class exemption as opposed to a prejudice test for the purpose of the Bill. I hope that that clarifies the matter, and, if so, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am far from satisfied with the explanation that I have received. I understand the initial point that the Minister made, but I do not understand why the clause is phrased as it is. It is far too wide an exemption, applied to areas that are not, strictly speaking, the province of courts of law but of commissions of inquiry set up under other legislation. There are many occasions on which information derived from such a source, held by a public authority, ought to be available and no obstacle to its availability exists. However, a member of the public applying for that information will not even be told whether it is being held by the authority. The terms in the clause are far too widely drawn, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> We have not tabled amendments to this clause, but I would like some explanation from the Minister before we proceed.
<P>
As a former commissioner of the Audit Commission, I would be foolish not to understand the principle behind clause 31 (1)(a), on the matter of audit. I assume that that provision will apply not only to the Audit Commission, but to bodies such as the Housing Corporation. It is more difficult to come to terms with the definition in paragraph (b), which covers public authorities with functions relating to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which other public authorities discharge their functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That covers a much wider group of public bodies that are so charged. Will the Minister tell us which bodies encompassed by the provision are not auditing bodies as such, but bodies dealing with the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of other bodies? Would the provision cover bodies such as Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary, the fire brigades and the Prison Service? Would it cover the social services inspectorate? Would it cover the Housing Corporation? If so, it would encompass a substantial number of types of public authority, some of which may not properly fall within such a blanket exemption. If the Minister cannot give me a reasonable range of examples now, perhaps he will write to me in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that I may supplement this brief answer in writing, and I shall do so. He is right that the wide range of bodies that carry out inquiries into the effectiveness of public bodies such as the magistrates courts inspectorate and the social services inspectorate are within the intended purview of the clause. While they are carrying out their inquiries, it would be inappropriate for documents generated within the inquiry to be made available to the public on a drip-feed basis. Secondly, many of those bodies will find that, under different statutory regimes, their reports will be made public when they have been concluded. Thirdly, the provision is subject to the public interest test in clause 13, so it is not the case that information or documents generated within inquiries will never see the light of day. They may do so, depending on whether the public interest is served at the time the applicant makes the inquiry.
<P>
If necessary, I shall supplement that brief answer in writing and I hope that, with that assurance, the hon. Gentleman will allow us to proceed and allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful reply.

Question put and agreed to.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Shona McIsaac </B>(Cleethorpes): Bearing in mind your earlier comments on breaking for dinner, Dr. Clark, I shall be brief.
<P>
I welcome the exemption for parliamentary privilege. As a member of the Standards and Privileges Committee, I believe that that is essential for the good working of the Committee. Will the Minister tell us, either now or later, what impact the legislation will have on investigations being conducted by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Until she has reported to our Committee, the documents would not be covered by parliamentary privilege. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the position concerning those investigations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> In view of the hour, the technical nature of the question and our desire to ensure that issues concerning the Parliamentary Commission are completely right, I take up my hon. Friend's kind offer to write to her with clarification. I shall, of course, circulate that reply to all members of the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
