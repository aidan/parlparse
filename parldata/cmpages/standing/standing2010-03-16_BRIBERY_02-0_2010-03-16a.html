<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000459"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Claire
Ward):</b> It is a great pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Ms Walley. I believe that this is your first sitting as
Chair of a Public Bill Committee, so congratulations. I hope that we
can make it an interesting and enjoyable experience for
you.</div><a name="100316113000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
the lunch break, we were discussing amendment 11 in relation to the
clause 6 offence of bribing a foreign public official. I explained
that, although the Law Commission originally proposed a defence similar
to that proposed by the amendment, we carefully considered
representations and took the view that it was important that companies
engaging in activities overseas should not be able to rely on a defence
of ignorance of the law. That would not be acceptable. In the
exceptional case of a genuine mistake where an individual in unfamiliar
surroundings was faced with plausible demands that in fact amounted to
a low-level bribe, it would be for prosecutors to decide whether it was
in the public interest to pursue a
prosecution.</div><a name="100316113000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
offence is intended to send a powerful message that those involved in
international business should think twice before offering, promising or
giving payments or other advantages to foreign public officials. The
introduction of a reasonable belief defence would detract from that
powerful message and undermine the policy aims of the offence to combat
foreign bribery. The Joint 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>Committee agreed with the Government&#146;s decision to reject the
reasonable belief defence and commented that the proposed
offence</div>
<a name="100316113000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;represents an
important step in putting the United Kingdom&#146;s compliance with
its international obligations beyond
doubt.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also like to clarify some of the other issues raised during this
morning&#146;s debate. The hon. Member for Huntingdon asked why we
are not following the preferences expressed by the Director of Public
Prosecutions in his evidence to the Joint Committee. Of course, we
value the views of the DPP, as we do those of all stakeholders and
parties that are interested in the issue. We took those views into
account and considered them carefully, but we have to achieve a balance
and make a judgment. In doing so, we believe that we have come to the
right conclusion. That does not mean, however, that we do not value the
contributions that have been made to the
debate.</div><a name="100316113000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was also asked about the publication of guidance. For clarification, I
assure the Committee and the hon. Gentleman that, as is usual practice,
we will make guidance available on the Bill&#146;s contents as part
of an explanatory circular, which will cover the clause 6 offence, as
well as other aspects of the Bill. The guidance to which clause 9
refers relates to the offence under clause 7 and the procedures that
commercial organisations can put in place to prevent bribery by persons
associated with them. That guidance will therefore touch on the offence
in clause 6 only to the extent that it is relevant to the commission of
an offence under clause 7 and the procedures that a commercial
organisation can put in place to prevent bribery by those associated
with
it.</div><a name="100316113000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="100316113000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100316113000460"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): First, I wish to
address the remarks, which I slightly blurringly remember, of the hon.
Member for Cambridge. His core point was that, in practice, the
amendment is not a problem in so far as it will not hinder a
prosecution. To that extent I agree that it is not a problem to mount
the prosecution. The clause is very clearly drafted and there will be
very little wriggle room; I am not disputing that. The concern is
whether it will be applied in a way that will stop business operating.
I was grateful to hear from the Under-Secretary that the clarification
of the guidance will accompany clause 6.</div>
<a name="100316113000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100316113000461"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I think I now remember what my
point was. It was actually in the opposite direction; the situation
where a company or person accused of bribery is said to have got the
foreign law wrong, which I think was the case that the hon. Gentleman
was raising. The issue then is: under what conditions is that
organisation or person guilty of bribery? My point was simply this: it
would be for the prosecution to prove what the foreign law was, as a
fact. The burden of proof would be on the prosecution to prove beyond
reasonable doubt that the foreign law was not as the defendant thought
it was. That is the reason why I thought that many of the problems that
he raised would not be problems for the defendant, so much as problems
for the prosecution.</div>
<a name="100316113000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000462"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that
clarification. We discussed that this morning, certainly to the extent
that the company seeking the advice 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>receives advice overseas on the written law of that country. The concern
is that if that advice is wrong, they still may be liable for
prosecution. That is the potential issue and concern.</div>
<a name="100316113000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary spoke about the amendment undermining the policy aims
of the Bill. That is a pretty broad-brush statement and I do not think
that that can necessarily be applied. As to where we have reached on
this for the moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="100316113000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="100316113000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="100316113000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100316113000463"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): I just
wanted to mention the CBI position. The CBI briefing to the Committee
expressed concerns about clause 6 generally. Of course, it is right to
have proper protection against bribery, corruption and extortion. It is
in the British interest, as a law-abiding country and law-abiding
trader, to have that situation. It is a bad thing for Britain if other
countries are able to bribe officials or act in an improper way when we
are trying to trade ethically.</div>
<a name="100316113000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
briefing, the CBI says that it strongly supports the
Government&#146;s objectives, as I do. It is important to recollect
that as long ago as 1995, the Committee on Standards in Public Life
said that it was important to codify our law in the field of corruption
and bribery, and that that is a reputational issue for the UK. However,
it is also important to take account of the concerns of one of our
major large business organisations, when it says that it is very
concerned that legitimate business promotional expenditure and
proportionate use of corporate hospitality will be caught by clause 6,
because the offence does not adequately incorporate a concept of
dishonesty or impropriety.</div>
<a name="100316113000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
useful to hear the Under-Secretary&#146;s thoughts on the
CBI&#146;s concerns. The CBI went on to raise the idea that the
notion of corruption and dishonesty or impropriety is something that is
recognised internationally. It is a mistake for a new offence of this
sort, involving the bribery of foreign public officials, not to have
that concept at its centre. The Law Commission and the Joint Committee
have produced a workable draft Bill, but the point discussed this
morning is important and the CBI&#146;s concern needs to be
addressed.</div>
<a name="100316113000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CBI
says:</div>
<a name="100316113000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
cannot be fair to criminalise honest company behaviour. A response that
relies on prosecutorial
discretion&#148;</div><a name="100316113000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
not adequate. It makes the point that there are
implications:</div><a name="100316113000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Businesses
either have to commit to no promotional expenditure, which is clearly
unsustainable, or openly condone criminal acts by their
staff.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
do not want to be in that position. The CBI says that any proper
promotional expenditure should be made without the fear that it would
only be proper under prosecutorial discretion. It raises the question
of section 328 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.</div>
<a name="100316113000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested to see whether the Minister wants to comment more generally
about the clause, as it is worth responding when a large business
organisation raises such concerns.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="100316113000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000464"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I received the same briefing as the hon.
Gentleman but did not follow his point about section 328 of the
Proceeds of Crime Act. That is a very difficult Act to construe. That
section is about money-laundering. My understanding is that the
underlying offences have to be shown; that there cannot be a
money-laundering requirement or offence where there is no underlying
offence for the proceeds provisions to latch on to.</div>
<a name="100316113000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In general,
in the proceeds of crime area, it is only in a situation where somebody
thinks someone else is doing something bad that he or she has to make a
submission to the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The concern raised by
the CBI does not seem to be in line with my understanding of how the
system works. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman understands it better than I
do.</div>
<a name="100316113000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000465"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I would not be so outrageously arrogant as to make
that suggestion. I did not read the sentence fully. I thought a little
shorthand was probably adequate for the hon. Gentleman, given his
detailed knowledge of the law. The point that I and the CBI have been
making is that</div>
<a name="100316113000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any proper
promotional expenditure would, irrespective of the prosecutorial
discretion under the Bill, be a breach of section 328, unless companies
obtain
consent&#148;</div><a name="100316113000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
make each payment from SOCA. The CBI believes that is an unworkable
proposition.</div><a name="100316113000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000466"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is what I do not understand, because I do
not think it is a breach of section 328, unless it is already illegal
in some other way. That was the point I was trying to
make.</div><a name="100316113000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000467"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The offence is clear and there are good reasons why
we have incorporated it into the proposed legislation. We believe that
it sends a strong message about what is acceptable conduct. It requires
the prosecution to prove that the person offering the advantage
intended to influence the official in his or her official capacity, and
intended to obtain or retain business or an advantage in the conduct of
business.</div>
<a name="100316113000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The offence
is deliberately structured so that, where an advantage is offered, it
will only fall outside the offence where the public official is
permitted or required by the written law applicable to the official to
be influenced by the advantage. That avoids any question of what is
customary in the foreign jurisdiction concerned. Where any doubt
exists, prosecutorial discretion will remain an important safeguard
against legitimate activities being penalised.</div>
<a name="100316113000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000468"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> North-East
Hertfordshire.</div><a name="100316113000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000469"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I should know that well but always get the precise
description wrong. I know the areas it covers, though. The hon. Member
for North-East Hertfordshire raises the concerns of the CBI. The CBI is
one of the organisations with which we have had ongoing discussions
about the Bill. We continue to have discussions to ensure that in
practice businesses are able to comply in due course with the offences
under the proposed legislation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="100316113000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raises the prospect of promotional expenditure or other forms
of hospitality being caught under clause 6. We all know that for many
companies, promotional expenditure is an important part of modern
business practice, and the Government do not seek to restrict
appropriate expenditure of that kind. Whether promotional expenditure
will amount to an offence under the clause will depend on the
facts.</div>
<a name="100316113000428"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="100316113000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is possible that clause 6 would catch some promotional expenditure.
When such expenditure is designed to explain, and to inform potential
buyers about, a commercial organisation&#146;s products, it would not
necessarily involve the transfer of any advantages as mentioned in
clause 6. However, if benefits that might be regarded as hospitality
were included within promotional expenditure, such expenditure could be
an offence under the clause if the local law did not expressly permit
or require the receipt of such benefits by officials. Whether such a
case would proceed would be a matter of prosecutorial
discretion.</div>
<a name="100316113000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that in marginal cases of bribery such as those that I have outlined,
prosecutors would try to provide the right balance when determining
whether it would be in the public interest to proceed with a
prosecution. It is not our intention to drag a series of companies
through the courts on the basis of promotional expenditure that does
not seek simply to bribe a public official.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000470"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Suppose that a company is trying to break into a
new market in a country that is perhaps not brilliantly familiar to
Britain, or vice versa&#151;it is good to encourage businesses to do
that but it is not easy to achieve. If the product being sold was
something uniquely British that we would understand fully but that
would not be understood elsewhere, the business might want to bring an
official of a company, and perhaps a local planning official, over to
this country to see what its plant looks like and what it produces for
the purpose of information. In the process, the officials might visit
London and perhaps take in a show. In such circumstances, would that be
a bribe?</div>
<a name="100316113000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000471"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> We would have to look at the extent of the
hospitality and the purpose for which the business was undertaking
those activities. The prosecutors would consider the facts to determine
whether to proceed with a prosecution. Providing information about a
business and promoting it to ensure that it has the opportunity to
compete on equal terms with other businesses is different from
providing a foreign public official, his family and various others with
a five-star holiday and other additional benefits not specifically
related to the promotional work of the business. The case would be
about the facts, and then it would be for the prosecution to determine
whether it was in the public interest to proceed with
prosecution.</div>
<a name="100316113000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000472"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Under-Secretary&#146;s reply has sparked
my memory of our exchanges on facilitation payments during which, if I
recall rightly, she questioned me about whether any facilitation
payment whatsoever was bribery. It was suggested that the fact that I
could see certain circumstances in which there should be an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>exception&#151;as has arisen in the United States&#151;was basically
outside the remit of the Bill, and she was somewhat on her high horse
on the matter. Given her comments about hospitality, it seems to me
that slipping a small note into a passport as a facilitation payment
would be out of the question but that&#151;depending on the
circumstances, as she said&#151;taking in a show in London might be
acceptable. That not entirely consistent approach makes me think that
there is something more to this than what she has been
saying.</div>
<a name="100316113000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000473"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> In general I welcome the Bill and think that it is
well structured, but it seems to drag in some low-level activity and
elements of business practice that one would not traditionally have
described as corruption or bribery, such as showing the client the
product, where it is made and perhaps including some hospitality. That
is, I would have thought, fairly normal business practice when trying
to break into a new market overseas. If someone working for a company
is worrying all the time that if they bring people over to show them
the product and the plant and then go out for a meal, they might be in
trouble with the Minister and perhaps be prosecuted, it will cause them
to pause for
thought.</div><a name="100316113000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clearly a good thing for serious incidents to be dealt with by the
courts, and it is good that we have a new Bill, but I am worried that
low-level activity that would not normally be thought to be criminal in
any way will be criminalised. The CBI is also worried, and I normally
take it seriously because it is the big business organisation. I hope
that the Minister will think again. If we are going to have an
export-led recovery, is this approach
wise?</div><a name="100316113000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100316113000474"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): In the example that my hon.
Friend cited, showing people a company&#146;s wares would be sensible
business. If those people happened to see part of British culture too,
I do not think that there would be a problem. However, as the onus is
on the prosecution authorities, if I were a French company and knew
that my competitor had brought three people over to look at its plant,
I would simply write to the prosecutors and say that the competitor was
being corrupt. Some companies are willing to do such things when they
are in competition. One or two of our airlines have had some quite
vicious fights. The problem is the focus on the prosecuting
authorities. We might get complaints that are an attempt to disrupt
business.</div><a name="100316113000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000475"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I had not thought that there might be a vindictive
competitor, but I suppose that is possible. The alternative danger is
that the French operator decides that it will do even better and takes
those people to the south of France, and then we get into heavy
expenditure. It is important that there are limits but, at the same
time, I worry about the way in which the proposal is
pitched.</div><a name="100316113000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
this morning&#146;s sitting, we examined provisions that contained
nothing about behaviour being corruption or bribery in terms of intent,
and now we are looking at a provision that has implications for exports
when we want to stop bribery and corruption, but we do not want to stop
legitimate business expenditure on the promotion of
products.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div><a name="100316113000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100316113000476"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): During the late &#146;90s I did a
lot of work alongside UK Trade &amp; Investment and its predecessor
organisations to encourage exports, particularly to the newly opening
central and eastern European countries from where very few people had
come to the UK. It was the advice of successive Governments that when
people were brought over to look at the product, that should also be an
opportunity for them to see the UK and get a feeling for British
culture. That was sound advice because of the impact of the practice on
promoting UK plc. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Bill will put at
risk precisely that sort of good
advice?</div><a name="100316113000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000477"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Yes. Part of the sales pitch for those missions,
which were often led by Ministers, was saying, &#147;If you
don&#146;t understand how this service or product operates, come and
have a look.&#148; People would then come here. I believe that that
still happens, and I would not be at all surprised if Ministers in the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office were giving the same advice at this very moment.
However, the CBI, which is the business organisation that should be
seen as very important to the whole process, is saying, &#147;Yes,
but you&#146;re making promotional activities difficult for
us.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100316113000478"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
agree that another difficulty&#151;perhaps it is a two-fold
difficulty&#151;is that our embassies provide a great deal of
hospitality and also support the activities of businessmen in
attracting trade to the UK, as do our armed forces. For example, there
are often cocktail parties on the decks of navel ships. Such issues are
worth considering in this context.</div>
<a name="100316113000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000479"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Of course UK plc, as it is called, goes into bat to
get our products sold internationally. It carries out its promotion
legitimately, but that involves expenditure and, from time to time, not
only company officials but Government officials. In a lot of countries,
the view of the local official determines whether somebody is allowed
to build a factory and make products, or even to import a quantity of
material. In some countries, it might even be a political party figure,
as the local official and the party representative, who decides what
imports may take
place.</div><a name="100316113000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is easy to see that persuading a client that a company has a good
product and showing them how it works involves promotional expense and
exposure to officials. We want an assurance from the Under-Secretary
that people carrying out such activities will not fall foul of the law.
It should not be just a matter of begging the prosecutor not to
prosecute. If people behave legitimately, the fact that they are not
guilty should be a right. If the Under-Secretary cannot give that
assurance, and it is simply a matter of saying, &#147;Oh well, I hope
that the head of the British Transport Police, a prosecutions
department, the Director of Public Prosecutions or a Crown prosecutor
in some place will let me off,&#148; I do not think that our business
men will be reassured.</div>

Peter Kilfoyle</b> (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab): I am sure that
we are all extremely pleased to hear Her Majesty&#146;s loyal

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000482"></a>Mr.
Kilfoyle:</b> I have not got to my point yet. I was
particularly taken with the Under-Secretary&#146;s comment that she
had consulted the CBI. Obviously, we are all gratified that there is
such a doughty defender of civil and human rights in this country,
never mind elsewhere. During her consultations, did she consult SOCA to
determine its view on the Bill, and especially on clause
6?</div>
<a name="100316113000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000483"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> May I take this opportunity to welcome you to the
Chair, Ms
Walley?</div><a name="100316113000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall simple raise one issue that is, I think, relevant to clause 6. It
has been raised many times by the Under-Secretary in response to points
made by Conservative Members and to amendments tabled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Huntingdon. The issue is prosecutorial discretion, and
it will arise regularly, especially when we are dealing with the
bribery of foreign and public officials, so it is sensible to explore
it a little
now.</div><a name="100316113000429"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="100316113000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
things concern me. First, I am concerned about clarity. As other hon.
Members on the Committee have observed, we are creating new law, which,
in some ways, is radical. Business and industry in this country will
have to get used to it very quickly or find themselves with the
possibility of a criminal conviction. The one thing I am sure business
and industry will require of us is a good deal of clarity regarding
what law they are expected to comply with. We will go on, of course, to
talk about guidance. The Minister has already referred to that, and it
will be a large part, one hopes, of the clarity that they will seek.
However, what undermines clarity is the suggestion that the answer to
every potential problem with the Bill is that there is no need to worry
because the prosecutors have a discretion and might decide not to
prosecute at all.</div>
<a name="100316113000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
business people in this country will legitimately be concerned,
thinking &#147;That&#146;s all very well, but how do I know whether
they will exercise discretion in my favour before I decide to do
whatever I decide to do?&#148; That is why we, as best practice, seek
good, sensible, clear laws, whenever they can be
made.</div><a name="100316113000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000484"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> I was on the Finance Bill Committee, and Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has a system by which if some kind
of tax avoidance scheme is wanted it is possible to explain what it is,
and it either approves it in advance or does not approve it. Clearly,
if a company is doing business and wants to entertain, or bring people
in for training, or whatever, there should, if one is to go down the
route in question, be a way to ask whether that is appropriate or not.
We all know that there are some grey areas, but that is the problem. If
it is a matter for the prosecuting authorities, will it be necessary to
write to the Director of Public Prosecutions every time a company wants
to bring people in and entertain them in some modest
way?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div><a name="100316113000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000485"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> My hon. Friend makes a reasonable point. We can go
further than that, in fact. The situation will undoubtedly arise in
which people with a huge variety of businesses and types of business
interest, and who do business in different parts of the world, will
want such advice. They may also, while we are about it, seek advice
from the same source as to what exactly the local law is in the places
in question&#151;dealing with the point that was raised earlier. I
think that that is a sensible
argument.</div><a name="100316113000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point that worries me is linked to the first, and it concerns
consistency. If there is to be wide prosecutorial discretion there is a
danger that different decisions made in different cases will not give a
clear and consistent idea of law enforcement in this context. It is
important that if we are to give British industry the necessary
signal&#151;the signal that the Under-Secretary has today clearly
outlined, with which the entire Committee agrees: that this country
does not tolerate bribery and that those who engage in it will be
properly punished&#151;there must be not only clarity but consistency
in the minds of all the relevant businesses about what will happen to
them if they engage in certain activities. If, as I have said, the
Under-Secretary&#146;s answer to every proposed defence or
clarification on the part of my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon,
is &#147;You don&#146;t need to worry, because the prosecutors have
discretion,&#148; we shall not necessarily get
consistency.</div><a name="100316113000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third point is my response to the Under-Secretary&#146;s argument
about setting an example not just for British industry but globally.
She has referred to the Bill as a global gold standard, and I am sure
that we would all want that. The danger is that we tend to undermine
the gold standard if there is a good deal more flexibility in the
implementation of the law than appears from the statute. If, again, the
answer to every question seeking clarification and every question about
defences is, &#147;You don&#146;t need to worry because the
prosecutor has a discretion,&#148; how does that look to those to
whom we say, the Bill is a global gold standard?</div>
<a name="100316113000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer
is that there is a danger that people elsewhere in the world&#151;the
OECD and others&#151;will say, &#147;I understand the
Government&#146;s intent; they have spoken many fine words about
bribery and the law looks good, but it seems from listening to the
Under-Secretary in Committee that there is an awful lot of wriggle
room, because prosecutors might be able to say in any given case,
&#145;We have a discretion and perhaps on this occasion we will
choose not to
prosecute.&#146;</div><a name="100316113000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
moral authority that we have as a result of talking about a global gold
standard, as we should all want to do, is somewhat undermined if we do
not have clarity, consistency and an absence of wriggle room; that will
undermine the principle. That is the danger we need to consider, and I
raise it because a pattern seems to be emerging. The Under-Secretary
responds in the way I have described to all our amendments. This is a
live issue for the stand part debate and I hope she can deal with the
point directly.</div>
<a name="100316113000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000486"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Listening to my hon. Friends and to the
Under-Secretary&#146;s remarks so far, I am starting to wonder how
apprised she is of the needs of business in the context of the
Bill&#151;and perhaps in other contexts. Although everyone wants to
stamp out bribery, I acknowledge the rather poor attempt we have been
making at it over recent years. However, the rationale of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>a Justice Minister is, of course, slightly different from that of, for
example, a BIS Minister. Given some of the Under-Secretary&#146;s
comments, I am not sure how absolutely aware she is of the realities of
international business. The days when I expected any joined-up thinking
from the current Administration are long gone, but will she explain to
what extent she has discussed these clauses, the Bill generally and the
CBI&#146;s concerns, as expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire, with her colleagues in
BIS?</div><a name="100316113000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000487"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> How interesting! One moment we hear the Opposition
call for flexibility in legislation to make sure that we respond to the
needs of businesses, and in the next breath they are telling us that we
cannot afford to have any wriggle room. It will be interesting to see
where we get to with this
debate.</div><a name="100316113000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000488"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Will the Under-Secretary give
way?</div><a name="100316113000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000489"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Perhaps I can proceed a little further first. The
reality is that the clause needs to be put into context. First, the
measure concerns foreign public officials and relates to where such
officials are involved. Bringing other companies from other parts of
the world over is not appropriate or important in this respect; it
relates to the transfer of an advantage to the individual. That may not
be the case if we are talking simply about promotional expenditure and
whether that foreign public official is getting an advantage as a
result of promotional expenditure. Perhaps where hospitality is
involved and the local law does not permit it, the prosecuting
authorities are quite capable of distinguishing between what is
excessive conduct and what is routine.</div>
<a name="100316113000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
supported across government and has the support of my colleagues in
BIS. They have attended events, meetings and discussions with business
as part of the discussion on the Bill and the clauses. They are well
aware of the implications of the clauses and we make absolutely no
apology for setting a high standard&#151;a gold standard. We are
sending out a very strong message to businesses that bribery is not
acceptable in this country and it is certainly not acceptable in
respect of foreign officials.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000490"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Based on what the Under-Secretary has just said
and her somewhat over-broad opening statement, there is a fundamental
misunderstanding. There is a difference between applying the needs of
business and being willing to listen and be flexible when the law is
being drawn up, and doing so once the law is in existence. When the law
is in existence, what business needs above all else is clarity, so that
those involved know where they stand. It is not an answer to the
question of whether the needs of business have been thought about to
say, &#147;We will think about the needs of business at the level of
prosecutorial discretion.&#148; That is the point we have been
making, and that is what the Under-Secretary needs to
address.</div>
<a name="100316113000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000491"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I am already saying to the hon. Gentleman and his
colleagues that business is not an after-thought in this matter.
Business has been involved in the discussions on the Bill for a
considerable time, and it continues to be part of our discussions,
particularly in respect of guidance for clause 7. We welcome the
opportunity to discuss the measure with business. There are already a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>whole range of appropriate guidance and standard procedures in place
within companies, because they deal with international business. Those
companies operate effectively and appropriately. Of course, we
recognise that hospitality can and sometimes does form a very important
part of international businesses. However, it is clear that there are
circumstances in which such expenditure could amount to a bribe, if it
is excessive and designed to influence the foreign public official,
irrespective of the merits of what might be the company&#146;s
promotional expenditure. On that basis, it is appropriate that the
prosecuting authorities should have an opportunity to consider such
matters.</div>
<a name="100316113000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000492"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Obviously, the purpose of a promotional activity,
such as bringing a foreign official who will have a say in whether the
contract is awarded to a company to see the plant and the product, is
to influence his decision, but it is not an improper motive. A lot of
what will be done will be to show him the reality of the product and
the plant. There is no element of corrupt intent. However, there is a
worry that in such a situation the company might be
prosecuted.</div><a name="100316113000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
does the Under-Secretary accept the proposition that often in
business&#151;exporting and so on&#151;it is necessary to talk to
officials as well as companies to get the requisite permissions to
export? Secondly, does she accept that it is proper to show the
official, if necessary, the details of how the business works here,
although the expenditure involved in bringing the official to Britain
would arguably be to his advantage&#151;he may never have visited
before&#151;and the visit is designed to influence him by showing him
what the real product is like and educating him about it, and so
on?</div><a name="100316113000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000493"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. This is a long intervention; I hope it is
coming to an end
shortly.</div><a name="100316113000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000494"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> It is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000495"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I think I understand the point the hon. Gentleman is
trying to make, but I do not see the advantage to the foreign public
official in those circumstances. As the hon. Gentleman describes it,
the company is promoting its business in respect of a potential
contract. The offence is in respect of the foreign public official. I
am not clear where he thinks the advantage to the foreign public
official might
be.</div><a name="100316113000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000496"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> If he is brought here and put up in a hotel while
visiting the plant and the various products, for
example.</div><a name="100316113000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000497"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> It then becomes a matter of degree, surely. It is a
question of the foreign public official seeing the circumstances in
which the business operates as a legitimate business activity, as
distinct from an opportunity for the foreign public official to have a
three-week stay in a five-star hotel with his family. The hon.
Gentleman may be alluding to a distinction between the two sets of
circumstances. That is the point at which the prosecuting authorities
will consider what the intention was behind what people were trying to
do, and what they were seeking to achieve.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="100316113000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000498"></a>David
Howarth:</b> For the hon. Gentleman&#146;s scenario to work,
the foreign official has to be in a position where they are neither
permitted nor required to go on such trips or to accept hospitality.
The hon. Gentleman is piling unlikelihood on
unlikelihood.</div><a name="100316113000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000499"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Hence our saying that we set a high standard for
business. We make it clear that it is for businesses to consider what
they are doing and whether such activities would amount to bribery of a
foreign public official. We set that high standard because it is
appropriate to do so to send a clear message that it is not
acceptable for bribery to take place around the world or in this
country, as mentioned under other
clauses.</div><a name="100316113000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
most cases, businesses have more sense than the hon. Member for
North-East Hertfordshire suggests they might have in respect of
understanding the difference between providing promotional activities
and information in the course of their business, and seeking to bribe a
foreign public
official.</div><a name="100316113000430"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000500"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I understand that the Under-Secretary is saying,
&#147;You, Heald of North-East Hertfordshire, have come up with this
idea.&#148; If that were so, it would be a fair point. But I am not
saying that: the CBI, which represents the big businesses of Britain,
is saying that, and it is concerned. The hon. Member for Cambridge
might be right to say that companies do enough research to be
absolutely clear about what a foreign official can do when making
overseas visits, but it concerns me that the CBI is worried that
legitimate business promotion expenditure could be
caught.</div><a name="100316113000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000501"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The CBI is perfectly entitled to express concerns on
behalf of its members. We seek to explain circumstances in which there
might be an issue but, ultimately, the Bill cannot provide every type
and detail of corporate hospitality or promotional expenditure that
would fall one side of the line or the other. The matter is one for
prosecutorial discretion. I expect that businesses are more than
capable of determining what is appropriate behaviour to ensure that
they are not engaging in
bribery.</div><a name="100316113000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000502"></a>Mr.

&#147;adequate&#148; as &#147;satisfactory or acceptable&#148;.
The first recourse of business owners or legal practitioners when
putting in place or accessing anti-bribery guidelines will be the plain
English meaning of the words chosen by Parliament when drafting the
Bill. As it stands, I must confess, that I am not sure about a
formulation that requires such guidelines to be only satisfactory or
acceptable.</div><a name="100316113000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
a definition gives rise to inherent inconsistencies or concerns. First,
to whom are the guidelines satisfactory or acceptable? If a commercial
entity has to rely on the subsection as a defence against alleged
bribery, surely the measures in place to prevent bribery could not have
been adequate. If the measures had been adequate, the bribery would not
have occurred in the first
place.</div><a name="100316113000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Henley, in the other place, summarised the problem quite
well:</div><a name="100316113000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Who
is to judge what is adequate and what is not? If a company has
stringent rules in place, checks on its employees, has transparent
accounting and so on, but a determined associate of that company still
manages to bribe another, were those procedures adequate? They did not,
after all, prevent the offence of bribery taking place. What about a
company with weak procedures in place which nevertheless managed,
perhaps more by chance than anything else, to stop an embryonic plan to
commit bribery?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC45.]</div><a name="100316113000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment seeks to change the wording from &#147;adequate&#148; to
&#147;reasonable&#148;. The &#147;Compact Oxford English
Dictionary&#148; defines reasonable as &#147;fair and sensible. As
much as is appropriate or fair&#148;. I trust that the Government do
not seek to impose a blanket requirement for all businesses, from the
smallest family business right up to the global giant corporate
monolith, to follow the same procedures? Those concepts of fair and
appropriate have not been watchwords of this Government in imposing
regulations on businesses.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000507"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Until that point, I was following what the hon.
Gentleman was saying. It occurs to me that although there are some
exceptions, when the courts discuss the meaning of
&#147;reasonableness&#148; in general law, they do not take into
account the resources available to the defendant. An overall
cost-benefit analysis applies the objective to everyone; it is not done
according to the defendant&#146;s wealth or ability to make
payments.</div><a name="100316113000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000508"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No, but in a corporate sense the hon. Gentleman
surely appreciates that what is reasonable for a small family business
may not be so for a huge company, with its procedures and HR
departments. That is common
sense.</div><a name="100316113000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000509"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman is a lawyer, like me, and
knows that the law is not necessarily common sense. I am pointing out
to him how the courts often interpret
&#147;reasonable&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000510"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> As I have seen in practice, and as the hon.
Gentleman has said, the consideration of &#147;reasonable&#148;
will involve a review of the various issues involved in the
case.</div><a name="100316113000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000511"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> On the argument that my hon. Friend is having with
the hon. Member for Cambridge, would it assist if we looked at the rest
of subsection (2)? If my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment were to be
adopted, that subsection would
read:</div><a name="100316113000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
prove that C had in place reasonable procedures designed to prevent
persons associated with C from undertaking such
conduct.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, in a smaller enterprise there would be fewer people than
in a large organisation, and in that context &#147;reasonable&#148;
may be
different.</div><a name="100316113000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000512"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for pointing that
out&#151;a good spot. It is often forgotten that the burden of
regulation is disproportionately carried by smaller businesses. That is
the reality of corporate life, and we need to move away from it. It is
often small businesses that are hit hardest by the global economic
problems and face the steepest uphill road back to prosperity, and that
is why we believe that amending the wording to
&#147;reasonable&#148; has a threefold advantage. First, by its
very nature, the term imports objectivity; secondly, courts and jurors
are well acquainted with the concept of reasonableness and the
so-called reasonable man test; and, thirdly, it provides for a
proportionality of assessment that is otherwise absent. Reasonable
procedures can be considered in the light of the circumstances and
facts of the case giving rise to the alleged offence, for instance the
size of the company, its sphere of operations from both a geographical
and a product perspective, and its history of offences. I would be
interested to hear from the Minister examples of where
&#147;adequacy&#148; has been used in statute. That might make an
interesting
comparison.</div><a name="100316113000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree in principle with the need for corporate liability in the Bill,
but our concern is to strike the right balance. There was near
unanimous agreement in the evidence presented to the Joint Committee
that the meaning of &#147;adequate procedures&#148; would require
amplification through guidance. The OECD was anxious that there should
be greater clarity over what it meant:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="100316113000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is a case for saying that, even if it reaches the statute book, this
clause should not be brought into force until some work has been done
with the CBI, other business representatives, anti-corruption experts,
and others, to hammer out some basic standards and
procedures.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000513"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Is my hon. Friend suggesting that that there needs
to be a handbook or guide that explains what adequate procedures would
be, perhaps saying what they would be for small, medium and large
enterprise in certain scenarios&#151;whether they were big exporters,
for
example?</div><a name="100316113000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000514"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The answer is yes, and I will come on to
describe precisely what I am getting at in that regard.
</div><a name="100316113000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
quote was hardly a ringing endorsement from the body that has pushed so
hard for reform of the bribery legislation in the UK. There is a widely
held concern among commercial organisations about the lack of certainty
over what would be considered adequate procedures. It is acknowledged
that the Bill would create, in effect, a large range of organisations,
making it difficult for the Government to produce comprehensive
guidance. The scales seem to be weighed in favour of using
&#147;reasonable&#148;, a term with which companies and courts
alike are familiar, rather than introducing a new concept of
adequacy.</div><a name="100316113000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a number of examples in English law of criminal liability being
imposed on companies, subject to a defence such as due diligence on the
part of the legal person in question. One thinks, for example, of
section 21(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990, section 34 of the Weights
and Measures Act 1985, section 141A of the Criminal Justice Act 1988
and section 24 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. Such a defence may
operate even when the offence to which it relates has a fault element
and is not one of strict liability. In such a case, the defendant,
according to the Law Commission, is saying:</div>
<a name="100316113000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
may have been fault on this occasion, but that it is not a reflection
of the way that I run my affairs generally. Indeed, my business is run
with systems in place whose aim it is to prevent this kind of
incident.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UK is not alone in the policy of imposing criminal liability on
corporate entities. It is a global trend that can be seen from
Scandinavia to Japan. The UK system tends to concentrate on the
regulatory area of criminalisation, which broadly speaking is concerned
with imposing liability as an incentive to good practice in a
particular area. Such structures often focus on health and safety
issues, broadly
construed.</div><a name="100316113000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rationale behind the due diligence or adequate systems defence was
considered in some detail by the Law Commission in its 2008 report. In
essence, a company should not be liable for a serious offence, such as
a failure to prevent bribery, on the basis of a single instance of
carelessness if it can show that it had robust management systems in
place to prevent bribery from taking
place.</div><a name="100316113000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
criminal liability in the Bill is imposed on the basis of the lack of
supervision rule, which, for the classicists on the Committee, is
&#147;culpa in eligendo, instruendo, et custodiendo&#148;. In other
words, the offence is committed by a person, be they an agent or
employee of the company, as a consequence of the company&#146;s
failure properly to supervise them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="100316113000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The defence
recognises that the control of some behaviour is out of the hands of
the company. The Law Commission provided examples of two such
instances, the first of which
reads:</div><a name="100316113000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
English company, C, that has anti-bribery policies of which employees
are periodically reminded, takes over a company (YCo) based in a
country where bribery by companies is common. Immediately following the
take-over, a former employee of YCo (now an employee of C) bribes an
official to secure a contract. The employee&#146;s supervisor (also a
former employee of YCo) says that he or she was still coming to terms
with C&#146;s new ways of operating, and had not fully appreciated
the wholly categorical nature of the new policy. C is charged with
negligently failing to prevent bribery by the
employee.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second example
reads:</div><a name="100316113000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
English company, C, wishes to do business in Blueland. C
employs an agent (X) living in Blueland to establish business contacts
on C&#146;s behalf with Government officials in Blueland.
X bribes those officials to place contracts with C. C can
show that it gave Y, their regional manager, the task of ensuring that
all foreign agents complied with the company&#146;s anti-bribery
policy. Y had failed in her task, as she was busy looking
for a job with a rival
company.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
both examples, the individual failings of particular members of staff
do not necessarily illustrate systematic failures in the way in which C
has sought to prevent the commission of bribery. As such, C would have
a good defence to the offence under clause 7 if it can show that it had
in place reasonable procedures designed to prevent
bribery.</div><a name="100316113000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to a point that was
made in the General Counsel 100 group&#146;s submissions to the Joint
Committee. GC100 is the body the represents the general counsels of
leading companies. The point was made in relation to whether a
negligent element should be included in the offence, but I believe that
it is also of use to our discussion. GC100
stated:</div><a name="100316113000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Unlimited
fines and debarment from tendering for public contracts are real
consequences of the new offence. As a basis for criminal liability,
negligence is not generally sufficient to establish liability for
serious offences. The only offence for which negligence is arguably
sufficient is public nuisance, and the most recent corporate offence
which is analogous is corporate manslaughter, where &#145;gross
negligence&#146; is the required threshold...The appropriate
test in this case should be that of &#145;gross negligence&#146;.
That would apply where the standards of behaviour fall well below what
could reasonably be expected, and is a more realistic test for an
offence with such serious
consequences.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000431"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
<a name="100316113000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of
negligence as the basis for the offence was widely criticised by
non-business witnesses. The point that I want to make about the
amendment, however, can be drawn out relatively easily. What is
proposed in the Bill has the potential to have devastating consequences
for business. Unlimited fines and debarment might prove fatal, not
least for small and medium-sized enterprises.</div>
<a name="100316113000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
so concerned in this context&#151;although we are
concerned&#151;about a large global corporate that employs a
200-strong team of compliance officers to formulate, implement and
monitor a bespoke anti-bribery procedure across the company. Our
concern is mainly with the small business that, for instance, has just
won a contract to supply specialist medical equipment to a foreign
state.</div>
<a name="100316113000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
suppose that such a company employs 25 people in making, marketing and
selling those highly specialised pieces of equipment. It will have a
staff 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>handbook and some guidelines on its internal computer network to deal
with anti-bribery. It will even have given one of its salesmen the
title of anti-bribery overseer, and all suspected cases of corruption
will be reported to him. Employees will be able to go to him for
confidential advice about certain business practices about which they
are concerned. Our anti-bribery overseer will attend a two-day course
every other year to be updated on the latest trends in the area of
bribery.</div>
<a name="100316113000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
company, however, will never have fulfilled contracts abroad before, so
it will be sailing into the unknown. A manager could be dispatched with
the order of machines but be informed on arrival by customs officers
that he is over his allowance of imported electronic goods if he brings
the goods into the country and that his documentation has not been
completed properly. A &#147;fine&#148; would be payable or the
consignment will be confiscated, and he would be required to pay an
&#147;administration fee&#148; to have his documentation corrected.
The machines would be deliverable on that day, on a trial basis, and
successful shipping would result in repeat business, but if they were
confiscated, or there was an appeal, the consignment would be impounded
for 90
days.</div><a name="100316113000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the Bill, if that manager were to pay the fine and the administration
fee, he and the company would be liable to imprisonment and an
unlimited fine. Furthermore, the company would be barred from
procurement processes for major health care contracts throughout
Europe. The anti-bribery procedures in place in that instance would not
be adequate because they did not deal with the bribery of foreign
officials. My example concerns a company undertaking work abroad for
the first time, but the defence in clause 7 would not protect it. It is
arguable whether that response in the Bill is
proportionate.</div><a name="100316113000134"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000515"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Such a scenario would probably be more relevant with
a perishable product such as a foodstuff or something that would go off
if it was not moved quickly to a secure or cold area. We all know that
people sometimes hold up goods whose value diminishes if they do not
clear the docks
quickly.</div><a name="100316113000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000516"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That good example was given in the Joint
Committee and in the other place, so it is appropriate that my hon.
Friend has brought it
up.</div><a name="100316113000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
alternative, under our amendment, would be that the procedures would
have to be reasonable. I put it to the Minister that a reasonable man
might have looked at the provisions that the company had in place, when
considering the facts of the case, and decided that they were
reasonable&#151;not adequate, because they would have required
consideration to be given to foreign officials&#151;because of the
company&#146;s size and usual sphere of
operation.</div><a name="100316113000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to go on much longer about this issue, but I would be
grateful if the Under-Secretary would inform hon. Members of the
Government&#146;s plans to issue guidance, and explain how
consultation is being established with business. I should also be
grateful if she would confirm that the clause will not become effective
until such guidance has been issued.</div>
<a name="100316113000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We feel that
there is a need for guidance on the offence as it is expressed to
assist British business and prevent it from being disadvantaged on the
world stage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>when competing with companies from many other states. Will the Minister
therefore also explain how the guidance, once it is agreed, will be
disseminated to companies? The difficulty with introducing
comprehensive guidance is that many companies of many different sizes
operate in the UK, in a multitude of business sectors and geographical
regions. The Joint Committee acknowledged that when it recommended that
appropriate bodies should be able to draft guidance that was tailored
to specific sectors, and that the Government could approve to provide
it with official status. That approach is supported by the Law Society,
the Bar Council and one of the law firms that put its tuppenny-worth
into the consultation.</div>
<a name="100316113000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
return to the issue in more detail when we discuss my amendment 14,
which relates to the guidance to be published by the Secretary of
State, but I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s comments on
amendment 12 as well.</div>
<a name="100316113000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000517"></a>David
Howarth:</b> This is one of those issues on which I thought we
all agreed about what to do. The meaning of the word
&#147;adequate&#148; is at issue. It was debated in the other
place, and we all came to the view that guidelines should be issued to
help companies to ensure that they comply. Having reached that
agreement, I am not sure why we are debating the underlying issues all
over again. I do not want to spend much time on them; I just wonder why
the hon. Member for Huntingdon has not kept to what I thought we all
agreed was the heart of the
problem.</div><a name="100316113000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000518"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is
making, but he will be aware that we do not have the guidance.
Hypothetically, does he think that, in the absence of guidance,
&#147;reasonable&#148; is better than
&#147;adequate&#148;?</div><a name="100316113000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000519"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That question cannot really be answered because
we do not have the guidance. It is entirely the case that extra
information about the word &#147;adequate&#148; must be supplied to
make it usable. However, there are problems with using the word
&#147;reasonable&#148;, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon
illustrated in his speech by using that word in a way that a court
probably would not recognise. If we used the word
&#147;reasonable&#148;, he would need to produce further guidance
to explain its meaning to companies.</div>
<a name="100316113000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
say that this is a strict liability offence, but that is not quite
accurate. Somebody must commit the crime of bribery. The question then
is whether that crime committed by an individual is attributed to a
company. The law comes across that problem all the time. It is about
vicarious liability, not the company&#146;s direct liability. There
is no offence unless some human has committed the actual offence of
bribery. The attribution is not strict either, in the way that it would
be strict in a normal negligence case. In a normal negligence case,
there is no excuse at all. If the employee has committed a wrong in the
course of employment, that is it&#151;the employer is liable. In the
Bill, employers have a get-out clause in the form of the adequacy
defence, and that seems a generous starting
point.</div><a name="100316113000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth
about the difference between &#147;reasonable&#148; and
&#147;adequate&#148;, it seems to me that, in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>general terms, what &#147;reasonable&#148; means in law is a sort of
cost-benefit analysis. When answering the question of whether
reasonable steps have been taken, one asks whether the defendant has
taken precautions against whatever it is that we are talking
about&#151;in this case, the commission of bribery by associated
persons&#151;to the point where imposing more costs on themselves
would yield no proper return on those costs. The question is whether
those precautions have gone to the point where incurring extra costs
would produce no appropriate
benefit.</div><a name="100316113000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000520"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The Bill talks about precautions that are adequate
for the purpose of preventing</div>
<a name="100316113000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons
associated with C from undertaking such
conduct.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the hon. Gentleman see room for a situation in which procedures are in
place yet bribery occurs, but a defence can be mounted? My hon. Friend
the Member for Huntingdon was expressing concern about a situation in
which bribery has occurred, the procedure was inadequate for its
purpose and, ipso facto, the defence did not
run.</div>
<a name="100316113000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000521"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is what we, in the academic world, call the
ex post interpretation of the defence, which does not make any sense.
It is an interpretation under which the defence could never apply
because whenever a bribe is taking place, the measures taken by the
employer could not possibly have been adequate in that sense, as
otherwise the offence would not have taken place. Therefore, it cannot
mean that; it must mean something else. There is then a question about
what it means, and that is why it is right to have
guidance.</div><a name="100316113000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
to answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Rugby and
Kenilworth in a roundabout way, if the statute simply said
&#147;adequate&#148;, and there was no further guidance, a court
might think that it was a causation defence, which is to say that the
court would look for extraneous events that interfered with the
defendant&#146;s efforts to prevent bribery&#151;perhaps an
extraneous independent action by a third party. It might perhaps look
for unforeseeable actions by third parties that made the precautions
taken against the commission of bribery ineffective. Without further
guidance, that is how things would look, and that is why guidance is
important. However, as I said at the start, I thought we had come to a
conclusion about what we were doing about this particular problem, and
we should stick to it.</div>
<a name="100316113000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000522"></a>John
Howell:</b> Let me give my welcome for your time in the Chair,
Ms
Walley.</div><a name="100316113000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that this debate is necessary, particularly for those of us who
were not members of the Joint Committee. It relates particularly to our
discussion on guidance. We have heard a lot about the need for
guidance, and I want to return to that subject in a
moment.</div><a name="100316113000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I would like to address the practical questions that were asked by my
hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon about the fact that we do not
need a one-size-fits-all system. In my business experience, I have
worked for a large international partnership with branches in savoury
and unsavoury parts of the world in which people do business. I have
also run a small business that was active in different parts of the
world, including the middle east.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div><a name="100316113000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">What one can
do with regard to putting systems in place differs between those two
types of firms. In an international firm, its complexity, particularly
in a large client-focused service company, means that it is difficult
to see how one can get through the chain of the hierarchy of the
company except by having values to which everyone is signed
up&#151;that was certainly the case in the firm that I worked for. It
is different when it is one&#146;s own business, however. When my
business partner at the time and I were pitching for contracts in the
middle east, it was easy to ensure that we did not enter a situation
that put us in a position of either being bribed or wanting to be
bribed because only the two of us were the principals of the business
and we were able to undertake the contracts. Such a situation involves
quite different burdens and restrictions.</div>
<a name="100316113000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
raise a question that has not yet been asked about those large service
firms. Let us take a large accountancy firm that shares its clients.
Typically, there will be one particular partnership that has the head
office function of looking after a major client around the world. Each
of the partnerships around the world will provide services for the
company in its own area and add different bits. In such cases, are
those partnerships around the world providing a service to the head
office of the client company, or to the head office of the partnership?
The situation under the Bill will differ depending on which one
applies, so we need to understand
that.</div><a name="100316113000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was also interested by the mention of agents. In my experience with
agencies, it is rare for businesses, and particularly small ones, to
have their own agent, because agents tend to work on the basis of
having a number of different clients, and one of the difficulties is
making sure that their other clients are not one&#146;s competitors.
Those clients for an agent overseas will typically come from many
different countries, so an agent acting for one&#146;s UK company
might also be acting for a Thai company in a particular part of the
world. All those clients bring their different legislative bases and
the different cultures that go with
them.</div><a name="100316113000432"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="100316113000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am a little concerned that there is no practical element of how that
will work and how we will put in place the mechanism for controlling an
agent, because, although the agent is providing services, one&#146;s
leverage over the agent is quite minimal in many cases.</div>
<a name="100316113000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
also the question of the guidance. We have already reached a number of
clauses that can be understood only with guidance. Effectively, two
sets of guidance are required. The first is a vertical set of guidance
on what is adequate or reasonable, if our amendment is accepted, for a
large company, a medium company and a small company. There is some
sense in having that.</div>
<a name="100316113000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has also
been suggested&#151;Lord Henley suggested it in the Grand Committee
and others have done so today&#151;that we should have a vertical set
of guidance that goes across industry-specific sectors. I can see some
benefit in having that, but to understand the Bill when we go overseas
we will have to take a briefcase full of guidance to ensure that we are
doing the right thing. We are getting into a disastrous situation where
we pass a Bill in this House that cannot be read on its own and where
large amounts of the interpretation can vary  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>significantly. Draft guidance has not even been produced for us while we
are discussing the Bill, yet it could affect significantly the way in
which British companies
operate.</div><a name="100316113000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other issue that we have not mentioned so far is one that the Joint
Committee decided to park because it did not have time to deal with
it&#151;the role of subsidiaries and joint ventures. The difficulty
is that we are between two stools. Do we want to capture the
subsidiaries and the joint ventures, because it could lead to abuse if
a company effectively allowed the bribery to take place through its
subsidiary but it was argued that the subsidiary was not providing the
service back to the company and so was not caught by the Bill? On the
other hand, the last thing we want to do is to increase a network of
obligations for subsidiaries that may not apply and that hold up the
company dealing in the business.</div>
<a name="100316113000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue
was parked. We were expecting a Law Commission conclusion that would
inform a debate on the future of that. It would be nice to know when
such a debate will take place and what the likely outcome will be. We
need to understand how this will work in practice and what system will
be put in place by companies to make sure that they can operate safely
within the
Bill.</div><a name="100316113000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000523"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> There is just one matter about which I should like
to ask the Minister. When the Joint Committee looked at this clause it
referred to the impact assessment. On page 37, it stated
that</div><a name="100316113000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
note the &#145;light-touch&#146; approach endorsed by the Impact
Assessment for small firms in low risk sectors where it may be
sufficient to demonstrate that &#145;anti-bribery principles have
been fully communicated to its work force&#146;&#148;</div>
<a name="100316113000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister
confirm that there will be a light-touch approach in the guidance on
small firms in low-risk sectors? Clearly, that would be a help. It is
eight months since the Joint Committee did its work, and I imagine that
the Ministry of Justice will have done some work in the meantime. It
would be interesting to have an update on where the Under-Secretary,
her colleagues and staff have got to on the guidance and the
light-touch approach for small businesses.</div>
<a name="100316113000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000524"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I want briefly to focus on one issue and return to
the difference between reasonable and adequate. I understood what the
hon. Member for Cambridge said. However, in the absence of guidance,
which we do not have at the moment&#151;I know that we will come on
to discuss what guidance we will get and when we will get it&#151;one
of the questions that those in business and industry affected by the
legislation&#151;</div><a name="100316113000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000525"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. I seek clarification from the hon. Gentleman
on whether we are moving to a clause stand part debate and having a
discussion that is slightly wider than what is reasonable or adequate
to the amendment.</div>
<a name="100316113000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000526"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> My point was specifically about the amendment
because it replaces the word &#147;adequate&#148; with
&#147;reasonable&#148;. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will be able to
help the Committee on this matter. Assuming that we do not have full
guidance&#151;I will make that assumption for the moment, although we
will come on to discuss guidance at a later
stage&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div><a name="100316113000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000527"></a>The
Chair:</b><b class="B"> </b>Order. As we have already strayed into a
wider clause stand part debate, it might be helpful if this
contribution avoided the need for a clause stand part debate at a later
stage. I am in the hands of the Committee.</div>
<a name="100316113000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000528"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I am perfectly content to make my point either in
relation to the specific amendment or to the clause, but I appreciate
that some other members of the Committee might not have made all their
points, as they did not realise that this was their opportunity to do
so.</div><a name="100316113000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000529"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. In that case, I shall assume that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comments relate to the
amendment.</div><a name="100316113000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000530"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I am grateful for that guidance, Ms
Walley. My point is straightforward and relates to the type of advice,
particularly legal advice, that those affected by the Bill are likely
to seek. We will assume for the purpose of the debate that there is no
detailed guidance, although I understand that we will move on to that.
Assuming that there is no detailed guidance to provide specific answers
to points that are raised, people are likely to seek legal advice on
this part of the Bill. It occurs to me that the legal advice that
people are likely to receive would be more helpful if the word in
question were &#147;reasonable&#148; than if it were
&#147;adequate&#148;, simply because the courts are far more
familiar with &#147;reasonable&#148;. The hon. Member for Cambridge
gave a helpful indication of how the courts are likely to regard the
word &#147;reasonable&#148;, but it is more difficult to do that
for &#147;adequate&#148;. It would be useful to know whether the
Under-Secretary has received legal advice on the likelihood of people
getting sensible legal advice on the definition of
&#147;adequate&#148;, should guidance not be available to them when
this part of the Bill becomes an Act.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000531"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I understand that your guidance, Ms
Walley, is to continue with the debate on the amendment. However, many
of the issues that have been raised are wider than that and relate to
the clause stand part debate. I will touch briefly on those issues, and
then, since hon. Members have indicated that they wish to return to a
stand part debate, we can do so again. I do not wish to repeat the
process.</div>
<a name="100316113000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cambridge worries me intensely. I find it difficult to agree
with Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="100316113000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000532"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am leaving soon.</div>
<a name="100316113000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000533"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> In order to make me feel more comfortable it would
have to be not only the hon. Gentleman who is leaving, but his whole
party. Nevertheless, I agree with him on this matter. He is right to
say that we had agreed in another place&#151;which I understood to be
a cross-party agreement&#151;on the inclusion of the term
&#147;adequate&#148;, and that the appropriate way to deal with
that was to provide guidance.</div>
<a name="100316113000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to a letter that has been placed on the
Table for this afternoon&#146;s sitting&#151;indeed, I think it was
also placed on hon. Members&#146; seats&#151;that gives a draft
outline of the guidance that might form 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>part of the guidance available under clause 9. I am sure the hon.
Gentleman will want to come back to that
matter.</div><a name="100316113000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000534"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> One of my hon. Friends made the point from a
sedentary position that it might help the Committee to know why we have
received that document at 1 o&#146;clock this afternoon. The
Under-Secretary will have been fully aware that the guidance that was
likely to be published in connection with the Bill would be an
important part of the Committee debate. I suggest that to be handed
that document when we are part way through debating the section of the
Bill that is relevant to guidance is somewhat unsatisfactory. Given
that the letter attached to the document is dated 11 March, it would
not have been difficult to get it to us before 1
o&#146;clock this afternoon. Will she tell us why that has not
happened?</div><a name="100316113000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000535"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The hon. Gentleman will find that we thought the
document would be
helpful.</div><a name="100316113000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000536"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> On a point of order, Ms Walley. It would be helpful
to have a copy. I do not know whether there are any spare copies, but I
have not got one and neither has my hon. Friend the Member for
Poole.</div><a name="100316113000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000537"></a>The
Chair:</b> On that principle, it would be extraordinarily
helpful for all members of the Committee, including the Chairman, to
have a
copy.</div><a name="100316113000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000538"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I considered that it would be helpful, although, of
course, it is not necessary to provide that information to the
Committee at this stage, given that it is simply a draft outline of the
issues we believe should be covered by the guidance. I felt it would be
helpful to give hon. Members an opportunity to consider the
document.</div><a name="100316113000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000539"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On a point of order, Ms Walley. To receive the
guidance, which some hon. Members have not even got, in the middle of
the debate to which it is pertinent is, frankly, totally
unsatisfactory. I suggest that the Committee immediately suspend for
half an hour, so we can be given the opportunity to read the documents,
take them in and consider a key issue to the whole
Bill.</div><a name="100316113000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000540"></a>The
Chair:</b> This is entirely a matter for the Under-Secretary.
I point out that there is still the opportunity for a clause stand part
debate.</div><a name="100316113000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000541"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Further to that point of order, Ms
Walley. The difficulty with not adjourning the Committee is that we are
all interested in participating in the ongoing debate on other clauses.
Doing that while simultaneously reading the guidance is extremely
difficult. That is the reason for the request for an
adjournment.</div><a name="100316113000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000542"></a>The
Chair:</b> I call the Under-Secretary to
reply.</div>
<a name="100316113000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000543"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I felt it was helpful to the Committee to provide
that information at this stage, but it was not necessary to do so. It
is simply a draft outline of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>issues that we have been considering and I thought it would be helpful.
The hon. Gentleman asked why the letter is dated 11 March. If he really
wants to know, it is because I had it in my weekend box and,
unfortunately, because of the illness of my son I was not able to
return it last night, so it came back this morning. That is why the
Committee has it available
today.</div><a name="100316113000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000544"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Under-Secretary give
way?</div><a name="100316113000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000545"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> One moment. The hon. Gentleman may think he needs
considerable time to consider the document. I propose to deal with the
amendments he has tabled in respect of &#147;adequate&#148; and
&#147;reasonable&#148; and the issues around that. This is an
opportunity for him to consider the guidelines as we move into the next
section of the debate: the clause stand
part.</div><a name="100316113000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000546"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am sorry to hear about the
Under-Secretary&#146;s personal circumstances, but I must remind her
that it was her colleague the Minister in the other place who promised
the guidance to Lord Henley, who I think called it the draft of the
draft that was expected. I am afraid the situation is much
more serious than it just being a case of the Under-Secretary not
providing the guidance. Providing the guidance during the middle of the
debate on the clause is
unacceptable.</div><a name="100316113000433"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="100316113000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000547"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I am sorry to repeat the point, but we are under no
duty to provide the guidance at this stage. I am simply seeking to help
the Committee to understand this guidance, which is a draft outline.
Despite the many protestations that the hon. Member for Huntingdon may
wish to make, there has been plenty of opportunity for him to consider
the detail of the guidance, because it has been available to him for
the last hour and a
half.</div><a name="100316113000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000548"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b><b class="B"> </b>The Minister may not have noticed it, but
I have been doing some other things over the past hour and a
half.</div><a name="100316113000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000549"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Precisely, but there was an opportunity for the hon.
Gentleman to look at this matter when it became available this
afternoon. The documents are simply to inform the discussion and the
debate of the Committee. I am not under any duty to provide guidance at
this stage. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment proposes that we
replace &#147;adequate&#148; with &#147;reasonable&#148;. Does
he feel that companies should proceed on the basis that they have
inadequate procedures in place, because that is the reality of the
amendment?</div>
<a name="100316113000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000550"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> As I said in my speech, there may be
circumstances in which something that is inadequate is reasonable. That
may be an unusual situation, but that could be the
case.</div><a name="100316113000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000551"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> A court will have an opportunity to consider all the
factors. However, the hon. Gentleman is simply seeking to water down
and to lower the threshold by replacing &#147;adequate&#148; with
&#147;reasonable&#148;, and I cannot possibly accept the amendment
on that basis.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div><a name="100316113000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000552"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> On page 37 of the impact assessment, there is a
reference to small business and the risk being low in certain sectors.
In such circumstances, light touch regulation to ensure that staff are
aware of bribery risk would be adequate. Is that dealt with at some
point in the draft of the guidance? For example, is it dealt with under
risk assessment and management, because small businesses do not seem to
be mentioned anywhere?</div>
<a name="100316113000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000553"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Perhaps I can be even more helpful to the Committee
and suggest that we deal with the guidance under clause 9, which is
where the guidance should be discussed in detail. I am more than happy
to come back to a discussion on that matter when we come to
clause 9.</div>
<a name="100316113000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000554"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Are we going to have a break to look
at
it?</div><a name="100316113000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000555"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is reviewing the
matter carefully as I speak.</div>
<a name="100316113000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000556"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I do not think that the Minister understands the
importance of this issue. It was raised at every single stage by the
Opposition in the other place and by the Liberal Democrats as well.
Businesses consistently raised the matter. My hon. Friend has just read
out what the CBI wrote today. The Minister is making a mockery of a
very significant issue, and I am afraid that I want to put it on the
record that her behaviour is unacceptable. She is suggesting that we
discuss the matter when we get to clause 9, but, as she can see, all
the amendments listed up until clause 9 are mine, which means that I
will have no opportunity whatever to sit down and look at this, so her
suggestion is totally
unacceptable.</div><a name="100316113000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000557"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I do not accept the views of the hon. Gentleman. I
have sought to be as helpful as possible to the Committee by providing
some information on the basis of the discussions that we have already
had with our stakeholders, companies, the CBI and other organisations.
On that basis, I felt that it would be helpful to provide the Committee
with some indication of where those discussions were going and the sort
of issues that we may well be covering. I am sorry that the hon.
Gentleman does not share that view on how helpful that guidance will be
for many people.</div>
<a name="100316113000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000558"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> The Minister is slightly misrepresenting the
position of my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon. I do not think he
argued that the guidance is not helpful. He said that it would have
been more helpful if it had been delivered earlier&#151;even,
frankly, if we had received it before the lunch adjournment or when the
Committee rose&#151;rather than when we all got back to our seats and
went straight back into other Committee
business.</div>
<a name="100316113000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000559"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I have pretty much said everything I possibly can on
the matter. I intend to move on and deal with the issue in the
amendment, which is the suggestion that we should replace
&#147;adequate&#148; with &#147;reasonable&#148;.</div>
<a name="100316113000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
already said, I do not believe that that is acceptable. It is a
watering down of the test. It would allow an organisation to argue
that, although the procedures 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>were wholly inadequate, they were none the less reasonable&#151;for
example, the resources available to the organisation to devote to the
prevention of bribery. The hon. Member for Huntingdon gave a series of
examples in his
remarks.</div><a name="100316113000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment could result in a court, when considering the applicability
of the defence, taking into account all manner of subjective factors
such as, for example, the extent to which it was practicable, bearing
in mind the distraction of a change management programme; or whether it
was reasonable, given the financial position of the organisation
following a significant outlay on new production equipment; or whether,
due to the quick onset of the organisation&#146;s entry into a new
market, there was insufficient time to put procedures in place. Those
are subjective factors and I do not believe that it is acceptable to
lower the threshold from adequate to reasonable. There is no
incompatibility between adequate procedures and the commission of a
bribery offence on behalf of a commercial organisation that has them in
place. Indeed, in one of the examples that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon gave, that is an issue that no doubt a company would wish to
raise as part of its defence to show that it had adequate procedures in
place.</div><a name="100316113000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that systems meeting the highest standards may still be
ineffectual in preventing bribery by a rogue individual determined to
commit such an offence. When reading the clause as a whole, it is clear
that, despite an isolated bribe being paid on behalf of an
organisation, the organisation may still plead the defence and absolve
itself. I think that deals with the case that the hon. Gentleman
raised.</div><a name="100316113000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the word &#147;adequate&#148; strikes the right
balance. Commercial organisations should have adequate&#151;not
simply reasonable&#151;bribery prevention procedures. It is
reasonable to expect them to have adequate procedures in place. On that
basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="100316113000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000560"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I find this whole situation highly
unsatisfactory. Let me first address the hon. Member for Cambridge, who
asked why we were debating the underlying issues now. My basic answer
to him is: because the Committee has not debated them before. That
means, as my hon. Friend the Member for Henley made clear, that we have
every right to do so, despite what was previously debated, and wherever
it was previously debated. I know that the matter was debated in the
other place, that the Joint Committee had a look at it, and that it
came up when the Minister and I spoke to Transparency International UK.
It has probably been debated in many other forums that I have been to,
but the Committee has a right to address the serious issues. I consider
that we, as the main Opposition party, have a duty to debate the main
issues that are part of the Bill. We would be negligent if we did not
do so, so I make no apologies here&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;We need an adequate debate.&#148;] Quite
right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000561"></a>David

debate.</div>
<a name="100316113000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000562"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> A reasonable debate sounds good to me, but I am
not sure whether we are there at the moment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div><a name="100316113000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman likened the definition of &#147;reasonable&#148; with a
cost-benefit analysis, which was quite a good way of considering it.
However, he assumes that the reasonableness test will, as a result, be
contained in the guidance. In a big debate in another place, it was
said that the reasonable element will go into the guidance, but in the
two seconds that I have had to look at the outline guidance&#151;the
draft of the draft&#151;I have not seen anything about
reasonableness, although perhaps I have missed it. Presumably that
information will be slipped quickly into the final
version.</div><a name="100316113000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000563"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that we have new things
to debate? We have the draft outline of the guidance, which nobody has
seen before. The CBI has thought about what happened in the House of
Lords and made representations to us on its latest position. It has not
raised every point that it made before, but those that it still thinks
are important&#151;this is new
material.</div><a name="100316113000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000564"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I want to make it absolutely clear that although
the letter from the Under-Secretary is dated 11 March, my hon. Friends
and I did not see the guidance until an hour or two ago. I have not had
the opportunity during our sitting to give it any consideration. As has
been said, an opportunity to consider the guidance would have been
helpful, and that was why I was so keen to know what stage we were at
with its production. In all that has been said so far, I do not think
that the Under-Secretary has explained where we are with the production
of the guidance, but we can discuss that during a stand part
debate.</div><a name="100316113000210"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000566"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b>
Indeed.</div><a name="100316113000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary discussed the impact of reasonableness, and we have
reached an understanding that that is an outstanding issue. We will
have to consider that when taking a view on the guidance. I cannot say
whether we will have time to do that, given the way in which these
Committee debates are panning out, but it is unlikely, so the way in
which we will approach the Bill&#146;s later stages is looking
increasingly interesting. If this is an example of how the Bill will
continue, I am not impressed, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="100316113000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000567"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> In one way or another, we have had something of
a stand part debate on what Lord Henley described as a draft of a
draft. I have not had the chance to look at it, however, so everything
that I say is premised on
that.</div><a name="100316113000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are concerned that there is no reference in the document to
reasonableness. Although the Under-Secretary said there would be
reference to the clause 6 offence, a cursory glance suggests that there
is not. As a starting point, it would be helpful if she explained the
feedback she has had from those in the business community and
non-governmental organisations with whom she has consulted on this
draft of a draft.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="100316113000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000568"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> On a point of order, Ms Walley. Are we are
discussing the guidance in respect of clause 9, which is the guidance
clause, or having a stand part debate on the offence in clause 7? That
is not clear from what the hon. Gentleman is
saying.</div><a name="100316113000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000569"></a>The
Chair:</b> In response to the Minister&#146;s point of
order, I say to the Committee that we are having the stand part debate
on what is presented in the Bill as clause 7. It seems to me, given
what is being said, that there will be ample opportunity to discuss the
guidance when the Committee discusses that aspect of the Bill. We will
now resume the clause 7 stand part
debate.</div><a name="100316113000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000570"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000571"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> This important clause is concerned with the powers
of commercial organisations to prevent bribery. The new offence is a
key element in the reform of bribery legislation because it underpins
the development of a corporate culture in which bribery is not
tolerated, as is set out clearly in the clause. I encourage the
Committee to support the
clause.</div><a name="100316113000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000572"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment 13, in
clause 8, page 6, line 3, leave
out from &#145;circumstances&#146; to end and insert
&#145;including but not limited
to&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) the extent of C&#146;s
influence over A,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) the
degree to which A was able to act autonomously of
C,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c) the particular
circumstances of any joint venture or consortium arrangements, both
documented and arising by virtue of the parties&#146; conduct,
between A and C, and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(d) the
nature of the relationship between A and
C.&#146;.</div><a name="100316113000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with the meaning of an associated person in the context of
the clause 7 offence:</div>
<a name="100316113000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Failure
of commercial organisations to prevent
bribery&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with concerns about remaining ambiguities in respect of
the application of the offence in clause 7 as a result of the current
drafting of clause 8(4), particularly the interpretation of the
words</div><a name="100316113000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;performs
services for or on behalf of C is to be determined by reference to all
the relevant
circumstances&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ambiguity that arises as a consequence of its interpretation might
create practical difficulties for banks and syndicates, companies and
joint ventures and large group companies, as the law firm Clifford
Chance submitted in its evidence to the Joint Committee. For example,
is the lead bank in a syndicate performing services on behalf of the
other banks? Is a company in a joint venture performing services for
its joint venture partner? Is a bribe paid by an employee of a
subsidiary of C, to gain a contract for that subsidiary, made in
connection 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>with C&#146;s business? Does the answer differ if C is the sole
holding company, a 51 per cent. shareholder or a 20 per cent.
shareholder?</div><a name="100316113000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8 ties in with the offence specified in clause 7 and provides that A is
associated with C for the purposes of clause 7 if
A</div><a name="100316113000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;performs
services for or on behalf of
C&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also ensures that clause 7 relates to the actual activities being
undertaken by A at the time, rather than A&#146;s general position.
The clause expressly states that A may be the commercial
organisation&#146;s &#147;employee, agent or
subsidiary&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment would clarify the clause and clearly signpost considerations
that must be taken into account when deciding whether entities are
associated for the purposes of clause 7. It was tabled to explore the
nature of the association that the Government wish to capture with the
Bill and, at the same time, to suggest an improvement to the current
structure that would assuage concerns expressed in the other place and
by a number of business organisations. Consideration would still be
taken in respect of &#147;all the relevant circumstances&#148;, as
required under the current draft of the clause, but emphasis would be
placed on considerations regarding the extent of control exercised by C
over A&#146;s behaviour and the formal relationship between A and
C.</div><a name="100316113000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
listened to the concerns of business groups, we believe that the clause
as drafted could present significant problems to UK businesses engaged
in consortiums in international JVs. We received a representation on
that from the CBI this morning. The CBI believes</div>
<a name="100316113000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the Bill
as written does not take due account, nor can it properly cope with,
the realities of a variety of corporate structures. This is
particularly the case for joint ventures in all their forms, project
work, construction, extractives and the financial
sector.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
states:</div><a name="100316113000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
cannot be right that business finds itself criminally liable where it
has little, limited or no ability to influence or control its partners.
This is not to say that UK business fails to exercise the influence
that it can within the constructs of the contractual or business
relationship. The CBI is worried that failure to recognise and act on
these concerns will have a detrimental effect on UK competitiveness,
not just in terms of existing arrangements but potential future
business.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Henley spoke about this matter in the other place and provided an
insight into the concerns of some businesses. He
said:</div><a name="100316113000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Much
international business in the petroleum, mineral, banking, financial
and construction industries is conducted through consortia or
contractors who have sole or overall responsibility for a
project.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
continued to say that a UK company&#146;s relationship with other
entities</div><a name="100316113000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
not one of control, but regulated by contract only. In many cases, the
partners may be state entities. A UK company, especially in one of the
extractive industries, may have no choice but to take a state entity as
a partner. It can investigate potential partners and then monitor them
for bribery, using contractual provisions or by exercising its maximum
influence. The latter is regarded as acceptable in United States
practice, and that may be the maximum extent of the control of its
fellow consortium member that the UK company would be able to
exercise.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c. GC57.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div><a name="100316113000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
can be no doubt, however, that partners in such industries mutually
perform services. If the Bill was passed unamended, in certain regions
and in respect of certain resources, a UK partner company would have no
choice but to abstain from participation in certain projects, or worse
to pull out of the consortium altogether. What is the Minister&#146;s
view on whether the provisions in the Bill will be sensitive enough to
deal with such
situations?</div><a name="100316113000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000573"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. There are a
number of collaborations&#151;Airbus is a prime
example&#151;involving several countries and companies of different
types that sell products abroad. There is a real risk that, as a
minority participant, as we used to be through British Aerospace, a
British company could be prosecuted, but the other companies involved,
from the rest of continental Europe, would not
be.</div>
<a name="100316113000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000574"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend gives a good example. This is a
real problem. Companies will often go into partnership with others
through joint ventures. They might start with a majority stake but over
time, due to a contract proviso, that may be sold down to smaller
stake, at which point control is lost and the ability of the British
company to manage the relationship becomes weaker, which means that the
problem that he raises becomes more acute.</div>
<a name="100316113000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of equal
concern to business groups is the competitiveness of UK bribery laws
when compared with those of other countries and potential competitors.
For example, the USA and its feared Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act&#151;with which parallels have been drawn throughout the
Bill&#146;s passage&#151;recognises, particularly in its audit
provisions, the importance of the degree of control when deciding a
company&#146;s responsibility for bribery by associates. The Bill
makes no such allowances, as the sole criterion is whether services are
being performed. The cost to British business due to that could be
considerable, and it would rise to an even greater magnitude if UK
companies had to withdraw from existing groups because of the
Bill&#146;s
impact.</div><a name="100316113000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000575"></a>John
Howell:</b> I am sorry if I raised this point prematurely in
an earlier debate, but the typical agent is much stronger and more
powerful than those companies for which he is agent. Does my hon.
Friend agree that that is another indication that the practicalities
were not thought through before the Bill was
published?</div><a name="100316113000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000576"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend raised that point in an earlier
debate and he rightly makes it again. This is a sensitive area and we
could easily get things wrong. As businesses are saying, I do not think
that we have received enough indication from the Government about how
the provisions will be put into practice. I can understand why,
particularly in certain sectors, such as joint ventures in developing
countries, those involved would be very concerned about exactly where
they stand in relation to the application of the clause. In any event,
companies from other jurisdictions will quickly fill the places that
might have been available for UK
enterprise.</div><a name="100316113000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concern
was raised by the Joint Committee about the consequences of the
Bill&#146;s application to joint ventures and subsidies. The time
constraints imposed on the Joint Committee prevented it from reviewing
the issue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>in detail, but it made specific reference to its concerns and the need
for future debate. The Joint Committee said:</div>
<a name="100316113000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
limited time that was available to complete our inquiry has prevented
us from focusing on this issue in more detail. However, we note that a
parent company&#146;s liability for a subsidiary is one of the issues
due to be considered as part of the Law Commission&#146;s general
review of corporate criminal liability and we anticipate that the Law
Commission&#146;s conclusions will valuably inform future debate on
this difficult
issue.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Tunnicliffe, when speaking for the Government in the other place,
noted:</div>
<a name="100316113000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
formulation of the defence under Clause 7 is broad enough to cater for
different corporate structures: including contractors, consortia and
joint ventures. The Government are also committed to publishing
guidance on the meaning of adequate procedures well before this offence
is brought into
force.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Under-Secretary will say whether that is included in the draft of
the draft that we have just
received.</div><a name="100316113000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Tunnicliffe also
stated:</div><a name="100316113000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are considering what guidance may be appropriate in respect of
different corporate structures. This is not a one-size-fits-all
approach. The procedures should be appropriate to the circumstances of
the enterprise.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC51-58.]</div><a name="100316113000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to make two points about that, and I hope that the first
will be the easier one to answer. Will there be further details on the
form of guidance that we will get in this area. Will the
Under-Secretary explain the extent to which she has discussed it with
business? Do the Government intend to consult on this area, and, if so,
will she tell us the time frame
involved?</div><a name="100316113000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Tunnicliffe was good enough to give us a taste in the other place of
what can be expected, but I hope that the Under-Secretary will
elaborate on what he said. He stated on
Report:</div><a name="100316113000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
envisage that later sections of the guidance will cover, for example,
what organisations can do to plan, implement and monitor anti-bribery
policies...as will challenges faced by organisations when seeking
to put into place measures designed to deal with the risk of bribery on
their behalf by subsidiaries and other organisations with which they
are associated in a joint venture. It may be useful to include a
section detailing further useful reading materials-guidance published
by the Serious Fraud Office, by business groups such as the ICC and by
NGOs such as Transparency International and the Institute of Business
Ethics.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2
February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
146.]</div><a name="100316113000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are we
to understand from that that the Government will be reproducing
sections of guidance from other organisations, or will they be
providing original and specific guidance? That is important, especially
when considered in the light of the Joint Committee&#146;s concerns,
which I have already
cited.</div><a name="100316113000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second aspect that I would like to draw out is the Government&#146;s
point about a one-size-fits-all approach. Business is uneasy with the
possible broad implications of the clause 7 offence. Following a review
of the debates in the other place and, indeed, our debates in Committee
today, it is clear that the Government&#146;s concession&#151;that
is what it was originally&#151;to produce statutory guidance is
motivated in no small part by such
concerns.</div><a name="100316113000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the phrase &#147;all the relevant circumstances&#148;
in clause 8(4) allows for account to be taken of the different dynamics
that relate to the sector, the size of company and the risks associated
with markets. It might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>go some way towards addressing the fact that the Bill pays scant regard
to the reality of corporate structures. In today&#146;s global
economy, the chain of command from head office to local employees might
be a long one, and proving the degree of supervision required to
prevent something from being done on one&#146;s behalf by a third
party might be extremely difficult. I will be grateful if the
Under-Secretary addresses that
issue.</div><a name="100316113000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
evidence to the Joint Committee, the legal adviser on the Bill
recognised those problems and commented, in response to a question by
Baroness
Whitaker:</div><a name="100316113000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recognise that the OECD has itself identified problems with foreign
subsidiaries.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
talked about what clauses 7 and 8 do together, and said that clause
8(4)</div><a name="100316113000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;makes
clear that whether a person or body was performing services on behalf
of another person is to be determined by reference to all the
circumstances. So you have to look at whether, first, A was performing
services for or on behalf of C. You then also have to look at whether
the bribe was in connection with C's business. So, obviously, the jury
and the court will be looking at those elements and, if it can be
established that there was this connection, then it is fair that C
shall be prima facie liable, but if the foreign subsidiary has no
connection with the UK other than its parent company being located
there, then we do not think it should be
caught&#148;</div><a name="100316113000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">by
the offence. He further
stated:</div><a name="100316113000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do not think that the question of ownership is sufficient justification
for taking jurisdiction over foreign
subsidiaries.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Under-Secretary would confirm that that is the
current
position.</div><a name="100316113000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
phrase &#147;all the relevant circumstances&#148; is too opaque for
businesses to apply practically to their dealings. They need some
signposts as to the elements that will be at the forefront of the
consideration of whether A is a person performing services for or on
behalf of them. We suggest that more emphasis needs to be placed on the
degree of control exercised by C, and I would like to know whether the
Under-Secretary agrees with that position. We would like to understand
from her why signposts on the factors that will be considered by
prosecutors and jurors cannot be formalised in the
Bill.</div><a name="100316113000435"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="100316113000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout
debate in Committee and in the other place, much has been made of the
need for prosecutorial discretion. In previous debates, we have
questioned the reliance of the Government on that. The amendment seeks
to facilitate such discretion, by clearly signposting those
considerations to which prosecutors should pay particular
attention.</div>
<a name="100316113000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concerns
that I have just set out have been raised by the International Chamber
of Commerce and other business groups, such as the CBI. It is often in
the nature of international business to operate in joint ventures. The
point was raised in the other place that a company, even though it may
have no control over a joint venture partner, may none the less be
caught by the provisions of the Bill, due to that partner&#146;s
conduct. Although the Government have previously attempted to explain
the problem, by stating that the degree of control would be one of the
circumstances taken into account when deciding whether an offence has
been committed, it is not clear to what extent such comfort would be
effective in law. There will be much to keep the lawyers busy as a
result.</div>

it stands, the Bill does not deal adequately with the possible
liability of a company for acts of bribery committed by a subsidiary or
joint venture company in which it holds an interest. The Joint
Committee was unable to come up with proposals to deal with that
because of shortage of time. It was allowed only a very busy 10 weeks
in which to consider the Bill. As a result, we are concerned that the
Bill does not include any recommendations on how to deal with the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000577"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Companies working in the third world sometimes make
donations to non-governmental organisations that provide associated
services such as medical care and some environmental benefit. Is there
a risk that a donation to an NGO may be perceived as a bribe, as with
political and corporate hospitality donations? Unless we get clear
reassurance from a Minister that it would not be included, might that
be drawn into the ambit of the Bill? If a community benefited via an
NGO from an oil or mining company, that might be perceived as a
bribe.</div><a name="100316113000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000578"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Under-Secretary might wish to come back on
that issue. If there is no financial advantage for the NGO, my
understanding is that such an application is unlikely, although the
provision might apply to the person paying the NGO if financial
advantage were involved. That gets complicated and I am sure the
Under-Secretary will be well briefed on the answer to that
question.</div>
<a name="100316113000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
will the Under-Secretary confirm that the Law Commission will consider
this gap when it reviews the law on corporate liability for crime? That
may be some time off. Meanwhile, the absence of rules in the Bill could
lead to difficulties for British business involved in joint ventures or
consortium arrangements. We would have preferred to have the matter
covered by the Bill and that is why the amendments were tabled. The gap
will have to be closed at some date, if not in Committee, but we
believe it should be as soon as possible, otherwise British business
could be left in the
dark.</div><a name="100316113000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000579"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am not sure that the joint venture problem is
as murky and difficult as the hon. Member for Huntingdon says, as long
as one breaks it into its constituent parts. In a joint venture, a
number of partners come together to create a joint venture vehicle. The
first question is whether, if that joint venture vehicle engages in
bribery, that should be part of the system established by clause 7 with
regard to failure to prevent bribery. I cannot see why the answer is
anything other than, &#147;Of course, the joint venture company is
acting on behalf of the people who create it. That is the whole point
of a joint venture.&#148; I cannot see why anyone should object to a
situation where, if one creates a joint venture vehicle and it acts
corruptly, one should claim that it was not acting on one&#146;s
behalf. That is clear to me.</div>
<a name="100316113000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000580"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> What if there is a 2 per cent. holding in the
joint venture, with a contractual clause that gives some power to
determine how it performs in certain
regards?</div><a name="100316113000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000581"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The question is this; what is the adequate
anti-bribery system to put in place, not only in the contractual
relationship between the partner and  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>the JV vehicle but in the JV vehicle itself? Of course, one would have a
chance to influence that or a chance not to take part in it if it was
inadequate. We have the adequacy provisions in front of us so that we
can judge that. That is the first point. I really do not think that
that is unclear at all.</div>
<a name="100316113000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point is what happens if the bribery is carried out by an employee of
the JV vehicle, so that the bribery is one step removed? However, that
depends on the attribution rules that apply to the JV vehicle with
regard to its own employees. If the attribution rules about
bribery&#151;not about the failure to prevent bribery, but about
bribery&#151;are such that the JV vehicle itself is then guilty of
bribery, the same applies. Again, I do not see any problem
there.</div>
<a name="100316113000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
we are not talking about what happens if the JV vehicle is guilty of
the crime of failure to prevent; that is a different question
altogether. I think that there is some confusion here between the two
crimes, the crime of bribery and the crime of failure to prevent
bribery.</div>
<a name="100316113000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
possibility is that one partner in the creation of the JV vehicle could
be held liable for what other partners do. That is a completely
separate question, but it is answered simply by applying the clause as
it stands. In those situations, there is no employer relationship and
there is probably no agency relationship. It is not a subsidiary, so I
would have thought that it would have been more difficult to establish
that there is a relationship of performing services for or on behalf of
the other JV partners, because they are all acting through the JV
vehicle.</div> <a name="100316113000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the clause provides a degree of flexibility. Whenever drafting provides
flexibility, people claim that it is unclear and of course when
drafting does not provide flexibility, they claim that it is unfairly
rigid. However, it seems to me that the three possibilities are dealt
with adequately by the clause as drafted, and the problems that the
hon. Member for Huntingdon is putting forward largely arise because he
seems to have conflated the three examples in the speech that he
made.</div>
<a name="100316113000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000582"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The amendment raises important factors, which need
to be considered. The issue at stake is whether particular emphasis
should be placed on the four factors listed in the amendment when a
court considers whether a person committing a bribery offence is a
person performing services for the commercial organisation charged with
a clause 7 offence. That is not to say that those four factors are not
important or should not be taken into account. There is no doubt that
the degree of control that a commercial organisation exerts over a
person is relevant to whether he or she performs services for the
organisation. However, the better course is not to elevate particular
factors relating to the degree of control but to leave it to the court
to decide which factors it wishes to take into account and what weight
to give to those factors.</div>
<a name="100316113000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8
provides that the question of whether a person is performing services
on behalf of an organisation is to be determined by reference to
&#147;all the relevant circumstances&#148;. We do not think that it
is necessary to explain that further in the Bill, by specifying
particular sets of circumstances that the court should take into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>account. It goes without saying that &#147;all the relevant
circumstances&#148; is likely to cover the extent of the
organisation&#146;s control over the person paying the bribes.
Therefore, the factors listed in the amendment may well be relevant,
but other factors that the court may wish to consider may also be
relevant.</div>
<a name="100316113000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
always the danger of adding a list such as the one contained in the
amendment. It can have the effect of elevating the importance of those
matters specified in the list to the exclusion of others, which may be
just as relevant or indeed more relevant in any given case. I believe
that this is a situation in which we can leave it to the good sense of
the court and the jury.</div>
<a name="100316113000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
other issues that have been raised relate to guidance, and instead of
repeating myself, it is more appropriate to return to them on clause 9.
However, the hon. Gentleman made a specific point that I want to draw
to his attention in respect of the Law Commission. My noble Friend,
Lord Tunnicliffe, made it clear in the other place
that</div><a name="100316113000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Following
a request from the now Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
in late 2008, and as a result of discussion with that department and
the Ministry of Justice in early 2009, the Law Commission's corporate
liability project took as its focus the use of the criminal law as a
way of promoting regulatory objectives or public interest goals,
particularly how businesses are treated by the criminal law.
Consequently, I advise the House that the liability of a parent company
for the acts of its subsidiary is outside the scope of the current
project. However, the Law Commission expects that this issue would fall
to be considered in a future project as part of a general review of the
law on corporate criminal liability.&#148;&#151; [<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 2 February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
142.]</div><a name="100316113000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that that deals with the point that the hon. Gentleman
raised.</div><a name="100316113000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000583"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I thank the Under-Secretary for saying a little
more about joint ventures. I had understood from the comments of the
hon. Member for Cambridge that the joint venture vehicle would be
liable in such circumstances, not the constituent parts, which are
separate corporate entities. Does she
agree?</div><a name="100316113000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000584"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> That would depend on the circumstances and whether
the joint venture were the corporate liability, and also whether the
companies that are component parts of the joint venture were liable. It
would depend very much on the circumstances of the offence, and in
which organisation the joint venture was formed. On that basis, I
encourage the hon. Member for Huntingdon to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="100316113000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000585"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Member for Cambridge said that the
matter is straightforward, although it did not sound straightforward to
me. I will consider what he said, and perhaps return to the matter
later.</div><a name="100316113000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary said that the issue was important, and we agree. She
then said that it should be left to the courts, backed up by guidance,
which we do not yet have, except in a draft of a draft form that we
have not had a chance to examine. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="100316113000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

about commercial organisations preventing
bribery</div><a name="100316113000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000586"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment 14, in
clause 9, page 6, line 10, after
&#145;section 7(1)&#146;, insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;at least 30 business days prior to sections
1, 2 and 6 coming into
force&#146;.</div><a name="100316113000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that it is extremely difficult under the law as it stands to
prosecute a company for failure to prevent bribery carried out on its
behalf. The clause 7 offence will require all corporations conducting
business to treat bribery as a very serious issue, and compel them to
set up proper systems to prevent bribery on their
behalf.</div><a name="100316113000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
9 as drafted requires the Secretary of State to publish guidance on
procedures that relevant commercial organisations can put in place to
prevent bribery. There was much debate in the other place on this
issue, and that ultimately resulted in the current formulation of
clause 9. We welcomed the Government amendment that was forthcoming in
the other place, but as drafted, the clause still has serious problems.
Our amendment seeks to draw out from the Government a statutory
commitment to ensure that the guidance that has been alluded to
throughout our debates in Committee and in the other place is published
in a timely fashion to ensure that businesses have time to consider how
the laws will apply. Although I have not had long to look at the draft
of the draft, I must say that it needs a little more work, as most
members of the Committee will
agree.</div><a name="100316113000436"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="100316113000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee was emphatic about the need for guidance before the
offences become law. It said:</div>
<a name="100316113000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no reason why the preparation of official guidance should delay the
passage of a Bribery Bill. It should, however, be available for use
before the offences come into force in order to give businesses time to
prepare for its
introduction.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
acknowledge that in the other place the Government moved considerably
in response to amendments, and we hope with our amendment to go the
final hurdle and ensure that the guidance is workable. Lord Tunnicliffe
recognised the importance of guidance,
stating</div><a name="100316113000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
recognise that the offences in this Bill are a special case and that
guidance is necessary to assist those who might be directly affected by
the offences in this
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to note that the guidance formulation procedure was already
under way with Ministry of Justice officials
meeting</div><a name="100316113000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
a number of experts from organisations such as Transparency
International, the Institute of Business Ethics and the Anti-Corruption
Forum about what should be included in the
guidance&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>7
January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC51.]</div><a name="100316113000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
notice that business organisations were not included, and I should be
grateful if the Under-Secretary explained which business organisations
she or her Department officials have met.</div>
<a name="100316113000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who are the
other stakeholders, and what progress on the guidance has been made to
date? Has it moved on from the draft of the draft? Is the fuller
version under way? Lord Goodhart offered a snapshot of the clear
justification for guidance, when he said:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div><a name="100316113000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Penalties
under Clause 7 could be very serious, so we believe that it is
necessary to provide guidance so that corporations are not at risk of
straying unintentionally into a field in which they may become liable
for serious consequences.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords, </i>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC47.]</div><a name="100316113000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Liberal Democrats seem at one with us on the
issue.</div><a name="100316113000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guidance
will be crucial to ensure both the proper practical implementation of
the Bill, and that it does not have a detrimental effect on business.
That will be especially important for those companies operating in
areas in which bribery is seen as the norm among briber and recipient
alike. With one eye on the parliamentary timetable and the other on the
usual timetable for producing draft guidance, it seems unlikely that we
will be producing guidance before the general
election.</div><a name="100316113000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is essential that, before companies are charged under or bound by a
statute that requires adequate provision, they should know what the
Government believe to be adequate provision in principle and what it
would be in their particular case. The potential disproportionate
impact of the Bill on businesses if guidance is not produced in a
timely fashion could be devastating. It is all very well for larger
companies to obtain advice from specialist lawyers, but it is not so
easy for smaller companies to obtain the necessary advice that would be
desirable. It is not an area of law that can be found in the average
high street
practice.</div><a name="100316113000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
evidence to the Joint Committee, the UK Anti-corruption Forum added
that it was costing companies large amounts to develop policies and
seek advice on a fragmented basis. The need for guidance attracted
widespread consensus throughout the evidence-gathering sessions before
the Joint Committee. The issue of immediate concern to business and
that forms the focus of the amendment is compliance guidance, which
should be differentiated from prosecution
guidance.</div><a name="100316113000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Director of Public Prosecutions accepted that centrally issued guidance
on prosecution policy could be prepared by prosecutors under the
superintendence of the Attorney-General. He anticipated that it would
outline the approach that prosecutors would take under the proposed
offences, while noting that no other Department could provide such
guidance since it would undermine prosecutorial independence. That is
to be welcomed, and we very much support the DPP&#146;s stance, but
our aim with the amendment is to focus on so-called compliance
guidance, which is far more important to businesses in the short term,
as was recognised by the
DPP.</div><a name="100316113000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
it stands, we are in a rather interesting position. It is not that
businesses lack information or guidance. We are informed that the OECD
is working on good practice guidance on internal ethics and that
controls are due to be published later in the year, which the
Government will undoubtedly wish to reflect in their guidance.
Organisations such as Transparency International and the Global
Infrastructure Anti-Corruption Centre have published on their websites
an impressive range of anti-bribery strategies. In evidence to the
Joint Committee, Louise Delahunty of the law firm Simmons and Simmons
noted the plethora of international sources of advice, and said that
the Government were best placed to bring clarity to the situation.
Business does not need more vague guidance. It needs definitive
guidance that carries the weight of law and the authority of
Parliament.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div><a name="100316113000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Tunnicliffe stated in Committee in the other place:</div>
<a name="100316113000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
guidance will also be designed with businesses of all sizes in mind.
What constitutes adequate procedures for one organisation will be over
the top for another. The procedures put in place by any organisation
must reflect the circumstances of that organisation. Indeed, the
flexibility of non-statutory guidance should help to achieve that
objective.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC52.]</div><a name="100316113000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is most welcome. Such proportionality and understanding of the concerns
of small business is remarkably lucid for a Government whose track
record on helping small business is generally less
sympathetic.</div>
<a name="100316113000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">His lordship
went on to indicate some of the Government&#146;s expectations as to
the scope and content of the letter. Having just received this letter,
it would be interesting to see to the extent to which it is reflected
in what the Minister in the other place said to the Grand
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000587"></a>Jeremy

of:</div>

the indicative nature and flexibility of the guidance and its relevance

application of the guidelines to small companies will need substantial
further
work&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000588"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that. The more we
hear about the guidance, the more complications seem to arise.
Forgetting the immediacy of having received the letter only today, but
putting it in the wider context of where we are in relation to the
Bill, it is unfortunate that this draft could have been received not
today but when the matter was being debated in the other place, or at
least before we had started our deliberations, as we could then have
given more thought to the matter. That would have been to the advantage
of all; I do not wish to make a party political point, but we are not
in that situation. I hope that my hon. Friends will take advantage of
my remarks and read the letter, so that they can make constructive
comments when we come to the stand part
debate.</div><a name="100316113000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will recall that the issues that guidance were said to cover
would be: the responsibilities of an organisation&#146;s board of
directors; the identification of a named senior officer with particular
responsibility for combating bribery; risk management procedures; gifts
and hospitality policy; facilitation payments; staff training;
financial controls; and reporting and investigation procedures. It
would help if, in the stand part debate, the Minister were to tell us
to what extent those headings have been developed in the letter that we
have just received. It was said to be a non-exhaustive list of the
topics that guidance would cover.</div>
<a name="100316113000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">A promise in

Government guidance was forthcoming, but was never delivered upon.
Unfortunately, such assurances seem to have been the source of some

Henley&#146;s summation of the debate on this part of the Bill. I

draft will be available by

that it will not be enough and that we will wish to come back to this

out, the promised draft of the draft was not
forthcoming.</div><a name="100316113000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that the Secretary of State touched on the matter on Second

need to keep in mind the Joint Committee&#146;s finding that there is

but the important thing is to have authoritative guidance from the
Government that can be relied upon by business. The mere fact that it
has come from the Ministry of Justice, among the many international
authorities putting up guidance, would not make it authoritative.
However, guidance done under the authority of Parliament tells the
court that the guidance must be taken into account and, as such, it is
a far more effective remedy for people who are extremely anxious about
such a serious offence. The guidance proposed is to be introduced for
the first time and it is very difficult to say what the ultimate
consequences might
be.</div><a name="100316113000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument was put forward most forcefully by Lord Mackay in the other
place, drawing support from a number of those present, with Lord Thomas
of Gresford&#146;s perhaps the most eloquent summary of the problem
faced if the guidance was not in a form that was reviewed by
Parliament&#151;I ask the Minister to consider those words most
carefully before
responding:</div><a name="100316113000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
there is a case against a company that is charged with an offence of
strict liability&#151;very unusual in criminal law&#151;and it puts
forward as part of its defence that it was relying on procedures 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>that it had read about in some book or other, written by somebody with
some authority and experience in the area, the judge can easily tell
the jury to ignore all that. There is no force behind what an
individual has written in a book or set of procedures. There is no
force behind anything like that. It is very different if the guidance
is under a statutory power and the judge must tell the jury that it
must take into account the fact that procedures which have statutory
backing were relied on&#151;or that is the defence&#151;by the
company that stands before it, charged with a strict liability
offence.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>7
January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC55.]</div><a name="100316113000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
matter that was briefly touched upon was the Department that was to
draft the guidance. In the other place discussion revolved around
whether the Ministry of Justice or BIS should produce the compliance
guidance. Will the Minister confirm which Department is to draft the
final guidance? How will the Departments work together on
that?</div><a name="100316113000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee highlighted the concerns expressed by the Secretary of
State for Justice in relation to the possibility of the Department
producing authoritative guidance. Some suggestions in the
evidence-gathering sessions before the Joint Committee posited a middle
ground based on the current money laundering regulations, whereby
guidance is produced by professional bodies, which would then be given
official status through recognition by the Government. Such guidance
would be admissible as evidence in court as to whether an offence had
been committed. Herbert Smith, the law firm, was particularly
supportive of that idea, believing that it would promote and publicise
best practice and ease the burden considerably on organisations
complying with the alleged offender. Have the Government given any
thought to those
suggestions?</div><a name="100316113000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point for consideration is the concern expressed in the
submission of the International Chamber of Commerce, which stated that
it is crucial that the primary partners in the consultations are the
businesses on which responsibility for implementation of the guidance
will devolve. As the ICC states, there is a fund of good will from
business for simplification and clarification of the law, and a deeper
knowledge of the problems and opportunities than any possessed by other
stakeholders. It is important that business be accorded adequate time
to participate in consultations and, subsequently, to adopt the settled
guidance.</div><a name="100316113000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I direct the Committee&#146;s attention to the Secretary
of State&#146;s acceptance of the fundamentals of the amendment on
Second
Reading:</div><a name="100316113000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
guidance will be issued before the Bill comes into force-although not,
obviously, before it becomes law-and we will ensure that businesses and
organisations representing them have time to digest it before the
sections of the Act to which it relates come into
force.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 3 March 2010; Vol. 506,

am pleased to see that we agree on the needs of British business in the
context of producing the guidance, although I am not sure it is being
done in practice. My one remaining concern is that, given the current
parliamentary timetable, there is a need to secure that assurance in
statute to give business the certainty it
needs.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000589"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I noticed that the hon. Member for Huntingdon
strayed rather a long way from the amendment in his remarks and asked
the Minister questions that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>relate to clause stand part. Would it now be reasonable to continue
combining the clause stand part and amendment debates? [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;Hear,
hear.&#148;]</div><a name="100316113000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000590"></a>The
Chair:</b> Whether I give a direction on that as an acceptable
way to proceed is a matter for the Committee, given that we now have
the letter and the guidance. I am conscious that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon spoke specifically to his amendment, so I will be guided by
the Minister if she wishes to make a
suggestion.</div>
<a name="100316113000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000591"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The amendment is important in the wider context of
what guidance there should be, how it will be formed and when it will
be available, and the hon. Member for Huntingdon raised those issues.
It would be helpful to extend that to deal with clause stand part at
the same
time.</div><a name="100316113000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000592"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The answer to the question will depend on
whether the points I have raised are answered by the Minister in a way
that covers what I wanted to cover in the clause stand part debate, and
I have yet to hear that.</div>
<a name="100316113000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000593"></a>The
Chair:</b> My co-Chair, Sir Nicholas Winterton, expressed in
his introductory remarks a hope that there would be a degree of
collaboration in the Committee. Having allowed the hon. Member for
Huntingdon to go slightly wide of his amendment, and in view of what
the Minister has said, I think that we can proceed on that
basis.</div><a name="100316113000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000594"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Thank you, Ms Walley. That is helpful. I will
speak first to the amendment. The hon. Member for Huntingdon mentioned
the speech my noble Friend Lord Goodhart made in the other
place&#151;I will not repeat those remarks&#151;which indicated
that in general the hon. Gentleman is making quite a good point. It
seems to me that that is a new way of setting up that area of law. The
guidance will be important, however it works technically, so it would
be a good idea to give businesses some lead-in time to understand their
new responsibilities. I think that his general point in that regard is
right.</div><a name="100316113000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Technically,
the amendment is a bit odd because it refers to the coming into force
of sections 1, 2 and 6, but not of section 7, which seems peculiar to
me. Nevertheless, the general idea is okay and the guidance seems
largely to be what was expected. There is obviously more work to be
done. For example, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth referred to
a passage in brackets stating
that</div><a name="100316113000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
application of the guidelines to small companies will need substantial
further work&#148;.</div>
<a name="100316113000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is just a
&#147;note to self&#148;, rather than part of the guidance, so
clearly it needs more work. It seems to be along the lines we all
expected.</div> <a name="100316113000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance contains many points on process, and that is the key point to
grasp. That is one reason why it is reasonable to ask for a lead-in
time. If companies are to be asked to conduct risk assessment, for
example, that will take time. The guidance is plainly the kind of thing
one would expect, with regard to developing written policies and
procedures. That seems to be the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>kind of thing one would expect some time to consider, although the hon.
Member for Huntingdon is correct that there is much material out in the
world that companies can draw upon and that many companies already
use.</div>
<a name="100316113000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the clause should proceed on the present basis. It is a good start
towards the guidance that is necessary. I will make one further point
on why the matter is about adequacy and not reasonableness. The list of
things mentioned in the guidance includes quite a few items that will
have a cost to companies. It takes resources to develop policies and
undertake risk assessments. The point is that companies cannot pray in
aid the cost to say that they should not have to do those things; they
must do them. If the test were reasonableness, they might be able to
say, &#147;We needn&#146;t do it, because it might be too
costly.&#148; That is the important difference between the two. The
hon. Gentleman is right that the guidance is about adequacy, not
reasonableness. However, it is a good start, and I look forward to the
further development of the
work.</div><a name="100316113000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000595"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> The issue raised by my hon. Friend&#146;s
amendment is important, as the hon. Member for Cambridge said. It is
relevant to quote what the Secretary of State said about the general
principle at stake. One would think that it was basic common sense. If
we are trying to assist businesses in understanding what is expected of
them, particularly&#151;to refer to our previous debate&#151;how to
put adequate procedures in place in order to provide themselves with a
possible defence under clause 7, we must give them some detail about
what they can be expected to consider. It does not seem reasonable to
implement the clause without giving businesses some indication of what
the measures will be and plenty of notice so that they can comply in
good time, especially if, as the hon. Member for Cambridge said, they
are structural measures involving substantial changes to how companies
do
business.</div><a name="100316113000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not seem that there can be any sensible argument against giving
guidance before the offences become relevant. Otherwise, it could lead
to convictions. The only question might be how far in advance the
guidance should be made available. My hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon suggested 30 business days. If the Minister disagrees with
that period, I have no doubt that an appropriate period can be
discussed, but it seems reasonable to me. I hope that, in the spirit of
helpfulness that she mentioned, she will accept the amendment. As I
said, it seems to be in line with what the Secretary of State said.
More importantly, perhaps, it is in line with straightforward common
sense.</div>
<a name="100316113000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
widely&#151;you indicated, Ms Walley, that we may also engage in
stand part debate on this clause&#151;it is interesting to read the
draft outline. I have had some opportunity to do so, and have quoted it
already. I accept what the hon. Member for Cambridge says: none of it
is guidance yet, and a lot of it is an indication of the
Government&#146;s current thinking.</div>
<a name="100316113000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
even the Government&#146;s current thinking gives cause for concern.
As I quoted during an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon, two contradictory things are likely to be included in the
foreword:</div>
<a name="100316113000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Stressing
the indicative nature and flexibility of the guidance and its relevance
to large and small organisations alike&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div><a name="100316113000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Either we assist small
businesses in understanding what specific measures they, as distinct
from large multinationals, need to take, or we produce guidance
relevant to large and small organisations alike. I do not see that we
can do both. If assisting small businesses with a degree of flexibility
is not in the writing of the guidance but in its application, that does
not seem to provide the clarity and certainty for which those small
businesses will ask and which they are entitled to expect. It is cause
for
concern.</div><a name="100316113000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
draft guidance is the most skeletal of skeletons. It does not give us
much help in terms of what precisely will be said, but it outlines a
whole list of things that businesses ought to be doing, according to
the Government&#146;s guidance. The suggestion must surely be that if
businesses do those things properly, their chances of being prosecuted
for a bribery offence or, at the very least, their chances of
succeeding on a defence of having installed adequate procedures must be
substantially changed.</div>
<a name="100316113000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister can help us with an answer to this question. If the guidance
is produced and follows the outline that we have before us and if a
business of any size has implemented every single one of the things set
out in the draft outline, can it therefore be confident that it has
done everything that it needs to do to insulate itself from a bribery
prosecution or, at the very least, a bribery conviction? Otherwise,
what is it for and what is the adequacy referred to in clause
7?</div><a name="100316113000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not see what else a business is supposed to do. If it is being asked
to demonstrate that it has done whatever it needs to in order to put in
place adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with
the company from undertaking &#147;such
conduct&#148;&#151;conduct related to bribery&#151;what is it
supposed to do other than have a look at the guidance and all the
things that the guidance suggests a well run company that is serious
about tackling bribery should do? If it completes all those
things&#151;if it does every single one and puts a tick in every
single box&#151;is it then entitled to say that it is not at risk of
being prosecuted for bribery? It seems not, because also likely to be
included in the foreword is the
following:</div><a name="100316113000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Make
clear that the guidance is merely guidance and not a blueprint for
companies or a covert regulatory approach; the procedures companies put
in
place&#148;</div><a name="100316113000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">are</div><a name="100316113000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ultimately
for them and whether they are adequate will, in the last resort, be a
matter of fact for the
courts&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
one level, of course that is common sense. In the end, no guidance will
be able to specify exactly every single set of circumstances that might
arise in every single
prosecution.</div><a name="100316113000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come back to the issue of how helpful we are trying to be. Are we
saying, &#147;Here is a set of things that you as a company may or
may not choose to do, potentially spending considerable resource in
doing them, but none of them may save you from a prosecution or,
indeed, a conviction&#148;? It is worth bearing it in mind that for
many companies, given the reputational impact of being subject to a
prosecution in the first place, it may well be the issue of a
prosecution that concerns them, rather than necessarily a conviction.
We would make a mistake to assume that all companies would be saved by
the fact that they were not going to be convicted even if they were
prosecuted. This is at least partly a question of whether a prosecution
is instituted in the first place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div><a name="100316113000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
reassurance will the guidelines, when they are eventually fleshed out,
provide? There are two questions to be asked. First, why on earth would
the guidance not be produced in advance of the offences becoming
active? Indeed, what possible argument could there be for not giving a
decent period of notice beforehand? Secondly, even if one does all
that, how useful will the guidelines be in dealing with the point of
adequacy and enabling businesses to do all that they need to do to
satisfy themselves that they will not be liable to a prosecution? Those
are the two relevant questions to ask in relation to the
guidelines.</div><a name="100316113000335"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000596"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I have some concerns about Government
back-pedalling in respect of when the guidance will be published. In
the other place, the commitment given was that the guidance would be
available well in advance of the new offences coming into force, but
the explanatory notes, dated 9 February, merely say that the
Government</div><a name="100316113000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has
indicated its intention to publish guidance ahead of the commencement
of clause
7&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
seems to me to be a difference between a good lead-in period and just
saying that guidance will be published &#147;ahead of&#148;
commencement. I would welcome the Government&#146;s making it clear
what is
planned.</div><a name="100316113000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister will know, the CBI has stressed
that</div><a name="100316113000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;full
and comprehensive guidance is vital. To achieve this...the
Government must ensure that consultation with companies plays a major
part in its preparation and updating, and that there is a realistic
timescale for business to implement the guidance once it has been
agreed. We would expect to have a clear commitment on both points from
the Justice
Secretary&#148;&#151;</div><a name="100316113000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">obviously,
we have the Under-Secretary before us. That issue does matter. I think
that 30 business days is rather modest. I should have thought more than
that might be required and I would be grateful to hear from the
Under-Secretary what she has in mind for the
timing.</div><a name="100316113000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
turning to the point about small business that I have been
making&#151;I want to ask some questions about the
document&#151;there is the requirement, of course, to liaise with
Scottish Ministers. Clearly, it is important that they should be
consulted in accordance with subsection (3), and it would be
useful if the Under-Secretary gave us an update on
that.</div><a name="100316113000438"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="100316113000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
small business, the Under-Secretary will remember the passage that I
highlighted from the report of the Joint Committee on the draft Bribery
Bill. There was a lot of agreement that the idea of adequate procedures
required amplification through guidance. It noted the need
for</div><a name="100316113000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
&#145;light-touch&#146; approach endorsed by the Impact Assessment
for small firms in low risk sectors where it may be sufficient to
demonstrate that &#145;anti-bribery principles have been fully
communicated to its
workforce&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
hon. Members would agree that there is a danger for small business,
which already has a considerable amount coming down the pipeline. The
British Chambers of Commerce estimated recently that there is
&#163;26.5 billion worth of regulation in cumulative costs
in the pipeline. Small business often says that over-regulation is a
disaster for it. It was welcome that the impact assessment said that
there would be a light-touch approach for small business in sectors
where the risk was low.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="100316113000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at
the document that the Under-Secretary has produced, I am concerned that
there may be a bit of backsliding there too. It has some of the
hallmarks of the gold-plating that Whitehall loves. A small business
man would have to feel for the smelling salts as he read the list on
page 2 under the title &#147;Risk assessment and management&#148;.
It
starts:</div><a name="100316113000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Conducting
a thorough risk assessment&#151;e.g. looking at the risks arising
from doing business in specific
regions&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that is designed for big businesses that go overseas regularly, not for
small firms in low-risk areas, it is a very different ball game. It
would be helpful if this document made it clear that it is not
backsliding from the impact assessment and that small business will get
a reasonable
result.</div><a name="100316113000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
part
on</div><a name="100316113000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Assessing
risks of large public sector
contracts&#148;</div><a name="100316113000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">is

words:</div><a name="100316113000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Risk
mitigation&#151;establishing anti-bribery procedures to deal with the
specific risks
identified&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are talking about major businesses such as British Airways, which is
in the news, or British Aerospace, this may well be meat and drink to
them. However, for a small business in Hertfordshire that just wants to
sell some goods in China, having to go through an onerous, heavyweight
procedure suitable for one of the companies with
&#147;British&#148; in its name is not what is required. The
document goes
on:</div><a name="100316113000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ongoing
risk management and
monitoring&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
all sounds to me like big business
stuff.</div><a name="100316113000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
document improves in the section
entitled:</div><a name="100316113000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clear
and practical policies and
procedures&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
this is the bit for small business. It talks
about:</div><a name="100316113000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Developing
written anti-bribery policies that are effectively communicated to
employees and external
stakeholders&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is almost the wording in the impact
assessment.</div><a name="100316113000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
section entitled &#147;Appropriate implementation&#148; talks
of</div><a name="100316113000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Embedding
anti-bribery policies into the administrative structure of the
organisation&#151;e.g. making sure that legal advisers, HR
department, training teams, communications department etc. are signed
up to new
policies&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sounds like it is talking not of a successful small business in
Letchworth trying to sell goods overseas, but of a massive organisation

stage.</div><a name="100316113000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000597"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I agree with what my hon. Friend is saying. Does
he agree that we should give specific consideration to new businesses
that are setting up afresh because they are likely to be put off by
this raft of guidance and
legislation?</div><a name="100316113000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000598"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> We want new business to be aware that corruption
and anti-bribery policies are important. The problem is the scale of
what is required for a small enterprise. A small business setting up,
which is already being told that there is &#163;26.5 billion worth of
regulation in cumulative costs to the nation&#146;s businesses in the
pipeline, will then be faced with this document. Unless it is made
clear that small business at low risk may be a different proposition,
talk about the administrative structure of the organisation, legal
advisers, HR department, training teams and communications departments
may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>put people off. It goes on to state how the procedures would acknowledge
the stance and so on. That might be possible in a small organisation,
but there needs to be a section in the guidance that makes it clear
that what was in the original impact assessment is still important to
the Government; namely, light touch where it is right and some
explanation of that. I notice, for example, that the front page of the
draft outline states that</div>
<a name="100316113000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
application of guidelines to small companies will need substantial
further
work.&#148;</div><a name="100316113000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that means that we will get what the impact assessment said, but I
would like the Under-Secretary to reassure us, because that is an
important
issue.</div><a name="100316113000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000599"></a>John
Howell:</b> I look at this and think back to the start of my
business career, and I have to say that I am not sure that I would have
bothered. I just do not understand how, under the guidance, one can
plan. So much is left to the courts, and we do not know how that will
turn out. There is a lot of other uncertainty as well. If I heard the
Under-Secretary correctly, the key issue of the parent and subsidiary
relationship will be looked at later. The Under-Secretary is frowning
at me. Is that not what I heard as regards that relationship, which was
going to be looked at by the Law Commission and is now going to be
looked at? If she wants to correct me on that, I am happy to
acknowledge any misunderstanding.</div>
<a name="100316113000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said in
an earlier debate, we have a growing body of guidance, both vertically
and horizontally. The problem with that level of guidance is that,
despite its size, it is never complete. There are always cracks through
which things fall and I am not sure how those will be dealt with. The
issue of the volume of the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises
has been raised, but the advice that they can get and the advice that
is out there also needs to be looked at. The access to advice for SMEs
is completely different from that for large
companies.</div><a name="100316113000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
pick up on the last points made by my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire, on page 2 of the draft of a draft, he is
right to point out that all the evidence and early indications about
risk assessment are meant for large companies. From that point of view,
they are not only somewhat detailed but incredibly patronising. I have
not come across a large company that would not have undertaken a risk
assessment of going overseas that included a whole number of issues,
including an assessment of the culture&#151;not just the normal
culture, but the business culture&#151;and particularly aspects of
bribery and corruption. We have seen that sort of advice provided over
the years by the Government through UK Trade &amp; Investment, which
provides advice on doing business. I was involved in central and
eastern Europe as it came out of its communist period. There were huge
issues of bribery and corruption that were absolutely crucial to both
small and large businesses who wished to do business there. They turned
automatically to UKTI for advice to follow in order to stay clean in
that area, and they were given that advice.</div>
<a name="100316113000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
section, &#147;Clear and practical policies and procedures&#148;,
tells businesses in detail how they will interface with their employees
and their external stakeholders, and the sort of communications
programmes that they will run. Many large companies will find that
level of detail incredible and patronising. The points made about the
impact on SMEs have already been made fully and are well worth
making.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div><a name="100316113000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Joint Committee, the issue was raised of Government advice, and of
a Government advisory organisation to help businesses with the very
things that fall through the gaps. The Joint Committee rejected that
suggestion on the grounds that there might be a conflict with cases
that were brought later. In that case, we would need to know what
practical advice will be given to supplement the guidance when we find
things that fall through the cracks. If that rejection applies to a new
advisory group, does it also apply to the sort of advice that UK Trade
&amp; Investment created and, to my knowledge, still gives at the level
of detail that I have indicated? Without wishing to be too pessimistic
and negative, I would feel hard done by&#151;I was going to say as a
big businessman, but that might be taken as too personal a
statement&#151;as a businessman in a large company because of the
patronising nature of the guidance, and as a businessman in a small
company I would feel totally bewildered and unable to plan for any
operation that I might want to
undertake.</div><a name="100316113000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000600"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I do not know whether my hon. Friend noticed, but
the CBI today said how helpful an advisory service or a point of
reference for business would
be.</div><a name="100316113000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000601"></a>John
Howell:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for mentioning that. I do
not feel strongly about whether the advice is provided by a new
advisory service or through existing Departments. What we need to know
is what the advice will consist of and how it will be delivered. That
information is missing from all the documentation we have, and it is
crucial to ensuring that the proposals work on a practical level,
rather than just at a level that is acceptable to lawyers and
academics. People such as me, who have spent their career in business,
need to know how to adapt their businesses to meet the Bill&#146;s
objectives.</div><a name="100316113000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000602"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> I have looked briefly through the guidance outline
and a lot of it sounds non-controversial and sensible. To start off
with, it says that the guidance
will:</div><a name="100316113000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Emphasise
that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to drag down well-run
companies for isolated incidents of bribery committed by rogue
officials&#148;.</div><a name="100316113000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sounds like a sensible approach. Clearly, if a business has repeat
offenders there may be a cultural problem, and those offenders may well
come to the notice of the prosecution authorities. However, this
proposal involves some heavy costs&#151;I do not say that it is a bad
thing. I think that the most honest place in the world to do business
is Finland. It always comes out top, and Canada is pretty
high.</div><a name="100316113000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all know that there are parts of the middle east and Africa where there
is a problem, and public policy and honesty in the fight against
corruption are essential in improving the lot of many of the people who
live in those areas of the world. If a business is conducting a risk
assessment of whether to do business in a particular area, clearly
there is a higher risk in some areas than others. Will it be held
against a company if it does business in a high-risk area, or should
the risk assessment be about trying to avoid getting caught up in the
cultural problems of that area? I see the guidance as saying that if a
company does business in a high-risk country or sector, or if it is
doing a public sector project, it should beware, because it will get
itself into trouble. That may well lead to the conclusion that that is
not a place where one wants to go.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="100316113000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">One therefore
has to consider a number of issues. Are we trying to put businesses off
trading in areas where there are problems, or do we want British
companies with best practice to get involved in such areas? The
consequence of a British company with best practice going to an area
where bribery and corruption are endemic is that at some point it will
get caught up in the difficulties of doing business there. It is
probably better that we do business in those areas and try to raise
standards, but I do not believe that we will necessarily move to a
perfect situation straight
away.</div><a name="100316113000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other thing about due diligence on business partners, employment,
business opportunities or business operations in a foreign country is
that information is sometimes not forthcoming. Sometimes people lie to
businesses. If you ask, &#147;Have you bribed anybody this year,
Mr. Smith?&#148;, the answer may well be no, but his
record may be somewhat different. There are difficulties, including
with companies keeping blacklists of people. So there is a need for
careful thought, and I am sure that the Minister will reassure us with
her
comments.</div><a name="100316113000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000603"></a>Claire

Walley&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="100316113000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100316113000604"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. There is a Division in the House. As it has
been brought to my attention that the Committee is likely to sit late
tonight, I propose to suspend the Committee for an hour, and for food,
until 8
o&#146;clock.</div><a name="100316113000439"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000193"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I think I had got to, &#147;well,&#148; or
something along those lines. I hope that we are all a little refreshed
after a dinner break. I will start on a positive note, which is that it
has always been our intention to provide as much information to
businesses as possible. We understand the issues raised by
businesses.</div>
<a name="1003172000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon asked me whom we had met and discussed the
matters with. I shall give him an indication of the types of companies
and organisations we have engaged with to draw on their experience and
expertise on the issues: the Confederation of British Industry, the
International Chamber of Commerce, BP, Balfour Beatty, Shell,
Transparency International UK, British Telecom, GC100, Institute of
Business Ethics, Deloitte, Simmons and Simmons, and the Federation of
Small Businesses. I am sure that the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire would be pleased to hear about that last organisation in
particular.</div>
<a name="1003172000006"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have also
attended a conference with the AeroSpace and Defence Industries
Association of Europe. We are engaging with all those organisations
because many of them already have good guidance and procedures in place
that they follow to ensure they stay within the existing law. I need to
emphasis that, in many aspects of domestic law, bribery is obviously an
offence, and it is important that those companies abide by
that.</div><a name="1003172000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the importance that we place on having guidance, I have provided
assurances that we would make sure that guidance is in place. Indeed,
we introduced clause 9 because we recognised the importance of
guidance, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>which we will make available before clause 7 comes into force. The hon.
Member for Huntingdon has tabled an amendment that refers
to</div><a name="1003172000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at
least 30 business
days&#148;.</div><a name="1003172000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have said in the past that guidance should be introduced well before
the commencement of the clause 7 offence. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman&#151;I pre-empt him here&#151;will press me and say,
&#147;What do you mean by &#145;well before&#146;?&#148; I mean
well before 30 days. It is my intention to ensure that businesses have
as much opportunity as possible to consider the guidance. I accept the
spirit of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, which is the need to
ensure that businesses have an opportunity to consider the guidance
before the offence comes into force. However, on the basis of my
comments, it is not necessary to accept the
amendment.</div><a name="1003172000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that we have had an opportunity to extend the discussion to a clause
stand part debate, perhaps I can consider the guidance I have provided,
which is a draft outline. The guidance is very much at an embryonic
stage and is growing rapidly in the sense that we are continuing to
have those discussions with business and other stakeholders to ensure
that we get it right. That is why, for example, we have stated that the
application of the guidelines to small companies will need substantial
further work. We recognise that the guidelines will have to be read and
considered by large, international, multinational companies, as well as
by the small businesses that wish to avail themselves of the guidance.
On that basis, we need to make sure that the guidance is
appropriate.</div><a name="1003172000010"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000194"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Under-Secretary explain how the
Government intend to disseminate the guidance once it has been agreed?
That will presumably take place during the lead up of at least 30 days
to which I think she has committed the
Government.</div><a name="1003172000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000195"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> We continue to have that discussion with
organisations. Once the guidance is published&#151;I again make it
clear that the Secretary of State is responsible for it&#151;it will
not require parliamentary approval. Organisations such as the CBI, the
ICC, and many of the others that I have already listed with which we
are in consultation will have access to the guidance. That will ensure
that there is plenty of opportunity for businesses to consider
it.</div><a name="1003172000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000196"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Under-Secretary saying that she expects
the guidance to be disseminated through business organisations, or will
the Government find ways to disseminate it
themselves?</div><a name="1003172000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000197"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> There is a range of ways in which we can ensure that
businesses are well aware of the guidance, one of which is to make sure
that the organisations with which we are already in discussion are able
to pass and disseminate it through their support
networks.</div><a name="1003172000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000198"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> May I ask about another aspect? The Minister will
correct me if I am wrong, but I think that the regulatory impact
assessment refers to the possibility 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>of a lighter-touch regime in low-risk sectors. Is that likely to find
its way into the guidance? If not, how might it manifest
itself?</div><a name="1003172000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000199"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Some of the guidance will apply to some companies,
and all of it will apply to others. It is possible that all aspects of
the guidance will not be appropriate to some
companies.</div><a name="1003172000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000200"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I understand that. I think that the assessment
envisages organisations whose line of business means that bribery is
unlikely to rear its head, and such companies might not be expected to
meet the same requirements as others. Will companies in a low-risk
sector be expected to meet all of the guidance&#146;s recommendations
or will they be limited to a
subset?</div><a name="1003172000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000201"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Perhaps that would be better answered if I said that
there are no obligations for businesses under the Bill. The guidance
will simply be available to assist them in ensuring that their
procedures are adequate to prevent bribery. We have sought in our
discussions with businesses to draw on the existing experience and
expertise in aerospace, defence and security, which already have
extensive guidance in place. Those companies already know what is
appropriate to meet some of the conditions under
discussion.</div><a name="1003172000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will now deal with some of the other issues that have been raised. We
firmed up our commitment to provide guidance during the Lords stage of
the Bill by tabling an amendment, which is now clause 9. The clause
specifically requires the Secretary of State to publish guidance on the
procedures that commercial organisations can put in place to prevent
bribery by persons associated with them. It also includes a provision
for the guidance to be updated from time to time at the discretion of
the Secretary of State, who is also required to consult Scottish
Ministers before the guidance is
published.</div><a name="1003172000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire asked what the consultation
with Scottish Ministers will amount to. The Ministry of Justice is
discussing the drafting of the guidance with its Scottish counterparts.
The guidance will then be the subject of consultation with Scottish
Ministers before it is published.</div>
<a name="1003172000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">We, and all
who have so far helpfully assisted in the formulation of the guidance,
are of the view that any guidance should not be prescriptive. It is not
the role of Government to provide guidance for commercial organisations
on how to resist a criminal charge or to provide, in essence, a
tick-box approach for organisations on how to stay within the law.
Indeed, as the Joint Committee indicated, it is also important that the
meaning of &#147;adequate procedures&#148; is interpreted in a
flexible and proportionate way, depending, for example, on the size of
the company and the risks associated with the business sector in which
it
operates.</div><a name="1003172000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ongoing formulation of the guidance that members of the Committee have
in front of them this evening draws on the expertise of a wide range of
stakeholders. The guidance will set out what organisations can do to
prevent bribery. As Members will note from the outline document, we
intend for the guidance to highlight key principles: namely, top-down
commitment, risk assessment and management, clear and transparent
policies and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>procedures, effective implementation that goes beyond paper compliance,
effective due diligence of business relationships and open and accurate
reporting, monitoring and review. As the draft outline shows, the
guidance will refer to issues such as facilitation payments, corporate
hospitality, agents and intermediaries and joint ventures or syndicates
to the extent that they relate to the procedures that commercial
organisations can put in place to prevent
bribery.</div><a name="1003172000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
anticipate that the formulation of the guidance will continue over the
next couple of months, and we will continue to engage with businesses
and
stakeholders.</div><a name="1003172000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000202"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> We all understand the Under-Secretary&#146;s
point about the discretion of the courts&#151;of course it is right.
In the end, it will not be possible to present a tick-box list that
businesses can simply comply with and give them absolute immunity.
However, will she concede that if there was a list of recommendations
in the guidance that companies should follow and carry out, companies
would have a good defence under clause 7(2) of having put in place
adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with the
company from undertaking acts of bribery? Otherwise, one has to wonder
what the guidance is
for.</div><a name="1003172000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000203"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The guidance is exactly that&#151;it is guidelines
to ensure that companies address the issues. However, it would be wrong
for me to give an indication. Ultimately, it is for the courts to
decide whether a company has ensured that it has adequate procedures in
place. The issues that we are covering in the guidance direct the
companies to look at specific areas&#151;due diligence, their
relationships in joint ventures, whether their procedures are upheld,
whether they engage employees in the discussion of the policies, and
what sort of guidance they provide to their employees and how to do so.
Those are the sorts of things that companies will want to put in place.
However, I cannot give any commitment that by simply ticking all those
boxes, a court would consider that that in itself was adequate, because
there might be other factors that have to be taken into
account.</div><a name="1003172000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, I encourage the Committee to support clause 9 and the hon.
Member for Huntingdon to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="1003172000187"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.15
pm</div><a name="1003172000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000204"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We have had a full and helpful debate on the
amendment and the clause stand part. The hon. Member for Cambridge said
that the cost of compliance cannot be prayed in aid. I agree, but I am
not sure that that leads me to agree with him that the reasonable test
is not relevant, particularly when it does not yet appear in the draft
guidance, as I hope it will. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and
Kenilworth developed the argument by asking how the guidelines connect
with the underlying clause 7 offence. That is a vital issue. I am still
concerned that we have not quite got to the bottom of that, but it is a
different issue from the lead-in time. It is more a stand part
issue.</div>
<a name="1003172000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for North-East Hertfordshire gave a good justification for
the lead-in time and noted how reasonable we have been in suggesting 30
days. He made the important point that it is not just about producing
the guidance, but how it is disseminated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>to companies. He also warned about the hints of gold-plating he saw
coming out of the draft guidance, with the possibility of backsliding
as a result. We would certainly wish to avoid
that.</div><a name="1003172000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Henley voiced real concerns about how he
would feel as an ex-businessman looking at the guidance. This is of
great concern, not least because we need to keep in mind the very
severe penalties that exist under clause 7. I was impressed by his
ability to assimilate the draft guidance in a very short period. Given
the timing, we feel totally justified in coming forward with further
issues as we see them once we have considered the form of the guidance.
In the absence of my hon. Friend I will say that I have tabled an
amendment to discuss the advisory service, which was an issue that he
said was very important. He need not fear. We will be going back to
that.</div>
<a name="1003172000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pointed out
to the Minister that the clause 6 offence was not mentioned in the
draft guidance. I think she said in her concluding remarks that it
would
be.</div><a name="1003172000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000205"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> May I clarify that? The guidance relates to the
clause 7 offence and will relate to the clause 6 offence in as much as
it is about procedures operated by the company. The guidance is not
specifically about the clause 6 offence.</div>
<a name="1003172000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000206"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I will have to think further about that one. My
hon. Friend the Member for Poole reviewed the draft guidance and made
the important point about the need to review high-risk areas. Risk
assessments are an important issue to be covered in the guidance and
the proportionality resulting from that. I thank the Minister for her
full response on this issue. She has started this evening&#146;s
deliberations on a positive note.</div>
<a name="1003172000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000207"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> At least the Minister had the honesty to point out
that because her child was ill she could not get on top of the guidance
issue. It is difficult with
families.</div><a name="1003172000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000208"></a>Mr.

<a name="1003172000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000209"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I do not wish to labour that point, but I did not
say that I could not get on top of this issue. I am fully on top of
this issue, but I simply explained why hon. Members had received the
letter now compared with the date on which it was signed. I make that
point absolutely clear. I am very sorry that the hon. Gentleman sought
to lead the Committee along that route.</div>
<a name="1003172000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000210"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Moving on swiftly, we accept the spirit in which
the Minister spoke on the last clause and the confirmation that the
lead-in will be at least 30 days. Once we have guidance it will be
vital to disseminate it. I did not quite get the feeling that that much
thought had gone into that side of things yet. So I would be grateful
if she ensured that such preparations were progressed to save us time
when we take over in a few weeks time, of course.</div>
<a name="1003172000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
of what goes into the guidance hangs over this debate. I have already
put on record our concerns about how it is being collated and
organised, and I will not go into it again. I agree that we want to
stay away from a tick-box process on the guidance, which would be
counter-productive, but that does not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>make its content any less important for it to fulfil the adequate
procedures purpose of clause 7. With those remarks I am happy to ask
the Committee&#146;s leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1003172000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000213"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendments 15 and 16 will allow the Committee to
debate the constitutional position of the Attorney-General. Under the
law as set out in the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act
1889 and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, prosecutions for
bribery cannot be commenced without the consent of the
Attorney-General. However, the Bill gives prosecution powers to the
Director of Public Prosecutions, the director of the Serious Fraud
Office and the director of Revenue and Customs prosecutions in England
and Wales. Amendment 15 would reverse that by reinstating the
Attorney-General as the key individual in the prosecution consent
process.</div><a name="1003172000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to review the background to why we have a requirement for consent
to prosecute in the law of bribery. In our legal system, some offences
cannot be instituted without the prior consent to prosecute of the
Attorney-General. Under the law as it stands, prosecutions for bribery
cannot be commenced without such consent. So-called consent cases are
statutorily created with the requirement for consent to prevent certain
offences from being prosecuted in inappropriate circumstances. In a
memorandum to the 1972 Franks Committee, the Home Office set out five
reasons why certain offences require
consent:</div><a name="1003172000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
secure consistency in prosecution, e.g. where it is not possible to
define the offence very precisely so that the law goes wider than the
mischief aimed at or is open to a variety of interpretations; To
prevent abuse or bringing the law into disrepute, because the offence
is a kind which may result in vexatious private prosecutions; To enable
account to be taken of mitigating factors, which may vary so widely
from case to case that they are not susceptible to statutory
definition; To provide some central control over the use of the
criminal law when it has to intrude into areas 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>which are particularly sensitive or controversial, such as race
relations; and To ensure that prosecution decisions take account of
important considerations of public policy or international nature such
as may arise, for example, in official secrets or
hijacking.&#148;</div><a name="1003172000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a matter of constitutional law, the role of the Attorney-General is
also important because ultimately, when making decisions, that person
is accountable to Parliament. If the Government wish to tinker with
such a constitutional position, they should not do so
lightly.</div><a name="1003172000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee of the Government&#146;s opening remarks in
their response to the Justice Committee&#146;s report on the draft
Constitutional Renewal Bill, which was published last July. They
said:</div><a name="1003172000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Government is clear that reform is required to clarify the Attorney
General&#146;s role and make it more transparent, with the result
that public confidence in the role will be enhanced. To that end
certain changes have been, or will be, made principally in relation to
the Attorney General&#146;s role as superintending Minister of the
prosecution authorities. As no change in the law is required to bring
about these significant reforms the Government has decided not to bring
forward any legislation relating to the Attorney
General.&#148;</div><a name="1003172000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
those assertions, here we are eight months later, at the tail end of
this Parliament, faced with what amounts to a significant amendment of
more than 100 years of constitutional convention. It is
little wonder that such a considerable strength of feeling was
expressed in the other place about the Government&#146;s decision to
remove the Attorney-General from a decision-making role in bribery
prosecution. It is also worth drawing the Committee&#146;s attention
to the evidence provided by the Attorney-General herself in evidence to
the Joint Committee, which is cited at page 59 of that report. She
said:</div><a name="1003172000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
appears to me that the power of direction and the wider constitutional
position of the Attorney General should be addressed in the context of
the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, rather than this
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="1003172000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
led the Joint Committee to
say:</div><a name="1003172000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
broader reform of the Attorney General&#146;s Office, including her
power of direction, must await comprehensive proposals being pursued in
the
future.&#148;</div><a name="1003172000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to realign the role of the Attorney-General, I suggest that this
is not the way to do so. If, indeed, it is decided that there is a need
to discuss this, there should be a full discussion in the widest
context. The Government have a vehicle to allow a full debate on these
and many other matters in the Constitutional Reform and Governance
Bill, which has only just finished its Committee stage in the House,
but in the interim, the role of the Attorney-General should be left as
it is&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> In fact, that Bill
has gone to the Lords. However, if the Government want to tinker
further with our constitution, they should do so in a constitutional
Bill.</div><a name="1003172000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government will no doubt counter with the argument that the provision
was agreed unanimously by the Joint Committee. As Lord Goodhart said on
behalf of the Liberal Democrats in the other
place:</div><a name="1003172000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Volume
1 of the report on the draft Bribery Bill makes reference to the
Attorney-General. Paragraph 171
states:</div><a name="1003172000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;The
Attorney-General&#146;s powers of consent and direction raise complex
constitutional issues that lie at the heart of ensuring parliamentary
accountability for the criminal justice system. We agree with the
Government that the power of direction should remain in place without
being reformed by the draft Bribery Bill.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>Since this power will remain in place, we are satisfied that the power
of consent should be transferred from the Attorney-General to the
Directors of the prosecuting authorities...Any broader reform of
the Attorney-General&#146;s Office, including her power of direction,
must await comprehensive proposals being pursued in the
future.&#146;&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
68.]</div><a name="1003172000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
make two responses to that position. First, as Lord Lyell quite rightly
noted in the other place, there is an absolute tradition that Joint
Committees will always aim to be unanimous. That is why this Joint
Committee proceeded on a unanimous basis, even though many members did
not support its findings. The Government&#146;s statements in the
other place suggested that there was widespread agreement on the issue,
but they should be seen in that context.</div>
<a name="1003172000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, why
does the transfer of power of consent not count as a broad reform of
the Attorney-General&#146;s office, and therefore necessitate
comprehensive proposals to be pursued in the future? If the
Attorney-General&#146;s powers of consent and direction raise complex
constitutional issues that lie at the heart of ensuring parliamentary
accountability for the criminal justice system, why are they being
given away so lightly in the
Bill?</div><a name="1003172000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the key factors in favour of the need for consent to prosecution is
the aim of avoiding vexatious claims, or claims that are not in the
public interest. Lord Hodgson intervened most tellingly on that issue
in the other place and concisely cut to the heart of concerns that have
been voiced, not least by the business community. He
said:</div><a name="1003172000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
provision envisages at least three routes by which a prosecution can be
launched. The danger therefore is of different thresholds of
prosecution. Of course, the lawyers will say that the legal grounds are
there and that they are statutory, but those in the real commercial
world know that interpretations can vary greatly. When we have the
additional words &#145;with the consent of&#146;, that means that
yet other people may wish to bring prosecutions and obtain the consent
of the three bodies
listed.</div><a name="1003172000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">Those
of us who have been involved in commercial activity will know of
companies that have got across some of the bodies listed&#151;in
particular, HMRC. There may be a situation where a firm has done
something with which HMRC disagrees and it may even have brought a
prosecution and failed in its endeavours, but that means that that firm
will then be marked by HMRC as a body whose future activity should be
considered carefully. There is a real danger that in these
circumstances people will find themselves being lifted up the scale for
consideration for prosecution in connection with the activities
considered under the Bill.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 7 January 2010; Vol. 716,
c.GC70.]</div><a name="1003172000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
for that very reason that we think that the Attorney-General should be
in place as a safety valve, so to speak. It is not as helpful to have
in place an individual who is unaccountable to Parliament in the form
of a director of one of the prosecuting authorities detailed in the
Bill. It is an established strength of our system that a Law Officer as
senior as the Attorney-General is directly answerable to Parliament. It
is to Parliament that the Attorney-General must come to answer
difficult questions about difficult decisions. Is this change being
made because of criticism that a member of the Government cannot be
trusted to exercise untainted discretion? Those questions have been
raised by partners in the OECD, as well as by the Liberal Democrats.
However, that is simply the way that our constitution is, and the
Government should be legislating within our constitution and not
running scared of it. The criticism that a member of
the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>Government cannot act impartially should be proved incorrect and not
acceded to. It is important that a person making decisions in this area
should be accountable to Parliament, because that is where there can be
proper independent scrutiny and accountability regarding such
decisions.</div><a name="1003172000188"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000214"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> If the Government were of the view that my hon.
Friend described, would it not be much more satisfactory for them to
address the issue of the Attorney-General in the round and come forward
with some wholehearted reforms of the post
itself?</div>
<a name="1003172000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000215"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend that
whatever the Government have done in relation to other legislation
recently, they have pulled back from addressing the wider issue of the
Attorney-General. However, this proposal is poking out like a pimple
when it should be dealt with, as my hon. Friend has just said, in a
constitutional sense. Ideally, it should be dealt with on the Floor of
the House, as it is a constitutional matter, rather than being picked
off here in the Bill. Although it is not the Government who prosecute
an offence but the independent prosecuting authorities, it is important
that someone who is answerable to this House or another place should
have ultimate responsibility for that process of prosecution.</div>
<a name="1003172000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the OECD&#146;s observation on this matter shows what is driving
the Government&#146;s desired changes&#151;the idea that someone
who is intimately concerned with the Government cannot be trusted to
decide matters of criminal prosecution independently. We say that our
constitution has preserved the role of the Attorney-General for
centuries longer than we or the OECD have graced such discussions. If
we subscribed to the idea that people in government cannot be trusted
to take independent decisions, it would be of little surprise if the
public found it possible to take that view. Therefore, we believe that
it is of vital importance to preserve the role of independent Law
Officers who are accountable to Parliament. We suggest that we should
not give way on our constitutional principles and that we handle these
matters in the manner that has prevailed in some other countries. We
have no doubt whatsoever that the Attorney-General is the proper person
to account to Parliament in relation to this very important area in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1003172000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
said much in the other place about the support for the arguments put
forward by outside stakeholders, including Transparency International
UK and the OECD, which we believe have sought to discredit the office
of the Attorney-General and the ability of the incumbent to distinguish
between party politics and impartiality. Transparency International has
been particularly vociferous in its criticism, suggesting that the
Attorney-General was not only incapable of impartiality, but
incompetent. If I may quote from its briefing paper, which was
circulated yesterday, I think that that view will be self-evident. It
said that our
amendments:</div><a name="1003172000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fundamentally
impaired an entire Bill, taking the law back to the discredited system
of political interference in prosecution, in conflict with the United
Kingdom&#146;s treaty obligations. They would replace the need for
consent to prosecute from the competent officials making such decisions
in the normal course with that of the
Attorney-General.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div><a name="1003172000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well, we are British, and
I am proud of that fact. We administer our law according to our
historical constitution and our
values.</div><a name="1003172000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the other place, Lord Lyell spoke most convincingly of the continuity
of the current role of the Attorney-General. He
said:</div><a name="1003172000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
vital matter is that, when the Attorney-General takes any decision in
the public interest, he is not acting as a party politician. If he or
she were to allow themselves to act as party politicians, they would
break the whole tradition and background of the office. It is not party
considerations or the party interest that the Attorney-General or the
Solicitor-General is considering; it is the public interest.
Prosecution decisions par excellence are taken entirely in the public
interest. Speaking personally, I have never had the slightest
difficulty in knowing the difference between public and party interest
and I believe that I never had the slightest difficulty in following
the public
interest.</div><a name="1003172000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">What
is more, if an Attorney-General or a law officer strays from the narrow
path that it is their absolute duty to follow, they are answerable in
Parliament directly; indeed, they can be very severely criticised and
should recognise that. To a far greater extent than the Directors of
Public Prosecution, although they are excellent people who sometimes
come before Select Committees or Committees of this House or the other
place, the law officers of the Crown are by tradition Members of one
House or the other...and are answerable as
such.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2
February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
154.]</div><a name="1003172000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concerns and the reasons behind the amendment are threefold. First, if
the Attorney-General&#146;s constitutional role is to be amended in
the fundamental way proposed by the Bill, it needs to be done in
stand-alone legislation that can be properly assessed from a
constitutional point of view. It should not be tacked on to a Bill that
is being rushed through the House in a desperate attempt to get it on
to the statute book in the dying days of this
Government.</div><a name="1003172000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the Attorney-General&#146;s position as a decision maker who is
accountable to Parliament should not be idly dismissed. We are
concerned that, by delegating power to the directors, there is a danger
that we will lose that
accountability.</div><a name="1003172000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
we should not be so ready to bend over backwards at the behest of
external stakeholders. The institutions of this Parliament have
outlasted almost all others in the world. We should not take at face
value assertions that the Attorney-General cannot act independently as
a Law Officer. We put great store by the qualities of the individuals
who hold such office and their ability to act independently in the
public interest, unconstrained by party politics. If we are seriously
to question such fundamental issues, let us do it on the Floor of the
House in our consideration of a clear, well-stated piece of legislation
that provides for full and frank debate, rather than in a rush in
Committee before an
election.</div><a name="1003172000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
grouping of the amendments means that I have to speak to amendment 17
as well as the provisions relating to the Attorney-General, although I
can see why they were grouped in such a way, given the link between the
two matters. The office of the Attorney-General originated in 1315,
when the Crown began to appoint an individual to prosecute its business
in the Court of Common Pleas. This appointment was usually by Letters
Patent under the Great Seal, and it has been through a great number of
changes since, but one thing has remained consistent: accountability to
Parliament.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div><a name="1003172000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The office of
Attorney-General was summarised succinctly in the other place by Lord
Lyell, who
said:</div><a name="1003172000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
an Attorney-General or a law officer strays from the narrow path that
it is their absolute duty to follow, they are answerable in Parliament
directly; indeed, they can be very severely criticised and should
recognise that. To a far greater extent than the Directors of Public
Prosecution, although they are excellent people who sometimes come
before Select Committees or committees of this House or the other
place, the law officers of the Crown are by tradition Members of one
House or the other-as far as possible preferably of the other place-and
are answerable as
such.&#148;</div><a name="1003172000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
enough importance has been placed on the accountability element in the
provisions that we are discussing. Lord Bach sought to justify that
when he
said:</div><a name="1003172000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is the Government&#146;s view that this is the appropriate level at
which decisions for these offences should be taken. I remind the House
that these directors already exercise the consent function in respect
of a number of other offences, and the vast majority of prosecutions
take place without any involvement by the Attorney-General. As some
noble Lords have commented, bribery cases will not normally hold such
significance and sensitivity to be of national
interest.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2
February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
154-157.]</div><a name="1003172000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
note was published by the House of Commons Library in April 2009 to
deal with the Bill as it then stood. It stated that, between 1997 and
2003, the average number of prosecutions each year for the offence of
bribery was 21. That is a low figure, especially when considered
alongside the average number of prosecutions for the offence of fraud
in the same years, which was in the order of 23,000. However, companies
involved in those cases are household names. Given the number of cases
and the reputations of the companies involved, such cases frequently
hold the significance and sensitivity to be of national interest. As
such, the power of consent to prosecution should not be withdrawn from
the Attorney-General. However, in the unfortunate event of that
happening, clear provision should be made in the Bill to ensure that
there is no further slippage down the prosecutorial
ladder.</div><a name="1003172000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
17 would prevent the directors of prosecuting agencies from
transferring their powers under the Bill to others within their
organisations. It is vital, especially when considering the number of
bribery cases, that consent to prosecution remains in the hands of
those who can be held accountable. Furthermore, the amendment should go
some way to addressing the concerns of Lord Hodgson about the problem
of prosecution creep, which I discussed
earlier.</div><a name="1003172000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a commercial level, it is important that businesses&#146; concerns
that they will be the target of over-zealous prosecutors, or the
subject of extended and invasive investigations, are put to rest. Just
as the original consent requirement was introduced to avoid vexatious
claimants, there is a concern among some that, without proper
restrictions in place, the decision to prosecute will be wielded by
those too far down the prosecutorial ladder with the result that
certain businesses are targeted as a result of their being on the radar
of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs or others. That is the
theme that is echoed in proposed subsection (3B) in amendment 17. Those
who start a prosecution should see it through to a conclusion. It
should not be possible for prosecuting agencies to swap cases between
themselves as they see fit, as that could lead to inherent
inconsistency and uncertainty for business.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div><a name="1003172000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light of
many of our debates this evening, I am becoming more worried that we do
not yet have adequate procedures in place to decide who will prosecute
and the extent to which directors may knock down decisions to
subsidiary members of their organisations. Given that, in any event,
there are only about 20 prosecutions a year, one would have thought
that that would not be necessary. However, if it is, we will need to
know how the system will
proceed.</div><a name="1003172000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
Attorneys-General do not retain the role&#151;we hope that that they
will&#151;and we move to what is in the Bill, many serious questions
about implementation will need to be answered. The Government must
recognise that business is very concerned about the issue, and that if
it is not dealt with, different organisations will be looking at
prosecutions based on different rationales, which could damage business
confidence.</div><a name="1003172000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000216"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I strongly oppose the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
proposals, especially those involving the Attorney-General. In fact, I
take the exactly opposite view to his. I agree that the
Attorney-General&#146;s position should have been resolved in the
Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, but regrettably it was not.
In fact, it was never discussed during any stage of that Bill&#146;s
passage. What the Government proposed in that Bill was a far more
radical separation of the Attorney-General from any role in
prosecutions and decisions than they had proposed in their previous
draft.</div><a name="1003172000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals in the Bribery Bill do not go far enough to separate the
Attorney-General from the prosecution system. In my view, leaving the
role of Attorney-General as it is, so that the Attorney-General
continues to be the superintendent of the Director of Public
Prosecutions, the director of the Serious Fraud Office and so on,
leaves in place a system of dubious international legality. It is clear
that the system that the hon. Gentleman prefers, in which the
Attorney-General has the consent power&#151;not just the
superintendence of the DPP and the director of the SFO, but the consent
power personally&#151;would certainly be in violation of our
international obligations. The hon. Gentleman quoted Transparency
International&#146;s document on this aspect of the Bill. He quoted
it accurately, but I agree with it and he does not, so I shall quote it
a bit more of it. It says that the putative justification for having
the Attorney-General&#146;s consent as part of the law was
supposedly</div><a name="1003172000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
prevent irresponsible private prosecutions. It has been evident for
years that the power to withhold consent had no purpose other than for
political, commercial or other inappropriate expediency. The OECD
Working Group on Bribery, in successive formal reviews of the
UK&#146;s&#148;</div><a name="1003172000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">non-performance</div>
<a name="1003172000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of its
obligations under the Anti-Bribery Convention, has pointed to this as
being...contrary to the Convention, a view reinforced by the
conduct of the then Attorney General in relation to the decision to
abandon the criminal investigation of the Al-Yamamah project and in
relation to the &#145;loans-for-honours&#146; affair. The
Government...accepted that the practice had to change; and the
Bill formally transferred the power of consent to the
three...Directors.&#148;</div><a name="1003172000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is absolutely right. Maintaining the power to refuse to consent to
bribery prosecution in the hands of a politician fundamentally
undermines our position internationally. What is the purpose of that?
What does it look like to the rest of the world? It looks like a
Government&#151;of whom the hon. Member for Huntingdon hopes to be a
member&#151;who would find it important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>that they could do favours for their mates in the commercial world. The
hon. Gentleman might not like that way of putting it, but that is what
it would look like to the rest of the world, so he has to take that
into
account.</div><a name="1003172000189"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000218"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I do not want to get into a general
constitutional debate, but that is fundamentally complacent about what
really happens in politics in this place. The holding to
account&#151;the asking of a few questions by Back-Bench Members of
Parliament, which Ministers then deflect and refuse to answer&#151;is
not in my view a substitute for a proper legal system. In a way, that
is the fundamental problem.</div>
<a name="1003172000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">By the way,
the hon. Member for Huntingdon said that Attorneys-General could
separate in their own minds the questions of legality and politics, and
they could do both jobs. That is precisely the point that the OECD
doubts. If that were true, we would have seen far more
Attorneys-General from parties other than the ruling party, or from no
party, than we have seen for as long as anyone can remember. The actual
number is zero. No Attorney-General has been appointed from outside the
ruling party. It is fundamentally a political appointment. The role is
so political that it is highly sensitive, which is why it should be
separated
out.</div><a name="1003172000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000219"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to be confusing the
nature of the political appointment and someone being able to take a
judicial decision based on non-political
grounds.</div><a name="1003172000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000220"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is an extraordinary idea. That could be
applied to the judiciary and one could say that the ruling party should
appoint all the judges from their own party and that would be fine
because they will be able to separate in their own minds the political
and the judicial aspects of their job. It is complete
nonsense.</div>
<a name="1003172000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concede one
point, as I mentioned earlier, which is that it would have been better
had the whole matter been dealt with comprehensively in the
Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill. There is a fundamental point
about whether the prosecution function is an Executive, Government
function or more of a judicial function. I tend to the view that it
obviously has elements of both, but it should be seen more as a
judicial function than has been traditional in this country.</div>
<a name="1003172000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that we
have not had that comprehensive reform, it is much better to have the
separation of the political and judicial role as much as we can,
whenever the opportunity arises. The opportunity arises in the Bill in
a specific context, in respect of which this country has been in
serious trouble internationally for many years, and I urge the
Government not to give way on that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000221"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I want to ask the Minister about one aspect of the
Joint Committee&#146;s report that she might be able to help the
Committee with. I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon
said about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>delegation of each of the directors to, at the moment, any official whom
they may think fit. I note in passing that the Joint Committee thought
it more appropriate that a senior post-holder should be nominated to do
that. There is no mention of seniority in the Bill. In particular, will
she tell us how the Government will deal with the point raised about
section 53 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 and the apparent contradiction
that the Bill as it stands would
create?</div><a name="1003172000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000222"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Perhaps I can ask the hon. Gentleman a question: are
the Opposition seeking for responsibility to lie solely and personally
with the Director of Public Prosecutions, for example, or do they think
that that could or should also be exercised be a senior
official?</div><a name="1003172000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000223"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> No, we take the view that that should be the
responsibility of the director himself or herself, as it is an
important decision. As my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon said,
it is not an onerous responsibility, given the volume of cases
involved, and we think that that should remain in the hands of the
director.</div>
<a name="1003172000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward
to the Under-Secretary&#146;s answer to the question I had finished
asking.</div><a name="1003172000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000224"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> We move on to the matter of consent to prosecution
for an offence under the Bill. The amendments offer two alternatives to
the provisions in the clause. Amendments 15 and 16 would require the
prior consent of the Attorney-General before commencing proceedings for
the new bribery offences. Amendment 17 accepts that the consent
function should be exercised by the director of the relevant
prosecuting authority but seeks to prevent the director from delegating
the function. It would also make the prosecuting authority whose
director consented to the prosecution solely responsible for the
proceedings.</div>
<a name="1003172000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
currently provides for the responsibility for giving consent to be
exercised by the directors of the relevant prosecuting authorities. We
consider it right to retain a consent provision for the new bribery
offences and that that should be exercised by the directors, rather
than the Attorney-General.</div>
<a name="1003172000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon takes the opposing view and, in so doing, wishes
to retain that role for the Attorney-General. He has cited the historic
and constitutionally important role of the Attorney-General in those
matters and the need to maintain effective parliamentary accountability
for the operation of the prosecution services. Interestingly, he is
seeking to ensure that there is, as the hon. Member for Cambridge said,
essentially a political appointment role within those proceedings, much
against the recommendations of the OECD.</div>
<a name="1003172000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather
worryingly, I am again agreeing with the views expressed by the hon.
Member for Cambridge&#151;I hope we will not make that too much of a
custom. Although we disagree with retaining the
Attorney-General&#146;s consent for the offences in the Bill, we do
not question the distinguished service given by former
Attorneys-General or the independence with which they exercised their
powers in the past. It was the 2003 Joint Committee on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>the draft Corruption Bill that originally questioned the need to retain
the requirement for the Attorney-General&#146;s consent for those
offences, stating that</div>
<a name="1003172000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;without doubting
the independence of the Attorney-General and his predecessors, we
accept that the appearance of ministerial involvement in the
prosecution decision would best be avoided&#148;.</div>
<a name="1003172000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest that that is
rather
clear.</div><a name="1003172000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Law Commission and the most recent Joint Committee, on which the hon.
Members for Huntingdon and for Rugby and Kenilworth both served, was
similarly satisfied that the power of consent should be transferred
from the Attorney-General to the director of the relevant prosecution
authority. That view is shared by, among others, the OECD and the
Council of Europe&#146;s monitoring body, GRECO. The directors
already exercise the consent function is respect of several other
offences, and the vast majority of prosecutions take place without any
involvement of the Attorney-General.</div>
<a name="1003172000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000225"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I hope that this will not cause too much agony for
the Under-Secretary, but one of the concerns the Joint Committee looked
at was how the directors will be held to account. It is true that at
the moment, the Attorney-General&#146;s general power of direction
means that even if consent is not being given, the Attorney-General can
be held to account in Parliament for the general operation of
prosecutions, so there is an element of accountability under the system
even though the consent is going. However, if we went as far as the Lib
Dems would go and stripped away the powers of direction and
superintendence as well, we would end up with no accountability at all
for those directors. They are not judicial, as they are in some
countries. They are not directly elected, as in America, so how will
they be held to account?</div>
<a name="1003172000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
noting that, with the BAE Systems incident that was criticised by the
hon. Member for
Cambridge&#151;</div><a name="1003172000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000226"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. I hope the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention will be
short.</div><a name="1003172000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000227"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I am just finishing. That decision was actually
made by the director of the Serious Fraud Office and was simply
approved by the
Attorney-General.</div><a name="1003172000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000228"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> A protocol exists between the Attorney-General and
the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is possible in those rare
circumstances for the Attorney-General to consider the decision,
especially in respect of national security. The director has already
exercised the consent function in respect of several offences, as we
know. Many such cases raise difficult and complex issues, and always
require the directors to consider the public interest in pursuing a
prosecution. Our conclusion is that the directors are fully capable of
exercising the consent function in relation to the new offences under
the
Bill.</div><a name="1003172000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not dismiss the arguments about the need for parliamentary
accountability for such important decisions, but we believe that such
accountability will continue to exist through the
Attorney-General&#146;s significant statutory role in superintending
the main prosecuting authorities. That is also reflected in the
protocol between the Attorney-General and the prosecuting authorities.
The protocol that was published last July sets out the circumstances 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>in which the Attorney-General will or will not be consulted, and how the
Attorney-General and directors will engage with one another. It serves
to underline the fact that the directors of the prosecuting authorities
exercise their statutory functions under the superintendence of the
Attorney-General, who is responsible to Parliament for the
directors&#146; functions in relation to prosecutions. In turn, the
Attorney-General is responsible for safeguarding the independence of
prosecutors in making prosecuting
decisions.</div><a name="1003172000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Attorney-General made the point when she gave evidence last June to the
Joint Committee that considered the draft Bribery Bill. She said
that</div><a name="1003172000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;accountability
will remain because, so long as the Law Officers, that is the Attorney
General and the Solicitor, remain the supervisors and superintendents
of the prosecutorial authority, there is a vehicle through which that
accountability can take
place&#148;.</div><a name="1003172000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
reflected in the protocol, the Attorney-General will also retain an
exceptional power to give a direction in relation to any case that
threatens national security, in which case the protocol requires the
Attorney-General to report to Parliament. That is appropriate because
the Attorney-General, after consulting other Ministers and not
necessarily the prosecuting authorities, will have the significant and
relevant expertise when national security is at
stake.</div><a name="1003172000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to amendment 17, we do not accept that precluding directors from
delegating the consent function in relation to offences under the Bill,
even in limited and appropriate circumstances, would be the right way
forward. As the Attorney-General said in her evidence to the Joint
Committee on the draft Bill, there needs to be some flexibility in the
organisation to enable it to deal with matters appropriately. That is
why I asked the hon. Member for Huntingdon whether such measures should
be exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions or named senior
individuals, the Director of Public Prosecutions and his or her deputy
and other named individuals, or just the Director of Public
Prosecutions.</div><a name="1003172000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
her evidence, the Attorney-General went on to
note:</div><a name="1003172000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
issues are very important, so one would expect that, if the matter were
to be taken by a Director or the DPP or otherwise, there would be an
appropriate degree of seniority in taking that
decision&#148;.</div><a name="1003172000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our view, to require that consent for the offences under the
legislation should always be given by directors personally would be
unnecessarily inflexible, compared with the existing statutory powers
of delegation for the Director of Public
Prosecutions.</div><a name="1003172000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000229"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Unfortunately, the Bill as drafted does not regard
what either the Under-Secretary or the Attorney-General said as
desirable. Nor does it say that delegation would happen only in limited
or appropriate circumstances, nor that the person to whom the
delegation was made should have an appropriate degree of seniority.
Will the Under-Secretary explain why those measures are not covered
under the
Bill?</div><a name="1003172000190"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9
pm</div><a name="1003172000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000230"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The power of the Director of Public Prosecutions
extends to the other prosecutors through the Crown Prosecution Service.
It does not have to be held directly by the DPP personally. The
amendment, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>however, requires that action to be performed solely by the directors. I
was seeking clarification from the hon. Member for Huntingdon about
whether he saw that as a specific requirement, or whether the power
should be exercised by a Director of Public Prosecutions and his deputy
or other named senior
officials.</div><a name="1003172000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000231"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> As the Bill stands, there will now be three
people instead of one, so there are already three times as many people
taking the decision, even without delegation. The additional concern is
about the grounds on which prosecutions will be based, and the fact
that if three people will be doing a job that is now done by one
person, a difference of policy could creep
in.</div><a name="1003172000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000232"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Perhaps I can direct the hon. Gentleman to clause
10(5):</div><a name="1003172000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsections
(3) and (4) do not affect other powers of a Director to authorise a
person to exercise functions under subsection (1) or
(2).&#148;</div><a name="1003172000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Attorney-General gave the view that that authorisation would be at
senior level, and we see no need for that detail to be in the
Bill.</div><a name="1003172000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000233"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Is that not all rather lazy? There are only 20
cases a year. Can the directors not pull out their fingers and get the
work
done?</div><a name="1003172000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000234"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I do not think that that is a helpful intervention.
It suggests that the Director of Public Prosecutions or the director of
the Serious Fraud Office is for some reason not undertaking their full
responsibilities. I simply seek to question whether the purpose behind
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment was to restrict the power to
those three
individuals&#151;</div><a name="1003172000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000235"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="1003172000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000236"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Or whether he sought to extend it to deputies or
named
individuals.</div><a name="1003172000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000237"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b>
No.</div><a name="1003172000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000238"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> That matter has been clarified&#151;the power is
simply with the three of
them.</div><a name="1003172000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
section 1(7) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, where the consent
of the DPP to institute proceedings is required, that consent may be
given by a crown prosecutor. Section 37 of the Commissioners for
Revenue and Customs Act 2005 permits the director of Revenue and
Customs prosecutions to designate members of his office to exercise any
of his functions, as they relate to the institution and conduct of
criminal proceedings in cases investigated by Revenue and Customs. We
have provided a similar power in clause 10(3) for the director of the
Serious Fraud Office to delegate the function of giving consent to a
member of their staff authorised for that purpose by the director.
Powers of delegation are provided for the Director of Public
Prosecutions for Northern Ireland under section 36 of the Justice
(Northern Ireland) Act 2002. We therefore take the view that the
existing statutory arrangements for the delegation of directors&#146;
functions and those provided for the SFO under clause 10 will allow the
directors to ensure an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>appropriate degree of seniority when consent is given to a prosecution
under the Act, in keeping with the views expressed by the
Attorney-General to the Joint
Committee.</div><a name="1003172000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth mentioned section 53 of the
Serious Crime Act 2007. That issue was raised by the Joint Committee,
and has been dealt with in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman would like
to refer to schedule 1, paragraphs 12 to 14, he will see that that
provision removes the inconsistency. On the basis of those comments,
and the clarification that the hon. Member for Huntingdon has given me,
I urge him to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1003172000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000239"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> First, to the hon. Member for Cambridge, the
question of the role of the Attorney-General is, I totally accept, an
issue on which strong opinions are held by different people. I do not
think that we shall resolve that one between us this evening. The hon.
Gentleman said that the Liberal Democrats want to remove the
Attorney-General totally from the prosecution system, but we do not
agree. Given that that is not suggested in the Bill and we are being
offered only piecemeal reform, as he acknowledged, I argue that it is
logical to keep the status quo&#151;even from his point of view, at
this stage&#151;so that the issue can be reviewed in its entirety as
part of a constitutional Bill on the Floor of the House at some time in
the
future.</div><a name="1003172000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000240"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="1003172000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000241"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman is going to say that he will
be sorry not to be here to see
it.</div><a name="1003172000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000242"></a>David
Howarth:</b> No, I want to remark that that is a classic
example of the famous academic argument that the proposal will block
the way for more radical reform later. It was always a bad argument in
the
university.</div><a name="1003172000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000243"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It sounds like a good conservative maxim to
me.</div><a name="1003172000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister referred to the agreement of the Joint Committee, but I was
there, my hon. Friend was there and, most importantly, Lords Lyell and
Mayhew were there&#151;two distinguished past Attorneys-General, and
I can assure the Minister that they were not supportive&#151;so I
suggest that she does not rely too heavily on the unanimity of the
Joint Committee in that
instance.</div><a name="1003172000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issues are difficult and complex, so we believe that there is a role
for the Attorney-General. Issues that involve national security, for
instance, are exactly the sort of issues that would benefit from having
the Attorney-General there
still.</div><a name="1003172000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary&#146;s comments on directors delegating powers did
not give us much, if any, additional comfort. As my hon. Friend the
Member for North-East Hertfordshire rightly said, with 20 cases a year,
that is about six cases a piece between the three of them, so we
believe that they should be taking the decisions
themselves.</div><a name="1003172000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, at this stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1003172000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

out subsections (6) to (14).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div><a name="1003172000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000245"></a>The
Chair:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 26 to
30.</div><a name="1003172000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000246"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> With this group of amendments we come to what has
proved to be the most difficult aspect of the Bill, namely the defence
for the intelligence services and armed forces found in clause 13. I
say &#147;difficult&#148;, because I do not dispute that the
arrangements for oversight of the intelligence services and armed
forces are properly a matter for public and parliamentary debate, in
particular when, as in the Bill, legislation will sanction such conduct
by those organisations which, if committed by anyone else, would be
unlawful. The question with which the other place grappled and which
now falls to the Committee concerns where the balance lies between
ministerial accountability for what are operational decisions by the
intelligence services and armed forces and the need to maintain
operational effectiveness and
flexibility.</div><a name="1003172000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the reasons that I shall set out, the Government firmly believe that
the amendment passed on Third Reading in the other place, and which now
forms subsections (6) to (14) of clause 10, does not get the balance
right. We accept, however, that the other place has expressed a
legitimate concern and we do not propose, therefore, to invite the
Committee simply to strike out those subsections. Instead, the
amendments to clause 13 in this group offer an alternative model for
providing an appropriate level of ministerial
oversight.</div><a name="1003172000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
setting out the case for the amendments, I shall first explain why the
provisions in subsections (6) to (14) are fatally flawed. I do not
argue that a ministerial authorisation scheme is, of itself,
unacceptable to the Government. As the Committee knows, the Government
put forward such an authorisation scheme in the draft Bill published
last spring, but that scheme was a very different beast from the one in
clause 10. There are a number of important
differences.</div><a name="1003172000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the draft Bill, the Government proposed what was, in effect, a
mandatory authorisation scheme. The draft Bill proceeded on the basis
that conduct that would otherwise constitute an offence under the Bill
by persons acting on behalf of the intelligence services did not, in
fact, constitute a bribery offence if it had been authorised by the
Secretary of State. By excluding such conduct from the ambit of the
offences in the Bill there was no need for a
defence.</div><a name="1003172000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
contrast, we now have a discretionary authorisation scheme that retains
the defence in clause 13, and far from having the best of both worlds,
we have a muddled hybrid scheme that is neither one thing nor the
other. One of the primary purposes of clause 13 is to provide
assurances to members of the intelligence services and armed forces
that they will be protected in the event that they have to engage in
conduct that would constitute an offence under the Bill. In practice,
the very existence of the defence means that it is highly unlikely that
a member of the intelligence services or the armed forces would ever
face prosecution for an offence under the Bill, because a prosecutor
would take the availability of the defence into account when deciding
whether there was a realistic prospect of securing a
conviction.</div>
<a name="1003172000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the unlikely event that a prosecution was brought, the person concerned
would be able to avail himself or herself of the defence. The comfort
provided by the defence is considerably dissipated by the discretionary
authorisation scheme. In any case in which the conduct 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>in question had not been subject to a prior authorisation, the question
would inevitably be asked, &#147;Why not?&#148; Whatever the
intention of the drafters of the Lords amendment, there would
inevitably be heightened suspicion in any such case. Prosecutors would
be more likely to contest a claim that the defence operated in the
particular case and a jury might be more likely to convict. I ask hon.
Members to put themselves in the shoes of a member of the intelligence
services or armed forces in that situation. They would regard the
defence as devalued and insist on an authorisation in all
circumstances.</div><a name="1003172000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we were to have an authorisation scheme, it would not be the one in
clause 10. The drawback with that scheme is that it requires that
conduct be specifically authorised by the Secretary of State. That is
tantamount to a case-specific authorisation scheme. Such a scheme poses
significant practical difficulties that would make it unworkable. It
could potentially place heavy demands on the Secretary of State due to
the number of separate authorisations required. Moreover, a
case-specific authorisation scheme simply fails to recognise the
dynamics of what can be complex and fast moving operations. One only
has to consider military operations in Afghanistan to recognise the
impracticality of a case-specific authorisation scheme. Such
difficulties could be remedied by also providing for a class-based
authorisation scheme&#151;indeed, our draft Bill contained such a
scheme&#151;but that is not the complete answer. A class-based
authorisation would, by definition, necessarily cover a wide range of
conduct in a wide range of
circumstances.</div><a name="1003172000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
issues led us to conclude that the defence in clause 13 has a number of
advantages over an authorisation scheme. The defence is more focused
and case specific, without the drawbacks of a case-specific
authorisation scheme. It relates to specific conduct by an identified
individual.</div>
<a name="1003172000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000247"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Under-Secretary says
&#147;case-specific&#148;, but would it not still be possible to
have a group of issues in one case, so that only one authorisation
needs to be given?</div>
<a name="1003172000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000248"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The hon. Gentleman appears to be describing a class
authorisation. That is the distinction and I have already set out why
there would be a difficulty with class
authorisation.</div><a name="1003172000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
defence in clause 13 relates to specific conduct by an identified
individual and the application of the defence would need to be
considered on a case-by-case basis.</div>
<a name="1003172000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it is
worth noting that the amendment made in the other place would allow the
Secretary of State to authorise conduct that would constitute an
offence under clause 6, namely, bribery of a foreign public official
for a business purpose. We have taken great care in drafting clause 13
to ensure that it is compatible with our international obligations. To
that end, the definition of a relevant bribery offence purposely
excludes a clause 6 offence. Such a defect could, of course, be
remedied, but the other fundamental flaws that I have outlined are not
similarly capable of being rectified.</div>
<a name="1003172000191"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
pm</div><a name="1003172000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently,
we must strike out the offending Lords amendment. As I have indicated,
we do not propose to leave it at that. The other amendments to clause
13 in this group would provide an alternative mechanism for ministerial
oversight.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div><a name="1003172000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
amendment is amendment 27, which places a duty on the heads of the
three intelligence services and the Defence Council, in respect of the
armed forces, to make sure they have arrangements in place that are
designed to ensure that conduct amounting to a relevant bribery offence
takes place only where the defence would apply. Those arrangements must
be ones which the relevant Secretary of State considers satisfactory.
This introduces a significant measure of ministerial oversight while
ensuring that such oversight can be exercised proportionately without
undermining the operational effectiveness of the intelligence services
and armed
forces.</div><a name="1003172000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of amendment 27 is that the arrangements put in place by the
heads of the intelligence services and the Defence Council must be ones
with which the relevant Secretary of State is satisfied. Moreover, the
requirement for the Secretary of State to be so satisfied is an ongoing
requirement. This is neither a tick-box nor a one-off exercise. The
Secretary of State will need to make a qualitative judgment on the
arrangements and decide whether they are satisfactory. If he considers
that they are in some way unsatisfactory, the head of the relevant
intelligence service or the Defence Council would need to address his
concerns and resubmit modified
arrangements.</div><a name="1003172000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the duty on the Secretary of State will be an ongoing duty, it would be
necessary, for example, for him to review any proposed changes to the
arrangements before they take effect and to confirm, or otherwise, that
the revised arrangements are also satisfactory. The amendments
purposely avoid specifying what form the arrangements must take or what
they must cover. That is properly a matter for the heads of the
intelligence services and Defence Council, subject to sign-off by the
Secretary of State that the arrangements are
satisfactory.</div><a name="1003172000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments make it clear that it will be the responsibility of the head
of each of the intelligence services and of the Defence Council to
design arrangements that will work most effectively for their staff and
operational activities. They would be devised taking full account of
the new law as it affects each organisation&#146;s role, statutory
remit and operational activities, and would be submitted to the
relevant Secretary of State for his or her approval. If would, of
course, be open to the Secretary of State to indicate that more or
different arrangements were required. Beyond that, it is not possible
for me to say more without commenting on what is a matter for the
individual service heads and the Defence
Council.</div><a name="1003172000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it may assist the Committee if I give a flavour of what the
arrangements might cover. They might, for example, include internal
guidance on the offences in the Bill and the clause 13 defence, and the
taking of internal legal advice in specified circumstances. The
Committee will understand that by the very nature of such arrangements,
addressing as they will sensitive operational matters, it will not be
possible to put them into the public
domain.</div><a name="1003172000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have set out the amendments in some detail. It is right that I should
do so, given the legitimate concerns that have been expressed about
clause 13. We will come to a stand part debate on clause 13 in due
course, but the Committee should be in no doubt that the Government
regard the clause as a core part of the Bill. I share the widespread
desire to see the Bill reach the statute book before the election, but
the Bill that we pass must be fit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>for purpose and not jeopardise the operational effectiveness of the
intelligence services and our armed
forces.</div><a name="1003172000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members are right to press for proper oversight of the circumstances in
which the intelligence services and armed forces might need to engage
in conduct which would constitute an offence under the Bill, but this
is not the occasion for a general debate on the accountability of the
intelligence services. The amendments and the Bill deal with the narrow
question of bribery, and the Government amendments provide an equitable
way forward. I invite Opposition Members to support the amendments and
not to let this issue derail passage of the Bill. I commend the
amendments to the
Committee.</div><a name="1003172000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000249"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Minister is right to say that this is a
difficult and delicate problem, and that there are legitimate concerns
on the part of the intelligence services and the armed forces. I do not
want to get into the principle of clause 13 until we have reached it.
My preference, like that of my noble Friends in the other place, would
be to leave out clause 13 altogether, but now is not the time to
explain
why.</div><a name="1003172000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Thomas of Gresford said in the other place that there are basically
four ways of dealing with the problem. One is to have a statutory
defence for such organisations, as in clause 13. Another is to have
prior authorisation, as in clause 10. The third, which Lord Thomas
offered as a compromise and which was never discussed, was to redefine
the offence so that in the circumstances it would not be an offence at
all. That was offered in the spirit of compromise, but it is not a
compromise I am fond of, and we have now passed the point in the Bill
where it could have been proposed. The fourth possibility would be to
have nothing of that sort in the Bill at all and to leave out clause 13
altogether.</div>
<a name="1003172000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me
that if I cannot have my first preference, which is to leave out clause
13&#151;we will come to that later&#151;the Government are, I
reluctantly concede, unfortunately right about what should be in clause
10. If there is to be a statutory defence, including prior
authorisation as well would lead to enormous complications, so perhaps
the best way forward is the one proposed by the Government, which is to
combine the statutory defence with other procedures to ensure that the
issues, especially the issue of necessity, are decided
properly.</div><a name="1003172000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the basic reason why I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that
that part of clause 10 should be omitted is the reason the
Under-Secretary mentioned towards the end of her remarks.
Unfortunately, the drafting of the provisions has included clause
6&#151;the foreign official bribery offence&#151;in their scope. As
she said, clause 13 was carefully drafted to cover only clauses 1 and
2. When we come to clause 13, by the way, I will ask why it covers
clause 2, because I cannot see why special provision should be made for
receiving bribes rather than giving them. Clause 13 was carefully
designed not to cover clause
6.</div><a name="1003172000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000250"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Double
agent.</div><a name="1003172000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000251"></a>David
Howarth:</b> We will come to the examples later. It was,
properly, designed not to cover clause 6. The solution that the
Government have adopted with regard to clause 6 is the one that I
favour for the whole Bill. In the Government&#146;s view, when it
comes to a clause 6 case, there is no defence at all. As Conservative
Members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>have been saying all day, that throws us back on prosecutorial
discretion, but given that the Government have rightly accepted
prosecutorial discretion as the way forward on clause 6&#151;my view
is that we should fall back on it for clause 1 as well&#151;the only
consistent thing that I can do is to support the Government&#146;s
position on the removal of this provision from clause 10. It is a
conclusion to which I have come reluctantly, as there is a problem and
I am not satisfied with the overall way of dealing with it.
Nevertheless, I will support the Government&#146;s lead
amendment.</div><a name="1003172000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1003172000252"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I should start by recognising the upper
House&#146;s distaste at the idea of law enforcement authorities
bribing unless there is a significant reason for doing so. We share
that emotion. On this particular topic, unlike some of the topics that
we debated earlier today, I feel that the upper House is thorough in
its
deliberations.</div><a name="1003172000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
position has also not been helped by the fact that the Government
amendments arrived only last Friday. To be frank, that has not enabled
me to discuss them as fully with my colleagues in the other place as I
would have liked. Having said that, we will of course review carefully
what the Under-Secretary has said
today.</div><a name="1003172000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments will remove the key intention of the other place
that the Secretary of State should give the authorisation and that the
authorisation should be time-limited. That is different from the much
weaker proposal that the arrangements need only be those that the
Secretary of State considers satisfactory. Lord Mackay of Clashfern
supported Lord Pannick&#146;s amendment in the
Lords:</div><a name="1003172000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
idea of a prior authorisation is incorporated in the statutes of the
security and intelligence services.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 8 February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
483.]</div><a name="1003172000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
peers, including former Lord Chief Justice Woolf, asked why, if the
systems can be provided for the security services to involve themselves
in such things as telephone tapping, we should not be able to find an
authorisation route for
bribery.</div><a name="1003172000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is all I will say at this stage, but we will look at the
Under-Secretary&#146;s earlier comments and return to this matter at
the later
stages.</div><a name="1003172000159"></a>
