Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Let me summarise the position
that we had reached on the amendments before lunch. As
parliamentarians, we should be jealous of our rights to determine tax
law. Parliament fought for those rights and we should not give them up
lightly. I am not convinced that the Economic Secretary has fought as
vigorously as she should have done to make sure that Parliament kept
the rights that the amendment would enshrine in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08052069000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said three things that gave me some comfort, the first of which was
that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs would consult the

included principles to enable clarity of how the regime would operate.
The third thing that the Minister said was reassuring. She said that
there would be transparency about the EU arrangements and that they
would be posted on a website so that there was no doubt about what
instruments were deemed investment transactions and what instruments
were not. In that spirit of openness and consultation, I am minded to
withdraw the amendment. However, if HMRC goes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>back to its previous habit of not consulting fully with the industry,
the industry will put pressure on the Treasury to reinstate
parliamentary scrutiny of the legislation. The amendments would be
effective only if the open spirit of consultation that the Minister
spoke about earlier continues. If it does, there will be no
uncertainty. If it does not, there will be and we shall return to such
issues when we discuss the Finance Bill

than push her luck. I have reflected on what she said. Her argument
improved somewhat, after a bit of pressure from the Tory Benches. Her
exchanges towards the end of the debate on the amendments were much
clearer than they were at the start. I do not want to draw out the
proceedings for too much longer. Some safeguards that are in place
should ensure that the provision works well and, if it is does not, I
am sure that the industry will tell us. On that basis, I beg to ask

							<a name="08052069000296"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I cannot let the clause pass by without making some
comments, which I know will be of particular interest to my hon. Friend
the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham. The clause gives the Treasury
the power to introduce by way of statutory instrument the reinstatement
of tax advantages that would have been lost if holders of individual
savings accounts in Northern Rock had taken out their money when the
run on Northern Rock took place. Although it does not immediately leap
out from the explanatory notes, it is clear from the regulations that
the Minister kindly supplied last week that they relate to Northern
Rock. Indeed, the press notice that was published last year made it
clear that, after it was leaked that the Bank of England was acting as
a lender of last resort to Northern Rock, a number of members of the
public sought to withdraw their deposits from the bank because they
felt that it was not a safe place to keep their cash. That triggered
queues around the block, both literally and metaphorically, as many
tried to withdraw their money over the internet.</div>
					<a name="08052069000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of those
customers held their money in cash ISAs. To lure back depositors and
try to rebuild the retail deposit base of Northern Rock, the Minster
announced that people who put their money back into the ISA with
Northern Rock would have their tax relief reinstated. That also applied
to people who redeposited 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>their ISA money with other ISA providers, but as I understand it, the
measure was particularly aimed at rebuilding the deposit base of
Northern Rock. This debate is one of the rare occasions that we have
for parliamentary scrutiny on what is happening with  Northern
Rock.</div>
					<a name="08052069000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08052069000297"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): Does my hon.
Friend share my general concern that it does not matter what is asked
about Northern Rock, because it is being held at arm&#146;s length in
a special purpose company, so that Ministers are unable to answer any
questions. I hope that my hon. Friend has greater luck
today.</div>
					<a name="08052069000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052069000298"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right. We have both experienced
the problems of trying to ask questions about Northern Rock, and we get
poor answers in response, if we are answered at all. However, I might
chance my arm and ask the Minister how much that change will cost the
Government. What additional tax relief will be granted to customers who
took their money out of their Northern Rock ISA and redeposited it with
Northern Rock or another provider? Given that banks, as I understand
it, must provide returns to the Treasury on ISAs and such things, I am
sure that they have that information. Therefore, perhaps she could also
tell us how much money has been redeposited in Northern Rock and,
therefore, what the tax cost would
be&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> The Minister is looking
quizzical. Can she tell us how much of the money that was originally
taken out from cash ISAs in Northern Rock has been redeposited, and
what the tax cost of doing so has
been?</div>
					<a name="08052069000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052069000299"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I will answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question, but I also want to make some remarks on the background,
because he implied that the purpose of clause 37 was to help us rebuild
Northern Rock&#146;s retail base, which is not true at all. It was a
logical point of fairness that I feel followed absolutely from the
decision to guarantee normal retail depositors. The clause will allow
retrospective ISA regulations to be laid, committing those individuals
who withdrew cash from their Northern Rock ISA between 13 and 19
September 2007 to reinvest it in another ISA by 5 April 2008 and
restoring the tax advantage that they would otherwise have lost. That
is because in that window from 13 to 19 September inclusive, some ISA
holders withdrew money from their ISA held with Northern Rock. By
withdrawing their funds in cash, those individuals lost their ISA tax
advantage for money deposited in 2007-08 and in earlier
years.</div>
					<a name="08052069000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
existing ISA rules, if they had wanted to transfer their funds to a
different ISA provider and retain their tax advantages, they should
have arranged for Northern Rock to transfer their investment to another
ISA provider. Before the Government gave that guarantee, I think that
it was reasonable for them to presume that Northern Rock might be
unable to transfer to another provider, so we are simply compensating
for the actions taken at that time. We decided that the need to protect
the financial interests of those ISA savers in exceptional
circumstances justified a departure from the usual transfer rules.
Therefore, on 18 October I announced that the funds that had been
withdrawn between 13 and 19 September inclusive could be put back into
any cash 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div>ISA with any provider by no later than 5 April this year and that the
tax advantages would be restored. We announced that we would do so in
this way. It was not an attempt to rebuild the retail base; it was a
matter of
fairness.</div>
					<a name="08052069000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the cost to the Exchequer. There will be no
tax cost at all, because we are simply restoring a tax advantage that
customers already had. I do not have the figures for the overall amount
of retail deposits currently in the bank. They will be made available
through the business plan in the normal
way.</div>
					<a name="08052069000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052069000300"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I am sure that when the announcement on the matter
was spun, back in October, it was not a benign gesture by the
Government to encourage people to put their money back into other
providers. It was pretty much aimed at encouraging people to put their
money back into Northern Rock, since the retail deposit base was a key
factor in its problems. It was a way of rebuilding the
Rock.</div>
					<a name="08052069000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Minister for suggesting that information on the
deposit base might be in the business plan. The only problem is that so
far we have been denied sight of the business plan, so that was not a
satisfactory answer. Also, I would have thought that there would be a
tax cost if people were unable to redeposit money into ISAs. Under
normal circumstances, there would have been a tax saving to the
Government from the money coming out, because people could not reinvest
it in ISAs.</div>
					<a name="08052069000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s answers were not particularly satisfactory, but we do
not wish to deny tax relief to people who have already suffered
uncertainty as a result of the problems of Northern Rock and how the
lender of last resort was handled. I therefore do not propose to vote
against clause stand
part.</div>

at the heart of the changes to the rules on offshore funds, and there
should be proper legislative scrutiny of changes to it.</div>
					<a name="08052069000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft
instrument with which the Minister kindly provided the Committee
contained significant parts about administrative arrangements,
including on the provision of written information to Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the inquiries that HMRC can make
into a reporting fund and breaches of reporting fund requirements.
Those are all important, but we accept that it might be appropriate for
them to go through the negative procedure. However, we believe that a
substantive change to the rules on offshore funds should go through the
affirmative procedure. The amendment is intended to carve out that core
definition and ensure that it continues to be dealt with through the
affirmative
process.</div>

Ussher:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has explained the effect of the
amendment, so I shall not repeat that. I do not feel that the amendment
is necessary for two reasons. First, it is normal in tax legislation
for regulation-making powers to be introduced. The first exercise of
the power is made by affirmative resolution. That is what form a
substantive debate on the new scheme would take. Subsequent exercises
are made by negative resolution. That follows the same format as that
for UK authorised investment funds introduced in 2005. It is simply
standard
procedure.</div>
					<a name="08052069000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns
have been raised that we might use this power to change the tax
definition of what constitutes an offshore fund. That is not the case.
I reassure hon. Members that the Government have no intention of
changing the tax definition of what constitutes an offshore fund by
means of secondary legislation. Indeed, the Government decided not to
change the definition this year, having listened to industry, and are
committed to further discussions before changing the definition in next
year&#146;s Finance Bill. It will therefore be properly scrutinised
at that stage. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment
because it is
unnecessary.</div>

legislation. In light of the assurances given, I beg to ask leave to

							<a name="08052069000305"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> We were debating whether clause 38 should stand
part of the Bill. I have a series of questions to put to the Minister,
which are based on representations made by a number of different
bodies.</div>
					<a name="08052069000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
question is quite fundamental to the legislation. One of the concepts
that underpins this framework is the distinction between income and
capital, and the fact that they are taxed in different ways. There has
been some comment that that distinction is in danger of outliving its
usefulness, particularly in the convergence on accounting standards and
the new and more complex products that will be included in offshore
funds. It would be quite useful if the Minister would explain why the
Treasury believes that this distinction is still appropriate.
Furthermore, what implication does the Minister think would arise from
the abolition of the distinction between capital and
income?</div>
					<a name="08052069000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the new rules require an offshore fund to report 90 per cent. of its
income. It has been suggested that the calculation may use the existing
UK EP rules. However, there have also been suggestions that, given the
fact that some of these funds are domiciled elsewhere, there are
alternative accounting practices that could be used instead to reduce
the cost of complying with these rules. I wonder if the Minister could
explain the framework that she expects to be in place for the
calculation of the income to be
reported.</div>
					<a name="08052069000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
approach that has been taken is that funds should seek advance
certification to obtain reporting fund status. However, there is
concern that the annual submissions required by HMRC will create
uncertainty; I certainly hope not, and I hope that the fund continues
to qualify. We might therefore introduce an element of retrospectivity
into the way in which funds are granted reporting fund status. Has the
Minister given any thought to how the issue might be addressed and
whether there is a mechanism that could reduce the
uncertainty?</div>
					<a name="08052069000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next point
relates to the role of participants. In its submission, the Institute
of Chartered Accountants notes that there is a contradiction between
clauses 38 and 39. Clause 38 states that the new rules are about the
tax treatment of participants in offshore funds, but clause 39 focuses
on the treatment of the funds themselves. Under the new rules, only the
fund itself can apply for reporting fund status. Under the existing
rules for offshore funds, the participant can request that the Treasury
treat the fund as a distributor fund so that it can keep the current
favourable tax treatment. Has the Treasury given any thought to the
participant being able to apply for the fund to have reporting fund
status?</div>
					<a name="08052069000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
offshore funds marketed in the UK will have an incentive to apply for
reporting fund status, but other funds that people acquire will not
have that status. A fund may derive no benefit from seeking reporting
fund status if its main market is in the US, but an investor might want
it to have that status because that might be advantageous in a tax
sense. Non-UK nationals resident in the UK who hold funds that invest
in their original jurisdiction might, for example, want to apply for
reporting fund status. Similarly, an expat who has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>bought funds in the US and moved back to the UK might welcome the
possibility of that fund having reporting fund status. If the fund
itself did not apply for it, however, there would be no rules to enable
the participant&#151;the fundholder&#151;to do so themselves. That
option is available under the current rules, and I just wondered why it
had not been carried forward into the new
rules.</div>
					<a name="08052069000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052069000306"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> Let me say just a couple of general words before
addressing the specific points raised by the hon. Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="08052069000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
discussed, the clause provides a regulation-making power to allow the
tax regime for UK investors investing in offshore funds to be
modernised and simplified. The offshore fund legislation seeks to
prevent UK investors from gaining beneficial tax treatment by investing
in offshore vehicles, where income flows could be converted into
capital to gain tax advantages.</div>
					<a name="08052069000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
marketplace for investment in offshore funds has changed significantly
since the rules were originally introduced in 1984. The Government have
worked to modernise the rules, while retaining the original objective.
The modernised tax regime for offshore funds has been developed through
extensive consultation with stakeholders. A paper with policy proposals
was issued in October 2007. That was followed by summary of responses
and further policy proposals in March. The draft regulations are in the
public domain for consultation, and copies have been circulated to
members of the Committee, as the hon. Gentleman was kind enough to
mention. The final version will be published in the autumn, with a view
to laying them before the House around the end of the year. As we have
discussed, the regulations will be made under the affirmative
procedure, so they will be subject to full scrutiny by the
House.</div>
					<a name="08052069000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made several points. He asked why clause 39 allows for a
retrospective effect, and she aid that that would perhaps lead to
uncertainty in the industry. The clause permits a retrospective effect
only in limited circumstances, and it will be used only if it becomes
clear following further consultation on the regulations that the
industry wants them, or parts of them, to take effect earlier than the
date on which they are laid in the House of Commons. I want to make
that clear to the Committee to remove any uncertainty.</div>
					<a name="08052069000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked whether moving to a new regime would lead to
additional costs for funds, because systems will have to be updated and
so on. The changes that we are making follow representations from the
industry have been developed through consultation. That is a running
theme in much of today&#146;s debate. Broadly speaking, we may need
to make adjustments to offshore fund systems to reflect the
modernisation changes, but because we are working in
tandem&#151;shoulder to shoulder&#151;with industry we envisage
that the changes will lead to long-term benefits.</div>
					<a name="08052069000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked why an investor cannot apply for reporting fund
status on behalf of an offshore fund. That issue will be considered as
part of the consultation on the offshore funds tax regime. In March
this year, we stated in our most recent publication on the subject that
the Government will consider exploring the feasibility of responses on
that issue in relation to investment by UK investors. HMRC receives
approximately 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>six applications a year from UK investors who wish to treat their
offshore fund investment as if it were a distributor status offshore
fund. We will consider the evidence on whether to replicate similar
rules in the modernised offshore funds tax
regime.</div>
					<a name="08052069000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the framework for the calculation of the
income to be reported. Again, in the document &#147;Offshore Funds:
the Next Steps&#148; that we published in March, we set out our
thoughts on that and on how the computation of income should operate.
The process will be based on acceptable accounting standards and
information, as set out in the regulations that are subject to
consultation. He also asked why the figures are 90 per cent. in
relation to reporting. In principle, it was agreed that 100 per cent.
was appropriate, and the reduction to 90 per cent. was to deal with
cases where the amount could not be easily estimated&#151;it is a
practical, administrative issue. I hope that I have answered the
questions he has asked. If I have not responded to all the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s points, I am happy to do so in
correspondence.</div>

							<a name="08052069000307"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 92, in
schedule 17, page 242, line 3, leave
out sub-paragraphs (5) and (6).</div>
					<a name="08052069000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph (5)
of schedule 17 deals with the tax treatment of fronting reinsurance
commitments, and seeks to tackle a situation in which a life company
obtains tax relief for the costs of acquiring business&#151;for
example, the commission it pays to the person who refers the business
to them&#151;that is reimbursed by the insurer either wholly or
partly for all of those costs. All the risk transfers from the life
company to the reinsurer. In this case, the life company claims tax
relief for the expenses incurred regarding how much is actually
reimbursed by the insurer. The paragraph deals with a particular aspect
of fronting. As part of a package, a retailer may sell a term
assurance, which would be placed with a life company that is then
reinsured with a captive insurer who is part of the same group as the
retailer. The retailer will receive commission from the life assurer
who will be reimbursed for that by the reinsurer. The life assurer will
receive tax relief on the cost of acquiring the business, but, under
the new rules, will not be able to do so where the retailer who
receives the commission and the reinsurer who pays life assurance
commission are part of the same group. The measure will tackle a
practice that has
emerged.</div>
					<a name="08052069000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of British Insurers raised concerns about the provision,
but it has&#151;in my interpretation, with a sense of
reluctance&#151;accepted paragraph (5). We are concerned about the
retrospective nature that arises in sub-paragraphs (5) and (6). Why is
there a retrospective element? I understand that acquisition expenses
for life policies are, for taxes purposes, spread forward over seven
years, so expenses incurred in 2002 will obtain tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>relief between 2002 and 2008. However, the changes under paragraph (5)
do not apply just to expenses incurred after the date of the pre-Budget
report, when the announcement was made, but to all unrelieved expenses.
Costs incurred under existing tax law between 2002 and 2007, on which
businesses would have expected relief and which they would have
factored into their calculations and pricings in respect of the work
that they are doing for the retailer, will now have to be written off,
because they will not obtain any tax relief for them. The insurers
object to that element of retrospectivity. Again, it goes back to a
point that I have made in previous sittings. The measure undermines the
certainty of the tax system, because at that point the insurers knew
what the law was and acted in accordance with
it.</div>
					<a name="08052069000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth bearing in mind the fact that the principles on
retrospectivity&#151;the Rees rules&#151;were debated in the
Standing Committee on the Finance Bill 30 years ago. Peter Rees, then
an Opposition Treasury spokesman and later a distinguished Chief
Secretary to the Treasury&#151;now a Member of the other
place&#151;set out some parameters on retrospective legislation, and
how it could be used to tackle tax avoidance. He argued that
legislation could be backdated to the point at which a clear warning
was given through either a parliamentary question or a statement. The
point was that, having flagged up that change in the law, it could be
enacted in the subsequent Finance Bill. That principle has since been
observed and followed by Governments of both
persuasions.</div>
					<a name="08052069000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Rees principle ensures, in effect, in this country businesses are taxed
on the basis of what the law says. However, in respect of the
provision, the ABI has a point, because it is logical to say that
expenses incurred after the PBR should not get tax relief. Life
companies expected that they were going to be relieved in respect of
expenses that have been incurred, but which have yet to be relieved;
that was the basis on which they incurred those expenses and on which
they expected to get tax relief. Paragraph (5) is retrospective in its
application, but it goes beyond what is acceptable under the Rees
principles, because it means that people will not receive tax relief on
legitimately incurred expenses, even though they were to be taxed in
accordance with the law at the time they were incurred. That is why I
tabled amendment No. 92. Although the amendment may be slightly
technically deficient, I am sure that if the Minister is swayed by the
power of my arguments she will come up with a more technically
compliant amendment on Report. Nevertheless, it is important that the
Committee discuss this
matter.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052069000308"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> If I were swayed by the power of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s arguments, I would overlook the fact that his
amendment should also remove sub-paragraph (7) technically
to have the effect that I presume was intended. Of course, we could
produce Government amendments to correct that, but unfortunately I am
not swayed by the power of his arguments. I shall explain
why.</div>
					<a name="08052069000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08052069000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the Committee&#146;s benefit, since the hon. Gentleman has explained
the purpose of paragraph (5) of schedule 17, I will not
rehearse that argument, but will just address the points that he made.
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>mentioned the Conservative Treasury Minister, Peter Rees, who introduced
the Rees rule. I was wondering whether he had purloined my briefing
pack at some point over lunch, because I was intending to use the Rees
rules to make exactly the opposite point. Peter Rees, who is now in the
other place, set out that the fact that if legislation is announced
before a Budget, it should be sufficiently detailed so that people know
where they stand. We believe we have done that through the pre-Budget
report, so the issue of retrospectivity&#151;if that is the word; it
might be retrospectiveness&#151;is not one that we will take from the
hon. Member for Fareham.</div>
					<a name="08052069000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">That,
however, is beside the point. The substantive point that I want to make
concerns the hon. Gentleman&#146;s complaint that the expenditure on
commissions disallowed for tax purposes in 2008 may have been spent up
to six years ago when the company expected to get relief&#151;I think
that we all know which company we are talking about&#151;and that
that expectation should be honoured. There are a number of responses to
be made, but the main point is that there has been no real outlay of
funds by the fronting company to justify a tax relief. The fronting
company is not at risk in any real sense, and its only interest in the
arrangements is a modest fee. The other economic flows arising from the
arrangement net out to zero, so the tax relief on the commissions is,
therefore, a straightforward tax subsidy that should not be
allowed.</div>
					<a name="08052069000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not accept that the company is entitled to relief in the first
place. If necessary, we may litigate on the issue if it comes to that.
Courts are not always well disposed to tax schemes that manufacture tax
deductions, when there is no corresponding economic cost. Finally,
simply incurring expenditure on an asset does not guarantee that the
tax treatment of the asset, whether on realisation or amortisation of
the expenditure, cannot be changed in future without being
characterised as retrospective. That is what invariably happens in
relation to capital gains tax, and it is what happened with relief
being denied not from 9 October&#151;the PBR date&#151;but from a
later date that is not before 1 January 2008. Therefore, we believe
that the commencement rules in paragraph (5) are fair and
necessary to stop an unacceptable leakage of tax.</div>
					<a name="08052069000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
another point on which I would like to tease the hon. Gentleman. If his
amendment were hypothetically passed, it would deprive the Exchequer of
&#163;35 million in the first full year, which I will now add in to
our black hole calculations. <i class="I">[Laughter.] </i>For that reason alone,
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08052069000309"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I did not expect to provoke such hilarity on our
side. I am surprised at the Minister. After last week&#146;s
announcement of a &#163;2.7 billion reduction in tax allowances,
which will be funded from borrowing, she is not in a position to talk
about anyone&#146;s black holes. I thought that she might have held
back from making that sort of comment in the light of her
Department&#146;s predicament.</div>
					<a name="08052069000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
the Minister to think that we condone the scheme. From my perspective,
I can see where the problems arise. If I thought that the scheme was
acceptable, I would have tabled a very different amendment, which would
delete paragraph (5) entirely. I think that the Minister has drawn the
wrong lesson from the Rees rules, which talk about outlawing a process,
or a tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>avoidance scheme, from the day that the rules are announced. What we
have is a situation in which the expenses incurred are based on the tax
law at the time. I would expect the Rees rules to apply to expenses
incurred from the date of the PBR to the date of Royal Assent. I do not
think that the rules should necessarily apply to expenses incurred
before that period. The Minister&#146;s brief on the Rees rules is
very different from my reading of them, so I cannot have purloined that
document over the lunch break. As we spent some of the lunch break
together, it would have been difficult for me to find out about it. I
do not agree with the Minister&#146;s interpretation of the Rees
rules. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The Minister and I had a very enjoyable
time at the financial services lawyers&#146; AGM. I do not think that
the Minister&#146;s interpretation of the Rees rules is correct, but
I do not particularly want to press the amendment to a vote. I beg to

because, quite rightly, the insurance company gets no tax relief for
the mis-selling costs. However, if the life insurance company receives
a claim under its professional indemnity policy to meet the same sort
of expenses, that recovery would be taxed as a result of changes made
by schedule 17. As there is no policy reason to make that distinction,

							<a name="08052069000316"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Amendment No. 91 was tabled following the
expression of concerns by representative bodies. They could not
understand why the Government had sought to legislate on the
apportionment of income and gains, as that was subject to a
consultation between the insurance industry and the Treasury which was
not expected to conclude until 2009. The changes set out in paragraph 1
were not discussed with those bodies. They were concerned that the
consultation process, which had hitherto run reasonably well, seemed to
have petered out when the changes were proposed. Amendment
No. 91 would revert to the current basis of
apportionment.</div>
					<a name="08052069000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look
forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s explanation of the Government
amendments in the group. We must be serious about consultation; the
situation shows what happens when it goes wrong. I am sure that when
the Chancellor goes round to see the Association of British Insurers
tomorrow, its representatives will make that point to him. Recent
reforms of life insurance taxation have worked smoothly only when they
have involved consultation with the industry rather than change
announced
unexpectedly.</div>

							<a name="08052069000317"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I shall deal with that point immediately. A draft
of paragraph 17 of the schedule was sent to the industry working group
last summer. We received a nil response, so we presumed that it was
okay. Perhaps we should have dragged the group into a room and beat it
out of them, but in the interests of good industry relations, we
decided not to pursue that path. When they saw the Bill, they said,
&#147;Whoops, perhaps there are some issues we want to talk
about.&#148; They then engaged, and we proposed the Government
amendments. In the meantime, I presume that the Opposition tabled
amendment No. 91 as a probing amendment, perhaps as a result of the
same lobbying exercise. At all times, we have sought to engage
constructively.</div>
					<a name="08052069000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
question asked by the hon. Member for Fareham seemed to relate to the
process rather than the actual amendments, I will leave it there,
unless he would like me to explain the amendments.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I think that the hon. Gentleman
wants me to explain them. After consulting with the industry, we tabled
Government amendments Nos. 107, 109 and 116 as part of the ongoing
process of simplifying the life insurance corporation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>tax code. Paragraph 17 of the schedule introduces provisions to clarify
the scope and operation of the rules for dividing the income, gains and
losses of a life insurance company among the different categories of
life insurance
business.</div>
					<a name="08052069000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, like most of schedule 17, the provisions were sent some time
ago to the working groups involved in the major and complex
consultation exercise on life insurance taxation. After the publication
of the Finance Bill, the groups made a number of helpful suggestions
about how the provisions could be improved. That is why Government
amendment No. 107 will replace much of paragraph 17 with a revised and
improved version. It will also introduce a new paragraph 17A, which
continues the simplification process. Amendments Nos. 109 and 116 make
minor consequential repeals of obsolete legislation.</div>
					<a name="08052069000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 17
and the Government amendments will simplify and modernise the rules for
dividing the income and gains of a life insurance company among the
different types of businesses. The changes will not affect how the
division is made, which will be the subject of ongoing discussions with
the insurance industry working group on apportionment. Perhaps that
answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
questions.</div>

that it is always foolish to assume that a nil reply means assent on
difficult technical issues. I look forward with eager anticipation to
discussing apportionment in next year&#146;s Finance Bill. I am
afraid that we seem to debate life assurance in every year&#146;s
Finance Bill; I hope that the end of the consultation process will mean
that we will no longer be required to do so. However, given the

life insurance companies have been able to set the expenses of
management of their long-term insurance business against the income and
gains of that business. That type of management expense is governed by
insurance-specific rules under section 76 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988. In addition, under the Finance Act 2004 a life
insurance company that has any income in its so-called shareholders
fund&#151;assets outside its long-term insurance fund&#151;can set
certain expenses against that income under the general management
expenses rules. If those general expenses exceed a company&#146;s
profits, the excess can be relieved against the profits of other group
companies. That is known as group relief. However, for life insurance
companies, the income and gains of the long-term insurance business are
taken into account in computing the excess despite the fact that those
general expenses cannot be set against those life insurance
profits.</div>

21 of schedule 17 makes a number of amendments to schedule 22 to the

However, I am shocked and horrified to have to say that the need to
make such amendments to paragraph 17 of schedule 22 to the 2001 Act was

							<a name="08052069000330"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I want to raise a concern about the amendment. The
Minister says that it deals with an erroneous repeal in last
year&#146;s Bill, but representations that I have received suggest
that the repeal in last year&#146;s Bill was actually correct and the
repeal this year is erroneous. That sounds a very complicated position
to be
in.</div>
					<a name="08052069000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to a case that has been  before the special
commissioners in which it was ruled that the position in law as it was
after last year&#146;s repeal was correct, and that the life company
could carry forward losses for periods ending before 31 December 2002.
That relief is available to all other corporation  tax
payers.</div>

					<a name="08052069000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
amendment, we appear to have a question of policy rather than the
simple undoing of an accidental repeal. On that basis, there is concern
that it should have been subject to the normal level of consultation
and scrutiny rather than simply being treated as a correction of an
accidental
repeal.</div>
					<a name="08052069000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case involves an insurance company, and the special commissioners found
in favour of the insurer. I understand that the decision is subject to
an appeal in the High Court later this
year.</div>
					<a name="08052069000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment goes slightly beyond correcting an accidental repeal to a
policy decision and actually overrides the decision reached by the
special commissioners. In the light of current litigation, I wonder
whether there should be some proper consultation between the Treasury,
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the industry as to what
the position should
be.</div>

Breed:
						</b> I rise to support the hon. Gentleman. I believe
that we have all had a helpful e-mail from PricewaterhouseCoopers, and
I was somewhat surprised that the Government had continued to pursue
the amendment. It seems that at the very least there needs to be some
clarification and discussion with the industry as to exactly what it
does.</div>
					<a name="08052069000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not simply a matter of repealing an accidental repeal; it is a
matter of fundamental policy. If we allowed the amendment, we would
lose the possibility of a discussion on that and of the
Government&#146;s taking account of the appeal that is going through.
I hope that the Committee resists the amendment because there is clear
evidence that the Government need to look at the matter further.
Bearing it in mind that the amendment will repeal a measure that they
accidentally repealed last time, it would be double jeopardy if they
repealed a measure that should not have been repealed in the first
place.</div>

						</b> What will be the implication if the judges find
against the commissioners? Will the Treasury have to introduce
emergency legislation to undo the erroneous repeal from last year?
Given that the case is ongoing, that is a real possibility. If the
commissioners are proved wrong and last year&#146;s repeal was in
fact not erroneous, will the Treasury be forced into emergency changes
later? Would it not be better on that basis to wait until the court

Financial Secretary referred is in this year&#146;s repeal, not the
problem that arose last year. Last year, according to the judgment of
the special commissioner, the Finance Act 2007 was right. I am
concerned that, actually, the amendment is a poor
decision.</div>

Ussher:
						</b> I understood the hon. Gentleman, but he is not
correct. It has been suggested that we are now reneging on an intended
policy change. The point is that there was no hint in last
year&#146;s Budget of a package of proposed measures with costs
attached to it that actually came into being.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>
					<a name="08052069000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we had
intended to make a policy change last year, it would have cost more
than &#163;50 million. We made the change, but it was unintentional,
which is why we are seeking to correct it. The explanatory notes to
last year&#146;s Bill did not suggest that we intended that cost,
which goes to show that we are now simply trying to get to the position
as we thought it was last year. This is not a desirable position to be
in, but I want to make it absolutely
clear&#151;</div>

						</b> The Minister referred to the measure in last
year&#146;s Budget, the Finance Bill and the explanatory notes. Given
that the Finance Bill made the repeal, is the Government and Treasury
position now that if a measure is not in the Budget, and if it repeals
the Finance Bill, they can decide that it was not a good idea and
revert the Budget and repeal the Finance
Bill?</div>

							<a name="08052069000337"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I am not making any such point. I am simply saying
that we made a mistake last year that had an unanticipated cost. Had it
been deliberate, the cost would have been part of the explanatory notes
and the Budget process. Some companies have benefited as a result, but
we are not proposing to take the money back off them. We are simply
proposing to go back to the situation that we thought we were in last
year.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052069000339"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> The figure of &#163;50 million would be correct
if we did not make the correction today. I am advised that if we make
the amendment, the overall cost is negligible. The cost would be
&#163;50 million if we did  not correct the mistake and if
hon. Members do not  support us.</div>
					<a name="08052069000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware of
the note that PricewaterhouseCoopers circulated to us and I should like
to explain our response. The PWC briefing says that it is perfectly
proper for accidental repeals to be corrected, which is what we are
doing, and, rightly, that HMRC will no doubt argue that reintroducing
paragraph 7(3) is merely putting the law back to the position it was in
prior to the accidental
repeal.</div>
					<a name="08052069000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are, of course, arguing that, but it is not just HMRC that is doing so.
That is the Government&#146;s clear position. The Government&#146;s
policy in 2003, in 2007 and today is that the relief for losses carried
forward must be restricted. It is wrong to say, as the briefing does
say, that the accidental repeal was, nevertheless, correct. The
accidental repeal went against the decision of the special
commissioners. I hope that that lays the matter to
rest.</div>

							<a name="08052069000340"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I am not sure that it does. We emerge from this
slightly more confused than when we started. It would appear from the
note that PWC sent us that the position as it stood in the Finance Act
2007 reflected the law, as the special commissioners found to be the
case. We have some case law here that is very clear that companies
should have been able to carry forward losses that arose prior to 31
December 2002. The special commissioners have been very clear in their
finding about the availability of these losses. To say that this is
merely the reversal of an accidental repeal last year 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>does not really address the concern that the special commissioners have
ruled on this and it is likely to go further.</div>
					<a name="08052069000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
policy decision in that if the special commissioners&#146; findings
were accepted by higher courts, there would be a loss to the Exchequer
of &#163;50 million. We are looking for a bit more openness and
clarity as to why we should support the amendment. While the mistake
may have been accidental last year, the reality is that the law as it
stands reflects the view of the special commissioners in this case.
Unless the Minister can give us some more reassurance, we may have to
press this to a
Division.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052069000341"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I can give the explanation that the hon. Gentleman
requested. It may help the Committee to bear it in mind that there were
two parts to the commissioners&#146; verdict. They found that relief
for losses was implicit in the pre-2003 rules, but they also said that
the 2002 restrictions and later losses were still valid. So the
commissioners&#146; verdict affecting the 2003 change is in line with
putting back the restrictions. Perhaps that resolves the
confusion.</div>

							<a name="08052069000342"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I am troubled by this. Something that has been
presented to the Committee as a reversal of an accidental repeal seems
to be a bit more fundamental than that, given the special
commissioners&#146; case. I am also conscious that this has been
drawn to the Committee&#146;s notice at quite a late stage in our
proceedings. I and other hon. Members probably got this yesterday
evening. Personally, I am minded not to oppose the amendment, but I

and revise the regulation-making powers governing the allocation of
income gains, losses and expenses between taxable and tax-exempt
businesses of friendly societies, so that those powers cover all
circumstances in which an apportionment is required. Friendly societies
are entitled to exemption from corporation tax on profits arising from
life or endowment business and on profits from other business. Those
exemptions are subject to statutory limits. Business written outside of
those limits is taxable. To compute the taxable profits of a friendly
society, it is necessary to apportion income gains, losses and expenses
between taxable and tax-exempt business.</div>

						</b> I am coming to that. Under current law, a friendly
society may have taxable or tax-exempt other business, but not both.
However, schedule 18 allows the transfer of other business between
friendly societies without its impacting on the taxable or tax-exempt
status of a transferred business. That means that it will become
possible for a friendly society to have both taxable or tax-exempt
other
business.</div>
					<a name="08052069000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
there are no rules to divide income gains, losses or expenses between
taxable or tax-exempt other business. Schedule 18 includes a
regulation-making power to allow those rules to be made. However, the
HMRC solicitor drawing up the regulations to do this has advised that
the regulation-making power is insufficient to cover all situations.
Therefore, Government amendment No. 117 strengthens the
regulation-making power included in schedule 18, and Government
amendment No. 118 extends the existing regulation-making power in
section 463 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, so that all

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): Clause 42
relates to property abroad held by a company and to the tax
consequences resulting from that. A requirement for a UK resident to
hold a property abroad through a company is not uncommon, or it is, at
least, to their advantage. For example, in Bulgaria it is necessary for
all properties to be owned either by Bulgarian nationals or by a
Bulgarian company. In France there are certain advantages to holding
property through a company because of inheritance rules and in the US
it is advisable to hold it through a limited liability company because
of legal liability. Therefore, it is a common
circumstance.</div>
					<a name="08052069000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
some time, the problem has been that in those circumstances any income
from that property, if it is rented out, would be treated as a benefit
in kind. The Treasury has been trying to address that issue for some
time. The difficulty has been distinguishing between domestic
arrangements and employee benefits, which is the problem that we have
here. We therefore welcome and support the objective of clause 42, but
I have some detailed questions for the Economic
Secretary.</div>
					<a name="08052069000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording in the clause, and particularly in new section 100A of the
Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, relates to a property
owned by a company&#151;I think that the previous draft referred to
&#147;body corporate&#148;. I understand that it has been changed
to &#147;company&#148; to ensure that French soci(c)t(c)s
civiles immobilires and US limited liability companies are
included in the exemption, and I would be grateful for confirmation of
that. Under new section 100A(1)(a), all the shares of the company have
to be held by individuals. That begs the question, why not trusts?
Trusts are a common manner in which property is held. The traditional
objection to trusts is that they can be used as an anti-avoidance
mechanism. I acknowledge that, but new section 100B(4) would appear to
prevent that difficulty from arising, because it excludes from the
regime an arrangement of which one of the main purposes is the
avoidance of tax or national insurance contributions. Therefore, is
there a good reason why a trust should not be able to hold shares in
the relevant company? It also excludes a local management company,
perhaps acting as a nominee. There is doubt as to whether a local
management company as nominee for an individual would be able to hold
shares in the company. Again, we would be grateful if the Economic
Secretary could clarify
that.</div>
					<a name="08052069000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
potential difficulty is that new section 100A(1)(a) refers to the fact
that the director and the shareholder, or the property owner, will be
the same person. It might be that the director of the company will be
one  spouse and the owner of the shares the other. That would
appear to be excluded from the wording in new section
100A(1)(a).</div>
					<a name="08052069000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to new section 100A(2), the conditions on the company owning the
property include that the property must be the company&#146;s main or
only asset. That is usually interpreted as more than 50 per cent.
of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>the company&#146;s assets, but it does not necessarily need to be more
than that. Professional advisers have raised the point that the company
may hold cash to secure borrowing, or have an overseas bank account
which is used for running costs and/or to receive rent. So
clarification as to what &#147;main or only asset&#148; means in
that context would be helpful. Would the activities set out in new
section 100A(2)(c) exclude activities relating to the management of
minor assets? Can the Economic Secretary clarify the intention
here?</div>
					<a name="08052069000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
structure proposed by new section 100A(3) would appear to allow for a
holding company on top of the company that owns the property, but that
holding company has to be owned by the individuals in question. It has
to own all of the company that holds the property. Professional
advisers&#151;the Institute of Chartered Accountants, I
think&#151;have asked what happens if two sets of friends own a
property through two holding companies. Why deny the relief in such
circumstances? It would seem to be possible to structure in such a way
that that problem disappears, but is there any particular reason why
such restrictions on a holding company are in
place?</div>
					<a name="08052069000250"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08052069000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 100A(4) relates to the relevant interest in the property
and states that it must
be</div>
					<a name="08052069000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
right to exclusive possession of the property at all times and at
certain
times.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08052069000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
for clarification, I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm
that that does not cause a problem if the property is rented out,
particularly with a timeshare arrangement, when the owners would have
exclusive possession only at particular times, which would fall within
the definition of &#147;certain times&#148;? Would that fall within
the regime as set out in clause
42?</div>
					<a name="08052069000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
given that the issue is of long standing and has taken some time to be
resolved, I understand that the position of HMRC is that it will not
pursue tax liabilities in certain circumstances. The criteria are as
follows: the property is owned by a company owned by individuals; the
company&#146;s only activities are ones incidental to its ownership
of the property; the property is the company&#146;s only or main
asset; and the company is not funded directly or indirectly by a
connected company. Again, will the Minister confirm that that is the
policy approach of HMRC in such circumstances, while we wait
for the terms of clause 42 to come into
effect?</div>

							<a name="08052069000349"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, clause 42 will ensure
that individuals who have used their own money to buy&#151;or who
will buy&#151;a home abroad through a company will not face a benefit
in kind tax charge for any private use of the property. Some
UK-resident individuals have set up or acquired companies to own a
property abroad, generally for holiday use. They will often have done
so on the advice of their professional advisers, because of the
specific laws in the country where the property is located. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned Bulgaria. If those resident individuals direct the
company&#146;s affairs, they could be within the scope of the living
accommodation benefit in kind tax charge, although they may not have
been aware of that. They may have considered that no tax charge arose
in such circumstances and have not therefore reported the matter to HM
Revenue and Customs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>
					<a name="08052069000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
before us will remove that benefit in kind tax charge if certain
qualifying conditions are satisfied. It will apply where an overseas
property is owned by a company that is owned by individuals and the
sole activity of which is holding that property for occupation and/or
letting. That will include ownership through foreign companies, such as
French SCIs, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire mentioned.
The measure will have retrospective effect. It is right that we should
remove the tax charge that would otherwise arise in those
circumstances. It is not fair that those who have decided to buy a
property abroad, out of their own taxed income, should face a bill
simply because they did so through a
company.</div>
					<a name="08052069000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked a number of specific questions. A general point is
that eligibility will be considered against the rules that have been
laid out&#151;we expect those rules to be clear, but we may need to
look at the specifics of a specific situation in order to be able to
judge, so I do not want to give any misleading impression today. I can
respond in some general
ways.</div>
					<a name="08052069000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether companies owned by a trust were covered by
the exemption. The exemption will not apply where the property-holding
companies are owned by a trust. The limited exemption is intended to
remove the benefits tax charge in certain circumstances&#151;where an
individual had incurred the charge without realising it. The Government
feel that the current qualifying criteria strike the right balance in
that
regard.</div>
					<a name="08052069000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about a situation in which management companies
are nominees. The legislation covers the situation in which the company
owning the property is held by another company, and that can include a
management company if it is within that definition. He also mentioned a
situation in which property is rented out. If the property is rented
out and the owner makes a profit, it will be treated as any other
rental income. Obviously, if an individual has difficulty with a
specific situation, they should contact HMRC and look at how that
situation relates to general policy. The hon. Gentleman mentioned
timeshare. I have already explained what would happen if property was
rented out and the same applies to timeshare, so there is no issue
there.</div>
					<a name="08052069000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">If two
friends buy a property, the exemption applies regardless of whether the
property is owned by a single person or with someone else. The
legislation applies where the accommodation is provided to a director
or their spouse, and the fact that both spouses own shares in the
company will not affect whether they are covered by the exemption. The
legislation includes only a benefit that arises from the owner&#146;s
private use&#151;running costs for the rental of the property would
be allowable as usual. I think that I have answered all of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s questions.</div>
					<a name="08052069000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08052069000350"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I should declare an
interest because we sell overseas property. The Minister did not speak
about the incidental element of the question. Often, the company will
have a bank account in a foreign country. There may be a substantial
amount of money in it because the owner will bring across money,
depending on the exchange rate. That might fall foul of the incidental
provision.</div>

clarification on a number of points, but I would like to return to the
trust issue. As I said earlier, if a company&#146;s shares are held
via a trust, I do not think that it will benefit. The question remains
why not? I was concerned about a situation in which all the shares are
owned by one spouse, although the other spouse is the director of the
relevant company. Would that situation be protected? Although I have
those concerns, on the whole we welcome the clause.</div>

						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, clause 43 exempts
in-work credit, return-to-work credit, the in-work emergency fund and
the in-work emergency discretion fund from income tax. Such schemes are
designed to encourage lone parents and incapacity benefit claimants to
take up, and stay in, employment. The income tax exemption will apply
to payments made on or after 6 April. In-work credit and return-to-work
credit are weekly in-work payments for up to a year, to help the
transition into work for lone parents and people with a disability or
health condition. Lone parents in work can also receive discretionary
payments from the in-work emergency discretion fund in Great Britain,
and the in-work emergency fund in Northern Ireland, to help overcome
unexpected financial barriers to work. The income tax exemption will
ensure that payments under the scheme provide a clear, simple and

Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I have one brief question on
the clause. I understand what the clause seeks to achieve, but I want
to ask about the new tax regime for qualifying low CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>emission cars, which has been introduced from April this year.
From that date, cars with CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions of under 120g/kg are
subject to an appropriate percentage of 10 per cent., which will be
increased by 3 per cent. if the car has a diesel engine.</div>
					<a name="08052069000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
assessment has the Treasury made of the number of cars that are likely
to take advantage of that tax regime over the next three years? What
amount of tax giveaway will be provided as part of that regime, to
encourage those who have company cars, and companies that have company
cars as a taxable benefit, to choose qualifying low CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>emission cars, rather than going for the more traditional company
car models that people have chosen in the past? That is the main
question that I wanted to ask, to obtain more information about the
qualifying low CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emission cars, and I would be grateful
for any light that the Minister can shed on the Treasury&#146;s
expectations of how the scheme will work.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052069000356"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):
						</b> As the
hon. Lady will know, the whole approach to company car taxation since
it was reformed in 2002 has been to base it on carbon emissions, which
encourages the take-up and development of more fuel-efficient cars in
company fleets.</div>
					<a name="08052069000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
promotes more environmentally efficient business travel and the take-up
of cleaner cars because it will reduce the lower threshold from 135g/kg
to 130g/kg of emissions. The lower threshold rate relates to an
appropriate percentage of 15 per cent., which will have the effect of
reducing each of the 21 company car tax bands by 5g/kg. The new rules
will apply from 6 April 2010.</div>
					<a name="08052069000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the 120g/kg category at the very low end, about which the hon. Member
for Putney asked, we anticipate that over 100 different cars in the
next three years would qualify on those emissions bases. This is set
within the context of the forthcoming EU regulatory requirements, which
will ratchet down the emissions that are allowable under EU law. We
believe that manufacturers are already responding to the challenge of
populating that area of the company car tax threshold rate, and the
hon. Lady should also bear in mind the fact that fleet car sales are
about half of all new car sales per year. It is therefore particularly
important to send these messages to manufacturers who are aiming at the
fleet car market. It is a very influential market&#151;half of all
new car sales&#151;and it presents a way of achieving quite a rapid
turnover and an improvement in CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions from new cars
on the

						</b> Clause 48 exempts from tax payments to certain
members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces under the Ministry of Defence
new armed forces council tax relief scheme. The Opposition welcome
attempts to assist our armed services. I think that the Committee will
not disagree that our armed services do a fantastic job for this
country and, indeed, for the rest of the world. It is right that they
should be treated well. Today is not the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>time to debate at greater length the military covenant and the
relationship between the Government and the armed forces. The armed
forces council tax relief scheme is an attempt to cover a certain
amount of lost ground for the Government, but it is welcome none the
less. It is quite right that it should be exempt from
tax.</div>
					<a name="08052069000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want, however, to make one or two points. Paragraph 4 of the
explanatory notes to the clause
states:</div>
					<a name="08052069000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Following
an announcement by the Secretary of State for Defence on 25 October
2007, payments under the Ministry of Defence&#146;s new Armed Forces
Council Tax Relief scheme are due to start from 1 April
2008.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08052069000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
checked that and there is an inaccuracy. The announcement was made on
25 September, not 25 October. I am sure that that is an entirely
innocent mistake, but the context of the original announcement on 25
September was the Labour party conference in Bournemouth. The speech
was made by the Secretary of State for Defence in what was believed to
be a pre-election conference. How long ago that
seems.</div>
					<a name="08052069000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
or two points in that announcement attracted some criticism. First, the
original proposal related only to members of the armed forces serving
in Iraq and Afghanistan. On 28 January, the scheme was extended to
include other places in the world such as the Balkans. It also appeared
that the scheme was to be funded entirely from the existing MOD budget.
Although it provided a happy announcement for the Government at their
party conference, it was going to be funded by cuts elsewhere in the
MOD
budget.</div>
					<a name="08052069000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal in September was somewhat hurried. Will the Minister explain
when the Treasury first became aware that it might result in a tax
liability for members of the armed forces? The measures before us were
proposed to ensure that the council tax relief scheme would be exempt
from tax payments. Will the Minister also clarify the position for
national insurance contributions? Again, the explanatory notes
state:</div>
					<a name="08052069000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Secondary
legislation will introduce a parallel disregard for National Insurance

					<a name="08052069000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
under the clause, the council tax relief scheme will be exempt for
income tax purposes from April 2008. From the passage of the National
Insurance Contributions Bill earlier this year, my understanding of
national insurance contributions is that they are determined by a
forward-looking process. It is therefore necessary to pass secondary
legislation for the next year. I may well be wrong on this, but will
the Minister confirm that the disregard for national insurance
contributions will not start until April 2009, so there will be an
additional national contributions liability for members of the armed
services benefiting from the armed forces council tax relief
scheme?</div>

it is a pleasure to be in Committee this afternoon under your
chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I have enjoyed listening to the
discussions.</div>

do not believe that the national insurance effect will take exactly the
form that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire suggested. I
will make a few general comments. I understand from my advice that the
announcement was made in October, but I will double-check in the light
of what he said.</div>

Kennedy:
						</b> I apologise. I acknowledge that it was September
when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced
the introduction of the new scheme of tax-free council tax relief for
members of the armed forces who are deployed on operations overseas. I
do not want to go into the history, but it is clear that from 1 October
2007, the areas that attract operational allowance, namely Afghanistan
and Iraq, will give rise to council tax relief, but from 1 February,
service in other operational zones has been specified&#151;that is,
as I understand it, overseas operations, including British Forces South
Atlantic Islands, Bahrain, Bosnia, Diego Garcia, Kosovo, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, and deployed Royal Navy ships in receipt of the overseas
deployment welfare package, and UN operations. The Ministry of Defence
has the power to amend the specified areas from time to
time.</div>
					<a name="08052069000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
NICs changes will take effect from April this year, and secondary
legislation was introduced with that effect to ensure that the relief
is disregarded for NICs. I do not agree with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s description of the reasons why the proposal was
introduced. We have a compact with the British Army, and certainly
British soldiers whom I meet from my constituency acknowledge the
genuine commitment that the Government have made to British armed
forces. They believe to some degree that we do not receive fair
acknowledgement for our work to ensure that our armed forces are
supported in every
way.</div>
					<a name="08052069000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
payment of the council tax relief and what we are discussing today are
important steps to ensure that our armed forces receive council tax
relief as intended. Many of them endure danger in difficult
circumstances, and we believe that the relief should not be taxed,
thereby ensuring that they receive the maximum benefit. The clause will
cover all payments of council tax relief to the armed forces from April
this year, and I hope that the clause will stand part of the
Bill.</div>

Gauke:
						</b> I am grateful for that clarification, although I
stand by my point that the matter has been hurried. The Minister did
not confirm the time at which the Treasury was first aware of council
tax relief being potentially taxable, but none the less we welcome the
clause.</div>

Committee? When we came into this room, the clock was five minutes
ahead of the time on the monitor. I understand that we are using the
time on the monitor, but it is confusing to have two time references in
the same room, and I wonder whether I could look to you, Mr.
