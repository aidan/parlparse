of the money and Ways and Means resolutions connected to the Bill are
available in the room. I should also point out that adequate notice
should be given of amendments; as a general rule,Mr. Atkinson
and I will not call starred amendments. Please would all hon. Members
also ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so on are turned off or in
silent mode in Committee.</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):</b> I beg to
move,</div><a name="0606217000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">That&#151;</div><a name="0606217000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">(1)
during proceedings on the Compensation Bill, in addition to its first
meeting on Tuesday 20th June at 4.30 p.m., the Standing Committee shall
meet on Thursday 22nd June at9.00 am and 1.00 p.m. and on
Tuesday 27th June at 4.30
p.m;</div><a name="0606217000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">(2) the proceedings shall be
taken in the order shown below and shall (so far as not previously
concluded) be brought to a conclusion at 7.00 p.m. on Tuesday 27th
June: Clauses 1 to 8; Schedule; Clauses 9 to 17; and remaining
proceedings on the
Bill.</div><a name="0606217000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had a
constructive discussion in the Programming Sub-Committee yesterday, and
I hope that the Committee will therefore agree the programme motion. I
welcome you to the chair, Mr. Caton. You conducted last night&#146;s
meeting efficiently and smoothly, and I am sure that all members of the
Committee look forward to working with you to ensure the Bill&#146;s
smooth passage through Committee.</div>
<a name="0606217000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606217000344"></a><b class="B">Paddy
Tipping</b> (Sherwood) (Lab): As the Minister says, we had a
useful discussion in the Programming Sub-Committee yesterday. She will
recall that on Second Reading there was a good deal of discussion about
asbestos-related diseases and mesothelioma. Pressure was put on the
Minister to use this Bill as a vehicle to introduce legislation on
that. Will there be time in Committee to look at that
issue?</div>
<a name="0606217000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000345"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is
absolutely right that there was a great deal of pressure, from him and
other Government Back Benchers, about the dreadful situation facing
people with that tragic disease of mesothelioma. He will know that I
said on Second Reading that we were determined to look carefully at the
House of Lords&#146; judgment to see what we could do. He will, I
hope, be pleased to hear that the Government intend to bring forward
legislation to deal with the Barker judgment in the House of Lords, in
order that those who have suffered from mesothelioma will be able to
recover full compensation from negligent employers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div><a name="0606217000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend to table an amendment
to the Bill. Whether that is in Committee or on Report will be
determined by how we get to the detail of it, but I assure my hon.
Friend and other members of the Committee that it is our absolute
intention to ensure that those who are presently suffering or who will
suffer from that awful disease will get the compensation that they so
rightly deserve.</div>
<a name="0606217000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606217000346"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Hamilton</b> (Midlothian) (Lab): I have two questions.
May I ask about back payment, which may also be discussed? Also, will
the Bill apply throughout Scotland under a Sewel motion? It is
extremely important to recognise that the legislation should cover the
whole of the United Kingdom, not England alone.
</div><a name="0606217000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000347"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. It
would be quite inequitable if we were to legislate only for one part of
the United Kingdom and not all of it. Whether that is done by a Sewel
motion or via the Scottish Executive is being discussed as we speak. We
are in contact with the Scottish Executive to ensure that we work
together so that everyone in the United Kingdom affected by that
dreadful disease is properly compensated.</div>
<a name="0606217000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606217000348"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Michael Clapham</b> (Barnsley, West and Penistone) (Lab): Is
it the intention of the amendment to restore the law back to the 2002
Fairchild decision? That actually established fairness, which Barker
took away.</div>
<a name="0606217000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000349"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I must remind Committee that we should be
debating the programme motion. We are getting into the subject matter
of the proposed amendment but we cannot consider that until we have an
amendment before us.</div>
<a name="0606217000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000350"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Caton, for that
advice. I hope that we will have a full debate on those aspects when we
bring the amendment forward, but my hon. Friend the Member for
Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) knows my intention and that
of the Department: to ensure that everyone is properly compensated in
this area.</div>
<a name="0606217000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606217000351"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): I also
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Caton, as I do your brother Chairman, Mr.
Atkinson. We have considered Bills under your firm tutelage in the past
and I know that you will continue to be firm and
fair.</div><a name="0606217000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">In deciding
whether the allocation of time is suitable, and whether any knives are
needed in the programme motion, it is worth pointing out that there
issues inpart 2 deserve proper scrutiny. Therefore, if in
light of the Minister&#146;s statement, which I welcome, it is her
intention to table in Committee the welcome amendment dealing with the
Barker judgment, would it be possible to have extra time if we needed
it? We would have to debate the amendment to see whether it properly
tackles the issues raised by the Barker judgment over the allocation of
damages to mesothelioma sufferers, as the hon. Member for Barnsley,
West and Penistone mentioned.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div><a name="0606217000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">At that time, will the Minister
tell us whether she has plans to tackle the problem of those who
currently have no one to sue? As she knows, there are concerns that
some individuals cannot trace their employer&#146;s insurer or were
not affected in their workplace. Clearly, given that there should be a
quick response to that dreadful illness and that cases should be dealt
with out of court, Ministers might have to give further thought to ways
of helping some of the other sufferers as well. I would be grateful to
know whether she is thinking of doing anything to help other sufferers
of that dreadful disease. Of course, one problem is that the disease
takes such a long time to act. The condition can attack 30 or 40 years
after a person was working somewhere, after which it operates
incredibly fast. It would help to know whether a better tracing system
could be found.</div> <a name="0606217000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
usual channels will want to keep an eye on our progress on the first
part of the Bill to ensure that debate is balanced and that we have the
chance to discuss the important part 2 issues as well as the question
of mesothelioma. We will want to examine the language in clause 1 to
see whether it needs further clarification. Should it be discretionary
or compulsory for the courts to have regard to paragraphs (a) and (b)?
We will examine the phrase &#147;desirable activity&#148; and see
whether other words might better encompass that concept. We will want
to test whether the use of the expression &#147;particular
steps&#148; in clause 1 might change the law, as some have
suggested.</div><a name="0606217000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay
tribute to my right hon. and noble FriendLord Hunt for
bringing forward clause 2 in the other place, but we will want to test
whether &#147;an offer of treatment&#148;&#151;the wording in the
clause&#151;includes the provision of such treatment. We would want
to avoid the silly situation in which an offer once accepted might
nullify the effect of clause 2. I would be interested to know the
Minister&#146;s views on that in due
course.</div><a name="0606217000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
issues in part 2 that we will need to discuss, and which will affect
the decision on the programme motion. We will want to be sure that all
claims managers are covered by the new or professional regulator. That
must include trade unions, because although the vast bulk of them do an
excellent job for their members, and are to be applauded for doing so,
there have been examples in recent months and years of a small number
of trade unions abusing the situation. The Minister acknowledged that
on Second Reading.</div><a name="0606217000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would also like to be sure that inappropriate advertising of claims and
legal services is tackled by the Bill or under regulations and guidance
derived from the Bill, because clearly there is concern among outside
bodies that such advertising in hospitals and other places is
inappropriate.</div><a name="0606217000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
also want to discuss who the regulator should be. The Government have
said that it should be Lord Falconer and a trading standards
department. We believe that something more substantial is required. We
would like the Minister to explain why the Financial Services Authority
and other regulators that already operate in the financial sector and
cover insurance should not be available to deal with what is
after-the-event insurance. There are no two ways about it: it is a
financial product as well as being vital to making
claims.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 6</div><a name="0606217000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subject to the two important
issues that the usual channels will ensure that the balance of debate
does not get out of hand, and that we might be given some consideration
if the Minister decided to introduce in Committee the important matter
of mesothelioma, we are content with the programme
motion.</div><a name="0606217000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606217000352"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Julian Brazier</b> (Canterbury) (Con): I
wanted to make one point. I am not sure whether it is to do with the
motion or whether I should raise it as a point of order. Despite being
short, clause 1 is complicated, and it took up a large part of Second
Reading, so the grouping of amendments obviously required the judgment
of Solomon. I am anxious not to waste the Committee&#146;s time by
seeking to catch your eye, Mr. Caton, on clause 1 stand part. I hope
that it will be possible, when discussing amendment No. 11, to refer in
general terms to some of the amendments in the third group of
amendments, because they bear heavily on the merits or otherwise of
amendment No. 11. For me, doing so would avoid the need for a clause
stand part debate.</div>
<a name="0606217000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606217000353"></a><b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): I thank the
Minister and the Whips for accommodating a request on timing from our
corner of the jungle. Like other hon. Members, I serve on other
Committees and I am grateful that the timetable allows us not only to
do that but to do the other jobs that were fixed beforehand.</div>
<a name="0606217000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise for missing the
excitement of the Programming Sub-Committee, but having had profitable
conversations with the Whip I trusted that what had been promised would
be delivered. I am vindicated, and the Minister lives up to her
reputation. </div><a name="0606217000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) and I will
be happy to consider the implications of the Minister&#146;s
announcement about mesothelioma. As I said on Second Reading, it is a
hugely important issue and one that many hoped might be dealt with
under the Bill. If it can be proceeded with satisfactorily through an
amendment to the Bill, and if that is moved in Committee, it
self-evidently may have an impact on time. However, dealing with the
current rather muddled legal situation may require technically complex
drafting, and it is important that everyone is satisfied that the
provision does what we want. I therefore flag up the fact that we may
need to return to the programme motion, given that it is based on the
Bill as we see it now. I do not argue for more time in Committee unless
it is needed, but if we are to make such a change in Committee we must
get it right. I am sure that all parties will be willing to accommodate
that, and to ensure that we have enough time.</div>
<a name="0606217000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that context, the earlier
that we start discussions or informal consultation about the drafting
of such a provision the better. I am keen always to be co-operative and
helpful, and we want to ensure that as far as possible the drafting is
seen to work before it is formally tabled.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000354"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Given that it is a technical matter and that a lot
of legal issues may be thrown up by it, does the hon. Gentleman agree
that if the Minister were to table an amendment it would be useful to
have a helpful explanatory note about how it would tackle the issues in
Barker and Corus?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div><a name="0606217000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000355"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That would be helpful. I know that the Minister
will try to do so.</div> <a name="0606217000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a four-page note on the implications of Barker <i class="I">v. </i>Corus
from my hon. and academic Friend the Member for Cambridge (David
Howarth), whose life work has been to study and teach the law of
negligence. I have read it twice and I am still not sure that I
understand all the implications. I am sure that it just requires a bit
more fresh air and a flannel and less distraction because of the World
cup. The serious point is that, yes, the more information we get at an
earlier stage, the better. If that is not possible, I would be happy
for that information to be provided on Report, with plenty of
opportunity for colleagues to think about it. Ideally, though, it would
be provided in
Committee.</div><a name="0606217000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="0606217000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two final
points. I have never before been on a Committee in which the
Conservative party&#151;for that matter, any party&#151;has done a
sort of trailer for the real film of all the things that are to come.
Now we know what issues the Conservative party will treat us to. It is
always useful to know what is coming down the tracks, and we look
forward to discussing those issues. The one that we clearly need time
for&#151;the trade union relationship and trade union
solicitors&#151;was referred to in part 2, which is much less
controversial. There is a willingness to make sure that we understand
what the law is and what it should
be.</div><a name="0606217000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, in case
people comment later, I have always taken the view that, in Committee,
we should be as lightly whipped as possible, because Committee stage is
when people should be able to express individual opinions. So, if my
hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire and I have a difference of
view&#151;I have not discussed with him whether we do&#151;we shall
vote differently. In my view, that is what Committees should be for: to
allow Members to express their view unless there is a party manifesto
commitment. I do not think that there are any great party manifesto
commitments at stake. I hope that we will have a constructive debate
and be persuaded by the argument, not by pre-ordained views that drive
us into a particular voting Lobby or in a particular
direction.</div>
<a name="0606217000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000356"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Let me respond to Mr. Brazier&#146;s earlier
question. There was a difficult decision as to whether to put all the
amendments together and debate them in common. We decided that to do so
would give the Committee a better opportunity to discuss all the
issues. Like the hon. Gentleman, I hoped that we would avoid a separate
stand part debate because we would have covered everything in detail by
that point. The more general points would be most appropriately made in
the debate on the amendments grouped with amendment No.
27.</div>
<a name="0606217000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000357"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Normally, I hope that the programme motion will
pass virtually unscathed, but we have had an important debate about
what is in the Bill and what we hope will be in the Bill.</div>
<a name="0606217000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) is absolutely right: mesothelioma is a
disease that can be 30 years in gestation but which once 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div>diagnosed can cause a quick and painful death. We want to make
absolutely sure that sufferers and their families are as protected as
possible from the consequences of the disease. The Department for Work
and Pensions and the Department for Constitutional Affairs have been
working with stakeholders to find ways to improve the claims process
and the tracking of employers and insurers. We know that to be
important.</div><a name="0606217000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000358"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The hon. Lady will be aware that some major
insurers in this country&#151;Norwich Union, Zurich and so
on&#151;have good systems for tracing companies that were insured by
them through the years. The same is not true of some others. Clearly, a
level playing field helps everyone. It helps the claimant because he is
able to trace an employer&#146;s insurer and therefore has someone to
sue. It also means that the system is
fairer.</div>
<a name="0606217000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000359"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. We are
aware of that. It is one of the reasons that a great deal of work is
going on in that area.</div>
<a name="0606217000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606217000360"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Kevan Jones</b> (North Durham) (Lab): I warmly welcome the
inclusion of the amendment on mesothelioma. The issue of pleural
plaques was raised on Second Reading. Has that issue been considered on
the scope of whatever amendment the Government are bringing
forward?</div>
<a name="0606217000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000361"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> We are concentrating on the Barker judgment and
have asked officials to work on that. As for timing, I would like that
amendment to be introduced in Committee for two reasons. First, I said
as much on Second Reading, but, secondly and more importantly, Labour
Back Benchers in Committee have been most vociferous in advocating the
cause of mesothelioma sufferers. It is appropriate that my hon. Friends
should be the first to ensure that such changes take place. However, if
it cannot be done by the end of our time in Committee, we can come back
to the issue on
Report.</div><a name="0606217000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reflecting
on the issues, we have received cross-departmental support for what we
are trying to do. I can tell the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) that the Bill is a Labour party manifesto
commitment, and I am pleased that the proceedings are taking place.
However, I hope that people do not underestimate the amount of work
that has already been done in the short time since the Barker judgment
to make sure that people who suffer from mesothelioma and their
families receive the justice that they deserve. I know from comments in

Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): I beg to move amendment No.
11, in page 1, line 4, leave out &#145;may' and insert
&#145;shall'.</div><a name="0606217000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton. I am
introducing the amendment as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire has to leave our proceedings before the debate is likely
to conclude. The amendment is small. It is an attempt to move the power
of the court from a discretionary to a mandatory power. In its report
&#147;Better Routes to Redress&#148;, the Better Regulation
Commission concluded that the compensation culture is a myth. However,
the cost of belief in it is real. I agreed with that conclusion and
therefore support the principle of clause
1.</div><a name="0606217000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Constitutional Affairs report &#147;Effects of
advertising in respect of compensation claims for personal
injuries&#148; demonstrated how widespread is the perception that we
live in a compensation culture. Quantitative findings suggest a very
strong, widespread belief that there has been an increase over the past
five years in the number of people making successful claims for
personal injury compensation. The report showed that 87 per cent. of
those who responded believe that more people claim compensation for
personal injury than did five years ago. The majority expressed the
view that a lot more&#151;67 per cent.&#151;were doing so,
while 20 per cent. of people thought that a few more people
were doing so. Only 1 per cent. thought that fewer people were claiming
compensation. None thought that a lot fewer were. Those findings are of
concern and underline the importance of clause 1, which is designed to
add greater clarity and certainty to the
law.</div><a name="0606217000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000365"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> I do not deny that there is that perception, but
the reality is different. The number of cases entered before the court
is, in fact, dropping. One significant thing about clause 1 is that it
works on perceptions of what is happening rather than the reality of
what is happening on the
ground.</div><a name="0606217000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000366"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> The hon. Gentleman has pre-empted my later
comments Clause 1 is designed to add greater clarity and certainty to
the law. That is also the purpose of the amendment. There should be
some readily understood clarity on what the clause seeks to do. The
amendment accentuates the fact that clause 1 does not change the law
but merely clarifies the existing
law.</div><a name="0606217000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In another place,
Baroness Ashton
argued:</div><a name="0606217000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reason why we said "may" rather than "shall" is that when a court looks
at a negligence claim it takes into account all the circumstances of an
individual case; those circumstances, of course, vary dramatically from
one case to another, as all those who are members of the legal
profession will know far better than I.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 December 2005; Vol. 676, c.
200.]</div><a name="0606217000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that Ministers
may be reluctant to fetter the discretion of the court, but the
discretion remains in the overall provisions of clause 1, which enabled
the court to consider all the circumstances of the case. The law should
continue to develop. However, a clear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>statement is necessary for judges and the public. There should be some
readily understood clarity on what it seeks to do.</div>
<a name="0606217000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is wrong with the clause
stating that the circumstances will be considered, if it does not amend
the law? Why do Ministers not have the confidence to say that those
matters are required, not optional? Greater clarity and certainty are
necessary. I envisage, unless the Minister is willing to respond,
endless satellite litigation on whether the judge should exercise the
discretion, let alone on how the discretion is to be
exercised.</div><a name="0606217000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606217000367"></a><b class="B">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): Welcome to the Chair,
Mr. Caton. Does the hon. Lady agree that it is hard to see why the
Government would want to resist that? By putting &#147;shall&#148;
instead of &#147;may&#148;, we are asking that the court will
always take account of that condition. If it does not apply, that will
be fine. However, it may be inferred from &#147;may&#148; that
there might be occasions when the conditions should be taken into
account but will not be. Does she agree that the amendment is a
sensible&#151;almost a housekeeping&#151;change to ensure that the
clause is properly
applied.</div><a name="0606217000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000368"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman
for his thoughtful intervention. He has triggered my awareness of an
omission in my introduction; I should have said that the amendment is
introduced in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire, my own and that of the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. I apologise for
forgetting to do
that.</div><a name="0606217000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to the
Arculus report from the Better Regulation Task Force entitled
&#147;Better Routes to Redress&#148;, which Members may recall was
published in May 2004 and it put forward this
view:</div><a name="0606217000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">"an exaggerated fear of
litigation, regardless of fault can be debilitating. The fear of
litigation can make organisations over cautious in their behaviour.
Local communities and local authorities cancel events unnecessarily and
ban activities which, until recently, would have been considered
routine. Businesses may be in danger of becoming less innovative and
without innovation there will be no progress".</div>
<a name="0606217000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those words underpin the strength of the
case for being more certain about the impact of the legislation and
therefore moving from a discretionary situation to a mandatory one.
That is why I move the
amendment.</div><a name="0606217000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000369"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I did not intend to be churlish in not welcoming
you to the Chair earlier, Mr. Caton. I do so now and think we will have
as interesting a Committee stage as we had on Second Reading.</div>
<a name="0606217000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
amendment. The intervention a moment ago by the hon. Member for
Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) slightly missed the point. There may be a
sharp decline in the kind of activities that attract litigation, but a
fall in the number of cases does not show lesser willingness to
litigate, it shows that activities are disappearing. That is perhaps a
theoretical point.</div>
<a name="0606217000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The practical
fact is that my colleagues and I in the all-party group on adventure
and recreation in society&#151;I am delighted to see my co-chairman,
the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, on the Liberal Democrat Benches,
and our Labour co-chairman, the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div>Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt), made a powerful speech on
Second Reading&#151;are concerned not by the great raft of litigation
across all headings but by the amount relating to adventure training,
sport and physical recreation, which is a very small proportion of the
total. The overall statistics are not
relevant.</div><a name="0606217000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="0606217000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000370"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> The hon. Gentleman confuses the argument. He
accuses me of saying that the number of cases has gone down because
people have been put off activities, but has now admitted that
adventure and outdoor training, which is indeed important, is a very
small part of the claims total. If we are legislating, we must
legislate from fact, which is that claims registered are decreasing,
rather than from
perception.</div><a name="0606217000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000371"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but the
fact is that America, which has the worst compensation culture in the
world with more than five times our level of litigation, has a much
higher barrier in most states to protect sport and adventure training
than would be created even by a clause 1 strengthened in the way the
amendment proposes. In most American states, reckless disregard must be
proved, which means in practice that intent must be proved, and my
concern is with those areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster
(Angela Watkinson) made a powerful case by saying that the courts
should take the circumstances into account rather than having the
option to do so.</div> <a name="0606217000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be burdensome to repeat the case from a court in Manchester that
I described in detail on Second Reading, as almost everybody here was
present. However, I ask hon. Members to consider whether the judge in
that case, which took place while the matter was being debated in
another place, would have bothered to use his discretion in the way the
clause advocates. Hon. Members will remember that he awarded
&#163;15,000 against the Scouts for allowing a Brownie to cut herself
by sitting on a seat in an auditorium that had been doubly inspected
before a pantomime that the Scouts were performing for the
Brownies.</div><a name="0606217000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ian Lewis,
the director of Campaign for Adventure, which brings together most of
the adventure training organisations in this country,
commented:</div><a name="0606217000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association and the British Horse
Society...are being forced to close centres because the insurance
is becoming unaffordable. This is because the judiciary fail to realise
the implications of their decisions and perceptions related to
them.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is not
about the wider compensation culture but whether the activities of
youth, adventure training and sporting groups are being affected by the
kind of decision that was not made 15 years ago.</div>
<a name="0606217000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned on
Second Reading that I have submitted a string of cases to the
Government. When the all-party group submitted them, we were told that
they did not have law reports and so could not be taken into account,
even though we provided dates, locations and the names of the judges
concerned. There were cases against the Scouts, a case against a yacht
club and a case against a rugby club; there was a whole string of them.
In only 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div>one case, that of the rugby club, was there a fair degree of argument on
both sides. In every other case, the ordinary layperson would have
agreed that it was completely unreasonable, if we want people to
operate voluntary organisations for the benefit of young people and
others who want those opportunities, to make such
decisions.</div><a name="0606217000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
quote a new ally. The website of the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Accidents
says:</div><a name="0606217000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Exciting
and stimulating play areas not only contribute to the physical and
psychological development of the child but also discourage children
from playing in dangerous locations such as railway lines, canals and
river banks and alongside
roads.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
on the &#147;Today&#148; programme on 15 June, David Yearley of
ROSPA said that in his view, play areas were simply becoming
&#147;boring&#148;. <i class="I">The</i> <i class="I">Daily Telegraph</i> also reported
that he told an international play safety conference at Loughborough,
Leicestershire, that playgrounds should be</div>
<a name="0606217000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as safe as necessary, not as safe
as possible&#148;.</div><a name="0606217000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
the mentality of modern judges, and the cases that I have quoted
illustrate that.</div><a name="0606217000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Girl Guides, who have a waiting list of 50,000 girls and are 8,000
volunteers short, have
stated:</div><a name="0606217000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We want
the Bill to renew the recognition by the public at large that there is
an acceptable degree of risk in worthwhile activities for children and
young adults...The perception that anyone working with other
people&#146;s children risks being sued for even the most minor
accident is hugely detrimental to children&#146;s freedom to
partake&#148;</div><a name="0606217000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">in adventure
activities</div><a name="0606217000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by

David Anderson</b> (Blaydon) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman says
clearly that he wants to protect people who act as risk takers and look
after children, but we should surely not stop people made genuinely ill
or injured at work, due to negligence, from having the right to make a
legitimate
claim.</div><a name="0606217000076"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000373"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I have never suggested, nor would anybody, that
we should. Mr. Caton, your earlier ruling presents me with a slight
difficulty. The essential point, to which we shall come in our
discussion of the third group of amendments, relates to the workplace.
The members of the all-party group are anxious that desirable
activities should be more narrowly defined, so that they do not include
those at workplaces, except when people work in sport and adventure
training.</div> <a name="0606217000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am anxious
to support a specific protection for people involved in providing
inherently risky activities. A degree of managed risk is healthy. As
ROSPA and the Campaign for Adventure have said again and again, if we
do not provide children with opportunities to take risks in a
controlled and sensible environment, they will find their own ways of
taking them. ROSPA gives some pretty dramatic examples of that:
children being drowned in canals, or, to give an example that I cited
on Second Reading, more and more kids getting on to railway
lines&#151;</div><a name="0606217000078"></a>

<a name="0606217000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000375"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I see that my friend wishes to
intervene.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div><a name="0606217000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000376"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I did not mean to cut the hon. Gentleman off
in mid-flow; I was enjoying the passion with which he was speaking.
Does he recall that Professor Heinz Wolff, the celebrated scientist,
regards risk almost as a vitamin? If a person is deficient in a
vitamin, they will find a way to get it.</div>
<a name="0606217000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the amendment and the Bill
must do is recognise that the best that the Government can do is manage
risk, not pretend that it can be eliminated. Some of the people
concerned about the amendments seem to be mixing those two things
up.</div><a name="0606217000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000377"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> That is exactly right. The hon. Gentleman is my
friend, although I am not technically allowed to call him my hon.
Friend. What he said is precisely the point. As the right hon. Member
for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) said in one of his brilliant
speeches during the Committee stage of my private Member&#146;s Bill,
it is so important that legitimate outlets are provided.</div>
<a name="0606217000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Children need the opportunity to
get bumps and scrapes in playgrounds. If they do not, they will go and
play somewhere else. The chairman of the all-party group on play, the
hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), kindly copied me the
letter that she has written the Minister, and I was pleased to see that
she made exactly that point. She is anxious that the amendment should
succeed.</div><a name="0606217000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2003, Sport
England and the CCPR did a joint survey that revealed that risk, fear
of the blame culture and the threat of litigation were by far the
biggest threats to people volunteering in the area of sport and
adventure training. On Second Reading, I cited the Scout Association,
which 30,000 youngsters are waiting to join because it cannot get
enough Scout masters;69 per cent. agreed that the recruitment
of new volunteers is being made more difficult because of the fears of
being sued, and 92 per cent. agreed that risk aversion is affecting the
range and nature of activities offered to young people.</div>
<a name="0606217000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cases that we are discussing
have all arisen during the past 12 years or so. Of all the cases sent
to us&#151;they have come from so many different organisations, not
only the Scout Association&#151;not one happened before 1993. We need
to provide protection. Passing the amendment, which would strengthen
the clause, is the best way to do that, although to meet the fears of
the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson), some of the amendments in
the third group could be put in. They would balance the objections that
I know the Minister will raise. He will say that the amendment could
result in burdensome and unnecessary discussions in cases for which
they were clearly irrelevant. To avoid that, we need to make some of
the changes that we shall debate
later.</div><a name="0606217000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall look
abroad once more for a moment. I mentioned America earlier and in the
same way, a number of states in Australia have made changes to their
laws. A commentary on the Western Australian Civil Liability Amendment
Bill on the state&#146;s website states that the
Bill</div><a name="0606217000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requires
consideration of the usual factors (the probability of harm, the likely
seriousness of that harm and the burden of taking precautions) but also
&#145;the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of
harm.&#146;&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div><a name="0606217000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts are required
to set out specifically why liability should or should not be imposed.
I know that the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has had
an interesting interaction with his own law expert, and I am grateful
to Peter Charlish, who is a senior law lecturer in the field at
Sheffield Hallam university. Commenting on the position in America,
which I outlined a moment ago, he
said:</div><a name="0606217000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The truth
is that in this country the choice is not between careful and careless
volunteers. It is between protected volunteers and no volunteers at
all.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000378"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying a little
from amendment No. 11. Some of the points that he is making would be
more appropriate when we reach the third group of
amendments.</div><a name="0606217000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000379"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> Thank you, Mr. Caton. I had in fact almost
finished. I am happy to end there by saying that we hear an awful lot
about the yob culture, the problems of obesity and a lot of people
running young people down. By strengthening the clause, which is by far
the most important clause in a good Bill with support in all parts of
the House, the Committee can do something about
that.</div><a name="0606217000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000380"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Bill does
not just assist high-risk and adventure activities but ordinary,
traditional activities for Brownies and Guides such as using scissors
or skipping ropes, which could not normally be expected to be dangerous
or involve risk? People are being deterred from using such things
because of people&#146;s propensity to litigate now when a slight
accident happens that could not reasonably have been
anticipated.</div><a name="0606217000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000381"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I cited a
case on Second Reading and I shall cite another now, if the Committee
will forgive me. It involves the Scouts and an ordinary activity that
most people would not regard as highly adventurous. I can give chapter
and verse on it, and I have sent the case to the Government. About
three or four years ago a Scout team set up one of those plastic slides
on the side of a hill with a hose running down it. They actually got
crash helmets for the children. A leader of another group of youths
came up and asked if they could have a go too. The youth leader himself
grabbed one of the helmets, put it on wrong and dived head first down
the slide&#151;you are supposed to go feet first. In the process he
cut himself quite badly. He brought a case against the Scout leader,
who, four years ago, a British court of law described as negligent. A
significant cash award was made. I can provide any hon. Member with the
details of the
case.</div><a name="0606217000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000382"></a>Mr.
Hamilton:</b> I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman,
who argues well the case about risk aversion being the reason why
people are not getting involved. Is it not the case that throughout
society there are fewer people willing to put themselves in the front
line and volunteer? Volunteering is disappearing off the map, and it is
not just about risk aversion. Local clubs and organisations cannot find
volunteers tocome
in.</div>

pm</div><a name="0606217000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000383"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I
am making the point that by far the largest survey ever done on the
matter, by the CCPRin 2003, listed eight factors. They are all
there&#151;family pressure, job pressure and so on&#151;but the
factor covered in the clause was by far the top one
cited.</div><a name="0606217000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have taken
more time than I intended. I urge the Committee&#151;particularly the
Minister&#151;to think about strengthening the clause. It is our best
chance of doing something to protect volunteers in this crucial
area.</div>
<a name="0606217000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000384"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Caton. I heard what you
said earlier about clause 1 stand part. Will you reflect on whether,
after the debates on the groups of amendments, we might not need a
short stand part debate? Behind all the detail there is the issue of
whether we need the clause at all, and it might be useful to preserve
that to a later opportunity.</div>
<a name="0606217000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000385"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We can certainly consider that. I am in the
Committee&#146;s hands. If the Committee wants to debate stand part,
that can be done.</div>
<a name="0606217000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000386"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am grateful, Mr. Caton.</div>
<a name="0606217000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I added my name to the amendment
because it seemed that it would help to deal with one of the dilemmas
that were discussed on Second Reading. That interesting and wide
ranging debate, which the Minister and many others of us will remember,
had as its central question whether the clause seeks to add to the law
or to confirm what it is now. There were those who had given evidence
to the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and we heard the
view of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Those who said that we
should not have clause 1 said so, among other reasons, because if we
add to the case law a new Act of Parliament defining such things, the
lawyers will go off and start to re-debate the issue. That is a
perfectly reasonable argument. I understand it completely. The debate
was therefore on whether case law is sufficient, or whether we need
statutory clarification.</div>
<a name="0606217000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second bit
of the debate reflected on the fact that, just a few years ago, for the
first time, in the well-known and oft-cited case of Pepper <i class="I">v.
</i>Hart,the courts in this country ruled that in certain
cases the courts could look at material other than the legislation in
order to decide what it meant. The House of Lords, sitting as a
Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, decided
that</div><a name="0606217000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;clear statements
made in Parliament concerning the purpose of legislation in course of
enactment may be used by the court as a guide to the interpretation of
ambiguous statutory
provisions.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
we have first to debate whether clause 1 is intended to change the law
or to confirm it and, secondly, if it is intended to confirm the law,
whether it is better to do that by legislation or by a statement
elsewhere that seeks to clarify the law. I hope that I can persuade
colleagues of every party to support the amendment. I do not know what
motivates the hon. Members for North-East Hertfordshire and for
Upminster, but I am advocating it because if we want the clause to be
as close as possible to the present law, it must be something that is
taken into account all the time, not some of the time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div><a name="0606217000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I argue that
because I got up particularly early this morning&#151;it was a lovely
morning so it was not much of an effort&#151;and read all five
judgments in the most recent case that everybody has cited, that of
Tomlinson, which was decided in 2003. It was brought by a young adult,
Tomlinson, against Congleton borough council. I shall not summarise it
except to say that it concerns a young man of about 19 who went to a
gravel pit in Cheshire that had been filled in with water. It was a
lovely summer&#146;s day and he ran into the water, then sort of
dived ahead. He hit his head and injured himself.</div>
<a name="0606217000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case concerned whether he
could get damages from the borough council or the county council, which
were the two responsible bodies. In the end, the Court of Appeal said
yes, but the House of Lords overturned that and said no, on the basis
that, for a variety of reasons to do with statutory liability and
negligence, he was held to have taken the risk on himself, and it was
not so serious a breach of the actual or implied conditions of using
the gravel pit, which had become a lake, that he was breaking the
rules. Had he gone swimming, he would have arguably been breaking the
rule because there was a &#147;no swimming&#148; notice. He did not
get as far as that, because he ran in and sort of dived ahead of
himself and injured himself.</div>
<a name="0606217000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most famous judgment is the
one by Lord Hoffmann; he gave the main judgment. I want to cite two
sentences from two of the other judges who were in the majority and
came to the view that there was not a liability on the two councils.
The first was Lord Hutton, who, when citing an earlier case, said
that</div><a name="0606217000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is contrary to
common sense, and therefore not sound law, to expect an occupier to
provide protection against an obvious danger on his land arising from a
natural feature such as a lake or a cliff and to impose a duty on him
to do so.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
issues are all that the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and
others are arguing about. If, as I did between Christmas and new year,
someone decides to climb a mountain in north Wales and the situation
gets hairier, darker and wetter and so on than they expect it to be,
who do they sue? Is it the Snowdonia national park authority?
Alternatively, do they take the decision to climb the mountain and if
things do not go as they planned, that is their responsibility? I take
the view that we have such choices to make and we should not discourage
people by making the landlord think that they will prevent people from
going on the land.</div> <a name="0606217000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other sentence in the judgments that I thought was useful was in the
last judgment in the case, which was given by Lord Scott of Foscote. He
said:</div><a name="0606217000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Of course
there is some risk of accidents arising out of the joie de vivre of the
young. But that is no reason for imposing a grey and dull safety regime
on everyone&#148;.</div><a name="0606217000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
attitude with which I come to this debate and issue, and it is clearly
the decision that the courts&#151;in that case it was Lord Scott of
Foscote&#151;took in the case of Tomlinson.</div>
<a name="0606217000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister wants to argue,
as she did on Second Reading, and I understand her doing so, that she
is seeking to clarify the law rather than change it, that has to be
something the courts take into account all the time, not just some of
the time. It is no good saying, as the current drafting does:</div>
<a name="0606217000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A court considering a
claim in negligence or breach of statutory duty may, in determining
whether the defendant should have taken particular
steps&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div><a name="0606217000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we leave the wording
as &#147;may&#148;, by definition it means that the court need not.
If the court need not, we are clearly changing the current, most recent
and most senior judgment in the English courts and therefore opening up
a whole set of options for lawyers to say, &#147;Well, this is not
something that should have been
considered&#148;.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000387"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making an extremely
powerful speech. Does he not agree that the most worrying aspect of the
Tomlinson case was that courts right up to the level of Court of Appeal
did not take that view, which is why it is so important that we should
send out a clear
message?</div><a name="0606217000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000388"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is certainly the case. Indeed, there is
pretty robust wording, particularly from Lord Hoffmann, who said that
the Court of Appeal had clearly got it seriously wrong and that it was
being far too protective and was trying to protect people from risks.
There was an important section of his judgment, part of which was cited
on Second Reading, some of which is worth repeating. By and large, it
is good, readable stuff. There is a section in which he cites lots of
previous cases. He
states:</div><a name="0606217000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are two other related considerations which are far more
important&#148;</div><a name="0606217000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">than financial
cost, which he put further down the tree. He
continued:</div><a name="0606217000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first is the social value of the activities which would have to be
prohibited in order to reduce or eliminate the risk from swimming. And
the second is the question of whether the Council should be entitled to
allow people of full capacity to decide for themselves whether to take
the risk.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course it is different if a child or someone who has learning
difficulties or some other mental illness is involved, but a normal
adult human being is expected to be able to make such choices. Lord
Hoffmann had a go at the court below him for saying that it had been
far too defensive of a position in which risk was something that should
not be taken. It was a question of freedom and he pointed out that in
this country people should be given maximum freedoms.</div>
<a name="0606217000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to pick
up the point made by the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton),
which we ought to put on the record. He is absolutely right. Whatever
the number of people in the Scouts or Guides or elsewhere waiting to
take part in those and other youth activities, one of the problems is
that there is a shortage of people volunteering. Everybody says that
volunteering is fantastic. We honour it here, we have celebrations in
our constituencies, we do all we can, but there is a real shortage. We
must be very careful that what we do does not put people off by making
them think that they are going to be clobbered for a
liability.</div><a name="0606217000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a
trustee and the chairman of the governors of a primary school just over
the river and the reality is that we have volunteers who come in and
help. Yes, they are cleared in the appropriate way, as discussed
downstairs earlier, but we have people who come in and help.
They&#151;let alone people who might volunteer for youth clubs and so
on&#151;are not going to come and do school journeys and trips and
things if they think that they might be liable in some way. That is an
important point. That is why I hope that the Minister will be
sympathetic to considering making this compulsory, as it
were.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div><a name="0606217000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point is that there is a
bigger issue involving exactly what the clause is and how one defines
what it is trying to do. I am not trying to anticipate that debate.
Amendments have been tabled that will allow us to discuss that.
Whatever view we come to, whatever we say should be the right
formulation of the public benefit&#151;the desire to make sure that
people can take risks&#151;none the less there should always be the
same rule governing the judges, rather than their
discretion.</div><a name="0606217000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
end with anticipating what I think the Minister might say&#151;that
this is a drafting or stylistic matter, that parliamentary drafters
always put it that way, that they always say &#147;may&#148;. They
always allow the judges to do that and put &#147;may&#148; because
that looks as though it does not bind the hands of the judges. I think
that if one says &#147;may&#148; one should mean
&#147;may&#148; and if one says &#147;shall&#148; one should
mean &#147;shall&#148;. That is why I hope that we can get a
consensus. I think that this should be changed so that there is no
option; if we decide that these are the sorts of things that judges
should take into account and if we decide that we are going to try to
make this as near to the present law as possible, let us say that
unambiguously and not leave another set of things that can be litigated
in the courts at great
cost.</div><a name="0606217000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000389"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> This has been a useful opening debate on clause
1. Behind it all there is a great deal of consensus, which I also felt
on Second Reading. Everyone here believes that we have become too risk
averse and that we need to change that. I agree with the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accidents and with others&#151;for example, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank
Dobson), who was referred to earlier&#151;who say that children need
to have the opportunity to take part in some activities that may
contain an element of
risk.</div><a name="0606217000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remember having
a discussion about this area of the law shortly after Second Reading
with a colleague who said, &#147;Oh for heaven&#146;s sake, we used
to go on swings or roundabouts, whatever, fall off them on to the soft
padding put down and it never did us any harm&#148;. I thought that
he was clearly a lot younger than me because when I used to fall off,
there was no padding. We scraped our knees on a regular basis, but as
we always say, it never did us any
harm.</div><a name="0606217000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The serious point
is that experiencing such situations is part of growing up. I very much
accept the comments about encouraging people to be volunteers and to
make them feel reassured that by volunteering&#151;whether for the
scouts or the brownies, or accompanying school trips or
whatever&#151;they will not be subjected to frivolous, unnecessary
and inappropriate court cases. I have to say that I do not feel that
the amendment is appropriate, for reasons that I shall
explain.</div> <a name="0606217000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not the
Government&#146;s intention in clause 1 to change the law. The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey is right about that. However,
when the courts consider a claim of negligence or a breach of statutory
duty, it is important that they can take all the circumstances of the
case into account so that they can reach a fair and just decision. As
the hon. Member for Upminster said in her opening remarks, the
circumstances will vary from case to case, and it would not be
appropriate to require the factor embodied in the clause to be taken
into account in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>every case, because it might not always be relevant. That would add cost
and complexity and might encourage argument on that point in all
cases.</div>
<a name="0606217000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="0606217000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000390"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> Will the Minister give an example of a case in
which she thinks the court might be forced to allow unnecessary and
time-consuming argument on that point if we replace &#147;may&#148;
with
&#147;shall&#148;?</div><a name="0606217000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000391"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The point that I am trying to make to the hon.
Gentleman and other advocates for the amendment is that the courts
already take into account all the factors surrounding a case. Requiring
them to take the factor in the clause into account in all cases might
imply that it is more important and should carry more weight than some
of the other factors that the court has to consider. It is important
that the court decides in each individual case what weight to give to
each appropriate factor.</div>
<a name="0606217000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000392"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I do not think that the Minister&#146;s
argument makes sense, even though she is a great Minister&#151;rather
greater than her argument, in fact. I hope that I am quoting her
exactly, but I think that she said that &#147;the courts already take
into account all the factors surrounding a case.&#148; If she means
that and she assumes that all the factors will be taken into account
and that the Bill does not change the law, she needs to explain why
putting &#147;shall&#148; instead of &#147;may&#148; alters
anything. According to her argument, the courts already shall take into
account everything in clause 1. She is using a somewhat spurious
argument against what seems a common-sense
change.</div>
<a name="0606217000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000393"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I disagree with the hon.
Gentleman, although it grieves me to do so, because he always puts his
case cogently. As I said, the courts take into account all the factors
in the case, but if we specified one above all the others, we would be
putting more emphasis on it. My point is that the statute should not be
too prescriptive, and I ask the Committee not to accept the amendment,
because it is not appropriate.</div>
<a name="0606217000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000394"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I will be careful not to enter into a
conversation, Mr. Caton, and this is my final intervention on the
amendment. I simply do not accept that including the word
&#147;shall&#148; in a piece of legislation called the Compensation
Bill would give a court the slightest indication that it should
necessarily prioritise the content of clause 1 above all other
considerations in a case. I stress again that the Minister said,
rightly, that &#147;the courts already take into account all the
factors surrounding a case.&#148; She really needs to explain why the
drawbacks of changing one word in a clause that already
directs&#151;to use her word&#151;the court to take account of the
deterrent effect of potential liability would so outbalance the
benefits that she is resisting the
amendment.</div>
<a name="0606217000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000395"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> To take an example that has
already been mentioned, the Government&#146;s interpretation of the
opinions of the House of Lords in the Tomlinson case is that they do
not show that the courts will always balance considerations in the way
that the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div>suggests. However, they do show that the courts will always consider
whether they should do that, and clause 1 will not change that. It is
for that reason that the amendment would not be appropriate.</div>
<a name="0606217000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me try to reassure hon.
Members, because I know that they approach the issue seriously and with
extremely good intent&#151;an intent that I can understand and have
some sympathy
for.</div><a name="0606217000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000396"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> Does the Minister agree that
requiring the court to take the matter into consideration would not
predetermine what conclusions it came to? It would simply mean that
that aspect was considered, alongside all other relevant aspects.
Although the circumstances of cases will vary widely, the amendment
would at least ensure a consistent approach in terms of principle in
the consideration given by different courts and by different judges. We
would know that that aspect would be taken into
account.</div><a name="0606217000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000397"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I understand what the hon. Lady is trying to
achieve, but I say this to her&#151;it relates to what the hon.
Member for Canterbury asked. If we required the courts to take all
these factors into account in every case, we could, in cases in which a
certain aspect was irrelevant, be extending proceedings, increasing
costs and so on. Let us consider, for example, a case involving
professional negligence by an auditor, which clearly would not fall
into the kind of categories that we have been using today. The rules
governing professional standards are clear enough already, and the
courts know how to deal with such a case. I reassure hon. Members that
as the clause is drafted the courts will consider in every case, as
they do now, whether the factor identified in clause 1 is relevant in
the circumstances of the
case.</div><a name="0606217000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000398"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> The auditor case surely
illustrates why, in a later group of amendments, we try to focus
&#147;desirable activity&#148; more closely, but will the Minister
answer one question? Given that there have been a series of bad
judgments in the lower courts, including a monstrous judgment by the
Court of Appeal on which the House of Lords has rightly made strong
comments, is the Minister not keen to send a clear message to the lower
courts about the impact on the activities that we all want to
protect?</div><a name="0606217000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000399"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I certainly hope that as a result of the debates
that have taken place here and in the other place, we send a clear
message to the courts and I am sure that the Tomlinson case sends a
clear message to them. The role of the House of Lords is precisely to
make a judgment in a case such as that one, which tells the lower
courts, &#147;This is the way we, as the highest court in the land,
believe you should be interpreting the law.&#148; I do not want to
undermine the capacity of the judges in the House of Lords, because
what they are doing is exactly what the hon. Gentleman wants to happen.
That message is getting out or will get out to the lower
courts.</div><a name="0606217000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The word
&#147;may&#148; in clause 1 will not prevent the factor embodied in
clause 1 from being considered wherever it is relevant. It will ensure
that, where it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>relevant, it is given appropriate weight when considered against the
other factors that the courts take into
account.</div><a name="0606217000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000400"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> One could argue that &#147;shall&#148; would
have the same effect in terms of interpretation, but may I give the
Minister one more reason to reflect on whether she can accept the
amendment? Section 2(4) of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act 1957
states:</div><a name="0606217000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
determining whether the occupier of premises has discharged the common
duty of care to a visitor, regard is to be had to all the
circumstances, so that (for
example)&#148;</div><a name="0606217000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on. The
court will, I put it to the Minister, consider all the circumstances.
The amendment would ensure that it considered the factor in clause 1 as
well as every other. Perhaps she could help us unusually by taking
advice and, if she can be brave, letting us see the legal advice that
she has been given on the
clause.</div><a name="0606217000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000401"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am very happy to let the Committee see the
legal advice that we have on the clause. The advice that my noble
Friend Baroness Ashton and I have received is that, as we intend not to
change the law but to clarify it, it is not appropriate to change
&#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148;. However, we want to
ensure that the courts are not obliged to give detailed consideration
to it, even in cases in which it is irrelevant, or to consider
arguments that it is to be seen as a first or paramount consideration.
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said in an intervention that the
Government&#146;s job is not to eliminate risk but to manage it. I
agree with him. This is, therefore, the appropriate approach for the
courts to adopt, so I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="0606217000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000402"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> The amendment is probably the
most important to the Bill. Notwithstanding the Minister&#146;s
helpful remarks and attempts to reassure the Committee of her good
intentions in retaining the status quo, it is disappointing that she
does not feel able to acceptthis small but significant
amendment. I shall not askthe Committee to vote on it, but we
will return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="0606217000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000405"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> Clause 1 asks the courts, in determining
whether a defendant should have taken particular steps, to have regard
to the factors in paragraphs (a) and (b). At present, for a claim to be
successful, the claimant has to show, and the court has to agree, that
the defendant has been negligent because he has failed to do something.
The reference to determining particular steps is not helpful. It is
described by the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers as meaningless,
and will inevitably lead to argument about the extent to which a
desirable activity may have been prevented.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div><a name="0606217000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is more than a possibility that such a change in law would result in
conflicting judgments in lower courts, as every judge in each
individual case would devise different steps that he thought that
defendants should take. It would also lead to additional burdens on the
courts which, as we know, are already overstretched. In that respect,
the wording of clause 1 is unworkable in the courts.</div>
<a name="0606217000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
defendants and claimants will suffer unfairly if the clause is not
amended in the way that I have suggested. First, claimants will be
unfairly burdened, as they should not be expected to devise risk
assessments on behalf of defendants. Secondly, the clause is unfair to
defendants because they will not know what steps they should have taken
in any given circumstances. The amendment would remove those
problems.</div> <a name="0606217000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
should not in any way change current negligence legislation, but that
is what it might do as drafted. It might bring about unintended changes
that would burden our court system, leading to conflicting judgments,
and unfairly burden both defendants and claimants. I am not sure of
procedure, Mr. Caton. Should I introduce amendments Nos. 3 and 4
together with amendment No.
2?</div><a name="0606217000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000406"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Yes please.</div>
<a name="0606217000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000407"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 make a similar point,
but they build on it. Although the Association of Personal Injury
Lawyers is not in favour of clause 1, it has highlighted the use of the
word &#147;particular&#148;. It believes&#151;and I
agree&#151;that the absence of a proper definition of that word will
lead to further debate in court about the extent to which a desirable
activity may have been prevented. In particular, it implies that
defendants should have taken specific steps, and that is unfair on
defendants, as they will not know what steps the court might decide
that they should have taken in any given
circumstances.</div>
<a name="0606217000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000408"></a>Mr.
Clapham:</b> Is not the real issue here the possibility of
watering down the protection offered to people at work, for example?
The hon. Lady talks about removing the word &#147;particular&#148;,
so the employer would know better what steps to take, but she forgets
that the balance is being shifted in a way that seems to water down the
protection that a claimant or a worker ought to expect to be
provided.</div><a name="0606217000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="0606217000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000409"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that incidents at
work in particular involve health and safety at work legislation as
well, which has inherent protection for employees. We are seeking to
introduce consistency in the way that the courts approach the widely
varying cases that they deal
with.</div><a name="0606217000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
word &#147;particular&#148; should be replaced by
&#147;some&#148;, as that would send out a clear message to those
who are involved in desirable activities that they need to take some
steps to prevent accidents, but not unknown particular steps that will
be determined at a later stage in a court of law. That indicates to
those involved in desirable activities that they must act responsibly
and take steps to prevent foreseeable accidents, but preserves the
current law and does not require every conceivable eventuality, however
fanciful, to be covered. Common sense should be allowed to
prevail.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div><a name="0606217000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000410"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> As it stands, clause 1 enables
the court to consider whether a requirement to take particular steps to
meet a standard of care might prevent a desirable activity from being
undertaken to a particular extent or in a particular way. The
amendments would mean that, instead, the court could have regard to
whether the defendant should take steps to meet the standard of care
and whether the effect of doing so would prevent a desirable activity
from being undertaken to some extent or in some way. That would not be
an improvement on the current
drafting.</div><a name="0606217000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to amendment No. 2, the issue is not simply whether the steps that
should have been taken could be interpreted as suggesting that the
clause would be applicable only where the court has to consider whether
the defendant should have taken any steps at all. In many cases,
however, the issue will not be whether the defendant should have taken
any steps at all, but whether he should have taken identifiable steps
beyond those which he
took.</div><a name="0606217000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">In referring to
&#147;particular&#148; steps, it is certainly not our intention to
suggest that the clause requires any new steps or any specific set of
steps to be taken. The current wording is intended to cover any steps
that it is alleged the defendant should have taken to meet the standard
of care in the circumstances of a specific case. That is a more
precise, clear way of expressing how the clause is intended to
work.</div><a name="0606217000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation to
amendments 3 and 4, in using the word &#147;particular&#148; it is
not our intention to suggest that desirable activities must be affected
in a new or specific way for the courts to be able to take that effect
into consideration. The current wording is intended to cover any
effects on the operation of a desirable activity in the circumstances
of a particular case; as with the phrase &#147;particular
steps&#148;, it is calculated to refer to the effects that it is
argued that requiring those steps would have. Just as the particular
steps that the court will consider are those that it is argued are
necessary to meet the standard of care, so the particular effects that
the court will consider are those which it is argued might follow from
requiring those steps. On that basis, I do not believe that there is
any risk of the courts misinterpreting the clause. I invite the hon.
Lady to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606217000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000411"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> I take some reassurance from
what the Minister says. The purpose of the amendment was to protect
people from being expected to foresee something that was not
predictable, took everybody by surprise and could not reasonably have
been planned for, with suitable steps taken to protect the person who
was injured. On the strength of the Minister&#146;s statement, I beg

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000414"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I will speak to amendment No. 27 standing in my
name, and amendments Nos. 28 and 29, which are the other two amendments
in this group that I
tabled.</div><a name="0606217000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendments is to open up the key issue in clause 1,
which is the &#147;desirable activity&#148; question. When we
debated clause 1 on Second Reading, the central issues were whether it
was right to include a definition that said that desirable activities
should be treated differently from other activities, and whether the
phrase &#147;desirable activity&#148; could be included, given that
so far there does not appear to be any established definition of it. It
causes some
difficulty.</div><a name="0606217000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
thought about the matter at that time and since then, I have come to
the view that &#147;desirable activity&#148; is the wrong phrase. I
understand why it is present and the motivation behind it, but it is
the wrong phrase. It will get Parliament into the difficulty that the
hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) pointed out in his contribution on
Second Reading. He obviously opposed clause 1 as a whole, but putting
aside his general opposition, he made a good point about desirable
activity.</div><a name="0606217000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way that I put it on Second Reading was that if one took the duty of a
doctor and the duty of a tattooist to their patient and customer
respectively, there would be general consensus that the doctor was
carrying a desirable activity but the tattooist would not be put in the
same category. Arguably, if a tattooist were taking off a tattoo that
had become a difficulty for somebody psychologically, that would be
desirable&#151;I understand that&#151;but by and large one would
say that desirable activity is what doctors do generally. Let us focus
on the case of a doctor treating a patient. The Bill
states:</div><a name="0606217000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A court
considering a claim in negligence or breach of statutory duty
may&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0606217000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">take out the
middle bit just for a second as though it were in
brackets&#151;</div><a name="0606217000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
regard to whether a requirement to take those steps
might...prevent a desirable activity from being undertaken at
all&#148;.</div><a name="0606217000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is
whether a restriction will mean that a desirable activity cannot take
place because the risk is too high.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div><a name="0606217000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Staying with the medical analogy,
we all know that many operations involve risks. Patients are asked all
the time, &#147;Are you willing for this to go ahead?&#148;
Operations on the elderly often do not happen because of the risk of a
heart reaction, even though the operation is on a different part of the
body. Those desirable activities involve a
risk.</div><a name="0606217000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have tried to tease out whether there is a better way of dealing with
such issues, and I suggest that there are some ways of doing so. The
amendment puts up a coconut for us to shy at to see whether it stays;
it offers a better proposition by rephrasing the clause. I know of only
two other options that are potential candidates for inclusion in the
definition. One is set out in amendments Nos. 8 and 9, which were
tabled by Conservative members of the Committee. They refer to
legitimate activities of a certain type. I also use the word
&#147;legitimate&#148; in my amendments Nos. 28 and 29. The
alternative to saying &#147;desirable activity&#148; is to say
&#147;legitimate activity&#148;. Provided it is a legal activity,
one should seek to encourage it; but it would cross the line if it were
an illegal activity.</div>
<a name="0606217000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Montgomeryshire has just returned. I hope that he will not mind, but
although I had not planned to, I will cite an example of an activity
that he took part in. It was not his most risk-free moment. He has many
skills, and flying is one of them. I testify to the fact that he does
it well&#151;as far as I know, because I have risked my life with him
only once. We went up, went along, and went down again, so that was
satisfactory. It was an hour&#146;s worth of views over north-west
England, so it was a good test. Another thing that he has done that I
have not yet tried with him is paragliding, which, of course, led him
into difficulty some years ago; as Committee members may remember,
there was a crash and he was severely injured. That is a legitimate
activity.</div> <a name="0606217000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is easier
to divide things into legitimate and illegitimate than to get into a
value judgment about &#147;desirable&#148; without having any other
definition. After teasing this matter out, it may be that we will need
two tests: the first will be whether the activity is legitimate and, if
it passes that hurdle, there will be something else, which may or may
not be &#147;desirable&#148;. I have suggested an
alternative.</div><a name="0606217000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000415"></a>Mr.
Anderson:</b> The clause is supposed to clarify present law.
Everything that the hon. Gentleman has spoken about would give lawyers
opportunity to make the law even more unclear than it already is. My
hon. Friend the Member for Hendon was right to say that we should get
rid of the
clause.</div><a name="0606217000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000416"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand that point of view, and as I said on
Second Reading, there is a strong case for it. Evidence has been given
to committees, and they have said that this is not a helpful clause. I
hope that, on Second Reading, I expressed a fairly equivocal and
balanced view. I declare my interest: I qualified and practised as a
lawyer, but I have not done so for a long time. I am absolutely not
trying to produce more work for lawyers, and I understand the risk.
Getting the word &#147;desirable&#148; out is important because
there is no precedent for it; it is not one of those phrases on which
there have been 28 law cases. That word would give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 26</div>lawyers lots of cases; I can see myself writing the opinion and saying
that the word could mean this, that, or the other.</div>
<a name="0606217000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
am carrying the hon. Member for Blaydon with me; whether we will stay
together until the end of the debate, I do not know. I shall try first
to get &#147;desirable&#148; out of the way, because it is a
lawyer-encouraging zone. There cannot be a legal debate about
&#147;legitimate&#148; and &#147;illegitimate&#148;; something
either is or is not legitimate. Parliament has decided, and there is no
chance of making any money by going to the courts to argue the
matter.</div><a name="0606217000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are then
left with the question of whether there is anything else, other than
the straight legitimate/illegitimate threshold. My amendment
says:</div> <a name="0606217000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take into account
the social benefit of the activity&#148;.</div>
<a name="0606217000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than making a value judgment on
whether we use a phrase that has never been tested in the court, I have
tried to use a phrase for which there are precedents, and there are
precedents for things such as social benefit of activities. It is a
much more general, slightly less personal phrase. If we ask,
&#147;What is the social benefit?&#148; we mean, &#147;What is
the benefit to people in general?&#148;</div>
<a name="0606217000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is only one other runner
that I thought of. Actually, I was prompted to think again about it
last night, when I went to the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations reception downstairs. Its members came here to talk to
colleagues about the Charities Bill. The controversial part of that
Bill, which has just started its passage in the Commons, having been in
the Lords, is the question of what is a charitable purpose,
particularly in relation to private schools. The test in the current
draft of that Bill is the public benefit test, so the other runner
could be, &#147;Is this of public benefit?&#148; The slight problem
with that is that one might then be limited to the definitions in the
Charities Bill. They are fairly wide ranging; there is a whole list of
things that would be regarded as being of public benefit, and they
cover poverty, education, religion, health, saving lives, arts,
culture, sport and so on. So we could run with another option, but I am
suggesting that &#147;social benefit&#148; might be the best
phraseology.</div> <a name="0606217000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
trying to ensure exactly what the Minister and the hon. Member for
Blaydon said that they want the Bill to do: not change the law but keep
it. The most recent cases&#151;the Congleton case and the Donoghue
case in 2003&#151;appear to be nearer to what the courts were then
saying than &#147;desirable activity&#148;. I am simply trying to
make sure that what we are saying in this Bill gets as near as possible
to the law.</div> <a name="0606217000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not
have the relevant page in front of me earlier, so I will refer one more
time to the Tomlinson case to finish the statement of the
facts&#151;just for those who are interested in these matters,
because we might as well add some human interest to these Committee
debates so that people might look at them. The guy in the Tomlinson
case was 18. The event occurred on the May bank holiday weekend in 1995
at Brereton Heath country park between Holmes Chapel and Congleton,
which I guess is still run as a leisure facility. The question is
whether we can have something that accurately reflects what the court
said. I shall end by making two points about what the court
said.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000417"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> In reference to my own experience, I broke my
back in a paragliding accident. The local Conservative candidate,
having seen me walking around in relatively good health a few months
later, uttered the immortal words, &#147;Ah Lembit, you
were10 feet short of a by-election,&#148; so what he
regarded as a desirable outcome may have been rather different to what
I did.</div> <a name="0606217000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does my hon.
Friend agree that what is important here is that the Minister takes the
opportunity to define in clear terms what she believes the phraseology
means? I am inclined to agree with my hon. Friend on the word
&#147;desirable&#148;, but the Minister can mitigate the situation
by being clear about what she means. For example, despite my own
mishap, paragliding is clearly a desirable activity in the sense that
people should be entitled to make that judgment for themselves, and if
they want to take on that activity they should be able to do it. I am
hoping&#151;and I hope that my hon. Friend shares this
wish&#151;that the Minister will make it clear that &#147;desirable
activity&#148; cannot be a subjective judgment about what we
individually like, but is an objective judgment about what we should
like society to be able to do, should individuals in that society wish
to participate in those activities, whether we like them ourselves or
not.</div>
<a name="0606217000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000418"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is a strong and appropriate
intervention. The amendments are in a way cumulative. There is a
suggestion that we should have &#147;legitimate&#148; as one of the
thresholds. There is the suggestion that we have some other definition
that does the job better than &#147;desirable&#148;. My hon. Friend
made the point well that one person&#146;s desirable outcome might be
the other person&#146;s least desirable outcome. That plays into the
argument advanced by the hon. Member for Blaydon about the
possibilities for lawyers. There is a danger in that.</div>
<a name="0606217000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
offer a list of the sort of activities we are addressing. They are
sporting, recreational, educational and social activities that
personally or collectively help an individual or a group of people to
enjoy their humanity more in one way or another. The purpose is to make
sure that we all have experiences and that we do not prevent
experiences in which we exercise our freedoms to challenge and push
boundaries. That is where the Minister and the Government are coming
from and where the Liberal Democrats come from too.</div>
<a name="0606217000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a way, my final question is
the most difficult point of all, but it goes back to the
Minister&#146;s key point. I am raising it now because this is the
most sensible point at which to do so. My question is: if the
amendments are passed, will we still be at risk of doing what the hon.
Gentleman suggested&#151;opening this part of the legislation to a
new set of legal challenges? It took about 60 years for the case law to
become clear, ending in the case three years ago that we have
discussed. The first major case in negligence arose back in the
1930s&#151;the Scottish case about the snail in the ginger beer
bottle in Paisley. I presume that Paisley does not have any such
mishaps these days.</div>
<a name="0606217000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts took a long time. We
certainly do not want the process to take six years. The
asbestos-related cases show that we do not want any long period of
litigation. Therefore my other question to the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 28</div>is that if we were not to have such a clause in the Bill, but she wanted
to ensure that the courts interpreted the law in the way that all three
major parties want, is there not an alternative that could give
guidance without being law, a bit like the Pepper <i class="I">v. </i>Hart rules?
That is a serious question to see whether we can get at the objective
by other means. Pepper <i class="I">v. </i>Hart involved a tax inspector and was
a case about the interpretation of detailed tax legislation. In the
end, not surprisingly, people did not understand the legislation, so
they had to look at what had been said in debate to get a rough idea of
its meaning. That is entirely understandable with difficult financial
legislation.</div><a name="0606217000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are trying to ensure that the courts are clear on the issue, if we
do not want to put things off, if we want to allow people to take
risks, if we want to be on the side of freedom, not intervention, and
if we want landowners to take reasonable precautions, not unreasonable
precautions, is there not a way that would avoid all the risks of
endless court cases? I will be happy to withdraw the amendments, as
well as the other amendments to clause 1, if the Minister suggests a
better way of doing things. If not, we need to amend the clause. I am
in her hands, and will be interested to hear what other colleagues have
to say. I hope that that opens up the
debate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000419"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> I want to speak briefly on amendments Nos. 5, 8
and 9, which stand in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire.</div>
<a name="0606217000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 8 and 9 have the same effect of removing the word
&#147;desirable&#148;. The hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey has already referred to the difficulty of interpreting that
word, particularly in court. I think he referred to it as a
lawyer-attracting zone. One could foresee the pitfalls if the word were
to remain in the clause. It is wide open to interpretation and to
questions not only about whether an activity is desirable, but about to
whom or for whom it might be desirable. An activity might be desirable
to the individual concerned but have no socially beneficial effect:
taking illegal drugs is probably very desirable to someone who is
addicted to them, but it certainly does not have any social benefit to
anyone else. The amendments are intended to clarify the clause by
adding a more specific phrase, so that legitimate sporting,
recreational, educational or other socially beneficial activities are
covered.</div> <a name="0606217000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the same
time, we wish to leave out the phrase &#147;functions in connection
with&#148;, because we feel that it is superfluous and clouds the
meaning of the line. If the amendments were to be accepted by the
Minister&#151;I am looking to her for some indication of
sympathy&#151;the clause would read &#147;discourage persons from
undertaking legitimate sporting, recreational, educational or other
socially beneficial activity&#148;. With those amendments, the clause
would be much clearer.</div>

Chairman:</b> We will have a debate on clause stand part, and
I think that will offer the best
opportunity.</div>
<a name="0606217000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000424"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I shall first speak on amendment No. 27 and
amendments Nos. 8 and 9, the latter being a consequential amendment. I
shall then address my own amendment, No.
26.</div><a name="0606217000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has already been
made clear in both of the previous speeches, the term &#147;desirable
activity&#148; is too broad. I have no intention of returning to the
earlier debate, other than to say that the interaction of that term
with the use in the clause of &#147;may&#148; rather than
&#147;shall&#148; leads to a situation in which the intention of
the clause is unclear. Mr. Andrew Caplan is the legal adviser to the
scouts. In his briefing he
says:</div><a name="0606217000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The first
point is what would be considered a desirable activity and by whom?
Desirable activities would, if applied to the individual, presumably be
automatic otherwise the individual would not be participating in the
activity!&#148;</div><a name="0606217000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">He asks whether
&#147;desirable&#148;
means</div><a name="0606217000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Desirable
to the society at
large?&#148;</div><a name="0606217000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then
says</div><a name="0606217000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
concern I have is that if broadly applied the provision could lose some
or all credibility.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
continues:</div><a name="0606217000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
my own purposes I cannot see that there is any way of avoiding a
judicial debate about what constitutes a desirable activity. All that
parliament can do is perhaps limit the debate to a particular field of
operation. I think we should try and obtain an amendment to define
desirable activity as &#145;any activity with sporting, educational
or adventure training activity which can be categorised as having a
social
benefit.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="0606217000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would be a mixture of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey and by my hon.
Friends.</div><a name="0606217000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Roy Amlot, QC
also makes some helpful remarks. He is important because when the
Campaign for Adventure first came to Parliament to raise the issue two
years ago, he provided the references to the shocking legal case of the
mountaineering instructor who was convicted of negligence after a
tragic incident in which the client was killed. It was shocking because
there was no dispute of fact at all in the case&#151;all the parties
agreed on the facts. The negligence finding derived entirely from the
judgment of another professional mountaineer who took a different view
on what the defendant should have done when faced with a split-second
decision in a rock slide. The whole mountaineering community was
outraged by it. Roy Amlot&#146;s comments about amendment No. 8 are
that it:</div><a name="0606217000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;seems sensible
to me: &#145;desirable&#146; is too wide and would invite
uncertainty and a plethora of judicial definitions and a great deal of
legal argument. The proposed amendment narrows the field and confines
it to appropriate areas which are more precise and easier to
understand.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that something
like</div><a name="0606217000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;legitimate sporting,
recreational, educational or other socially beneficial
areas&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div><a name="0606217000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">would be a more useful
definition. In an earlier speech the hon. Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey cited the exact wording that the House of Lords gave,
which was not exactly the same.</div>
<a name="0606217000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like most Members here, I
welcome the Bill. However, for some curious reason, the original
message that was communicated with the Bill flagged up the helpful case
of Tomlinson as having been the source of clause 1, whereas, in fact,
the words &#147;desirable activity&#148; occur nowhere in the
Tomlinson
ruling.</div><a name="0606217000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000425"></a>Simon
Hughes</b> <i class="I">indicated
assent.</i></div>
<a name="0606217000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000426"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> The hon. Gentleman, unlike me, has read the whole
thing from end to end and is nodding his head. Interestingly, the
Western Australian measure contains much greater protection in a number
of respects, particularly for sporting activities. The wider definition
used there takes account
of</div><a name="0606217000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the social utility of
the activity that creates the risk of
harm.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is very close
to the words &#147;social benefit&#148; proposed by the hon. Member
for North Southwark and
Bermondsey.</div><a name="0606217000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000427"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> To complete the putting of words on the record,
&#147;social utility&#148; appears from the Tomlinson case to be
the phrase that the American courts have used. The sentence that fits
most closely to what the hon. Gentleman is saying
is:</div><a name="0606217000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is not,
and should never be, the policy of the law to require the protection of
the foolhardy or reckless few to deprive, or interfere with, the
enjoyment by the remainder of society of the liberties and amenities to
which they are rightly
entitled.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
most precise general phrase&#151;the &#147;liberties and
amenities&#148; to which society is
entitled.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000428"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman. It would be helpful&#151;a number of hon. Members have
suggested it&#151;if the Government were to reconsider the phrase
&#147;desirable activity&#148;. First, they should try to use
slightly more familiar legal language. &#147;Desirable
activity&#148; did not appear in the Tomlinson case and it does not
appear in the common law of our cousin countries. We should use
something like &#147;social utility&#148; or &#147;social
benefit&#148;, as do the Americans and Australians. Secondly, the
Government should consider specifically mentioning sport, adventure
training, physical recreation and educational activities&#151;all
things, as we know, that the Government aim to protect.</div>
<a name="0606217000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to labour the
point&#151;we have heard two excellent speeches and there was much
discussion of the subject on Second Reading&#151;but I doubt whether
anyone on the Opposition Benches, either Liberal Democrat or
Conservative, is wedded to a particular wording. We are asking the
Government to tighten the phrase or, as second best, the Minister to do
as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey suggested, which
is to record in <i class="I">Hansard</i> in more particular terms what is meant
by &#147;desirable activity&#148;, so that it can be used as
guidance for the courts. Otherwise, as with &#147;may&#148; rather
than &#147;shall&#148;, we will not be sending a clear signal, and
I know that that is not the Minister&#146;s intention.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div><a name="0606217000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendment No. 26, on landowners. Many activities require land to be
available. I received a letter from a canoeing organisation, which
pointed out that the provision of land does not of itself always
provide access to waterways, lakes and so on, which is necessary for
activities such as canoeing and sailing&#151;hence the wider wording
of paragraph (c), which would add the
words:</div><a name="0606217000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;discourage persons
or organisations from making land or water areas or courses available
for recreational, educational or adventure training
purposes&#148;.</div> <a name="0606217000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
anxious that we protect those, principally farmers, who generously make
their land available to such organisations. The Scouts and Guides
cannot operate without somewhere to go camping. Even the Army Cadet
Force and the sea and air cadets often have to rely on private land
being made available by farmers because of the shortage of military
training areas. Indeed, those who want to go hill-walking for the
afternoon who do not have the benefit of living near a national park
often rely on the availability of private land. Indeed, Randall
Williams of the English Outdoor Council states:</div>
<a name="0606217000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Bowles is a charity
which is custodian of one of the South East&#146;s major sandstone
rock outcrops. On a busy weekend, it offers voluntarily to the public
the use of the rocks for positive, affordable recreational rock
climbing activity. It would be a tragedy if the hundreds of people who
use this natural resource every weekend were denied this opportunity
because the charity felt it could not take the risk. Reasonable
protection of landowners is vital to prevent this negative reaction
from taking
place.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
area that is particularly under threat is farm visits. In the old days,
a large number of schools, not only from rural areas, took their
children on farm visits, so that the children could see how food was
grown, mingle with livestock and so on. I was privileged a month ago to
visit the open day of the Kent county agricultural society, which gave
14,000 children from state schools the opportunity to visit and to see
and handle farm animals. It was a terrifically adventurous day. I am
sorry to say that three schools could not afford the one item that they
were asked to pay for&#151;transport. I understand that they are now
looking into fundraising to ensure that no school misses out on the
opportunity next year.</div>
<a name="0606217000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point was made to me
strongly that every year fewer and fewer farmers are willing to allow
farm trips to their farms because they are frightened of being sued if
something goes wrong&#151;for instance, if a child gets bitten by a
farm animal or picks up a disease. Their insurers are leaning on them
not to agree to
it.</div><a name="0606217000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">George Jessel,
vice-chairman of the society,
said:</div><a name="0606217000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the
past farmers have been proud of what they do and have enjoyed showing
their operations to others. They now hesitate when they are asked to
provide educational opportunities, whether for school trips, for
visiting agricultural and veterinary students or farmers from
developing countries. Today, such visits result in increased insurance
costs&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0606217000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">and let us
remember that farming is really struggling in many parts of the
country&#151;</div><div class="hs_brev">&#147;because of the threat of
being
sued&#148;.</div><a name="0606217000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another area involving landowners: fun runs. That is not obvious, but I
was asked to mention it. Superficially, one might think that a farmer
should not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div>be liable for a fun run on a public footpath because people can always
walk or run down it and well established case law protects the farmer.
Unfortunately, however, if a farmer allows a fun run on a footpath,
involving, for example, marking stakes in the ground showing a
particular direction, marshals on duty at particular points to ensure
that people do not go the wrong way and water stations, the farmer is
in the legal position of having invited the organisers on to the ground
and thus opens himself up to being sued in a way that would not
normally matter on a public
footpath.</div><a name="0606217000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, I
ask the Minister to consider that the amendment would do no harm to the
Bill and provide real comfort to farmers, fewer and fewer of whom are
willing to make their land available each year. It is vital that
farmers, and indeed the trusts that own large areas of land, continue
to make their land available. Fewer of them are willing to do so under
pressure from their insurance companies. I urge the Minister to
consider the amendment. I am not wedded to the wording. If she does not
like it, I urge her to provide her
own.</div><a name="0606217000220"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000429"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> If the Committee will indulge
me, I shall take some time in responding to hon. Members&#146;
comments, which go to the nub of the clause. In a sense, the fact that
so many different alternatives have been proposed only serves to
indicate the difficulty in getting a commonly agreed wording. We and
parliamentary counsel think that &#147;desirable activity&#148;
best reflects the current law and what we are trying to
achieve.</div> <a name="0606217000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I respond
to the amendments, I shall take on board what the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey said about trying to put on the record exactly
what I mean and understand by &#147;desirable activity&#148;. I
hope also to reassure hon. Members not just about that, but about other
comments, particularly those made by the hon. Member for Canterbury
about landowners and so
on.</div><a name="0606217000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
relate to alternative phrases to &#147;desirable activity&#148;. I
shall begin by addressing some of the points raised on Second Reading
about that phrase. We have given considerable thought to what best
captures the courts&#146; approach to such issues and the concept of
the wider social value of activities, which is well established in
current law.</div> <a name="0606217000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, I think that &#147;desirable activity&#148; most accurately
reflects that. I do not believe that that term will lead to a large
amount of satellite litigation over what constitutes &#147;desirable
activity&#148;. Obviously, there will be some early judicial
discussion of the new provision. That is always the case in any
legislation. However, it is important to recognise that various factors
will reduce substantially the possibility of increased litigation. For
example, the clause will not create new claims. It simply identifies a
factor that the courts can already take into account as part of a
process that they already undertake in cases of negligence and breach
of statutory duty. A defendant might, in some cases, be emboldened to
resist a claim that may not be well founded, but which might be settled
because of the trouble and expense of defending it. I do not see that
as unjust.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div><a name="0606217000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Defendants might also argue more
strongly that the additional precautions it is suggested that they
should have taken are, in fact, excessive and disproportionate.
However, that is a far cry from the rather far-fetched idea that
defendants will invest vast sums in seeking to prove&#151;and
claimants in seeking to disprove&#151;that an activity is desirable
in the belief that the cases will turn solely on that factor. A
&#147;tsunami&#148; of additional litigation was predicted on
Second Reading. I suggest that a modest and temporary trickle is a more
realistic description of what might
happen.</div><a name="0606217000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
permissive. It is not mandatory. It does not require the court to
consider the desirability of an activity in every case. The court can
decide whether it is relevant in any particular case, as it does now.
The court is not required to give that factor any greater weight than
the many other factors that might be relevant in an individual case, so
while a defendant might argue that the activity to which the claim
relates is desirable, the decision that the court will reach on the
claim does not depend on its view on that
point.</div><a name="0606217000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The defendant
cannot get around having to demonstrate that he took reasonable care
simply by showing that the activity was desirable. The courts will, I
am sure, give short shrift to any defendant who tries to argue that,
because he is engaged in a desirable activity, he is allowed to be
careless. That considerably diminishes the likelihood of appeals based
on whether an activity is desirable or not. The Government believe that
the clause, far from generating large volumes of ill-founded and
misconceived argument about the concept of desirable activities, will,
in fact, help to reduce the number of ill-conceived, speculative or
frivolous claims and influence the basis on which settlements are
reached. It will discourage the bringing of claims based on the
proposition that reasonable care involves all steps required to prevent
accidents from occurring in any conceivable circumstances, regardless
of the effect of requiring those
steps.</div><a name="0606217000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 27
would replace the provision in clause 1 that enables the court to have
regard to whether a requirement to take particular steps might prevent
or impede a desirable activity from being undertaken or discourage
people from undertaking functions in connection with it. Instead, the
court would be able to take into account the social benefit of the
activity and the effect that liability for negligence or breach of
statutory duty would have in deterring identical or similar activities
from taking place. I do not believe that that would be appropriate.
There is a risk that, as drafted, the amendment could be interpreted as
implying that a claim that would otherwise succeed could fail purely
because of the potential effect on a socially beneficial activity of
liability, rather than because of the effect of a requirement to take
particular steps to avoid the risk of injury in relation to that
activity. I realise that that seems like a fine distinction, but it is
a real one. To ignore it might risk changing the law and we do not
intend to do
that.</div><a name="0606217000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000430"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> This debate is obviously one that we shall take
part in and reflect on. The Committee might be helped if it knew why
the Government chose the phrase &#147;desirable activity&#148;.
From where did it come? What is the authority for it?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div><a name="0606217000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that &#147;social
benefit&#148; is a creation, but the other phrases are not.
&#147;Social utility&#148; has been used commonly in other courts
and &#147;social value&#148; was the Tomlinson phrase and would
have seemed an obvious candidate. I hope that, before she concludes,
the Minister will tell us where she got her phrase, what authority it
has and why &#147;social value&#148;, if not &#147;social
benefit&#148;, was rejected given that it has been used in recent
court cases on the
issue.</div><a name="0606217000319"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="0606217000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000431"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
I shall talk later about the phrase &#147;public benefit&#148;, and
will discuss the matter then.</div>
<a name="0606217000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Canterbury
said that &#147;desirable activity&#148; does not appear in
previous case law. Although that is true, one of the
Government&#146;s reasons for using the phrase is that if we chose a
term that had been used in case law, there was a risk that we might
limit clause 1&#146;s applicability to particular types of case. We
deliberately took the decision to use a term that does not have any
baggage from previous cases, but which captures the courts&#146;
approach.</div><a name="0606217000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that fine
distinction, clause 1 will not affect the standard of care or create
any new defence against liability. It simply identifies a particular
fact that the courts can already take into account. The alternative
wording opens the way for the argument that even if the court considers
that the defendant did not take the steps that were reasonable in the
circumstances, it may nevertheless decide that the defendant should not
be liable because of the effect of liability on a desirable
activity.</div> <a name="0606217000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
as was discussed at some length in another place, the term
&#147;social benefit&#148; is arguably narrower than
&#147;desirable activity&#148; and could miss certain cases to
which the factor embodied in clause 1 would presently apply, such as
those where the benefit is primarily economic. Therefore, I do not
believe that amendment No. 27 would represent an improvement on the
existing drafting, as it could create confusion and uncertainty. I
refer hon. Members to the Latimer case. It was an economic decision
that the activity was desirable and that it should continue despite
some slippage on the factory
floor.</div><a name="0606217000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
8 and 9 would replace the term &#147;desirable&#148;
with</div><a name="0606217000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;legitimate sporting,
recreational, educational or other socially
beneficial&#148;.</div> <a name="0606217000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that
might be narrower in effect than &#147;desirable activity&#148; and
might not extend to the same range of cases in which the courts have
regard to such matters under current law. Although I understand why
hon. Members want to focus on particular types of activity, I believe
that it is important that clause 1 should accurately reflect existing
law and the range of cases in which the factor embodied in the clause
can be taken into account. The amendment would be an inappropriate
change to existing
law.</div><a name="0606217000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000432"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> This is not a trick question; I am trying to
discover whether the Minister and her officials have thought about the
matter. Could there be a desirable activity that was not
legal?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div><a name="0606217000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000433"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> As it happens, I was just coming to the issue of
legitimate activity. I am sure that in some people&#146;s minds there
are a lot of desirable activities that are not legal, but I do not want
to go down that particular road. I shall leave it to hon. Members to
reflect on that for a
moment.</div><a name="0606217000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
28 and 29 would replace &#147;desirable&#148; with
&#147;legitimate&#148;. I am not persuaded by concerns that the use
of &#147;desirable activity&#148; will lead to satellite
litigation. Although there might be some initial argument over what is
meant by the term &#147;desirable&#148; in this context, it is in
itself a simple term with a clear meaning. By contrast&#151;the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey raised this point as part of
a directly opposing view&#151;the word &#147;legitimate&#148; can
have a number of different meanings. For example, it could simply mean
something not expressly forbidden by law; a lawful activity as
contrasted with an unlawful one. It could mean something that it is
proper for a person to do or reasonable for him to expect to be allowed
to do, in the sense of a legitimate expectation. Or, it could simply
mean something which is worth while. Without further definition of
exactly which nuances the term is intended to capture, the uncertainty
that would arise over its intended meaning would be greater than may
arise in relation to &#147;desirable&#148;. So, it does not
necessarily provide an improvement on the existing
drafting.</div>
<a name="0606217000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000434"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> Returning to the point made by the Scouts&#146;
lawyer, which I quoted, the problem with the word
&#147;desirable&#148; is that it can mean either
&#147;collectively desirable&#148; or &#147;desirable on the part
of the individual&#148;. The advantage of terms like &#147;socially
useful&#148; or &#147;socially beneficial&#148; is that they make
clear where society has a wider interest. Can the Minister put on the
record that she means &#147;desirable&#148; in the latter sense and
not the former?</div>
<a name="0606217000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000435"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I certainly can reassure the
hon. Gentleman that we mean desirable in that latter sense. Reflecting
on the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey&#146;s question
about when something is desirable that is not legal, it is probably
perverse to suggest that any unlawful activity could be desirable, and
that would probably be reflected in case law. I am directed to yet
another of the famous cases about which all law students have to suffer
learning&#151;apart from Donoghue and Stevenson, which is quite
interesting. The Wagon Mound No. 2 case refers in detail to that, so,
replying to the hon. Member for Canterbury, it is indeed about what is
socially acceptable.</div>
<a name="0606217000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 5, by removing the
words&#151;</div><a name="0606217000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000436"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I may have misled the Minister by putting it the
wrong way round, but she has now used the word
&#147;acceptable&#148;. So, does she mean something that is
socially desirable, not just individually desirable? Is that what she
is
saying?</div><a name="0606217000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000437"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Yes, I am saying something that is socially
desirable.</div>
<a name="0606217000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000438"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I apologise that I was out of the
Room for a bit, but can the Minister amplify somewhat the
&#147;economically desirable&#148; which she was indicating earlier
would be in this clause? That is quite worrying, as I had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div>thought that the purpose of &#147;desirable activity&#148; was to
cover things like recreational trips&#151;the sort of things set out
in amendment. No. 8, in my name. If the Minister says that it covers
economic activity, what does it not cover within the sphere of legal
activity?</div>
<a name="0606217000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000439"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, in a sense,
for giving me the opportunity to elaborate. I used the Latimer case
because I want to re-emphasise that we are not changing the law here,
but making clear what the law is. In the Latimer case, which was a
negligence claim against the employer by an employee who slipped on a
floor in an out-of-the-way area after a kind of flash flood or freak
event, it was held that it was not short of reasonable care to continue
working in the factory after the flood had been cleared up, even though
some areas were still slippery, as to close down until the place was
completely dry would have lost a shift of production and have been out
of proportion to the impact of that particular event. I am directing
the hon. Gentleman to that sense of desirable
activity.</div>
<a name="0606217000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000440"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> It is sensible to deal with all these issues now
in our debate, and then we will not have to come back to them. I was
thinking of the possibility of the Minister adding the economics
option. Thinking quickly, it seems to me that there is a definition
that might fit with what we all understand. In the world of human
rights, there are two sorts; civil and political rights and cultural,
economic and social rights. Will the Minister consider whether there
might be other formulations that can work better? I have listened to
the arguments that she has made well, but if we can find an agreement
on the best formulation, would she be willing to consider it before
Report?</div><a name="0606217000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000441"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is a helpful
intervention, and I do want to try to achieve that aim. When I have
summed up on the matter of public benefit, I hope that Opposition
Members will withdraw their amendments on the basis that we will
consider the point in some detail. I reiterate to the hon. Member for
Canterbury that &#147;socially desirable&#148; is the approach that
we want to take, but the courts balance precautions against risk and
their wider impact. That may include economic considerations if their
impact is particularly
significant.</div><a name="0606217000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 5 would remove the words &#147;functions in connection
with&#148; so that the courts could have regard to whether a
requirement to take particular steps to meet a standard of care might
&#147;discourage persons from undertaking a desirable
activity,&#148; rather than
from</div><a name="0606217000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;undertaking
functions in connection with a desirable
activity.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that
would not be appropriate. The clause is intended to reflect the
court&#146;s current ability to take into account whether a
requirement to take particular steps to meet a standard of care would
discourage the provision of an activity. The amendment would change
that focus so that it applied not to the volunteers and organisations
providing the activity and undertaking functions in connection with it
but to those participating in it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div><a name="0606217000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no particular magic in
the term &#147;functions&#148; and it should not be read as a
technical term carrying a specific meaning to be argued over in the
courts. It is intended not to restrict the application of the clause to
specific acts or roles that may be performed but simply to reflect the
range of contributions that may be made to support the provision of an
activity from which people may be discouraged by the imposition of a
requirement of precautions disproportionate to the risk
involved.</div><a name="0606217000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
26 would affect the way in which courts take into account the impact of
a requirement to take particular steps. In addition to the effects that
the clause already enables courts to consider, they would be able to
take into account whether a requirement to take particular steps
would</div><a name="0606217000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;discourage persons
or organisations from making land or water areas available for
recreational, educational or adventure training
purposes.&#148;</div><a name="0606217000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Canterbury gave clear examples of his concern that that
might be restricted. I hope that I can assure him that the amendment is
not necessary. The facilitation by landowners or occupiers of property
of such obviously desirable activities is covered by the clause as it
stands. By singling out particular aspects the amendment would imply
that making land and other facilities available would not be part of or
connected with a desirable activity but would be something different,
requiring specific provision.</div>
<a name="0606217000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Existing law
provides an additional element of protection for landowners in the
circumstances covered by the amendment: when a landowner grants access
to his or her land for recreation or education activities otherwise
than as part of his business, he can exclude liability for loss, damage
or injury caused by the state of the premises. That can be done by way
either of a contractual clause or a notice adequately brought to
visitors&#146; attention. That strikes a fair balance as it ensures
that people using the land are made aware of the exclusion of liability
arising from the state of the premises before undertaking an activity.
The amendment is therefore unnecessary and could create
confusion.</div><a name="0606217000320"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000442"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> The Minister is courteous in giving way. It is
helpful that she has put on record the fact that the clause covers the
matter, although it is also important to note that her remarks about
the current state of law do not seem to work with insurers, whose
attitude is that if there is a risky activity they should put premiums
up. In large numbers of cases farmers have simply withdrawn from school
farm visits and from making land available for camping and so on. There
is a real problem, but I thank her for her assurance that the clause
will cover farmers and others who make their land
available.</div><a name="0606217000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000443"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I hope
that in stand part debate we will all reiterate the principles behind
the clause. It is about reassuring volunteers that they will not be
sued frivolously and landowners that they will have the same protection
that the currently have. That will also send a message to insurers that
they should not be over-cautious in dealing with some of their
clients.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 38</div><a name="0606217000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of public benefit is
rather technical, and the difficulty is that in parliamentary
counsel&#146;s view the concept is a narrower one than desirability
and would therefore not reflect the full range of flexibility

case
law&#151;</div><a name="0606217000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.46

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000444"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Before we broke, I was talking about why we do
not use the phrase &#147;public benefit&#148;. It is a technical
point: parliamentary counsel felt that that was a concept narrower than
desirability and that it would not reflect the full range of
flexibility available to the courts at present. It might be argued, for
example, that it would not encompass cases in which certain precautions
would have an impact on a business entirely disproportionate to the
risk to which they were directed. That was the point that I made about
the Latimer case.</div> <a name="0606217000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
statute, &#147;public benefit&#148; is defined in respect of the
definition of a charity. That implies that a wider public, rather than
a narrower group, might benefit, so it would not have the same range
that appears in case law, which &#147;desirable&#148; is intended
to reflect.</div><a name="0606217000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, I take on board what the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey said about that issue and about Pepper <i class="I">v. </i>Hart, and I
hope that the courts will reflect on our discussions if there is any
doubt about the meaning of the Bill. In asking Opposition Members not
to press the amendments, let me say that I shall reflect on the points
that they have raised and the phrases that they have used instead of
&#147;desirable activity&#148; so that we can be absolutely
confident, come Report, that we are at one as to what we mean by them.
I shall make sure that everyone on the Committee is given a full
explanation of what we understand by each of them to see whether we can
reach consensus by Report. In the meantime, however, I ask hon. Members
not to press their amendments.</div>
<a name="0606217000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606217000445"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I thank the Minister for her thoughtful and
wide-ranging reply, which picked up all the points that we raised. I do
not propose to divide the Committee and shall seek leave to withdraw
the amendment in a moment. I saw it as an opportunity to do what we
needed to do, which was to look at the drafting, phraseology and
terminology.</div> <a name="0606217000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">In only
one of the Minister&#146;s statements did those advising her stretch
the bounds of credibility beyond breaking point; she appeared to be
using notes, rather than speaking extempore, so I do not blame her,
although she is, of course, accountable. She said that the definition
of &#147;lawful&#148; or &#147;legitimate&#148; was that
something was &#147;worth while&#148;, but if we suddenly
reinterpreted those terms in that way, we would have a whole new
understanding of what was legitimate. I can see somebody appearing at
Tower Bridge magistrates court, saying, &#147;But your honour, it was
worth while.&#148; The judge would say, &#147;Oh yes? Well, it
might have been worth while to you, mate.&#148; The defendant would
reply, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div>&#147;But the law says that if something is worth while, it must be
legitimate.&#148; I think that that interpretation pushes the bounds
of possibility.</div> <a name="0606217000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
more serious issues, the Minister helpfully indicated her willingness
to look at alternatives. Having heard the debate and thought about it,
I accept what she said about public benefit, which is clearly a
narrower concept. Although it applies in statute law, particularly to
charities, it is probably inappropriate.</div>
<a name="0606217000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is merit in
holding on to alternatives to social benefit. They include social
utility, which has been established in the courts, although mainly not
in this country, and social value, which has been clearly established
in this country&#146;s courts, particularly in Tomlinson. I heard
what the Minister said about the provisions being meant to apply to the
tests that the court will use to decide not the final question of
liability in statute or common law, but whether, in the words of the
Bill,</div> <a name="0606217000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the defendant
should have taken particular steps to meet a standard of
care&#148;.</div><a name="0606217000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise that
there are different tests at different parts of the process to evaluate
such things, but I hope that the matter can be looked at.</div>
<a name="0606217000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall look at the Latimer case
and the Wagon Mound No. 2 case. While Members were voting just now,
colleagues and I discussed with people in the public gallery what had
happened to the Wagon Mound No. 1 case, but nobody knows. All I know is
that it never became as famous. I assume that it must 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div>have involved the same ship or the same defendant, but it clearly did
not raise the same important points of law.</div>
<a name="0606217000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be grateful if the
Minister took advice about looking at the personal, economic and social
benefit. There was a good exchange between her and the hon. Member for
Canterbury, in which she gave what I understood to be a clear answer.
She said that we were talking about something that was not only
personally but generally desirable, so that meant a wider, rather than
a narrower definition. However, we might still be able to return to
something that uses established phrases.</div>
<a name="0606217000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">To pick up a point made by the
hon. Member for Blaydon, I am keen that we do not end up accidentally,
or purposely, doing something that leads to lots of work in lots of
court cases. The Tomlinson case took nine years to get to law. The
asbestos case has been going on for many years and is still not
resolved. If we are not careful, the lawyers get going. It takes years
to get civil negligence cases to the highest court and sorted. We must
avoid that. This is about real people, real lives, real experiences and
a need for finality. Often, in court cases, individuals want not
necessarily a ruling that will be quoted in law but simply an end to
their case so that they know where they
stand.</div><a name="0606217000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for the Minister&#146;s response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606217000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
