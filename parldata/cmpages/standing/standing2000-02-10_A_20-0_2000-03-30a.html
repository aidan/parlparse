<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs Helen Liddell):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 712, in page 55, line 25, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) No person shall be required by virtue of this section to provide any information which he could not be compelled to give in evidence in civil proceedings in the High Court or, in Scotland, the Court of Session.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a technical amendment designed to limit the sort of information that electricity suppliers can be required to supply under a renewables order. It is designed to make the procedures in the Bill conform with those in section 28 of the Electricity Act 1989: suppliers cannot be required by an order to supply information that they could not be required to supply in court proceedings. It is clearly appropriate for companies to have that protection. The amendment meets the anxieties that the industry has expressed.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 713, in page 55, line 26, leave out ``role'' and insert ``functions''.

<P>
The amendment makes a small change to the language of the clause in order to make it consistent with the rest of the Bill. For the sake of clarity in interpretation, it is better to avoid minor differences in wording between clauses if their intended effects are exactly the same.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made:  No. 357, in page 55, line 29, leave out subsection (2).-[Mrs Liddell.]

<P>
Question proposed,  That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): We support clause 51, but what is the difference between paragraphs (b) and (c) of proposed new section 32A(1)? Paragraph (b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>only electricity generated using specified descriptions of renewable source<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
while paragraph (c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>only electricity generated by specified descriptions of generating station.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not understand the difference.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I am not familiar with that part of the Bill. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): I apologise for not having been present to move amendment No. 749. What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that the renewable obligation can be fully delivered? Amendment Nos. 749 and 752 were designed to explore whether it is appropriate to require delivery on the renewables target before extra generating capacity comes on stream. What is the Government's view on cost planning, which could have been included in the clause? Elsewhere in the world, including in America, one approach adopted is to suggest that it is environmentally improper to create new generating capacity when it is possible to meet consumer need through energy-efficient measures. One option could be to hand out free low-energy light bulbs, as some power companies do in the United States. Such initiatives would be worth pursuing because they would result in lower demand on capacity, leading to environmental and funding benefits and, as a consequence, reduced consumer bills. We do not want the creation of any new generating capacity when other avenues have not been explored.

<P>
Will the Minister tell us whether she has any sympathy for least-cost planning?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) on having the good sense not to move amendment No. 749, which was anyway defective. Under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, generating stations above 50 MW may not be constructed without the consent of the Secretary of State. Indeed, in section 14 of the Energy Act 1976, the Secretary of State has a similar role for plant fuelled by natural gas or oil of 10 MW or more. The power already exists also for large-scale conventional generation. The amendment would have extended that to small-scale generation, having the opposite effect from that which he wanted to achieve. For example, if he had wished to put a photovoltaic system on to his roof, he would have had to obtain planning permission from the Secretary of State. Therefore I commend, again, his good sense.

<P>
In relation to energy efficiency targets, the hon. Gentleman raised some interesting points, such as the distribution of low-energy light bulbs. The Energy Saving Trust Ltd. encourages the use of energy-efficient appliances. There are now a number of schemes designed to increase energy efficiency, particularly for poorer customers. Indeed, on Tuesday, during the break between sittings, I launched one called the neighbourhood energy service team-NEST-makers.

<P>
One reason why the Government do not take the line suggested by the hon. Gentleman is that it would restrict their power to assist energy efficiency. A judgment has to be made as to whether demand is likely to grow faster than the establishment of energy-efficient measures. It is impossible to predict demand with that degree of certainty because it depends on many different issues, such as the price of oil, the weather and so on. The provisions of clauses 58 and 79 are more relevant to setting specific targets for energy efficiency of the sort suggested by the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's points about least-cost planning, it is for the market to decide on the nature of new generating capacity and that is subject to planning constraints. We discussed some of those issues this morning. We address environmental matters through the renewables obligation and the energy efficiency targets in clauses 78 and 79. I should like therefore to take the opportunity of commending cluase 51 to the Committee because it provides that the size of an obligation may vary over time, and the Government intend that that should increase by steps towards the 2010 target.

<P>
An order may include or exclude specific power sources or types of generating station as counting towards an obligation. For example, it is well known that the Government intend to excude large-scale hydropower above 10 MW declared net capacity. An order may specify that a minimum amount of electricity must come from a particular source or type of station. The clause further provides for an order to specify how the level of a supplier's obligation is to be determined; how dual-fired generation-stations fuelled by renewables and non-renewables-is to be treated; and the information-gathering powers that the authority will need to establish and monitor the discharge of its obligations by suppliers.

<P>
The information powers have an important qualification. A person subject to them may not be required to provide information that he could not be compelled to produce in a court. That mirrors a protection elsewhere in legislation-in section 28(3) of the Electricity Act 1989 for example.

<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Lewes recognised the difficulty with his amendments, and I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I had prepared myself to oppose the amendments because one cannot trust the Government's competence these days to resist Liberal Democrats amendments. However, the Liberal Democrats' incompetence prevented the moving of their amendments.

<P>
The hon. Member for Lewes used the restriction of new generating capacity for the political purpose of pushing forward the renewables agenda. The Opposition also support the growth in renewable energy, but it is important not to attempt to achieve that by general restrictions on capacity. Excess generating capacity creates fierce competition and continually drives down prices. The hon. Gentleman's point is as absurd as the Government's stricter consents policy. That, again, restricts the creation of new generating capacity, solely for political reasons to do with the internal workings of the Labour party.

<P>
The energy White Paper published in October 1998 seems to attribute to the electricity pool higher prices for electricity than would otherwise be the case. The Government's argument in the energy White Paper was that, because the price will be artificially high for a temporary period pending the arrival of NETA, somehow entrepreneurs will build hundreds of millions of pounds worth of gas-fired power stations. To suggest that they will do so solely in response to the temporary price hike in electricity is absurd.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman raising the issue of the stricter gas consents policy. That was necessary partly because of the distortions that had been built into the energy market owing to the previous Government's obsession with running down the coal industry. We ended up with an imbalanced market in energy sources. It was made clear that the stricter gas consents policy would exist only until the distortions in electricity trading arrangements had been removed. Had the previous Administration been fair to all energy sources, they would have recognised that distortion in electricity generation and could have acted to redress it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is clearly nonsense. When the energy White Paper was published, the reform of the electricity pool was already expected. To introduce a consents policy once it was known in the marketplace that electricity prices would fall as a result of the new trading arrangements was disingenuous. Nobody would invest hundreds of millions of pounds in new gas-fired plant in the knowledge that around the corner prices would fall. Investors are not so stupid. It is widely accepted that the energy White Paper was simply a way of dealing with the problems of Labour Members of Parliament from coal-mining constituencies.

<P>
It is wrong to use restrictions on generating plant solely for political purposes. I oppose the arguments in the amendments tabled, but not moved, by the hon. Member for Lewes. However, the Opposition support the clause and those linked to it.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 714, in page 55, line 38, leave out ``The'' and insert ``A''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 715.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Both amendments are technical and minor, making changes to the language in the clause in order to avoid possible unintended inferences. They may appear very small changes, but it is sensible to make the drafting of legislation as clear as possible.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: Amendment No. 715, in page 55, line 46, leave out from ``count'' to end of line 4 on page 56 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for the purposes of section 32(3) as sufficient evidence of the facts certified.'.-[Mrs Liddell.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause provides for the issue of green certificates, which is a policy the Conservatives have long supported as the same in principle as emission trading. Issuing green certificates is a far better way of dealing with the reduction of CO2 emissions than the absurdity of the Government's climate change levy. For that reason, we support the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I rise to speak briefly because I know that the Minister is excellently briefed and that the Committee will be better informed if she would simply tell us how the Government intend to use green certificates. I say that in a spirit of co-operation, not anticipating that we will vote against the clause.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I am happy to expand on the provisions of the clause because it is very interesting and important. It paves the way for trading in renewables obligations by making it possible for a supplier to discharge his obligation by arranging for others to supply renewables electricity to customers. Indeed, the ability to do so is a very important way of encouraging the industry. If a supplier under a 10 per cent. obligation cannot in the first instance meet it, but could do so by supplying through another supplier, another supplier that may decide to specialise in renewables generation may be allowed to build up a critical mass of supply.

<P>
The clause further supports renewables trading by allowing certificates relating to renewables generation issued by the authority to be accepted as evidence of the discharge of the supplier's obligation. A certificate could be issued to the operator, or via a generating station, on the basis of evidence that is provided to the authority that the generator has generated renewables electricity and that it has been supplied to customers in Great Britain. The clause is a practical manifestation of how we can achieve that. It will allow a true market in renewables certificates to develop, and that can only benefit economic efficiency in the discharge of old renewables obligations-to the benefit of customers and the economy as a whole. The provision is an exciting means of ensuring critical mass in renewable energy generation, and I commend the clause, as amended, to the Committee.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 717 and 718.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I ask the hon. Member for Lewes not to press amendment No. 700 for the simple reason that the amendment that I have just moved achieves the same effect: to provide scope to set different buy-out prices for different renewable sources or technologies, where an order under clause 50 makes provision for particular sources or technologies.

<P>
It is entirely sensible to ensure symmetry between the two clauses because without it, the flexibility that we are deliberately trying to provide in clause 50 would be restricted. I should, however, make it clear that the Government do not currently expect to use the flexibility in making an order under clause 50, so the issue of banding the buy-out price should not arise. However, no one can forsee at the moment how renewables will develop over the next decade and it is only sensible to retain some flexibility in order that we may adjust to developing circumstances.

<P>
We intend to use the new provisions not to try to pick technologies-as I mentioned earlier, the Government are not good at backing winners-but to allow the market to identify the most economic methods of renewables generation that can be deployed to achieve the overall obligation on suppliers. In the context of our market-based approach, longer-term technologies will benefit too. I know that the hon. Member for Lewes is concerned about that.

<P>
As electricity suppliers move towards the 10 per cent. target, they are likely to find that there is insufficient availability of the more market-ready renewables and will need increasingly to look to offshore wind and energy crops to meet their obligation. Such energy sources cannot be introduced overnight. It would be prudent, therefore, for electricity suppliers to look ahead in order to ensure that such technologies will be introduced on a time scale and in the right kind of quantities to meet their needs. I am also looking at the scope for making limited additional Government support available for offshore wind and energy crops.

<P>
The renewables obligation that the Government set will be a firm obligaiton with which companies will know very well they must comply. The price cap will mean that, on all reasonable assumptions of the likely cost of renewables generation, companies will have very good reason not to exercise their buy-out option. The purpose of setting a buy-out price would be to cap the cost to suppliers of discharging their obligations. That would in turn set a ceiling on the ultimate cost to consumers of a renewables obligation. Such a cap might come into play if the cost of generating renewables turned out to be higher than anticipated when the obligation was set.

<P>
This is the right approach. The moves that we are taking under the clause, as amended, will ensure that we do not introduce a system that in the longer term militates against people using renewables technology. I ask the hon. Member for Lewes to recognise the point that I have made about amendment No. 700, but if he wishes me to expand on it, I shall happily do so later.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 717 and 718 are technical. They make clear that the provisions in the clause will be made in an order under section 50 rather than in a separate order. The price-cap mechanism of proposed section 53 will be an integral part of the renewables obligation and it would be wrong to handle it separately. I commend the Government amendments to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for anticipating what I might say, although I am slightly concerned that she should recommend that I do not press my amendment before I have spoken to it. I want to explore Government thinking on technology banding.

<P>
The purpose of tabling amendments Nos. 700 and 750 is to underpin support not simply for a renewable energy technology but for a variety of such technologies. That will ensure a diversity of supply of renewable energy which otherwise might not be provided. That is why the idea of technology banding is a good one. There are a number of different possible sources of renewable energy, some of which are clearly commercially attractive immediately. Some, however, have high set-up costs. Nevertheless, if those set-up costs are met, such sources would make a useful contribution as time goes on. I am keen to tease out from the Minister what support-either directly or, through legislation, to the market-the Government are giving those neo-market renewable energy sources. Such sources may not be commercially attractive to the private sector but make sense environmentally and-over the medium and longer term-make sense from a consumer and a business point of view.

<P>
I am not convinced that the Minister dealt adequately with that point in her introduction. The right hon. Lady will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that she does not intend to use the banding mechanism at first; it is in the Bill only in case she wishes to use it in years to come. The problem is that, under the Government's faulty definition of renewable energy, energy from waste is included. The Government signed up to the 10 per cent. target, for which I am grateful. I am looking to the Labour Whip for support on environmental issues.

<P>
Energy from waste through infill provides the easiest means for business or industry to meet the 10 per cent. target by 2010 because the technology will be tried and tested. It has been tried in other countries, from which we can learn. There is great pressure on the waste stream from the European Union landfill directive. The only way in which to meet the landfill directives is through energy from waste.

<P>
This country has a major energy-from-waste programme, but where is the guaranteed support for real renewable energy technologies? The Government's suggestion could be interpreted as a way of excluding large-scale hydropower or a means of facilitating energy from waste. What will the Government do to facilitate the neo-market solutions which, as I said, could be competitive over the medium to long term, but incur high set-up costs that are not immediately attractive to business?

<P>
Will the Government consider using technology banding? About 3 or 4 per cent. of the total 10 per cent. target could be set aside for technologies that are developed on the market. The Government could provide support by underpinning the market's efforts.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> The hon. Gentleman makes important points and asks important questions. I shoud like to ask him whether the Liberal Democrat party is in favour of buiilding big new reservoirs and big hydrodams in this country? If so, where will they be built?

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> With due respect, that is not germane to the amendment. I am talking about technology banding for renewable energy. I referred to hydropower because I feared that the Government might have excluded it. I did not comment in favour of it, but there is no doubt that large-scale hydropower is greener than most of the fuels used in this country today-and we should not forget that.

<P>
If the Government do not wish to pursue our detailed amenmdments-the Minister might view them as prescriptive-what guarantee is there in the current market context of energy crops, photovoltaic, solar or offshore wind power coming to fruition? That will not happen unless the Minister uses the banding that she put into the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Member for Lewes raises several interesting points to which I shall respond. We debated waste this morning and I know the strength of the hon. Gentleman's feelings about generation through waste but, frankly, there is not enough waste to meet the 10 per cent. obligation. Other technologies will be needed as we progress towards acheiving the target.

<P>
The principle behind the renewables obligation, moving on from the awful previous structure, is to shift from technology-specific solutions to allowing renewables to come from the margins into the mainstream; that market-based solutions, which have greater certainty of use, should be used to encourage renewable generation. Inevitably, as companies try to meet the 10 per cent. obligation, the cheaper, market-ready renewable sources will speedily be put under pressure, thereby making more attractive the longer-term offshore wind and energy crops and other such technologies, in which I know the hon. Gentleman is interested. It is the very limit on renewable energy sources and the rate at which they can be deployed that ensures the use of longer-term technologies. Suppliers will increasingly need to draw on the new technologies if they are to meet their obligations in the longer term.

<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I said that the Government are considering whether additional support for those technologies is necessary in the short term. We have talked to the renewable energy industry as part of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' consultation on energy efficiency measures under the climate change levy package. It is an important initiative under which £50 million could be used to promote renewables. The Government also intend to launch a new programme for new and renewable energy sources to help to remove the barriers to further uptake of renewables by stimulating research and development. That is improtant to secure the facilitation and development of industrial activities within the United Kingdom and for the export market.

<P>
New technologies not supported under the non-fossil fuel obligation may be supported under the renewables obligation because of the sheer scale of it. Once they become more competitive in comparison with existing renewable sources of energy, many of the existing barriers will be overcome.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for addressing these issues seriously. Will she estimate how much of the 10 per cent. of renewable energy will be created through energy-from-waste schemes? What is her best guess?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to find a back-door route into the banding issue. I wish to move on to the use of buy-out funds for specific technologies, which is basically the same aim as the hon. Gentleman's. There are real practical difficulties, not least the uncertainty year to year about how much will be available. If the buy-our price and the incentives are right, the level of buy-out receipts should end up being small. As I said, we are seeking a market-based solution to encourage use of renewables.

<P>
If we are to create a competitive market for the purchase and sale of renewable electricity, we must take the interaction of supply and demand into account. In a freely operating market, the opportunity for a range of different renewable sources becomes much more attractive simply because of the sheer shortages in various aspects of renewables. I pointed out this morning that we are not thinking only up to 2010, but right up to 2025. In the early years of the obligation, we expect the balance of supply and demand to produce prices below the cap that favour neo-market solutions. As time goes on, the solutions that seem further from us now will become more attractive on price grounds.

<P>
It is estimated that a quarter of the additional renewables required to achieve the 10 per cent. target from where we are now would come from waste. The hon. Member for Lewes and I will have to disagree about waste as a renewable source. I am not going to convince him and he is not going to convince me. We wish to secure a range of neo-market solutions while at the same time using the market, together with additional support, to help the longer-term technologies. I hope that that answer's the hon. Gentleman's point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister confirm my reading of clause 53, that, notwithstanding amendment No. 717, the Secretary of State will make the order and decide how the money will be spent. That goes back to clause 50, which brings in the new section 32, under which the Secretary of State is given the power to make the order.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I can confirm that.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The debate on the amendments follows on from the one on the previous set. The purpose of the amendments is to reward companies that comply with the renewables obligation and ensure that moneys raised are recycled to compliant companies for them to spend on future renewables.

<P>
The Confederation of Renewable Energy Associations has written to me and to other members of the Committee and expressed some concern about the drafting of the Bill. The letter says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Last month, the Confederation held a conference in London to begin a dialogue on the proposed Renewable Obligation. It was attended by over 160 people representing the renewable energy industry, the industry's financiers and the electricity suppliers upon whom the Renewables Obligation will be placed. It emerged that the area of greatest concern to all parties is the final distribution of the buy-out monies.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government has proposed that all the receipts from the buy-out will be returned to Suppliers. It has stated that the monies may be returned in such a manner that gives an incentive to Suppliers to purchase renewable energy or Green Certificates.
<P>
So far, so good.
<P>
However it has also suggested that other methods may be used, such as a distribution of the money based on each Supplier's share of the total electricity supply market. This latter method would result in the net cost of any buy-out being reduced, which is likely to lead to the erosion of Green Certificate values. The Confederation therefore supports the Government's first suggestion, that the receipts are shared out amongst those Suppliers who have met some or all of their obligation.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Obviously, the confederation is concerned about the possibility of that process going awry. The amendment is an attempt to pin down the Government on that point, so that they make it crystal clear what their intentions are, and that there will be no dilution or diminution of the green certificate system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): I do not think that the amendment is needed; the question is one of perception. However, I have a couple of questions for the Minister on the issue, because I agree with the sentiment underlying the comments of the hon. Member for Lewes.

<P>
I am concerned about the fact that companies that commit to the 10 per cent. renewable requirement and deliver on it might be held back by those who are half-hearted about it. How will the Minister respond to that? It is a matter of perception, and a strong statement from her about how the obligation will be delivered could ensure that all companies put in some effort.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The debate on these clauses has been interesting. Will the Minister comment on the possibility that a large number of companies might decide to fulfil only 2 or 3 per cent. of their obligations? Because they would not have met the requirement, they would have to pay 7 or 8 per cent., but they would then get the same amount of money back. The levy is normally used to pass money from those who are not meeting the obligation to those who are. If none of the companies comply, will they be penalised for failing to do so, or will the money simply go around in a big circle?

<P>

<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I will deal with those two points before I go on to the question asked by the hon. Member for Lewes. Many companies are doing what the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) suggests. It is now possible to choose green electricity. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) said that some companies might be half-hearted. The market will help comapnies be more whole-hearted in their approach to renewables because of the nature of the obligation.

<P>
There is another issue here that should unite hon. Members. If we are committed to renewables, we must go out and sell the concept of them. There is a need for some evangelism about their attractiveness, and perhaps none of us has taken that on as actively as we should have. An advantage of ensuring that the obligations on renewables are met through the clauses is that it allows the market to create some critical mass for companies that exclusively generate from renewable sources.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Under the system for the non-fossil fuels levy, bids were made by companies for the non-fossil fuel obligation. What is the position now? Normally, the Government announce that there will be another round of non-fossil fuel obligation bids, and there has always been a market for more companies to bid. I do not think that the previous and the present Government have used that mechanism fully, but I may be misleading myself.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> We discussed NFFO this morning. We decided not to move away from its model partly due to its technology-specific nature and the difficulty of backing winners that will become dominant technologies. Through NETA, renewables will have a much broader opportunity to thrive. The hon. Member for South Dorset alluded to one of the difficulties of NFFO: that the timing of NFFO rounds was imprecise. In planning ahead to 2010 and 2025, we are making a much longer and more certain time scale.

<P>
One of the big issues for the renewables industry is financing investment. We do not need to evangelise only to the consumer about the values of sustainable electricity, but we need to convince those who finance the industry that it has a sustainable and sensible future.

<P>
I shall come to some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Lewes. I cannot accept the amendment. The purpose of recycling the buy-out receipts to suppliers, like the buy-out provision itself, is to limit the cost to consumers. We currently envisage that the Secretary of State would determine a system for allocating receipts to suppliers in proportion to how they discharge their obligation through the supply of renewable electricity. That means that a supplier exercising the option for its whole obligation would get no money back and would receive no funds paid under the scheme by other suppliers.

<P>
Suppliers meeting their obligation in full by buying renewables would receive more of the money paid under the scheme by other suppliers. That is to provide an incentive for suppliers to meet their obligation by supplying renewables rather than exercising the buy-out option. I had not seen the letter quoted by the hon. Member for Lewes, but it many comfort him to know that we intend to consult on the matter when we consult on renewables orders as a whole. It will be important to get the mechanism right, and we need the ability to change it in case the incentive does not work as it should. It would be wrong to fix the mechanism in primary legislation, as we would lose the flexibility that we need.

<P>
Amendment No. 702 is roughly what we have in mind but, for the reasons that I gave, we should not set matters in concrete in legislation. We do not accept the argument of amendment No. 702 for using receipts to support the development of renewables, especially not in the United Kingdom only, as proposed in amendment No. 728. That would undermine the objective of recycling receipts, which is to limit the cost to consumers if renewable generation turns out to be more costly than expected, perhaps because of a more rapid move towards technologies that are not yet market ready.
 
<P>
If the receipts are then recycled to finance specific technologies, we are going into a further subsidy for renewables at a much greater price than was originally intended when the buyer price was set. Indeed, there are specific difficulties that I mentioned in connection with the previous clauses relating to using buy-out funds for specific technologies, not the least of which is that it takes us away from the market-based approach. I am confident that, if we can get the buy-out price and the incentives right, buy-out receipts should be fairly small. Therefore I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's amendment would achieve his aims. I recognise that it was tabled for sound reasons, but I ask him to consider withdrawing it because it would take away the flexibility that will allow us to get these arrangements right.

<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I have listend carefully to the debate to see whether the points made are covered; and I do not think that they have been. It might be useful if I read out what Climate Action Network UK says in its timely fax, which we received at lunchtime. Those who do not go back to check their fax machines will not have seen it. It says that amendments Nos. 701 and 702
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>concern clause 53, the ``buy-out'' clause. In its present form the suppliers who will not meet the requirement to supply their customers with a certain percentage of renewable energy will have to pay the authority, but this money will be channelled straight back to all suppliers, including those who did not meet the requirement. Climate Action Network does not consider that this provides strong enough incentive for suppliers to produce energy from renewable sources or that this is in line with the Government's target of 10 per cent. of overall electricity from renewable sources by 2010, or the suggested target of 50 per cent. renewable energy by 2050 (suggested by the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and the Regions). It is of vital importance that the money generated through the buy-out system goes back to suppliers who meet their obligation, and that it is used solely to develop the renewable generation capacity.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I know that the hon. Gentleman dealt with that when he moved the amendment, but it is an important matter for that organisation, which is clearly up to the minute. No doubt hon. Members will be able to read the fax when they return to their offices after the clause has gone through, but I thought that is should be put on the record.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am sorry that the Minister has not seen that letter-I assumed that she had. I am happy to give her a copy.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Is it the same letter to which the hon. Member for South Dorset referred?

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> No it is a different one. I will happily send the right hon. Lady a copy of it afterwards.

<P>
As I understand it, the Minister said that she was broadly in favour of amendment No. 701, but did not want to accept in because she has something similar in mind for secondary legislation after the Bill is enacted.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> My point is that we want to make sure that we get this right. It is a big step-it is a major change in how we regard renewables. We shall be consulting to ensure that we get this right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful for that-I am never against consultation. If the right hon. Lady consults the Confederation of Renewable Energy Associations, she will get a clear idea of what it wants her to do. She used the words ``proportional'' or ``generational'' when she responded to amendment No. 701. It is important that she makes it clear that those suppliers who do not meet their obligation will not benefit from the money that is being recycled.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell  indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The Minister nods. It is helpful to have that on the record. We will have to disagree about amendment No. 702. She is right to say that I am simply trying to get more support for the renewable energy industry; she does not think that that is appropriate. That is a simple disagreement of policy, and there is little point in pursuing the matter.

<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 728. Its purpose was to tease out from the Minister whether it is permissible for the 10 per cent. target to be met by sources of renewable energy situated outside this country. If the energy from a wind farm in France were transmitted across the channel, would that count towards the UK's 10 per cent. target? That is why the words ``United Kingdom'' appear in the amendment. Does the target of 10 per cent. relate to energy consumed by consumers, or to production in the UK?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows the Government's commitment to the liberalisation of European energy markets. One of the things that we would be very interested in doing is exporting renewable energy. That is one of the reasons why I mentioned my intense frustration that no European Union directive on renewable energy has been produced yet. Amendment No. 728 would undermine the whole objective of recycling receipts in the first place. That will limit the cost to consumers in the event that renewable generation turns out to be more costly than anticipated.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Perhaps I am not making myself very clear. I am thinking of the parallel of low-sulphur targets. Sulphur targets were set by a European directive and the Conservative Government met that target by closing down the industry that was causing some of the problems and importing low-sulphur coal. Many people at the time thought that that was not quite what was intended. Rather than clean up coal-fired power stations, the Government imported low-sulphur coal and, in many ways, bypassed the intention of the EU directive. The EU was very unhappy about it.

<P>
I am trying to ensure that a UK-based renewable energy generation capacity is created, rather than simply allowing suppliers to import energy without changing anything in this country. I accept, of course, that we are in the EU and that we are liberalising the European energy market, but I want to give some support to domestic-based renewable generation capacity none the less.

<P>

<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman will understand that we will set our obligation consistent with our EU obligations. That means that European generation that meets our criteria for the obligation cannot be excluded because of our commitment to energy liberalisation. The issue is fundamentally about climate change and sustainable development, and it cannot be viewed simply in terms of national markets. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will meet our European obligations, although I do not know whether that really reassures him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I will not delay the Committee further. It is useful that the Minister has provided clarification. Although it is quite possible to support a UK industry without contributing to the EU energy markets-

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I was trying to find out from the Minister whether funds from this measure can go to people working in the European Union delivering electricity. Would someone working on a wind farm that generated electricity outside our national borders, and hence outside our jurisdiction, receive the funding, or would it be limited to people licensed to produce electricity within the UK?

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> That is an important point. My amendment seeks to recognise the European liberalisation that is taking place. That is fine as a backdrop: we must conform to it, play our part and ensure that an EU directive is produced as soon as possible. The amendment also seeks to ensure fair play for UK businesses and consumers and to avoid the bypassing method described by the hon. Member for South Dorset. I shall not pursue the amendments once the Minister has replied.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> We have had a fairly extensive exchange on all the points that have been raised. An obligation could be met by renewable energy generated in another part of the European Union. There could be access to that recycling, because we have to work in the context of a liberalised energy market. One of the main objectives of reforming the electricity trading arrangements, and ensuring that renewables have a place in that, is to make sure that there is a level playing field for renewables in the domestic market. My first priority is to ensure that our industry can supply the renewables obligation and meet the 10 per cent. target by 2010, and we are carrying out the groundwork so that that can be achieved.

<P>
However, it is for the renewables industry itself to ensure that it is market-ready and that it provides renewables at a competitive price. Given that I am the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, I am sure that the hon. Member for Lewes will understand that I am anxious that competitive pressures on the renewables industry are maintained, so that it remains efficient and able to grow in the future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The right hon. Lady still has not answered the question, which I am not pursuing for any pro or anti-European reason. Can a levy be paid to a generator in another country, whether that country is in the EU or not? Levy is going to and fro, and electricity generated elsewhere can be included in the green certificate. We are trying to find out whether that jurisdictional matter is covered in the Bill. I can keep talking for a moment while the right hon. Lady takes advice. It is occasionally better for me to keep waffling so that we get the Minister's full answer. If she is perfectly comfortable, I hope that she will now respond.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. My memory has now caught up with me. Let me make it clear that we are talking not about a levy, but about the recycling of receipts to United Kingdom suppliers. However, liberalised energy markets mean that we cannot prevent other EU countries or any country from buying an electricity company in this country. UK companies get the receipts, but we cannot guarantee that those companies will not be owned by EU or other international companies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I do not think that we have been given the full information. Let us imagine that I am a UK electricity supplier buying electricity from the European Union, which has been produced by renewable means under the Bill's definition. Can I use that in my green certificate to say that I have bought green electricity generated elsewhere, despite the fact it is not part of a levy system? Can I get the levy back, even if I export the electricity to someone else? I am not clear about the issue of jurisdiction.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I completely misunderstood the hon. Gentleman's question-the answer is yes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The debate has been useful. The Minister has resolved one problem, which arose from the consultation document. There was a question about whether receipts might be recycled either on the basis of suppliers' shares of electricity supply markets or on the basis of their renewable electricity supply under the obligation. The Minister has given a firm commitment that it is the latter, which means that distribution will be on the basis of their renewable electricity supply under the obligation and not on the basis of the general supply.

<P>
Will the Minister also clarify some of the issues in the consultation document, particularly the premium that renewable electricity suppliers are likely to receive? The consultation document uses the figure of two-tenths above the market price; how was that figure arrived at? Is the figure in the order-when it is finally published-likely to be the same? How often is the figure likely to be reviewed, in the light of the fall and rise of the costs and the market price of normal electricity? Will the necessary discrepancy in the cost of producing renewables fall over time?

<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for the points that he made. The issues of the level likely to be set and the frequency with which it is likely to be reformed will be covered by the consultation document to which I referred when saying to the hon. Member for Lewes how important it is to get the mechanism right. It is important that we go forward in partnership with the industry to make sure that we create a climate in which the mechanisms are as accurate as possible.

<P>
I shall deal with some of the wider points of the clause. It is an important and interesting clause because it gives the Secretary of State a method of discharging his renewables obligation other than the supply of renewables electricity to customers. Some customers find, particularly in the short term, that they are unable to meet the obligation directly. Those who supply renewable generation often face the difficulty of requiring a critical mass of demand to make their operations economic. The clause provides the alternative of allowing a supplier to buy out all or part of his obligation by making payments to the authority. The amount of the obligation that a given amount of money would buy out would be determined by the renewables order that we have been discussing. It is envisaged that that would be set in pence per kilowatt hour of renewables electricity, which is the buy-out price to which we have referred.

<P>
The clause provides that the authority must distribute the proceeds of buy-out payments among electricity suppliers, according to an allocation system determined by the Secretary of State. The purpose of setting a buy-out price would be to cap the cost to suppliers of discharging their obligations, which would in turn set a ceiling on the ultimate cost to consumers of a renewables obligation. Such a cap might come into play if the cost of generating renewables turns out to be higher than we anticipate when we set the obligation. It is envisaged that the Secretary of State will determine a system for allocating the receipts to suppliers in proportion, as the hon. Member for Lewes said, to the extent to which they have discharged their obligation through the supply of renewables electricity. That would provide suppliers with an incentive to meet their obligations by supplying renewables rather than by exercising their buy-out.

<P>
I commend this important clause to the Committee. It gives us an opportunity to put the renewables industry in a new environemnt.

<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 719, in page 56, line 28, leave out ``transitional and saving''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 720 to 725.

<P>
<B>Mrs Lidell:</B> I am grateful for the opporutnity to move the amendments. They are mainly technical but there is a lot in them. I shall not go into too much detail because I do not wish to delay the Committee; but I will go through them briefly. Amendment No. 719 reflects the fact that the proposed arrangements can no longer be characterised as ``transitional and saving''; they are much more substantial than that.

<P>
Amendment No. 720 widens the scope of the order-making power under the clause to reflect the fact that we have put in place more elaborate arrangements to allow us to meet our obligations.

<P>
Amendment No. 721 reflects the fact that the arrangements may require the levy to be paid to parties to a company set up by a public electricity supplier rather than to the successor companies to the PESs, which will be the only recipients of the levy under clause 33.

<P>
Amendment No. 722 excludes the criminal provisions in clause 32 from having a continuing effect on that which is provided for by the powers in the clause. Any continuing enforcement will be undertaken using the authority's normal enforcement powers.

<P>
Amendment No. 723 deletes a cross-reference that is now too restrictive for the purposes of the clause.

<P>
Amendment No. 724 ensures that the powers under the clause are available so that recipients of the levy should pay back any profit that would arise if the price of electricity from renewable sources were to rise above the price of electricity under the NFFO contracts. That could be considered as a reverse levy.

<P>
Amendment No. 725 provides that compliance with the arrangements set up by an order under clause 55 will be enforceable by the authority. It is necessary to do more than simply make compliance with the arrangements enforceable, given the the NFFO contracts will not strictly be part of the arrangements. We must be able to enforce an obligation equivalent to that contained in clause 32 so that existing NFFO contracts are not frustrated.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the Minister explain exactly how the levy and the new system will interact? The Government seem to criticise NFFO for not delivering the level of electricity from renewable sources that they wanted. However, the mechanism was extremely flexible in determining what the Government wanted from industry, but a cost, which the consumer had to pay, was involved in deciding how much power should be produced from renewable sources.

<P>
Perhaps the Government have got the mechanism right and electricity from renewable sources will be produced more cheaply, which will be good for the consumer, and we shall all be very happy. However, given that we are discussing the arrangements that will allow the two systems to run side by side, the Minister should tell us exactly what the continuing liability will be. I understand that people tended to bid for NFFO levy for so many years at a certain price, which allowed them to make plans. They might have believed that, at the end of that period, they would be able to bid again and continue their programmes.

<P>
Have the Government considered the current schemes? Will those schemes be able to cope with the new regime, so that the new system does not produce a new, perhaps better, mechanism while destroying what had been done so far under the old system? I ask the Minister to tell us what is in her briefing notes, so that we can know more about the original levy and the new system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I seek the same clarification as the hon. Member for South Dorset. Several producers are concerned about the transitional arrangements and about the fact that the change might leave them stranded and at a commercial disadvantage. Indeed, some producers have referred to dire consequences. They might have misunderstood the Government's intention, but their legitimate concern must be dealt with. It will affect the decisions that investors in the companies and future schemes will have to take into account. It will be helpful if the Minister can give us clear assurances about the transitional arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Members for South Dorset and for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) were not present at the beginning of this morning's proceedings when I referred to the non-fossil fuel obligation and explained why we were going down a different route in relation to the renewables obligation. In essence, I think that they are having the same memory problem as I was having earlier, because I said that I wanted to put in context why the Government were changing the arrangements. I referred to our manifesto commitment and our desire for a major and fundamental shift in renewables policy. We carried out a far-reaching review and extensive public consultation. Our action in renewables, particularly in the post-NFFO environment, stems directly from our desire to reform electricity trading arrangements.

<P>
The old NFFO mechanism was not a failure. It succeeded in bringing down the price of renewable energy, but there was a poor implementation record on renewables projects and there was excessive Government involvement in the selection of projects and technologies. I said earlier that the Government are not good at picking winners. The market is much better at doing that. It is strange that I should be saying that to Conservative Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I heard the Minister's speech this morning. I do not know why she thought that I was not present. My Whip is extremely good at ensuring that I am in committtee on time. Having accepted that we are doing away with NFFO, we want to know what the implications for the schemes that are financed by NFFO will be in the new regime. Will there be a quick route to receive finance in a different way? I am sure that the Minister's officials, who have studied such schemes, will know how they will be affected by the new system. The Committee needs to know that.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is obsessed with my officials. I have had several meetings with the renewables industry, not just as part of the extensive consultation process. Changes bring about transitional issues, which are important. One reason why we introduced clause 55 and the amendments to it was to ensure the continuation of the contract between the generators and public electricity suppliers that is outstanding as a result of NFFO orders 3, 4 and 5 and the equivalent Scottish renewables orders. I shall bundle them together and describe them as a NFFO contract. The orders are not due to expire until 2001, so electricity that is generated under the NFFO contracts will form a significant proportion of our 10 per cent. renewable target.

<P>
Clause 55 is designed for the sole purpose of providing for that continuation. All the contracts were entered into in good faith by the renewable generators. In many cases, the financial backing was based on that. The counter-parties opposed to the contracts are the public electricity suppliers-the PESs. They are as solid a counter party for which any banker could ask, which is also important. The counter-parties must change as a result of the Bill, which will abolish the PESs and separate the activities into separate supply and distribution companies. We have been working closely with electricity companies and generators to develop arrangements to provide continuing security for the contracts, broadly equivalent to that provided by the existing public electricity suppliers.

<P>
Those arrangements are still under discussion, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware if he has spoken to the renewables industry. They have proved to be more complex than we envisaged when drafting the Bill, which is why I tabled the amendments. Perhaps I explained them too quickly in helping the Committee to make progress. We shall make all the provisions public when we are about to lay the order before Parliament under the negative resolution procedure.

<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is necessary to put the new regime in place and to ensure that we put the framework for renewable generation in a more modern context. In setting the obligation, we recognise that renewables must now be regarded as part of the mainstream rather than as on the margins. Nevertheless, we are anxious to protect existing contract holders, some of which will continue to 2018. The clause is therefore a long-term commitment. The Government amendments take into account some of the complexity that we have encountered in trying to ensure that each contract will be protected under the new electricity arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I thank the Minister, but I am even more alarmed than I was on first reading the clause. Having read the phrase ``transitional arrangements'', I assumed that NFFO contracts would continue for many years. The Minister said that they will continue until 2001-

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I should have explained. Some will continue until 2001, some until 2018.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, because my panic was partly caused by my understanding that some companies would have to convert to the new system almost as soon as the Bill came into effect.

<P>
The Government have a duty to secure renewables at the best price, which is good for consumers and for everyone. Has the Minister any idea of the reduction in price that is likely to be requested by companies that currently produce electricity using the NFFO levy and are now bidding to continue to do so under the new arrangements? Might the 10 per cent. reduction in the overall cost of electricity that various Ministers have promised or hinted at be part of that reduction? Or will renewables, because we want to encourage more of them, be subject to an even better regime and secure a higher price for their electricity? Has she or have her officials assessed the matter?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> So that the hon. Gentleman does not require counselling after this sitting, I can reassure him that prices under NFFO contracts will continue to be paid to the generators who hold those contracts.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> At the end of the contracts?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks about the price at the end of the contracts. It is too early to say. As I said to the hon. Member for Lewes, we are about to engage in a consultation process that will suggest what the cap should be. Once that is known, the position will be much clearer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> To press the Minister, without going into the detail of the reduction or increase, does she expect renewables to be cheaper in future, or does she expect the price to increase to encourage more renewables?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Member for Lewes referred in the previous debate to the possibility of a 2p cap in the renewables obligation. It is too early to say at this stage. At the start of our debate, I said that the consumer must not pay through the nose for renewables if they are to become publicly acceptable and attractive. We must ensure that the consumer has access to renewable energy at a price that is not disproportionate to that of other energy sources.

<P>
We recognise that there will have to be a slight increase or premium to take account of the technology. However, as we get closer to the 2010 target and an extension of renewables in the marketplace, the price will drop as competitive elements and demand play their part in driving down prices, as they do with every other commodity.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
No. 382, in page 57, line 30, leave out ``two years'' and insert ``one year''.

<P>
No. 383, in page 57, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) In this section, ``new electricity trading arrangements'', in relation to a licence holder, means arrangements for the trading of electricity in bulk that are designed to modify, revoke, or replace, whether in whole or in part, any such arrangements which he is reuqired by a condition of his licence to comply with immediately before this section comes into force.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This is yet another clause supported by the Opposition, for which I make no apology. We support the Government when they are right and oppose them vociferously when they are wrong. We have supported the clause all along. Indeed, we offered the Government a fast-track procedure for it when they were having problems early on in our deliberations and half the Bill had to be removed.

<P>
The clause is an enabling provision. Like the rest of the Committee, I have received many representations from industry, urging support for it. I have no problem in giving such support. However, we have several questions to which it would be helpful to have answers on the record for the benefit of the interested public. There are concerns about the cost of implementing NETA, which is estimated to be between £500 million and £750 million. there are concerns about the sheer complexity of the proposed arrangements.

<P>
Why have the costs escalated so much and how necessary is the sheer complexity involved in the new electricity trading arrangements? When will the first statutory instrument be published?

<P>
Amendments Nos. 380 to 383 reflect the concerns of the electricity industry, which is anxious about what it describes as an open-ended clause. The amendments attempt to redraft the clause to provide for a more objective exercise of the power. They would provide for a tighter definition of the new trading arrangements and would reduce the period in which the Secretary of State can exercise powers in the clause from two years to one, following commencement.

<P>
Will the Minister respond to the concerns of Professor Bunn of the London business school and Larry Ruff of National Economic Research Associates, which were raised on second Reading and have been widely reported since.

<P>
Finally, I turn to concerns expressed in response to the Ofgem-DTI proposals for new electricity trading arrangements, which were helpfully summarised in the appendix to the Ofgem-DTI conclusions document. I shall run through a couple of those concerns, so that the Minister can put the Government's case on the record.

<P>
The document states that respondents
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Wish to re-affirm commitment to delivering reforms but remain convinced that the benefits could have been achieved more quickly, more cheaply, with less risk and without jeopardising substantial investments through modifications to the existing process under a separate and independent market operator.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the Government response to that important matter?

<P>
A further cricism from respondents is that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With the implementation of the new electricity trading arrangements we expect that the current moratorium on Section 36 consents to CCGTS would be rescinded.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When is that likely to be? This morning, I contributed to our debate on the energy White Paper and on-in my view-the sheer humbug of the Government's arguments for a stricter consents policy for building new gas turbine generation. That is simply a matter of protecting the interests of certain Labour Members of Parliament, rather than dealing with the White Paper, which is based on the false premise that people will invest in gas-fired power plant on the basis of a temporary hike in the price of electricity.

<P>
Other criticisms in the document include the concern that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Price reductions of 20 per cent. would be an important factor in investment decisions affecting the life of a number of nuclear power stations. This in turn could affect the prospects for diversity of UK fuel sources and have a significant influence on expectations of the UK's ability to meet the carbon dioxide emission reduction targets to which the Government is committed.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We have not yet had a Government response on that important point. What will be the Government's nuclear policy from 2012, when magnox starts to be decommissioned? We will have met the Kyoto targets between 2008 and 2012, but that will largely be because of the dash for gas and the fact that 30 per cent. of our power is nuclear generated.

<P>
What happens when the old magnox reactors are decommissioned? What is the Government's policy on replacing those power stations? Will they build new nuclear power stations or do they have another way of prventing the escalation of CO2 emissions? That is relevant to our debate because the electricity price reductions anticipated by the Government-which we all want-will have a knock-on effect on the economic viability of future nuclear power stations.

<P>
In the Ofgem-DTI conclusions document, respondents to the new electricity trading arrangements said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is vital that the October 2000 target is met.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We concur with that. Is the project on target for that date? It would also be helpful if the Minister gave a start date.

<P>
Respondents commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When the new arrangements are fully implemented they should be allowed to take effect without Government or regulatory intervention.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister assure us that once the arrangements take effect, there will be a withdrawal of Government or regulatory intervention? Respondents also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The review has been hurried and consequently has not been fully consultative with interested parties as was originally intended.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That shows that there is wider criticism of the consultative process, in which there has been insufficient consultation with interested parties.

<P>
Another comment reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Industry and customers were not sufficiently involved in the decision making process.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister comment on that? Respondents also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Perceptions of regulatory risk have been greatly increased by the extent of the detail still to be decided.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That goes back to the question of whether the Government will meet the October 2000 deadline.

<P>
Finally, respondents expressed concern that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Simplifying the Balancing Mechanism will result in lower barriers to entry, greater flexibility and lower overall market costs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By contrast, the complexity of the balancing arrangements raises barriers to entry, increasing overall market costs. Respondents said that the design of the balancing arrangements
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has become very complex and cumbersome as rules have been added to fix perceived problems with the existing Pool  Complexity imposes significant cost burdens on all parties, particularly smaller players who will be driven to seek refuge with the larger players.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It would be helpful to receive a response to those criticisms. That does not mean that the Opposition do not support the clause: we do. However, it is important that perceived injustices and problems faced by the industry that has to use the new arrangements are addressed in Committee today.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> We have all been looking forward to the meat in the Bill and the change in the electricity industry. Indeed, we should all be happy that there is all-party support for that change. I may have been in the House too long-people who tried to get rid of me at the general election would agree with that-but I am always a little worried when all sides are in favour of a measure. I am even more worried when those affected by it-the electricity generators-do not complain. I am worried that we are not debating the detail of what the Secretary of State will do by secondary legislation. The clause is short, simply giving the Secretary of State the power to modify licences, and we know that he shall do so in relation to NETA. At least one pessimist should stand up and make the point that, although so many people are in favour of a measure, we should not assume that it will achieve the Government's aim of reducing electricity wholesale prices by around 10 per cent.

<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Those of us who have watched the news over the past few days will have noticed that OPEC has been doing what it did during the oil crises of previous decades. It has realised that if it turns off the tap for a while, it can ensure that the price goes up. I remember the briefings when the pool arrangement was made. We were told that unless the pool was there, people simply switching off power stations and not running them for a week could put prices up enormously. There has to be sufficient electricity, and the electricity companies have a duty and a commercial need to supply it to their customers.

<P>
How does the Minister feel that those difficulties will be dealt with? The Committee ought to be consulted on that further. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) in asking her when we will see those detailed arrangements, when the secondary legislation will be available in draft, and when we are likely to discuss it. I hope that she can prove my caution wrong.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I find it intriguing that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton started by saying how much he liked the clause and wanted to see NETA, but then trotted out the criticisms made by those who have something to gain from its not being implemented.

<P>
It is important to return to first principles and remind ourselves why it is necessary to reform the pool. The pool is fundamentally flawed. It is a price-setting mechanism, not a market, and it has no buyer participation. That hands market power to the generators. The pool is not transparent. Why did we identify price spikes in the market in July? Was there a sudden rash of air conditioning the length and breadth of the United Kingdom? The pool distorts the market to the disadvantage of flexible plant, including coal-fired plant. Despite the hon. Gentleman's political posturing, that is one reason why the stricter gas consents policy was necessary.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked when that policy was likely to be lifted. The Secretary of State made it clear that that will happen once NETA is in place. Opposition Members have already asked when we expect NETA to be established, and the answer is October. There are two classic opportunities to introduce it: autumn and spring. We believe that the industry is on target for its introduction in the final three months of this year. The Electricity Association, the main player in the field, has assisted me. I chaired a seminar that gave the industry an opportunity to express its anxieties, and I am assured that the industry is proceeding apace to put the new arrangements in place. It is in the interests of the not only domestic consumers but large industrial consumers to have a plain and transparent market for electricity.

<P>
The pool has an inadequate regulatory oversight of its operations. It has had 10 years to address its shortcomings, but it has failed to do so. The new arrangements will increase competition and put downward pressure on electricity prices, remove the distortions that are presently in the pool and level the playing field for both generators and suppliers. They will involve buyers directly in setting prices, which is important to energy users, and will introduce better governance arrangements and proper regulatory oversight. The arrangments will be important to an industry that has long criticised the pool. We shall end up with a much more competitive market that works to the benefit of the consumers.

<P>
Given that Conservative Members have said that they support the new electricity trading arrangements, I am surprised by the nature of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Amendments Nos. 380, 381 and 383 would narrow the scope of the powers under clause 56, but the provisions, together with the Government amendments, have been drafted carefully precisely to ensure that we have the right scope to introduce the new arrangements. The only purpose that could be served by the changes proposed by Opposition Members would be to put at risk the Government's ability to introduce licence conditions that would ensure the effective implementation of the new arrangements.

<P>
Amendment No. 382 would reduce the period in which the powers will be available to one year from two yeras, as in the Bill. The Government intend to introduce the new trading arrangements as soon as possible. I believe that we are on target for the autumn of this year. The amendment would not allow for the possibility that implementation may slip. Such things happen in the real world and it is a prudent provision, but one that we do not anticipate will be needed. It would be undesirable to maintain the power indefinitely, because it would overrule the protections for companies contained in the usual licence modification processes established under the Bill. That is why we have provided that the power may be available only for a limited period. The Government believe that a period of two years is prudent.

<P>
In any case, the amendments reflect a fear that somehow the Government will decide to use the powers for some purpose other than introducing new trading arrangements. That fear is completely unfounded. The new arrangements have been the subject of extensive consultation with the industry and with all interested parties. The consultation continues. Yesterday, Ofgem published its consultation document on the proposed scope and content of the connection and the use of system code, which will constitute a new contractual framework for connection to and use of the National Grid Company's transmission system under the new trading arrangements. Members of the Committee have been sent copies of that consultation paper and other relevant papers, including drafts of the proposed licence conditions. Through consultation, everyone knows exactly how we intend to implement the new trading arrangements. I cannot therefore ask the Committee to support amendments Nos. 380 to 383.

<P>
Government amendment No. 732 clarifies the scope of the provisions to ensure that we can do everything necessary, in particular with respect to transmission and distribution, to ensure effective implementation of the new arrangements. Government amendment No. 733 deals with the unlikely possibility that we might need to exercise the power after the separation of electricity supply from distribution and the creation of standard electricity licence conditions. Those technical changes match the development of the general provisions on standard licence conditions and will ensure that the standard licence conditions in licences granted subsequently properly reflect the changes to licences under the clause. The amendment provides for the publication of the modifications made to licences under those powers.

<P>
I shall now deal with some of the specific points that have been made. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton criticised the Government for a lack of consultation, but nothing could be further from the truth. I have referred to the consultations that have taken place. The development of the new electricity trading arrangements has been an extremely open process. Industry and consumer representatives have been heavily involved in shaping the proposals through their participation in the development and implementation steering group, which has met more than 25 times so far, and various other expert groups. In addition, all interested parties have had an opportunity to have an input during the extensive consultation process. All public documents on NETA are available on the Ofgem website, and NETA also has telephone and e-mail help desks.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asks when an order will be published, but there is no order under the clause; there will be new licence conditions. The draft licence conditions have been published in a consultation document. The deadline for comment was 27 March and the Government are considering the responses. The draft balancing and settlement code is due to be published in May. The consultation has been taken into account in that code.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman and I have had private discussions, as non-experts, about the complexity of NETA. I am not an expert on electricity generation. I find it complex, and I know that he shares my view, which is why I made the Department's experts available to all members of the Committee. However, we should not frighten ourselves unnecessarily; the majority of electricity will be traded in the bilateral market, which is no more complex than any other market.

<P>
I think that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that delivering electricity in real time is complex, hence the focus on the balancing mechanism. Participation in that part of the market will be voluntary. The balancing mechanism has been widely discussed, and he referred to some of the academic criticisms that have been made. He referred to Derek Bunn of the London business school, who criticised the arrangements, saying that the compulsory market and central dispatch for all generation should be retained because doing so would minimise system costs. However, the compulsory market makes collusion much easier, which can increase prices and reduce the pressures on electricity suppliers to decrease prices.

<P>
Derek Bunn's other criticism was that auction was better than pay as bid, as proposed under NETA. However, a single clearing price is incompatible with a non-compulsory market such as NETA, although prices in bilateral trades are likely to converge towards the marginal costs of generation. A uniform price in a compulsory market is much more susceptible to manipulation-one of the main criticisms of the pool. A uniform price mechanism may be unable to provide appropriate differential rewards for flexible and inflexible plant.

<P>
It has been suggestedthat NETA will fail to deliver price reductions. That suggestion is unfounded. A business simulation model has been created as part of the NETA programme. That model suggests that the NETA proposals should lead to a much more competitive market and lower electricity prices, as we expect.

<P>
Even beyond the modelling exercise, there is growing evidence, in nominal terms and because the market is expecting the introduction of NETA, of future prices of 14 per cent. below those at the time of the White Paper's publication. NETA represents a significant shift towards real-time pricing. The pool prices are set 24 hours ahead. Under NETA, prices will continue to evolve until three and a half hours before real time, and prices in the balancing mechanism will not be known until after the event. That is full, real-time pricing.

<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is also expected that the gate closure period of three and a half hours will shrink over time as players become more familiar with how the new market operates. Considerable attention in developing proposals has been based on examining how trading systems operate. We have taken examples from other countries, and there is wide variation. Some academics disagree with NETA. We know where they are coming from, but others agree with it. It is like consulting a lawyer: ``You pays your money, you takes your choice.'' I believe that sufficient work has been done with the industry to ensure the benefits that NETA is designed to provide.

<P>
One of the big issues is why the pool cannot be modified, but I have made the argument for the move from the pool arrangement to a more transparent system. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made a point about the costs of NETA, which have not escalated. It was always envisaged as costing £100 million a year over the first five years. That is a significant cost, but it must be remembered that there are significant benefits as well.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the future of the nuclear industry, which is important. It is interesting that, in talking about nuclear generation, he seems to assume that it is for the Government to decide whether to build more nuclear plant. We believe that the market should decide the nature of generation, but the market is not making any proposals about it. As across Europe, we have a continuing debate about nuclear generation, and we should focus on the subject much more.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I full appreciate the Minister's point that it is for the market to decide, but if the market decided on a strategy that significantly increased the carbon dioxide emissions of the generating industry, would the Government feel it necessary to take some non-market view on intervention?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The Government have put a range of instruments in place to ensure that all industry, not only electricity generation, takes account of the impact of emissions. That is the reason for the climate change levy and the Duputy Prime Minister's draft climate change strategy. All such matters must be considered for the future of the generation.

<P>
I shall return to my response to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Lower prices will require all generators, including nuclear ones, to increase their efficiency, and that will be good for competitiveness in the United Kingdom and for electricity consumers. One aspect of competitiveness in which we and the rest of Europe lag behind the United States is that European energy costs are 50 per cent. higher than in the US. That has a direct impact on our overall economic competitiveness, and must be addressed. I hope that I have answered all the hon. Gentleman's questions; if not, I am sure he will return to them.

<P>
We have a significant opportunity to change the operation of the electricity market. We have gone to great lengths to bring industry along with us. There are those who benefited from the operation of the pool, but those who did not benefit from the pool were largely the consumers of electricity, both domestic and industrial. I believe that this is a sensible move forward, so I commend the proposal to the Committee and I ask the hon. Gentleman, in the spirit of support for the clause, to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I want to comment on a few of the points made by the Minister. She asked why there were spikes in July. The answer is very simple. Most electricity generator plant has to be closed down for maintenance, and it will have been seen when that was done just how electricity prices could be manipulated upwards. In seeking a better mechanism that will better reflect real market conditions and the cost of generating electricity, we must understand that cutting off supply might make monopoly prices go up and might result in spikes all the year round. Ministers need to be very aware of that.

<P>
I noticed that the Minister got her retaliation in early. She said that there was a 14 per cent. cut in electricity prices not because the pool was working better but because people were anticipating the new electricity trading arrangements. The overall reduction in electricity prices, using the less-than-perfect pool arrangements, has been 30 per cent. We want an economic situation in which people get the right price for their electricity. However, the point my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made and that was not answered was about making sure that they are not simply running on old plant. Once plant is there, one can run the plant even if the capital costs are not being recouped.

<P>
Clearly, that is one of the problems that the nuclear industry has. It needs very high investment up front but it costs very little to run the plant and keep it going once it is in operation. That means that nuclear power is currently very inexpensive, but there will come a point when the nuclear inspectorate says, ``Sorry, this plant can't be kept going any longer.'' The capacity will be removed, and we need to know how the mechanism will operate to ensure that people invest new money in new capacity to replace the old nuclear plant. The new capacity may be nuclear, and I would like it to be, but I think that the Minister and the Committee understand that that is not likely in the current circumstances, because of the very high gamble of spending that money up front and not really knowing how much one will be able to charge for the electricity.

<P>
It was right to raise these concerns, discuss these issues and table these amendments. The Government have not got their sums right. Perhaps the Minister would do one thing for me: work out what the current total profit is in the electricity industry and calculate that as a percentage of sales. She should then think whether a 10 per cent. reduction in the cost of electricity-whether wholesale or retail-is the minimum that will come from the new electricity trading arrangements, as the Secretary of State said on the Floor of the House. Frankly, I do not think that a 10 per cent. reduction will apply across the board. It may well be that at certain times the peak price may go down by 10 per cent., but on the other hand it might go up by 10 per cent.-or it might even go up by 100 or 200 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was surprised at the Minister lashing out at me for mentioning the criticisms despite the fact that the Opposition supports clause 56. The Government need to learn not to fear criticism. If they have a firm case, they should take criticism on the chin. It is important to listen to people's concerns and to address them. That might be a lesson for the Government generally. We are a pluralistic society and this is our Parliament; it is important to raise issues and have them debated.

<P>
The Minister spoke about the pool arrangements. I agree that they have become an anachronism because of developments in the industry, but there was nothing wrong with them when they were put in place. There were few buyers and sellers when the industry was privatised. It was one big solid monolith that had to be broken up. The pool was the right mechanism for the early days of privatisation. As more competition has come in, we need a more market-based arrangement and approach. That is why we support the new electricity trading arrangements. The Minister criticised the amendments, but they reflect the concerns of the Electricity Association, with which she tells us she has been liaising closely. I am surprised that she is quite so critical of the amendments, given that she consulted widely on the clause.

<P>
The Minister said that it was for the market to decide whether new nuclear plant will be built-she is right in saying that there is no demand as yet from the industry to build new nuclear plant because of the economics involved-but she is keen to intervene in the market when it comes to gas-fired power stations. She is keen to have a stricter consents policy when it comes to market demands for building new gas plant. There will be an enormous CO2 impact as and when the magnox power stations start to come off stream in the next five to 10 years. The Government need to have a response about what they intend to do to meet our Kyoto commitments after 2012. There is no problem in meeting them up to then. The problems arise after that date. The Government should address that and raise the issue as a matter of debate in the country.

<P>
In view of the full response that we have had to the other criticisms raised in the consultation document, and in the spirit of supporting the Government, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
