<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge On a point of order, Mr. Gale. May I draw your attention, and that of the Minister, to a problem that has arisen for hon. Members who are trying to prepare for clauses 86, 87, 88 and 89? Government amendments to the clauses refer to sections that have been inserted at a later stage into the Children Act 1989. To the best of my understanding, the copy of the Act that is availabe to hon. Members in the Room does not contain sections 87A, 87B or 87C of the Act. Hon. Members who were in the same position as I was in my constituency at the weekend, with that copy of the Children Act, were unable to prepare amendments or consider Government amendments to those sections. Is it not the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that hon. Members have available to them the correct statutes that the Bill purports to modify?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, it is the responsibility of the Minister to make relevant information available, as he or she feels appropriate. My understanding is that other amendments will be tabled and other information made available to the Committee. As always, the Chairman takes the view that information should be made available to all members of the Committee at as early as is conveniently possible for the Government. That is not a point of order for the Chair, but if the Minister wishes to respond, I am happy to allow him to do so.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales </B>(Mr. David Hanson): Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. May I offer my apologies? We shall consider the points made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). We hope that the sections relevant to the Children Act will be available this afternoon.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful for that clarification.
<P>
I should be interested to know whether the parliamentary keepers of The Guinness Book of Records can tell us whether clause 68 is the longest clause of any Bill. It runs to 15 pages and presents difficulties for you, Mr. Gale, and for the Committee. There are more than 100 amendments, of which half are Government amendments, It might be helpful if, with your indulgence, we try to deal with issues that relate to each subsection of this very long clause as we discuss the amendments to them, and thereby avoid an unwieldy stand part debate.
<P>
The first groups of amendments is long. I freely confess that it attempts to probe a relatively simple issue. Having started the process, I found myself on a treadmill. In order to be consistent, I had to propose further amendments to the early part of the clause, and it has become an unwieldy group.
<P>
The point that I seek to clarify is simple. In earlier clauses that deal with registration of a person running a care home there is a relationship between the registered person and the establishment in respect of which they are registered. I have sought--perhaps imperfectly--to draw out that distinction, because in clause 68 the distinction appears not to be properly made.
If a person is registered as a child minder and is looking after children on domestic premises, there appears to be an underlying assumption that the domestic premises are their own home. I know, however, that child minders have other people working for or with them. Therefore, a person can look after children in their own domestic premises and employ other people to look after children in those premises.
<P>
We are dealing with two categories of people. The first is the principal child minder, who, under the Bill, must be responsible for the provision of the environment in which children are minded. Provisions of clause 68 deal with the condition, quality and appropriateness of the physical facilities.
<P>
The second category is people who are not in control of the premises on which child minding is provided. They must satisfy the appropriate criteria for suitability that they are suitable people to look after children but it does not seem right to impose on them a responsibility for the premises and other structures.
<P>
In the earlier parts of the Bill, a distinction is clearly made. A registered person who carries on a care home business is responsible for all kinds of things in relation to that home. Care workers must be registered and various provisions apply to them, but it is not suggested that they are personally responsible for the physical standards of the accommodation in the care home.
<P>
By probing the Government's intentions, I seek to suggest an alternative model that creates the concept of a child minder as a person who looks after children in domestic premises, of which they are the owner or over which they have control. A child minding assistant, however, looks after children in domestic premises over which they do not have control--in other words, they are an employee of a child minder.
<P>
A series of consequences flow from that distinction and affect the way in which this part of the Bill is structured and the responsibilities that are placed on those classes of people. For example, under proposed new section 79U(2), a registered inspector is given powers to enter premises if he believes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that a child is being looked after ... in contravention of this Part.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That raises the disjunction of an individual who looks after children from the premises in which they are looked after. I foresee considerable problems with that. If a person looks after children in premises that they do not control, what is their status when they look after a child in different premises? A logical and more sensible approach would be to register a person in respect of premises where that person was running the business of child minding, and to have a different category for people who are minding children and need to be regulated, but who are not in control of the premises.
<P>
Will the Minister give us her view on that important aspect of the Bill's architecture?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment </B>(Ms Margaret Hodge): May I begin by welcoming back the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride)? We have all heard that she had a bad time, but we are glad to see her fit, well and with us today. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"]
<P>
I understand the issues that have been raised by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, but I hope to persuade him that the amendment is unnecessary and potentially dangerous. The promotion of the safety of children is paramount--we do not want children to go to premises that are not safe. We have taken provisions from part X of the Children Act and we have no evidence--I do not know whether Opposition Members have any--that they are not working effectively.
<P>
The suitability of assistants who work with child minders will be assessed under subsections (3)(a) and (4)(a) of proposed new section 79B. Under the amendment, an assistant would no longer be assessed for suitability as part of the child minder's application, but would instead be registered separately. I am concerned about the scope for abuse, because the proposed definition would apply to a provider who was working on her own or in someone else's domestic premises. She could say, for example, that the premises were under the control of her husband. Providers could swap premises to avoid being in control of premises in which they worked, which could make them exempt from the premises check and put children at risk.
<P>
I have sympathy for a provider in the circumstances covered by the amendment--where she is unable to make safe premises that she does not control--but we must put the safety of children at the top of our agenda. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thought that the Government Whip wanted to catch your eye, Mr. Gale, but perhaps he does not.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister and understand her point. However, we did not intend to create any loopholes and expect all premises on which child minding is conducted to continue to be inspected.
<P>
I urge the Minister to look again at the provisions of proposed new section 79B(3), which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person is qualified for registration for child minding if--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, a person who wants to be employed by a child minder to mind children in the child minder's home is qualified only if they fulfil conditions that are entirely out of their control. It offends my sense of natural justice that someone may be disqualified from registration, or even deregistered under the clause, because the person who controls the premises fails to do something.
<P>
For example, the person controlling the premises might take in an unsuitable lodger. I have no problem with the concept that the person running the child minding business might be deregistered in respect of those premises in such circumstances, but it is harsh that someone who has merely been employed there should find themselves deregistered as a child minder because of something that their employer chose to do. That is why I suggested a separate register for "premisesless" employees who are innocent of any offence relating to premises that might otherwise cause them to be deregistered.
<P>
10.45 am
<P>
I understand why the Minister resisted this group of amendments--I freely confess that it is unwieldy--but I wanted to raise the issue. I hope that she will consider how deregistration for non-compliance in relation to premises will affect a person employed on them but who is wholly innocent of any offence and unable to influence the matters that led to it. In equity, an alternative form of registration should allow them effortlessly and seamlessly to continue working in other properly registered premises, notwithstanding what has happened to their previous employer.

<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I hope to offer the hon. Gentleman some comfort. The Act ensures that where premises arc deregistered, an assistant to a child minder will not automatically be affected. I had understood that this was more a case of our not having to register premises where a child minder was working away from the home in which they sought registration. Where two child minders work together in the home of one of them and the premises are deregistered, the other person would carry on being viewed and accepted as a registered child minder.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and sorry if my amendment was sufficiently confusing to have misled her. I am reassured by what she says, but I do not know where in these 15 or so dense and impenetrable pages that provision appears. I shall be extremely grateful If she would draw my attention to it.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I understand that the provision is in subsections (3)(a) and (4)(a) of proposed new section 79B.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I anticipated that it might be buried deep in the clause, but if the Minister is referring to proposed new section 79B, my initial reading of it did not strike me as having the effect she suggests.
<P>
I sense that there is good will here. None of us is trying to undermine the inspection of premises. I have raised a specific issue that concerns me, but the Minister thinks that I should not be concerned. I will read what has been said and look at the Bill again.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> In order to give absolute certainty on such an important point, I will write to the hon. Gentleman. If any problems arise, they can be reconsidered on Third Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister and I look forward to her letter. I might not be tempted to wait until Third Reading--I shall return to the matter on Report once I have seen her letter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No.386. I call Mr. Hammond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am in some difficulty because the selection list that I was sent last night does not suggest that amendment No.386 is the next amendment to be debated.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can assist the hon. Gentleman. I believe that he might have received the provisional selection list; an updated version was available in the Room this morning. Amendment No.386 has been selected for debate prior to amendment No.338. Is the hon. Gentleman ready to move the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Yes. I understand that the list that was issued last night was provisional. You will know, Mr. Gale, that, typically, Members rely on it to prepare their notes.
<P>
I beg to move amendment No.386, in page 32, leave out lines 14 to 18 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'( ) is a foster parent of a child'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is simply a probing amendment. The proposed new section 79A(3)(c), (d) and (e) put into place a new definition of foster parent. Proposed subsection (3) copies the Children Act in relation to paragraphs (a) and (b), but in relation to (c), (d) and (e), it provides for a complicated three-way split of the simple Children Act definition of foster parents. My purpose in tabling the amendment, which reverts to the language used in the Children Act, is to probe the practical significance of the greater differentiation in the definition of a foster parent and what effect it will have in practice once it is incorporated into the Children Act.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am for anything that simplifies definitions in Bills, but the one proposed in the amendment would not be sufficient to have any meaning under new part XA. The definition therefore needs the additional paragraphs. The hon. Gentleman referred to part X of the Children Act and the definition in section 71(4)(c). His amendment would effectively delete the Children Act definition of a foster parent in section 71(14), which would have to be reinstated. If he looked at the old Act, he would see that all we are doing is reproducing that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hear what the Minister says. I was looking at section 71(4)(c) of the Children Act, which uses the simple terminology
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is a foster parent of a child.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear to me why the expanded definition is required in new part XA.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> If the hon. Gentleman refers to section 71(14), he will see the wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand that the Minister is arguing that the expansion of the definition in proposed new section 79A(3)(c), (d) and (e) is in fact overall an economising measure because it removes one line from the Bill. I thank her for that explanation, which has effectively dealt with the point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): rose--
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed , I apologise to the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson). Once the Member who moves the amendment seeks leave to withdraw it, I must put the question to the Committee immediately. I know that the hon. Gentleman suffered from similar exclusion during the previous sitting. If he sought to catch my eye a little earlier, I am sure that I would endeavour to include him in debate. No offence was intended.
<P>
While I am apologising, I feel that perhaps I owe the Committee a modest apology for the change in this moming's order of selection. The Committee will be aware that when we are dealing with a massive number of amendments, as we are with this Bill, we have to work from loose papers. When we receive the final marshalled papers, it sometimes becomes apparent that the logical sequence is slightly out of order. That is what happened overnight. I advise Members to double-check the Chairmen's selection in the morning to ensure that the order is as they anticipated. I am sorry for any confusion that may have arisen.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): I beg to move amendment No. 338, in page 32, leave out lines 20 to 28.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 339, in page 32, line 46, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(9) This Part does not apply in relation to a person engaged as an au pair or a babysitter.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 340, in page 33, line 26, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(e) he is providing childcare in the parental home of a child and in such circumstances the following conditions will apply--
<P>
(i) he is suitable to look after children under the age of eight;
<P>
(ii) he is complying with regulations under section 79C and with any conditions imposed by the registration authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> This is the first time I have tabled an amendment to a Bill, so it is a little footnote in history.
<P>
I have had the opportunity to raise with my hon. Friend the Minister a number of concerns. I declare an interest as I am chair of the all-party child care group. The purpose of the amendments is to obtain a response from the Minister to some of my concerns about the fact that he might not be acknowledging that child care has changed dramatically over the past 20 years. A certain type of child care--commonly called the nanny--no longer might be the prerogative only of the very wealthy. Nannies in care for children in the home of a parent or, with shared nannies, in the home of another parent. As a result, there has been disinclination to bring nannies within registration. Since circumstances are changing, many parents with children under five would prefer, if possible, to have their children cared for in the family home, where the children are familiar with their surroundings and where there is equipment to provide for their needs as babies and toddlers. That is particularly true of parents of children with special needs who may have additional equipment and resources within the home that they cannot find elsewhere. That is a considerable problem.
<P>
Another issue is that those of us who are interested in the work-life balance find that, increasingly, parents' working hours no longer conform to a set nine to five pattern. For people who do not work a normal working day, therefore, and who are involved in shift work in some form--especially in the evening or into the early hours of the morning--the feasibility of finding child care outside the parental home is nigh on impossible.
<P>
I cite an example given to me recently by my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) of a single mother who is a nurse. Despite the efforts being made by the Government to offer family friendly working practices in the health service, she still had to find child care at hours that were not available outside of her home. That is a problem. There is a discrepancy between the child care that we register and access to, for example, the child care tax credit available under the working families tax credit scheme. Interestingly, clause 4(3) refers to domiciliary care. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Domiciliary care agency" means, subject to subsection (6), an undertaking which consists of or includes arranging the provision of personal care in their own homes for persons who by reason of illness, infirmity or disability are unable to provide it for themselves without assistance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Children cannot provide care for themselves without assistance. I would almost like to scratch out from our memories the term "nanny". Perhaps we should view this issue more in terms of domicilary care, or child care in the home, in order to move forward. There may be a slight contradiction in the Bill.
<P>
How does clause 4 affect a parent who has a disabled child with special needs and buys in domicilary care in the form of a nanny with specialist training and nursing qualifications to look after the child? Would the nanny be registered under clause 4 or under clause 68? For children with special needs, there could be a slight contradiction. The Daycare Trust believes that there is a strong case for including the registration of nannies in the standards, but I accept that there are issues and difficulties to be ironed out.
<P>
I have confined myself to three amendments today. I tried to work my way through the clause to see whether I could make consistency apparent throughout the clause by including child care in the parental home, but it was nigh on impossible. The Department and those who draft Bills should take up that challenge, if consistency is what they seek.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
More people are looking for child care that is flexible enough to meet their needs. A growing number of parents, on varying incomes, feel that child care within the parental home--or in a friend's home, where care is shared--is the answer for them.
<P>
We know that the Government are trying hard to increase child care places. Places for the under-threes are difficult to find and the Government have a long way to go to bridge the gap. Parents have special concerns about the environment in which their children are looked after and the care that they receive.
<P>
The Daycare trust is conducting a study, funded by the Department for Education and Employment, which asks parents what they think of present standards and future regulations. The Minister may wish to say more about it in her response, which is due at the end of July. It will be interesting if parents are asked about child care in the home rather than elsewhere and how they feel that it should be regulated.
<P>
There are no legal requirements on a person who applies for a job as a nanny--the defined term that is used. There is no nationally agreed system for checking the criminal record of people who apply for a post as a nanny. Many parents who are choosing that child care option understand that they have to do a check. I had a child minder for nine years and, although she was registered, I met her and asked questions as one should, whatever kind of child care one is considering. If, as a parent, I felt that a nanny was the option for me and my family, how could I check that person's criminal record? If the Goverment cannot see fit to bring nannies into the full scope of the regulations, they should at least deal with the issue of criminal records and help parents to make a difficult decision. Parents can follow up applicants' qualifications with colleges. If a person provides employment history, parents can ask for references from previous employers. On interview, when checking the person's health, parents can even ask for a GP's letter. All those instruments are probably available to parents. There is a good document on the Daycare Trust's website listing everything that parents should do to ascertain the quality of the child care that they are about to engage. However, there is no obvious way for the family to verify criminal records satisfactorily. We should offer that information to parents.
<P>
The other issue is the way in which regulation and registration fit into people's opportunity to claim the good benefits that the Government provide for families on a relatively low income who want to work. I gave the example of a nurse who is a single mother. She feels that, because of her shift work, she has to provide child care in her home. As a result, she cannot claim the child care tax credit as part of the working families tax credit. It seems ridiculous that she should be penalised because of the nature of her job and because she feels that care in the home is fit for her child. She may be employing someone who has recognised child care qualifications, but cannot be registered because the care is not in her home; by doing so, she is losing out on a good benefit that the Government are providing to help work pay and to help women to combine work and family life. That anomaly in the system needs to be addressed. At present, without some form of registration, people such as her, and many others, cannot access benefits to which they would be entitled.
<P>
My amendments highlight the omission of au pairs and babysitters. I did not want the Minister to tell me that there would be all kinds of problems in defining au pairs and babysitters. I know that, but they could be taken out of the scope of the Bill in the same way as clause 68 deals with child care for less than two hours. I wanted to include au pairs and babysitters in an amendment so that the Minister knew that I understood the issues involved. There are difficulties with them and they should be taken out of the Bill.
<P>
By removing lines 20 to 28, amendment No. 338 questions whether "child minder" should be defined differently. For a child minder who provides child care on their domestic premises there are issues about the standard of the premises and what equipment is provided, but they do not apply to a child minder who works in the parental home. Amendment No. 340 recognises that the full scope of the regulations would not necessarily apply to someone providing child care in the parental home.
<P>
I do not want to go on much longer, Mr. Gale, because we have a great deal to discuss on clause 68. We should all be aware, however, that the provision of child care is important to many families. In Britain today, the vast majority of families do not use paid child care, but rely instead on family and friends or work shifts that fit their child's needs. To a certain extent, it is time that we banished from our minds the images of Mary Poppins and Norland nannies and accepted that child care in the parental home is a much-needed service. Many people who provide child care would like to be brought within regulation, because, as in other forms of child care, the system can be abused. I should like to be reassured that, at the very least, the inability of parents to access criminal checks would be addressed in the short term.
<P>
We have to shape a national child care strategy and the regulations and qualifications that underpin it in a way that ensures that it moves with the times. For many parents, child care in the parental home for the under-threes and under-fours can be a real option. It could be an expanding sector if we stopped treating it like a poor relation and it could tackle some of the problems of meeting the gaps.
<P>
Most importantly--and I say this as a Labour Member--the divisions between people who use such provision and those who do not are becoming increasingly blurred. As a result of shift work, more and more people feel that they want to take up that option to care for their very young children. For the nurse that I cited, to be denied a benefit that would help to make her work pay, because she needs child care in the evening and at night, is an anomaly that we should address. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Lady has raised some interesting points for the Committee to consider. I say at the outset that this part of the Bill has the feel of the introduction of a relatively heavy-handed regulatory structure. We shall be exploring that as we go through the Bill and seeking from the Minister assurances that what is proposed is proportional to the perceived problem. We will ask what work has been done to establish exactly what is the problem and how extensive it is, and whether the proposal is an appropriate response. I enter that caveat at the outset, although having accepted the route that the Government propose to take, it is important that there is consistency.
<P>
The hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) has highlighted an area of possible inconsistency in the exclusion of nannies from the Bill's scope. The hon. Lady talked about getting away from the image of the Norland nanny and said that she would like the concept of nannies to be expunged from the legislation. If I have read it correctly, there will be no such reference in proposed new part XA, and as far as England is concerned, part X will be removed from the Children Act. There will be no reference to nannies and therefore, linguistically at least, her objective has been achieved.
<P>
The hon. Lady talked about the difficulty of carrying out checks on people whom one seeks to employ in one's home to look after children. I know from experience how difficult that is. The point that she did not make--but could have made--is that, at least in London, people in that category are increasingly from overseas, perhaps from Australia or South Africa. Typically, many young women working in London today are difficult to trace and the agencies that place them are not always forthcoming about their histories. I know from experience that it is difficult to find out anything about those one wishes to employ in the home to look after one's children.
<P>
The Minister could deal fairly simply with the concern of the hon. Member for Don Valley about people who have grown up and worked in this country. For example, parents could be given access to the criminal records bureau once it is up and running. However, it will not be so easy to deal with people who come from overseas, perhaps for a short period.
<P>
I remember once interviewing a Hungarian girl who said that she had lived in Italy for two years and worked as a child carer there. By chance, I happened to know somebody in the Italian town where she claimed to have worked and, by chance, he happened to know the local police commander. In Italy, aliens are required to register with the local police, so, by chance, I was able to check and discovered that the girl had not registered with the police in that town. If it had not been for an extraordinary set of coincidences, we would have had to take her at face value. I know that the point is anecdotal.
<P>
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's thoughts on how some additional routes of reassurance might be provided for parents who, for many reasons, including those described by the hon. Member for Don Valley, want to employ someone in their own home to look after their children, whether on a shared basis or not.
<P>
The hon. Lady also raised an important question about children with special needs who could be considered to have some form of disability. Will a person provided by an agency to look after such children be classified under this clause or prove earlier ones dealing with domiciliary care? I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that they will not be classified under both, because that is exactly the sort of double jeopardy and bureaucratic procedure that we seek to avoid. Will one clause take precedence over another where either might apply? I look forward to hearing what she says about that.
<P>
Having said that people from overseas are, by definition, more difficult for an individual parental employer to check, I was surprised that the hon. Member for Don Valley sought to exclude au pairs from her definition. I understand that she did so for pragmatic reasons, but it is precisely those who are difficult to trace--in some cases, they will be au pairs--who raise concerns. The Bill's main thrust is to keep unsuitable people away from contact with children and vulnerable adults. There is relatively little that can be done to check on a person from overseas. A child under their care in the parental home is perhaps more vulnerable than when he or she goes to a child minder's home or a day care facility, where at least there are other people around and there is a greater chance of detection if anything goes wrong.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall await the Minister's response to the amendment, and shall be interested to hear whether, not withstanding her amendment excluding au pairs, the hon. Member for Don Valley recognises the problem that I have identified.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): The Committee should be grateful to the hon. Member for Don Valley for raising at least three important issues. The first is the registration of nannies, for which my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) has long pushed. An opportunity to do so in this Bill has been missed, but I hope that the matter can still be addressed.
<P>
Another issue, alluded to by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, is the artificial distinction between domestic settings where children are looked after. What is important is the relationship between the child and the person looking after him or her, not so much whether the care is in the child's or the carer's home. We are creating artificial circumstances which people will have to manipulate in order to qualify, or escape having to qualify, for benefits. I would not want children to be shifted from one home to another in order to ensure that the nurse in the example given by the hon. Member for Don Valley could qualify for some of the benefits available.
<P>
The other question that the hon. Lady raised is an important problem that I have come across on more than one occasion in my clinical and constituency casework. At the moment, housing benefit and working families tax credit depend on employing someone whose registered child care qualifications are concentrated on the care of under-eights. People with special needs often need qualities and experience that are not necessarily related to those required for registration to look after that age group. It is odd that the definition in the clause is a child under eight years old, whereas the rest of the time it is children under the age of 16.
<P>
Will such an anomaly be dealt with by regulation, or has the Minister had words with her hon. Friends in other Departments to see whether the tax credit and housing benefit regulations may be adjusted so that people on any register under the Bill will be able to attract the benefits that are available to those who employ carers for the under-eights? I know a very nice family who have two sons with specific care needs, but they are aged 10 and 12 and the people best able to look after them are reluctant to take six months or a year out in order to qualify for access to benefits under the under-eight regulations.
<P>
The potential carer could be very experienced with children who have a special need, but could not register under the terms of benefits regulations. I would be grateful if the Minister said whether the Government intend to deal with that issue through regulations made under proposed new section 79C of the Children Act 1989, or whether discussions have taken place with Ministers in other Departments?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley on her contribution. I am sure that other hon. Members join me in expressing gratitude for her support and help as we consider how the child care strategy should evolve. The aim of that strategy is to increase the amount of child care available and ensure that it is of a high quality and affordable.
<P>
However, we must recognise that more than half the child care used by parents and families is provided through informal arrangements. Many parents prefer such arrangements, and we should respect their choices. The state should not interfere in private arrangements and relationships in the home. Those arrangements can be made with anyone from a nanny or au pair to a grandparent, other relative or friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If we are driven by the desire to protect the child, what is the logical difference between person A entering the parents' home to look after the child while they are not present, and the child being taken to person A's home and looked after there by person A? The Bill clearly requires registration in the second category, but not in the former. What is the difference in the risk to the child?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> There is a limit to the state's ability to intervene to ensure the child's safety. I will describe some of the difficulties in trying to intervene in the relationship between an employer/parent and a nanny or other employee in the home. That relationship is personal. The employer and the nanny may fall out. The employer may then complain that the nanny is unsuitable to work with children. Any regulator would be left in the invidious position of having to choose between the word of the nanny and that of the employer to decide whether the nanny was suitable to care for a child. There is no objective external check--as there can be with the inspection of child minders in their own homes--so it would be extremely difficult to provide parents with any certainty or ensure that the system was fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I fully accept the Minister's point, but the Government stand charged with inconsistency. She says that the relationship between an employer and someone who enters his home to care for his children is extremely personal. Is it more personal than the relationship between a disabled person and the carer who enters his home to perform intimate care tasks? I do not think so. I can see no logical reason for the Government's cut-off point.

<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> There is a difference between the domiciliary care provided by care workers in the home for disabled or sick people, and the day care provided in the home by a nanny, au pair, grandparent, friend or neighbour. If the hon. Gentleman cannot see the qualitative difference in the nature of those relationships, we shall simply have to disagree.
<P>
A child minder outside the home is regulated because a child minder cares on average for about three or four children, perhaps from different families. In those circumstances, a state-governed regulation and inspection regime is justified.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> May I take the Minister back to an earlier intervention? She said that it would be extremely difficult to assess someone minding a child in its parents' home, but much easier to do so if the person was minding the child elsewhere. As it is the person who is assessed, as well as the accommodation, and if a person can be assessed outside the domestic setting, surely the proposal should also be applicable to those working in the home.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The issue is where the line is drawn. When the employee works in the employer's home and there is a row, for example, it is difficult to say that the nanny is not completely competent and able to care for children. It may simply be a personality clash; that should not rule out the person working as a nanny elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): I take my hon. Friend's point about the parents' home and the child minder's home, but as the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) said, should we not at the very least be organising police checks on the individuals involved?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I was going to return to our attempt to give greater comfort to those who employ a nanny or an au pair to care for their child in their home in a formal or informal arrangement.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am becoming increasingly alarmed by what I hear. The Minister has said twice that if the occupation of a nanny were registered, difficulties would arise if a nanny fell out with her employer. Is the Minister suggesting that the registration of employees, whether they are nannies, child minders or workers in a residential home, will be subject to what their employer thinks? I had hoped for a more objective scheme to assess people's suitability, rather than one that takes into account an employer and an employee falling out.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> My point is that if an employer and an employee caring for a child in the home had a dispute and the employer referred the employee to the national agency responsible for that employee's registration and inspection, the agency would have to make a judgment based on two people not getting on. In such circumstances, it would be difficult to make an objective judgment. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman looks puzzled. It may help if I tell him what we are doing to try to ensure additional comfort--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has not been in the Committee for most of its deliberations, but I assure her that it is unusual for me to rush to support the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. How does what she describes differ from what applies to a domiciliary care worker who falls out with the person whom she is working with? We must assume that employers and registration authorities can make a distinction between personality clashes and professional incompetence.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We have gone over the point before. The situation of someone who is sick or disabled and therefore vulnerable cannot be compared with that of the fit, able-bodied parent of a child. The situation before us is different and requires different regulation. All the care regulations require balance; it is ironical that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned the heavy-handed regulatory framework. It suggests that he wishes us to provide greater regulation and to be more heavy-handed. He may accuse us of inconsistency, but I cannot understand how the previous Government were perfectly happy to have a system of registering child minders but not registering child care within the home. We are building on those regulations, not changing them. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, if he were in government, would have deregistered child minders or, if not, registered nannies. I am unclear about what he wants.
<P>
11.30 am
<P>
I shall return to the issue of nannies and then deal with the specific matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley. I hope that the Department of Trade and Industry will this year introduce regulations for agencies that recommend nannies to individuals. I hope that through those regulations checks will be carried out on people whom parents employ to look after their children, which is what many parents want. Under the new regulations, the agencies will have to make the essential police checks, health checks and checks on qualifications. An employer who recruits a nanny through an agency will thus have the comfort of knowing that those checks have been done.
<P>
About a year ago, we produced a leaflet to support parents called "Need a Nanny--a guide for parents", which took parents through the questions they needed to ask and the issues they needed to think about when employing a nanny, for the safety and well-being of their children. When the Department of Trade and Industry has introduced the regulations, we shall issue guidance to give further support to parents who employ a nanny.
<P>
A criminal records bureau is being set up and we are working with the Home Office to consider how best it can be established. I hope that members of the Committee appreciate that there are difficulties in allowing an individual to request a police check on another individual. However, parents who want to recruit someone to care for their child within the home can ask potential employees to produce the certificate of their criminal records bureau check. It is a voluntary measure, rather than a prescriptive one. My hon. Friend's point will be taken into account when we consider how the criminal records bureau will be set up.
<P>
It is extremely difficult to keep an up-to-date register of people working in the home, and young people who work with children in their own homes often tend to move around the country. Those with experience of the matter say that the register will always be three months out of date. It would thus not provide the comfort that many people seek from it.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley raised some legitimate and difficult issues. Shift workers on a low income may need care within the home to fit in with their shifts, but because it is unregistered child care in the home it is not taken into account when they claim working families tax credit. I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend's argument and I hope that Members will have noticed that we are introducing the regulation of all-night care. That new development is emerging as people work different shifts and more people work away from home. I shall look further at the issue of shift workers with my hon. Friend the Paymaster General.
<P>
Some children with disabilities have to be cared for within the home; there is a distinction between a domiciliary care worker who will be registered and a child care worker in the home supporting a parent who has a child with disabilities. We are again considering what flexibility we have and I shall be holding discussions with the Paymaster General on the issue. I assure the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight that we are also introducing regulations for child care for children over eight. It will be a looser regulatory framework as it will not need quite the same amount of regulation and we want it to be proportionate. That is another new measure that we will introduce as part of this very lengthy clause.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> Little did I realise that my amendments would spark such a lively debate, although it does make the time go more quickly. I listened carefully to the points made by my hon. Friend the Minister and I welcome her clarification of the criminal records checks, of children with special needs and of children over eight. I contemplated extending the age range to under 14 as the national child care strategy covers children from nought to 14, but that would have led to other problems such as amending the Children Act. The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight made the valid point that children between eight and 14 are often not in a position to protect themselves when in care.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Does the hon. Lady recognise that there is an enormous anomaly under the housing benefit and working families tax credit regulations, whereby exceptional arrangements allow over-eights to receive these benefits? They are available only if the carer qualifies under the under-eight regulations.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> I have much sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is saying. That is why I raised the issue of the child care tax credit. On the one hand, we are trying to do a good thing in supporting families with these benefits, but on the other there is no joined-up thinking on its impact. My hon. Friend the Minister is concerned about this issue, but we must raise it with the other departments that are responsible for creating the financial constructs. They need to be shown issues about which they might not have thought. Perhaps, for instance, people in the Treasury do not consider all the implications of child care, but the anomalies need to be addressed. Families increasingly want to have flexible child care that meets their needs. That is advocated consistently by my hon. Friend the Minister, although it does not always fit neatly into the financial constructs created by other departments. We need to ensure that the legislation does not give with one hand and take it back with the other.
<P>
We need to think further about interfering with private relationships. I have had a child minder for nine years and she has told me over the years about some of the disastrous relationships that she had with various parents--although not with me, of course. One realises that whenever one engages a service for the family--not a commodity bought in a shop--there are people involved and there always is sensitivity in the relationships. We need to look at relationships in child care in the home with some sensitivity. I am sure that every day of the week, all over the country, child minders are involved in personality disputes with the parents of the children they look after.
<P>
The nanny might come into a home where there is only one child to look after. A lot of families, however, choose in-home child care when there is more than one child, thereby lowering the overall cost. I am not sure whether that stands up to economic scrutiny. In many family arrangements, of course, particularly where there is not a large income, there is increasing use of a shared nanny. There would then be more than one child involved.
<P>
Increasingly, families are looking for a nanny. I would really like to wipe out that term from the Bill, however, since it evokes images that are not really contemporary. Many nannies nowadays do not live in but provide a service in the home. The comparison, therefore, with the domicillary care arrangements is quite striking. In one part of the Bill we say we will regulate domiciliary care for someone's personal needs. We debated the definition of those personal needs and concluded that they were not simply perfunctory but should consist of general all-round care of the person. Similarly, when it comes to looking after children, there are personal aspects of care--hygiene, feeding, caring--but there are also developmental needs. I am not convinced by what the Minister has said about being able to separate that from all the other areas of care.
<P>
I am worried that when many parents in the United Kingdom engage an au pair they assume that there is some standard to be met. I will quote from the Daycare Trust guide for parents on engaging in-home care. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Au pairs are single young people, who come from a member state of the European Community or one of a limited number of other countries .... [They] come to the UK to study English and, whilst staying with families, help in the home for a maximum of five hours a day. ... ...
<P>
Au pairs are not usually trained to work with children and therefore are not generally considered as being suited to looking after pre-school children while parents are at work. However, they can be a good option for ... after-school childcare.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have separated the issue of au pairs because when things have gone wrong it has often been because parents have expected young women to take on the role of looking after very young children with very little support while the parents were in full-time work. That is the wrong attitude to take when engaging an au pair. They should be seen as additional support and should not be left in sole care of children. If, however, I engage a nanny in my home to look after my children while I am at work, my expectations of the nanny would be totally different from those that I would have of an au pair. Unfortunately, a number of families in the UK misguidedly employ au pairs to look after very young children in unsuitable circumstances. They are expected to perform miracles and to take on responsibilities of which they are incapable. In so doing, the whole au pair arrangement is put in jeopardy and that is why I have separated them and babysitters.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to inject one other point into this discussion about different care arrangements. I know that there is nothing that the Minister can do about it, but we need to bear in mind the fact that one of the drives that motivates people to look at different arrangements is whether the jobs that we are talking about are in the formal economy or in the black economy. Whether we like it or not, a lot of child care is provided within the black economy. People who work in and wish to continue to work in the black economy may not be bad child carers but they will seek to avoid registration and controls as that will remove the advantages of working in the black economy.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> That is an interesting point. I am by no means saying that this is simple. I have tabled probing amendments. They have sparked a debate that has raised a number of issues that I hope the Minister and members of the Committee will consider. Perhaps we will return to them as we look at how child care develops.
<P>
One thing is clear, however, about child care: it is the lowest paid, most under-qualified industrial sector. It has a huge turnover. At the same time, we all talk about the family and about how care for our children should be of the highest quality. Many parents are faced with very little choice about the quality of affordable child care. The quality sometimes is not good. It is vital that we generate respect for the people who work in this industry. In some countries, such as Scandinavia and elsewhere, a child care worker has higher status. It should have the status of a nurse or of a teacher. The early care of our children is important. My hon. Friend the Minister is attempting to drive up standards and to create a qualification framework that is inclusive rather than exclusive, but there is the point that we start to take professions seriously only when we regulate them. Too often, child care is seen as work that women can do, and everything will be all right. Other professions, such as nursing, teaching, the law and medicine, have a status because of the seriousness with which we take their regulation and the qualifications within which they work.
<P>
I shall seek to withdraw the amendments, but I hope that they have sparked a debate about how to regulate for people who engage child care in their home. I hope that they have encouraged us to move away from some of the tired old titles that we use for child carers. I find "child minder" an odd title: what does "minding children" mean? I hope that the amendments have also prompted us to reallse that where we are trying to help families on low incomes to work in factories or in workplaces where shift work is part of their life, we are potentially excluding them from receiving the benefits that they need.
<P>
I was interested in what my hon. Friend the Minister said about regulating all night care. I shall discuss with her later what that might mean, but it would be ridiculous if parents took their children to spend the night in someone else's home, because they could not get registered child care in their own home where the children might spend the night. I look forward to discussion of that; I find it interesting to contemplate.
<P>
My views have had a good airing, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 375, in page 32, leave out lines 43 to 46.
<P>
The amendment relates to the issues that the hon. Member for Don Valley raised on the previous group of amendments and further probes baby sitting. In her comments on the previous group of amendments, the Minister sought to suggest that I was inconsistent in identifying the potential aggressiveness of the regime but probing why it was not being extended. The Minister and I have not had the pleasure of engaging in one of these debates before, but the one thing that I like is consistency. When I see inconsistency I become suspicious: is the lack of consistency mere expediency? To be fair, the Minister has been telling us today that there is a measure of expediency involved. She said earlier that we must have limited ambitions and be practical. When we are considering the scope of the Bill, it is important to understand what is excluded because it is difficult or will create other problems, and what is excluded because it is not desirable per se.
<P>
That brings me to amendment No. 375 and to subsection (8) of proposed new section 79A, which the amendment would delete. I have tabled the amendment in order to probe the Government about their intentions. The explanatory notes tell us that the subsection is in order to exclude from the arrangements what are euphemistically called "certain informal arrangements".
<P>
If I have understood the clause correctly--the Minister will correct me if I have not--someone placing their child with a child minder between 4 pm and 6 pm will be covered by the regulations and regime that the Bill implements, but the same person who has not done any child minding that day will not be required to be registered to look after a child between 6 pm and 8 pm.
<P>
Let us go back to basics. What is the Bill about? What is the point of the exercise on which we have embarked? Is it not to prevent children from being abused and from being cared for by unsuitable people? Does the Minister have any evidence that children are abused between 4 pm and 6 pm but not between 6 pm and 8 pm? What on earth is the logic for the 6 pm watershed?
<P>
When I said a few minutes ago that we needed to distinguish between what is excluded on purpose, and what is excluded for expediency because inclusion would be too difficult or create too many problems, the Minister shook her head. I have considerable sympathy for the intention of subsection (8)--to address a practical problem--but if we are not careful, we shall trap within the structure all kinds of early evening baby-sitting arrangements, or "informal arrangements" as the explanatory notes call them.
<P>
By extension, if excluding those arrangements is not undesirable--between 6 pm and 8 pm a child can be cared for by an unregistered, unregulated person--I simply cannot see why it is undesirable for the same child to be cared for by the same person two hours earlier. It does not make any sense, and I look forward to the Minister's explanation of the logic behind the 6 pm watershed. Perhaps she has evidence--risk-assessment data--that she can share with the Committee. She used the word "proportionality" earlier. When we are considering a situation such as this, we must be conscious of the need to deliver a proportionate response to any assessed risk.
<P>
One might argue that the regulatory regime will be justified if one case of potential abuse is avoided, but there are an awful lot of evils in our society and a limited amount of resource available to tackle them. After the terrible Paddington rail disaster in October, I heard the Deputy Prime Minister say on the television that if it cost 1 billion of investment in railway infrastructure to save one life, the investment would be justified. Without doubt, that is wrong. I assure the Minister and members of the Committee that their right hon. and hon. Friends who are charged with running the Department of Health will be able to suggest much more productive ways to spend 1 billion than saving only one life. By investing 1 billion, they will be able to save very many more lives. It is important to consider the rigorous work to assess the different risks of different categories of child care at different times of day and night that informs and underlies the Government's thinking, I hope that the Minister will be able to share that information with us now.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I hope that I can deal with the amendment quickly. Clearly, throughout the Bill--certainly the parts for which I have taken ministerial responsibility--the issue is not always one of consistency, but of judgment. That is probably true of life in general. If one wanted consistency in one's life, one would have to seek a long way. We are constantly making judgments on where it would be appropriate for us to regulate a relationship between a child and a carer. In this instance, we are trying to ensure that we do not regulate baby sitters; it is as simple as that. A baby sitter who cares for a child between 6 pm and 2 am would not be required to go through a regulatory regime. A child minder is highly likely to care for a child for more than two hours during the day; that is when regulation comes in. It is a simple amendment to ensure that baby sitters are excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understood that the amendment was intended to exclude baby sitters, but my understanding of a baby sitter is someone who comes to the parental home to look after a child. My reading of subsection (8) is that it would include the circumstances where a child is taken after 6 pm to be looked after at the house of a baby sitter, who then, to my mind, becomes a child minder. Is that interpretation wrong?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> No, that includes a child who is taken to be looked after at a baby sitter's house. In those circumstances it would be inappropriate to have regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It is rather as I thought. I cannot understand why Mrs. X, looking after child Y between 4 pm and 6 pm is regulated child minding, but Mrs. X looking after child Y between 6 pm and 8 pm is baby sitting, which it would not be appropriate to regulate. The same activity is taking place on the same premises, at slightly different times of day and that different approach seems grossly illogical. The fact that the Government recognise that implementation and over-regulation would create horrendous problems if they tried to tackle individual baby sitting arrangements which, typically and often take place in the early evening should cause the Minister to question what she is doing in the early and late afternoon. Why are baby sitting arrangements in the afternoon different from those in the evening? It is not logical and no case has been adduced to support the distinction the Government seeks to introduce.
<P>
There is no point in my delaying the Committee by seeking to force the amendment to a Division. The purpose behind the amendment is not to exclude the subsection, but to draw attention to this artificial division and, by extension, to the extraordinarily elaborate structure that would have to be created if there was to be any consistency. I cannot see the point of constructing a halfway house, unless the Minister has firmly based, empirical data that suggests that she is targeting the children most at risk.
<P>
I have said that several times, but as yet I have been presented with no evidence that any data has been amassed by the Department as to the scale, nature and type of risk and how it applies to different groups of children. So far I am unimpressed by the logic behind this part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am probably in danger of repeating myself. I know that the Committee is anxious to make progress through this vast array of amendments. Most professional child minders will have care of the children in the hours that will be covered under the regulatory regime. The hon. Gentleman's attempt to find total consistency is misplaced. These issues involve judgment as to where regulation and intervention are appropriate. Most registered child minders look after children in the hours that will be covered; at times when the child is most likely to be asleep, what is involved is purely baby sitting, and a heavy-handed regulatory regime would be inappropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Member for Don Valley in her speech on the last group of amendments highlighted the increasing prevalence of shift work and the need for child care arrangements at all times of the day and night. It does not seem to me that a parent who works a 6 pm to 2 am shift is in a different position in so far as child care arrangements are concerned from one who works from 9 till 5. I see no reason why the child carer in the latter case should be excluded from these arrangements.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): My hon. Friend may not have noticed that there were some nodding heads on the Government Benches while he was speaking. He makes an entirely reasonable point that bears on the Minister's judgment because of this exclusion. Might the way forward not be that if a child is being cared for outside the home, that in itself constitutes a child minding activity? Would that not be a more logical line to draw in the sand, given that, while we sympathise with the babysitting problem, we want something that is workable?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes a sensible point and suggests a logical way of creating the watershed between what is regulated and what is not. She gives me an idea for a possible line to take this further on Report.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Let us go beyond the words to the practicality of what has been proposed by Opposition Members. In the past, when we have been away overnight or come home particularly late, my children have slept overnight elsewhere with somebody to whom I have given some pocket money or something else. To bring that sort of arrangement into a regulatory regime would be blatantly absurd. I find it astonishing that Conservative Members, who, in most instances, are so opposed to regulation--the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred earlier to our intentions as a heavy-handed regime--now want us to start registering every baby sitter that every parent employs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened to what the Minister says and I am not reassured to hear that she does not understand how her own Bill works. The example she has given would indeed be caught by the requirements of regulation. If her children were staying overnight in someone else's home, after 2 am--I take it that she is not in the habit of getting her children up at 1.59 am and transporting them back to the parental home--the person to whom she has paid a little bit of pocket money would be regulated by her own Bill. Therefore the example that she gave does not strike a chord with me.
<P>
What does strike a chord is the suggestion that an informal baby sitter coming into the parental home in the early evening would present a problem that needs to be excluded. Again, the Minister lives in London and will know how difficult it is to be confident about somebody even in that position. I use a baby sitting agency that sends only student nurses. That is not a perfect solution, but it gives some sort of reassurance that the person who comes has a knowledge and understanding of what they are doing, I am not persuaded by the arguments. Along with my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) I noticed some nodding heads on the Government Benches, but I have been discreet in the extreme during the Committee and so long as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) and the Minister are looking in this direction, I have studiously avoided any facial reaction to signals coming from the Government Back Benches. I live in hope that, where our arguments find some resonance among those who are listening and thinking about what is said, an additional channel of quiet persuasion and pressure on Ministers might open up.
<P>
It seems inevitable that, given that there are opportunities for child minding between 6 pm and 2 am, an unintended consequence of what the Minister is doing is that those who are not registered because they are dodgy will switch from offering daytime child minding to evening child minding. That is what I would do if I was a dodgy child minder who thought that I might not pass the registration test. I would simply offer my services in an unregulated sector. The Government need to reconsider the issue and think about the message being sent to parents who work shifts and need child care facilities between 6 pm and 2 am.
<P>
Do the problems that the Minister identified of registering people who care between those hours point to a wider difficulty with the clause's structure? Perhaps the Government could return on Report with a provision more appropriately tailored to the problem, the detail of which we still do not know, because the Minister has not shown us evidence of a problem to which the Bill should respond. Having sparked a debate that I sense worries other hon. Members, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 387, in page 33, line 6, leave out from 'is' to end of line 8 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools in Wales (referred to in this Part as "the Assembly")'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a much simpler probing amendment. Why is the National Assembly for Wales the registration authority for Wales, when the registration authority for England is Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools? It seems more logical that the Welsh registration authority should be Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools in Wales. I see from a newly tabled Government amendment that the title of that august body has changed, so my amendment is technically defective and should refer to Her Majesty's inspectorate of education and training in Wales, but I hope that the Under-Secretary will take the intention at face value and explain the asymmetry--to use a word that I have used before--of the arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I hope that I shall be able to help the hon. Gentleman. The simple question was: why is there a difference? The simple answer is: because of devolution. The agreed policy behind the Bill did not percolate from nowhere. It was part of a range of discussions that the Assembly undertook internally and with the Government.
<P>
The First Secretary of the National Assembly and the cross-party committees dealing with health and pre-16 education examined a range of options for regulating services covered by part V. The Assembly Cabinet and the cross-party committees, comprising Conservative, Plaid Cymru, Liberal and Labour Assembly Members, determined that they supported the model in the Bill.
<P>
The Government discussed the format with them and supported their intention to achieve the objective in the Bill. Widespread consultation on regulation under part V took place throughout Wales with service providers and those involved. The consensus was that the format in the Bill was one that the Assembly, providers and the Government wanted the Committee to support.
<P>
England and Wales will undertake the delivery of regulation differently. I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman by saying that both regulators, the Assembly and Her Majesty's inspectorate for education and training in Wales--ESTYN--will have different but parallel responsibilities for regulating day care, childminding and other services provided to children aged under eight.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> It is fascinating that the Assembly has persuaded the Government that this part of the Bill is about children's social welfare and care, rather than their education. Has the Under-Secretary tried to persuade the Ministers responsible for the English legislation to adopt the same view?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Devolution is devolution. I speak for the Government on Wales. Long discussions have taken place, and the people elected to run child minding and child care facilities in Wales have determined that they want to take the whole-child approach. ESTYN is responsible for education opportunities and the regulation of those services for children in Wales. That is the  form of devolution that has taken place. It is accepted that there are differences with England.
<P>
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. Parallel discussions are taking place between the Assembly's care standards arm, which considers the regulation of child minders and other services, and the education arm. Those discussions will continue. It is hoped that common standards of inspection will be developed across day care and early-years education. There will certainly be a great deal of co-operation between both arms to consider inspection activities generally.
<P>
In addition, the robustness of the regulation and the objectives of England and Wales are intended to achieve similar outcomes. The policy and output objectives are identical. The difference between England and Wales is that the National Assembly has, following widespread consultation, introduced an alternative delivery model, which is suited to staffing needs, the size of Wales and the needs of the sectors to be regulated. It makes more sense for the devolved Administration to introduce that model. With those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the devolved nature of the legislation and am grateful to the Under-Secretary of States for Wales for clarifying the fact that the arrangements for Wales have been agreed across the parties in the Welsh Assembly.
<P>
The issue that bothers me could be summarised by the phrase, "Who watches the watchers?" In England, Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools will be responsible for enforcing part V, and the Secretary of State will be able to make regulations. In Wales, the Assembly will be responsible for enforcing this part, in accordance with regulations made and directions given by the Assembly.
<P>
I can understand why the Under-Secretary, in the first flush of enthusiasm of setting up and running devolved institutions, may not see my concern as valid. However, there is value in the arm's-length relationship that England will have between the Secretary of State and the chief inspector, so that regulations can be laid that will control, limit and steer the chief inspector in carrying out his duties.
<P>
Regulations could be made by the Welsh Assembly and debated by its Members, but the fear is that there will be no need to make regulations or give directions, because there is no arm's-length relationship between separate bodies. Matters will be dealt with internally, because the Assembly is the registration authority. There is something faintly absurd about the notion of the Assembly making regulations to control the registration authority, when the Assembly is that authority. I raised the issue for that reason.
<P>
I am certain that the Under-Secretary and those in the National Assembly who are engaged in the process have good intentions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> May I attempt again to reassure the hon. Gentleman? Regulations made by the Assembly will be debated by it and may be proposed by the Assembly Cabinet, which is part of the Assembly and accountable to it. As with this House, the Assembly Cabinet Member is accountable to the Assembly, which is accountable to people in Wales. Ultimately, the relationship is subject to public scrutiny by elected representatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There is still no separation or arm's-length relationship between the executive function of the registration authority and the legislative function of the Assembly. As I was saying before I gave way to the Under-Secretary, I accept that the intentions are good and I do not imagine that anything ill is afoot here. However, in the fullness of time we, and the people in Wales, may come to see that it might have been better to have the registration authority defined as the body that will carry out the work, with the Assembly in an overseeing role with a clearly defined arm's-length relationship from that body. I have listened carefully to the Under-Secretary and I am grateful to him for what he has said. Having probed the issue, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 279, in page 33, line 16, leave out 'the proximity of' and insert 'regular contact with'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 280 and 284.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> These are so-called technical amendments but they do have an important impact on definitions that enable us to ensure that we better protect the interests of children. When originally writing the Bill we took the wording of the current part X of the Children Act 1989, so the people affected are required to demonstrate that they are fit to be "in the proximity of" children under the age of eight. That was the term that we carried forward. It has become apparent, however, not least because regulators have told us so, that the term "in the proximity of" is somewhat unclear and is interpreted differently throughout the country. We have, therefore, sought to include in the amendment a term that we think will better ensure that we protect children's interests. The more appropriate test of the suitability of someone who works with children is whether someone is in regular contact with them. The three amendments replace the words "in close proximity of" with "in regular contact with".
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not have a problem with the amendments, which the Minister proposes for all the reasons that she has outlined. That seems a sensible step. She mentioned children under the age of eight. May I press her again on the question of supporting evidence for the various watersheds in the Bill? What evidence do the Government have to suggest that children over the age of eight are less vulnerable to abuse and harm than children under the age of eight, which would support a rigorous decision to make eight a watershed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am sorry that I spotted the amendment only this morning and did not have a chance to discuss it with my hon. Friend the Minister. I am concerned about it because the clauses to which the amendments refer are good clauses, which reflect a significant improvement on section 71(10) of the Children Act 1989.
<P>
The Children Act says that a local authority may refuse to register persons as child minders if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any person living, or likely to be living, at the premises. . . is not fit to be in the proximity of children.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I worked for a local authority that had the great good sense to enforce this section with some rigour. On a number of occasions applications from prospective child minders were refused because, following scrutiny of police records, it was found that the husband or partner, or on one occasion an older child, had been involved in quite serious offences that we were concerned would be detrimental to children coming to the premises. That section of the Children Act gave far too much leeway to local authorities that were not perhaps as rigorous as my previous employers. The original construction of the Bill set out a much more positive role for the registration authority, establishing conditions whereby people will be qualified for registration. If every person living or working on premises is suitable to be in proximity of children, that is a significant strengthening of the Children Act and a significant improvement. I am concerned that these are not merely technical amendments and that they could water down what seemed to be a perfectly good part of the Care Standards Bill.
<P>
"Proximity" has much greater strength than "regular contact with". A child minder's partner or husband or even a child minder's wife or child could have a serious record of offending behaviour, in which case one would have significant qualms about registration. It could be argued, however, that that person would not be in regular contact. The term "regular contact" could create a significant loophole in the Bill. I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to think again about what was extremely worthy and worth while yet now seems to be a watering down and a diminution of the protection offered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee but I wish to endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre has said. Having spent six years in child protection, I know that clarity is one of the key issues. Ambiguity on issues such as this makes the job of ensuring that those people who should not have contact with children do not have such contact all the more difficult. I look forward to my hon. Friend's response.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I should like to reassure my hon. Friends the Members for Lancaster and Wyre and for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw). The purpose meets entirely what they would wish. The advice that we have received from those who are responsible for regulating under the current definition is that first, it is not specific enough and is interpreted differently in different parts of the country; and, secondly, that it is too loose and that the definition that we are now proposing will be stricter and will protect the interests of children.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised the question of the age of eight. I was not quite sure why the age of eight was accepted, but presumably the previous Government were happy with it because it underpinned all the legislation and regulations on the protection of children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Would the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to give my thoughts on the matter? At about the age of eight, children start to play more independently and take more responsibility for their own lives and their own environment. It may also be the point at which they enter a different phase at school. At about eight, however, children probably have an element of judgment themselves about the nature of care and their carer, and they can articulate that more sensibly with their parents or with those who have responsibility for their care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am touched by the Under-Secretary's faith in everything that the previous Government did and by the fact that she is prepared to pick up an age from previous legislation without question. She has never met my three-year-old, who is capable of articulating a view on anybody who has been caring for her in any circumstances in the most specific and not always printable terms. The Under-Secretary gave us a perfectly plausible opinion on why eight might be the right age. I asked whether, in preparing the Bill, the Department had done any rigorous work on instances of child abuse to see which groups of children are most vulnerable in order to target the provisions on them, rather than--and at the risk of irritating the hon. Lady I will say it again--on the groups that are easiest to regulate and control, without making waves elsewhere with babysitters and so on. I have not yet heard anything that persuades me that there is such evidence.
<P>
Over the past couple of years, those of who served on, for example, the Protection of Children Bill in Committee--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that this is an intervention, not a speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I apologise. I thought that the Minister had finished. I shall sit down and seek to catch your eye, Mr. Gale, in a moment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I will write to the hon. Gentleman to see what evidence there is about how the age of eight emerged as the appropriate one. I assume that it results from research over the years--not all children are like his.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I should be most grateftil if my hon. Friend would also write to me, giving some reasons for the changes previously referred to. Frankly, I think that the advice that she has been given is wrong. My understanding of "proximity" means that anyone who has any contact with a household is affected and I have not the faintest clue what "regular" means in this context--it covers a multitude of sins. The amendment presents significant dangers to children and opportunities for people who would harm them. I should like to see the evidence.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> That is certainly not the intention of this technical amendment. I shall be happy to write to my hon. Friend to reassure him on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I apologise; I really did think that the Minister had finished speaking and I was responding to her point. In relation to what she says about the age of eight, I am grateful to her for offering to write to me to share whatever data are available.
<P>
The point I was about to make when you, Mr. Gale, wisely silenced me was that in the course of scrutinising the Protection of Children Bill, we heard harrowing stories of abuse of children. It is not apparent to me, as a non-expert, that children under eight are necessarily more vulnerable than those over eight to the people who prey upon them. No doubt different groups are vulnerable to different predators, but it is not immediately obvious that a cut-off at eight has any logic behind it. I look forward to seeing what the Minister will send to me.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 392, in page 33, line 30, leave out 'and every prescribed person'.
<P>
The amendment would excise the words "and every prescribed person" from proposed new section 79B(4)(a). The amendment aims to probe the Minister about who exactly she expects to prescribe. According to subsection (4), a person is qualified for registration for providing day care on particular premises if every person looking after children on the premises is suitable to look after children under the age of eight. I do not understand who, in addition to that category, the Minister might wish to prescribe. It therefore seems on the face of it that this is likely to be a redundant subsection--in the grammatical sense rather than the drafting sense. If the Minister argues that it is necessary, will she give the Committee an idea of the classes of person that she expects to prescribe under the provision in subsection (4)(a)?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> To deal quickly with the amendment, the Opposition have a point and I understand the concerns that they have raised. If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, I shall reconsider the matter and return to it at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and I look forward to hearing what she intends to do. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made, No. 280, in page 33, line 33, leave out 'the proximity of' and insert 'regular contact with'.
<P>
12.30 pm
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 281, in page 34, leave out lines 1 and 2.
<P>
The amendment deletes a defective definition of "care" that was inserted in an attempt to meet a minor concern that, on occasion, regulators are unclear as to whether certain services should be regulated under part X of the Children Act. The definition would not have resolved the lack of clarity and would have introduced new ambiguities.
<P>
For instance, it is possible to interpret the legislation as it stands in such a way that any service offering even the slightest element of care would fall to be regulated. Services offered in places such as cinemas or swimming baths might have been subject to child care regulation. It has not proved possible to devise a suitable definition that would be unambiguous in interpretation. We have therefore decided to leave the position as at present so that it will be for the regulator to take a sensible and practical approach and to make a judgment to determine whether a service should be regulated under part XA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has done right in moving an amendment to eliminate the definition in subsection (6) of proposed new section 79B. We had a similar debate during the passage of the Protection of Children Act 1999. I remember quoting the example of an assistant in a toy shop who could unintentionally have been caught by the definition because they would inevitably have regular contact with children in the course of their employment.
<P>
Given that we have had this debate before and the obvious problem with the breadth of the definition, and although it has now been corrected, how did it get into the Bill in the first place? We go through the process of scrutinising Bills, but we work from an assumption that there has been a major process in the Departments to ensure that we are not creating more problems than we are resolving. Does the Minister agree that this should not have slipped through the pre-legislative departmental net?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The definition was put to us by the regulators, but when those responsible for drafting the Bill reflected on it, the new anomalies became apparent. The hon. Gentleman should be grateful, as I am, that we caught them at this point, before they reached the statute book.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 282, in page 34, line 5, after 'includes' insert 'any area and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 393, in page 34, line 5, after 'includes', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'land within the curtilage of any premises and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 285 and 288 to 290.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I hope that when the Opposition have heard my explanation of the amendments, they will reflect that it is unnecessary to pursue amendment No. 393).
<P>
Amendment No. 282 clarifies the definition of premises, which was taken from part X of the Children Act 1989. It puts beyond doubt the fact that the premises that fall to be regulated include not only the building in which child care takes place, but the area in which child care is provided, such as a garden, a play area or open land. The effect of the amendment is the same as that of Opposition amendment No. 393.
<P>
Amendment No. 285 deals with the regulations that may be made under proposed new section 79C to govern the activities of registered providers. Subsection (3) itemises some of the matters that the regulations may deal with, including, in subsection (3)(e):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the maintenance and safety of premises and equipment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A similar provision is in part X of the Children Act. It is only right that the regulations should guide providers in such important aspects of their services.
<P>
It is essential that children's safety and well-being are at the forefront of the regulatory system. The amendment will ensure that aim by making it clear that providers and regulators should be concerned about not only the safety of premises and equipment, but its appropriateness to the setting. For instance, a climbing frame might be safe, but totally inappropriate for babies and toddlers, who could injure themselves if they were allowed to play on it. The amendment will allow the regulations to deal with such a situation.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 288 to 290 cover the circumstances in which the registration authority may not cancel a provider's registration. The relevant provisions were taken from part X of the Children Act and replicated in proposed new section 79G(2). The intention of the amendments is to afford providers additional protection against unnecessary cancellation of their registration.
<P>
Subsection (2) provides some protection as it stands. The registration authority may not cancel a provider's registration on the grounds that the premises are unsuitable for child care when the provider is still within the time limit for making an alteration. However, it has been pointed out that that does not cover all the situations in which it might be reasonable to allow the provider time to put right an unsuitable element of the service before the registration was cancelled.
<P>
For example, a provider might have to arrange for concrete to be dug up to remove a piece of unsuitable equipment, such as the climbing frame to which I referred. It is not right that a provider's registration could be cancelled before she has had time to take steps to remove the offending equipment. The amendments offer a straightforward solution to that dilemma.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall deal first with Government amendments Nos. 288 to 290. I understand the case that the Minister put. In my notes, I called that the yellow card procedure. It seems eminently sensible that the inspector can come in, identify something amiss, show providers the yellow card, then give them reasonable time to put the problem right, during which they will not suffer the extreme sanction of deregistration.
<P>
However, I am afraid that I must ask the Minister why no similar procedure is available elsewhere in the Bill to deal with other matters that might lead to deregistration. Why is a sensible procedure for child minders not sensible for other providers? The provisions for which the Minister is responsible are more sensible, fairer, and less likely to cause friction than those in other parts of the Bill. Her provisions actively invite providers to co-operate with inspectors and invite inspectors to engage positively by identifying improvements in the knowledge that making such suggestions will not lead to immediate and draconian sanctions on the provider.
<P>
The Minister rightly said that both Government amendment No. 282 and my amendment No. 393 were directed at correcting the same omission. To put it in ordinary language, they would ensure that children were covered when they were playing in the garden, as well as when they were in the house. The phrase "domestic premises" is insufficiently clear to cover all eventualities.
<P>
If the Minister will indulge me for a moment, I am not persuaded that her amendment is better than mine, because her amendment goes too far. It will make the subsection say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Domestic premises" means any premises which are wholly or mainly used as a private dwelling and "premises" includes any area and any vehicle.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unlike my amendment, amendment No. 282 does not mention any area within the curtilage of the domestic dwelling. It does not deal also with any vehicle on the premises. I understand why "any vehicle" is left undefined. One does not want to allow people to run a playgroup or child-minding activity in a bus that continually circulates the locality to avoid regulation.
<P>
However, surely we do not want to leave the phrase "any area" undefined. Does that mean any area owned by the same person, any nearby area, or any that is in the same county? I am not being facetious, but the wording is open-ended, and the terminology used in amendment No. 393 would deal with the problem nicely. Perhaps the Minister will reflect on whether her amendment is tight enough.
<P>
I have a separate question about the point at which a child-minding activity becomes a day-care activity. The question occurred to me while I considered the clause and the question of an area outside the premises but within the curtilage. There is little doubt about child-care activity that takes place largely in the home, even if the children play in the garden when it is sunny, but what about larger premises, such as a farmhouse with an outbuilding converted for the child-minding activity? Does that constitute child minding on domestic premises or day care on non-domestic premises? I suspect that the answer lies elsewhere, such as in planning legislation, in which the limit of a domestic curtilage is defined, and in which individual buildings in a group of buildings might be properly defined as domestic or non-domestic. I invite the Minister to follow the logic of a need for terminology that relates to the curtilage of the domestic premises in defining what is caught by the scope of the new section.
<P>
If the Minister is persuaded that there are issues to be addressed, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment so that she and her officials can look at it in detail to see what needs to be done.

<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I was hoping to persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For clarification, at present the amendment has not been moved.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> In that case, the amendments that have been tabled by the Government are appropriate and will deal with the circumstances covered by the Opposition's amendments.
<P>
In our view, we do not need to refer to curtilage. If the vehicle or area is used as a private dwelling, it will come under the definition in the Bill. Curtilage does not add to that. As to whether an additional building on a farm would be defined as a domestic premises or not, and how that would impinge on the definition of child minding or day care, I am advised that the answer lies in how the building is used. If an outbuilding is fully part of domestic premises--in other words, a private dwelling--it will be defined as child minding; otherwise it will not.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made, No. 284, in page 34, line 28, leave out 'the proximity of' and insert 'regular contact with'.
<P>
No. 285, in page 34, line 34, leave out 'and safety' and insert ', safety and suitability'.--[Ms. Hodge.]
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 286, in page 35, line 45, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(b) give any other information which the registration authority reasonably requires the applicant to give.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At present, anyone at the time of applying to be registered as a child minder or day care provider is required to give the registration authority prescribed information about prescribed matters. In general, Ofsted, as the registration authority, will need to request standard information from people applying to become registered child minders or day care providers in order to reach an informed view about whether they are qualified to be registered.
<P>
However, it is important that Ofsted is not restricted by the legislation to obtain only information that is prescribed. In individual cases, Ofsted may need on occasion to ask the applicant to provide additional information.
<P>
The condition that any additional information must be "reasonable" ensures that anyone concerned that this may intrude into personal matters unnecessarily may be assured that an unreasonable request could be challenged.
<P>
The amendment would bring the registration process under clause 68 into line with applications for registration with the National Care Standards Commission under clause 11(2)(b). As a consequence of the amendment, Ofsted will be able to make decisions on an applicant's suitability on the basis of complete information on every occasion. This is consistent with the primary aim to ensure that standards of child protection are maintained and improved by the existence of a robust and thorough registration procedure.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> It would be extremely helpful at this stage if the Minister told us who would be the judge of reasonableness. Would that be left to the appeals stage, should an application be refused?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> That would be a matter for the appeal mechanism.
<P>
I hope that the amendments will contribute to ensuring that better decisions are made about who should be registered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I might be about to be shot down in flames, but I have stood here many times and been told that the amendments that I have tabled are technically defective. Generally, I have accepted that with good grace, but it might be my turn to point such things out. I see that amendment No. 286 starts with a letter (b), but there is no paragraph (a) and I am not aware that any amendment has been tabled to insert one. It has been practice elsewhere, where the enumeration of clauses has changed, to include in the amendments the necessary additions to the text. In tabling my amendments, I have tried to do that consistently, although it is difficult. I hope that the Minister will not mind me having my moment in the sun by challenging her on the technical correctness of the amendment.
<P>
Turning to the more substantive point, the Minister may know, having looked at previous debates in Committee, that we have objected to the Government seeking to extend the requirement to provide information prior to registration beyond that which is prescribed in regulations. The amendment is a dreadful example of trying to have one's cake and eat it. The regulations, after all, will be made by the Minister. She can prescribe whatever she likes, and assuming that she does so while the parliamentary arithmetic remains as it is at present, she will have no difficulty in imposing it. Not content with the ability to prescribe by regulation any information prior to registration, she wants the registration authority to be given any additional information that it wants.
<P>
That might seem sensible or practical, but although the registration authority is a single body, its work will not be carried out by one person. There will be dozens, in fact, given the scope of the Bill, hundreds of people applying the regulations. The danger with allowing information to be sought beyond that which is prescribed, is that, to put it crudely, not every applicant will get the same application form. Some people in some areas will be asked for information for which other people in other areas, dealt with by different officials, will not be asked. If we are to have a relatively intrusive system of registration, we need to ensure that it is at least transparent and even-handed across the country.
<P>
It would be a far superior arrangement to require the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment to go that extra mile, to prescribe in regulations, so that under the Bill and through regulation the registration authority has the power that it needs, than to provide a blanket power to require additional information, which would render subsection (2) redundant. There is no point in making regulations if the registration authority has the power to ask for any information. We might as well abandon the regulations altogether and let the registration officials in each area make their own decisions.
<P>
I urge the Under-Secretary to reconsider and to ask herself whether such extra powers are necessary, given the wide-ranging powers already under proposed new section 79E(2).
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am extremely worried about the amendment. I had hoped that the Care Standards Bill would give us consistency in registration. The amendment would allow any individual official in discussion with an applicant to explore questions of whatever nature. The reasonableness of the question cannot be tested until there is a formal tribunal, when presumably everything will be reined back in again. That will create incredible tensions between inspectorates and those to be inspected. From the record of Ofsted, that is clearly happening in some circumstances now. We hear from some schools that inspections have been extraordinarily intrusive and that inspectors who had no right to do so explored the private life of staff.
<P>
The amendment sets a framework that would allow inspectors to explore things that are none of their business, but they would be challenged only when the damage had been done. Why cannot the Minister set out very strictly in regulations the framework around which inquiries can be made, and what information an applicant has to give? In applying for a position, an applicant needs to know what is being tested in that application and that no extraneous matters--as the applicant sees it--will suddenly be introduced. It is the definition of "reasonableness" with which I have difficulty. Ultimately, the test of reasonableness is for a tribunal system. Presumably, we will have to wait until there is a lot of case law before we can establish what is reasonable.
<P>
It is not too much to ask of Ministers to try to define what is reasonable through regulation. If they get it wrong, they can change the regulations. I would not be happy to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I understand that the technical matter to which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred will be covered when the Bill is re-printed, so no amendment is required.
<P>
I am getting to know the hon. Member for Isle of Wight rather better as we discuss these clauses. I now understand that he deals in absolutes in everything. As in this instance, he wants absolute regulations that cover every eventuality. We have to remember what we are concerned about. We are trying to establish--
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> We are seeking absolute limits, not absolute regulations. This is a coach and horses amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We are seeking to ensure the safety of our children and the suitability of those persons in whose care they are left. Clearly, the regulations will cover most eventualities. For the first time ever we will have national, instead of 150 different, regulations and they will be as transparent and even-handed as possible. Where the safety and well-being of children is concerned, however, there may be an instance when an inspector, who will be registered and qualified, will need to return to ask further questions of the applicant. We need flexibility in the regime to enable that to occur. The test of reasonableness is in itself a safety net to ensure that intrusive questions are not asked of those who apply for registration. Such a test of reasonableness will ensure that the the framework operates appropriately and that children are safe.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> This is getting more and more interesting. Will the Minister tell us whether she will try to define in regulations what is reasonable and what is not reasonable? There may be areas in the reasonableness test that will be specifically excluded from some of the investigations. The amendment is an attempt to take the 
 extra powers of an inquisition. I cannot imagine a scenario in which such powers would be required that could not be defined by regulations. It shows the poor confidence of the Minister and her officials that she feels that she cannot draft an appropriate set of regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that at its extreme the amendment is unnecessary because it would be possible for the regulations to include the very power that the Government are seeking to put on the face of the Bill if they persisted in believing that that was necessary?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am sure that the Government will have the power to do so, because it is clear that regulations can alter the thrust of the Bill quite considerably. I would not welcome their doing that in a way that was not open and clear. I cannot see the need for the amendment. If regulations are shown to be imperfect through case law, the regulations can be changed. To have this on the face of the Bill would give an individual inspector, coping with an inspection--
