<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I beg to move amendment No. 389, in page 61, line 26, leave out from second `area' to end of line 32 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The scheme proposed shall implement the policies set out in the authority's current integrated transport strategy in the area to which the proposed scheme relates in a way that will enhance the benefits brought to persons using those services, and can demonstrate effects which are environmentally beneficial.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 575 and 576.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> May I welcome you back after the brief recess, Mr. Gale, and say how much we shall continue to enjoy your chairmanship. We were praising the diligence of the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) at our previous sitting, who turned up on the day after his wedding. We note that he is now the only hon. Member on the Conservative Benches and one may draw whatever conclusions one wishes. Again, his diligence is demonstrated and we certainly welcome him back to the Committee.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) would have been anxious to support me in moving the amendment, but he presents his apologies to the Committee. A rather historic meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee is taking place this morning. He will, perhaps, join us later.
<P>
I am sure that the Committee is anxious to make progress. Therefore, I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 389. We are moving into the realm of quality contracts. The Under-Secretary will no doubt give his usual tour of the horizon about those contracts. It is an important part of the Bill. Quality contracts are clearly intended for use if there is a difficulty at local authority level in introducing a quality partnership. They are a last-ditch attempt to put together a series of services that will deliver the local transport plan and bus plans of the local authority.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that there is a clear mission statement for a quality contract. It suggests that that statement should effectively include two key components. The first will ensure that the quality contract will enhance the benefits brought to persons using those services. No doubt, that refers to clean, quiet, well-designed, modern buses with good access for the disabled, easy access for passengers with young children, cyclists and other matters. It will also mean that the services will meet the needs of the passengers rather than of the operators, including good passenger information.
<P>
The second component of the mission statement is that the contract should demonstrate effects that are environmentally beneficial. All members of the Committee would agree that the purpose of the quality contract must be to meet those two prime objectives: benefits to the travelling public in an environmentally beneficial way. That is the essence of the amendment.
<P>
The Under-Secretary may say that the amendment deletes some aspects of the clause, including the requirement for the local authority to demonstrate that it needs to move to a quality contract because it cannot provide bus services by any other means. If that is in his mind, I ask him to look at clause 104(2) which provides the very guarantees that he may feel are appropriate—and so do I—which are that appropriate consultation must take place with all of the interested parties before a quality contract can be introduced, and that approval must be gained from the appropriate national authority.
<P>
I see no down side. I see an enormous benefit in the clear statement that the purpose of a quality contract must be to ensure those two key features: improved benefits to the travelling public and improvements in the environment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> Ministers, too, are delighted to be here, Mr. Gale, freshly invigorated and looking forward to the continuation of your benign and excellent—and any other adulatory phrase—chairmanship of the Committee.
<P>
I fear that I must disappoint the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). There will be no tour of the horizon on this occasion—not even a tour of the network in my guided bus. I have already carried out a circumnavigation for earlier clauses and I do not propose to repeat that exercise. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining the amendment. The Government cannot support it. However, we are tabling an amendment of our own, which I hope that he will recognise as a response to the spirit of what he is saying.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman acknowledges, the amendment significantly modifies the tests that a local authority must satisfy in bringing forward a quality contracts scheme. The current tests are admittedly strict. The authority must be satisfied that the scheme is the only way in which it is able to implement the policies in its bus strategy. It must be satisfied that the scheme will implement those policies in a way that is ``economic, efficient and effective''—that is, in effect, a best-value test.
<P>
The amendment would import different tests, not unlike those set out in clause 96 of the Bill for quality partnership schemes. There would no longer be the strict ``only way'' test, and a quality contracts scheme could be made so long as it implemented policies in a way that would enhance the benefits to persons using the bus services and demonstrate environmental benefits.
<P>
I rest my argument on the point of principle. The Bill deliberately sets a stricter test for quality contract schemes than for quality partnership schemes. Quality contracts are a step change in local arrangements for buses. They are a radical departure from the present system whereby operators have considerable scope for decision, subject to the proper registration and operator licensing requirements. It is entirely right that local authorities should have to satisfy a stricter test before bringing forward quality contracts. Those contracts are different from quality partnerships. Quality contracts would confer significant new powers on the authority. At the same time, they confer a local monopoly on the operator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way so early in his speech. Will he reiterate for the benefit of the Committee—particularly for those who missed the earlier part of his speech—that the quality contracts the are in fact an admission of failure to reach agreement between operators and the local council under the quality partnership scheme, and are a last resort so far as the future provision of bus services is concerned?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My hon. Friend is right. They are a last resort, and it is precisely because they are that the Government are proposing such a high threshold before that point is achieved. I note his observations on the late arrival of a certain member of the Opposition. Yesterday I was harrying the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) in his lair in the Dengie peninsular—a beautiful part of Essex. I can understand that he needed to stay at home to repair some of the damage that he suffered in his back yard.
<P>
I agree that the Bill as drafted establishes a strict test. I have explained the thinking behind it, but have also listened carefully to hon. Members' arguments and to other representations that have been made. It has been suggested, for example, that there might be occasions when an alternative option would be available to the local authority, but at considerably greater expense. In such case, it should be open to the authority to argue in favour of a quality contracts scheme. I am sympathetic to that line of argument, which is why we have tabled amendments Nos. 575 and 576 to introduce the concept of practicability. There is no mystery about ``practicability'': it equates with what is reasonably practical—that is, where it is suggested that it will be necessary to consider the practicalities of carrying out the bus strategy via a quality contract, simply as a more reasonable means of achieving that end.
<P>
The amendments are a real and deliberate relaxation of the text of the Bill because we acknowledge that the original wording was too stringent, making it unduly difficult to make the case for a quality contract We have run the proposal by the Local Government Association and our impression was that it was content with the suggested amendment. On that basis, taking account of this definite shift in the wording away from the absolute, the unqualified and the ``only's'', I hope that the hon. Member for Bath will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): I welcome the Government amendments, as do many of the transport authorities. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the Government are still considering pilot schemes with quality contracts in areas where they are seen to be necessary straightaway?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I can confirm that we are considering pilot schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging that in the original drafting of the Bill the test required to be met by a local authority moving to a quality contract was too strict. As he knows, numerous representations have been made about the issue. The vast majority of those who have made representations will welcome the modification that the Minister suggests, as I do.
<P>
My concerns about quality and the environment, however, remain. The term ``quality contracts'', is part of the title of the clause. The tests of ``best value'', ``economic'', ``efficient'' and ``effective'', do not necessarily ensure quality. In moving my amendment, I sought to persuade the Minister to ensure that the test included a reference to the word ``quality'', which I suggested would best be judged by the benefits being brought to the travelling public. Nevertheless, I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the need to change this part of the Bill, especially the strict test that was imposed.
<P>
I was surprised to hear that the Minister has been beating up the hon. Member for North Essex. As he is a strong character, we shall hear him defend himself on subsequent amendments.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 594, in page 61, line 41, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, the standards to which they should be provided'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 595.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> These amendments make it clear that a local transport authority can determine fares as part of a quality contracts scheme. That has always been the policy intention, but doubts had been raised because clause 104 did not mention fares.
<P>
Amendment No. 595 adds a reference to fares in subsection 2(4)(b), alongside ``frequency'' and ``standard of service''. Amendment No. 594 makes a consequential tidying up of the drafting of subsection (3)(a).
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 390, in page 62, line 5, leave out `another person' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`other persons'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 19, in page 62, line 5, leave out `exclusive'.
<P>
No. 449, in page 62, line 5, after `exclusive', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or shared'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Clause 104(9) states explicitly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In considering whether to make a quality contracts scheme, a local transport authority must have regard to the desirability, in appropriate cases, of making a scheme jointly with another authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is reflected clearly in the opening words of clause 104, which explicitly state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A local transport authority, or two or more such authorities acting jointly, may make a quality contracts scheme . . .<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear in the Bill that where ``authority'' applies, if there is an intention that more than one authority is to be referred to, reference has to be made to that. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A local transport authority, or two or more such authorities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, when we come to the other side of the quality contract, in which there are clearly two partners, we see reference to ``another person'' in the singular, with no reference at any point in the Bill to ``or persons'', ``other persons'' or any form of plurality.
<P>
Clearly, in developing a quality contract, a local authority or local authorities may wish to include more than one operator. The amendment would simply ensure that the Bill contains a reference to the plurality of operators or other persons who may be on the service delivery side of the proposed contract. I suspect that the Minister's answer will be that, like ``man ``embracing the female, ``another person'' includes ``other persons''. It would be helpful if the Minister would confirm that that is so, so that it is on the record. Will he also explain why it is necessary to refer to the plurality of authorities? Why could not ``an authority'' embrace ``authorities''? There seems to be an inconsistency. I look forward to the Minister's explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 19. By and large, we Conservative Members believe in competition. For all its faults, competition is the best way to deliver services to the public. With quality contracts, we are heading back towards monopoly provision. We do not believe that long-term monopoly provision is the best way to provide local services, especially those that have to be responsive to local transport demand.
<P>
In principle, we do not want monopoly provision back in bus operations.
<P>
I was pleased with the intervention of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape), who said that quality partnerships have to be the key and that quality contractors are an admission of failure. One would hope that this section of the Bill will be used sparingly, but if it is not we may end up with a more bureaucratic monopolistic system. Partnerships could be squeezed out if local authorities use the powers in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I apologise for arriving a little late, but I do not think that I missed any of the essential truth of the Under-Secretary's comments. We know what he is about and amendment No. 19 goes to the crux of the matter. This chapter of the Bill is premised on the assumption that bus deregulation and the reintroduction of competition have failed the customer and that there is less bus provision as a result. That is the popular mythology, but it is not supported by the facts.
<P>
Bus ridership has been in permanent decline since the second world war, and even before that. The number of passengers lost between 1950 and 1970—when there was a regulated monopoly under the Road Traffic Act 1930—was 7,758,000 which is an average of 2.4 per cent. a year during that period. Between 1970–74, after the introduction of the Transport Act 1968, with the formation of the National Bus Company, the Scottish Bus Group and passenger transport executives the rate of decline slowed to 1.5 per cent. a year and between 1974 and deregulation in 1985–86, it continued at 1.2 per cent.
<P>
After deregulation and abolition of monopolies in the bus industry, the rate of decline slowed to 0.7 per cent. a year. Between 1990–94, as the newly privatised, industry matured and became more competitive and efficient, the rate of decline slowed even further to less than 0.3 per cent. a year. The picture that is popularly drawn by the old socialists on the Labour Benches of the halcyon days of bus transport during nationalisation and monopoly and the catastrophic decline since privatisation and deregulation is not borne out by the fact that loss of passengers has slowed considerably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, since deregulation, the decline outside London has continued unabated and that in London, where there is still considerable regulation, there has been a growth in patronage? Whilst accepting the longer-term trends owing to car ownership, that provides us with a controlled experiment and it is clear that a partnership arrangement will generate more patronage, contrary to what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's language. He referred to a partnership arrangement and we do not oppose that. We shall be interested in how the quality partnerships develop and there may be scope to build on them. We doubt whether it is necessary to put them in statutory form, but that is part of the gesture politics of the new Labour party to keep the old Labour party happy. I am open minded on the question of partnerships.
<P>
It is not a particularly strong academic analysis to single out London and decide that the absolutely decisive factor in the maintenance of ridership in London is that full deregulation did not take place. One cannot possibly draw that conclusion. That is the gut reaction of an old Labour party politician who likes the idea of state control and is still attracted to regulation. Many other factors affect bus ridership in London, not least the fact that every mode of transport is at full capacity. The tube is packed to the gunwales, the roads are at saturation point and it is hardly surprising that people resort to buses when there is spare capacity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman's thesis was that deregulation in itself had reduced the rate of decline of bus patronage. My point was simply that where full deregulation has not taken place, the number of passengers has increased. That blows a hole in his thesis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> One should not choose London—where, exceptionally, 50 per cent. of the work force travel to work by public transport—as the building block of an argument ignoring all other factors. I am considering the generality of bus transport, where the rate of decline slowed. The hon. Gentleman can see the figures for himself in the Library. Bus ridership is declining because more and more people, particularly in rural areas, own or have access to cars, but other services such as community transport or dial-a-ride, are developing to fulfil the needs that scheduled buses used to provide.
<P>
How will the new monopoly powers be used? Will they be used on the most marginal routes, where there may be a case for protecting a new service for a limited period while it builds up its ridership? If they are used where there are established services to go back to a state-controlled, state-planned, state-timetabled bus service, that is unlikely to serve the interests of passengers best.
<P>
Another feature of deregulation has been the relationship between vehicle kilometres travelled by bus services and public subsidy. In 1984–85 there were 2.1 billion miles of bus services with a public subsidy of £974 million. The little announcement that the Minister made in the Dengie yesterday morning pales into insignificance compared with the vast public support that the previous Conservative Government gave to the monopoly bus services. The hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) swoons in astonishment. It is amazing how the facts have passed him by.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): If that information is fact, why were the villages within the hon. Gentleman's constituency isolated and starved of the services that they now have that allow them to travel for work or leisure, following the subsidy that we gave to Essex county council?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I fully support the objective of providing mobility to all in rural areas. The Minister is busily waving a headline, but £100 million for buses is all mouth and no delivery. I will tell him why I said that: it is because the service that the Minister was serenading in the Dengie yesterday has attracted the most phenomenal quantity of complaints. The amount invested in the service is out of all proportion to the number of passengers being carried. For some reason, the Minister approved the service with only seven-seater buses, and when they are full they drive past the people waiting at the roadside. They do not fulfil the need that they were advertised to fulfil.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
They take elderly and infirm people shopping in the town of Maldon. When they are full on the return journey, the elderly have to wait at the bus stop for two hours until they can go home. That deters people from using the service. The real question I raise in the article is relevant to the amendment. That service is not a monopoly, and I do not see how it would benefit if it were a monopoly, because it operates in a very isolated area where there is no prospect of competition. However, funnily enough, the Dengie bus is actually driving out of business a privately-operated service, the Friday shopping bus, which drives into Burnham.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Although this is not my area, the hon. Gentleman has just described a service that was not there before, which has given a service to a percentage of those people who had no service. Would his party take that service away?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am happy to discuss that, but I am not sure that it is totally relevant to the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The answer to that is that it is marginally relevant, but I should be grateful if we could get back to the amendment. I have been monitoring what is a conversation rather than a debate very carefully, and we are beginning to stray outside the bounds of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> To answer that point briefly, I would allow councils such as Essex council much more flexibility on how they spend their money supporting transport in rural areas. That is where the amendment misses the point. It lays all the emphasis on bus services, with nothing for community transport and dial-a-ride schemes. Just a fraction of the money spent on the Dengie village link bus would be manna from heaven to the voluntary services and the volunteer drivers who provide services at much lower cost to the people who need them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that those services that are now servicing his villages provide a better quality of transport for each constituent than was available prior to that subsidy being given to Essex county council? Yes or no?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I give the Government three out of 10. The aspiration is laudable, but the delivery achieved for the money spent is pretty poor. I believe that a Conservative Government would do better with that money for transport in rural areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> You never spent it!
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We spent £974 million on bus services in 1984–85, but got only 2.1 billion miles of bus passenger transport. As a result of deregulation, the public subsidy was down to £280 million by 1994–95, yet we got 2.7 billion bus passenger miles in services. There was much less subsidy, much more service. The fact that the ridership continued to decline is a structural factor. We have to accept that more people own cars or have access to cars, therefore more people will avail themselves of the convenience of the car. The idea that the reimposition of monopolies through the clause will reverse the decline of bus passenger transport is pie in the sky.
<P>
The opportunity to reverse the decline in bus transport exists in major conurbations, such as London. I return to the point raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies). London and other major conurbations are exceptional, because demand for transport in the major conurbations continues to increase. There must be opportunities for bus companies to provide improved, more efficient and more plentiful services. That is what I believe would be achieved by bus quality contracts with competition maintained, but there is no evidence to suggest that the reimposition of monopolies would improve the efficiency of services, the answerability of services to their customers, or the frequency of services. If the Government had accepted our amendment on bus quality partnerships to allow a local transport authority to specify the frequency of services, we could have cracked the nut much more effectively than by going back to the old, failed monopolies of the 1950s.
<P>
This is a throwback to real old socialism. It is the right hon. Member for Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) in full flow, harking back to the halcyon days of George Brown and the national plan. What we have heard from the Government on bus quality contracts is that they are wary of using the provisions in all but the most rare circumstances. As we shall discuss later, there are all sorts of complex competition issues left unresolved in the Bill. It will be a power of last resort that is hardly used, if ever, but it will go into the Bill to satisfy the cravings of the old socialists on the Government Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to have moved in a few short minutes from the position that deregulation is good to a position that regulation in conurbations is a good idea and deregulation elsewhere with targeted subsidy is also good. His philosophy appears to have shifted enormously towards ours. I urge him to carry on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is living in a fantasy world if he believes that I have suddenly changed my mind on deregulation. The figures show clearly that the decline in bus usage slowed down considerably as a result of deregulation. Any widespread reimposition of bus monopolies would lead to an increase in inefficiency and cost. It is cost above all else that drives bus passengers away from using the services. Efficiency must be maintained, and the way to maintain efficiency is to maintain competition. All the rows that the Minister has been having with the Department of Trade and Industry about whether the Competition Commission will continue to have a role in regulation of buses if monopolies are reimposed would disappear if he removed the word ``exclusive''. All his problems would be solved, although a few Back Benchers might moan about it.
<P>
If the provision is intended as a power of last resort, will it be used in areas where services are already running? Will it be used where no services are running? Or will it be used where only one operator is running? Where will the monopoly powers be reimposed? Will it be on a route-by-route basis? Could a transport authority reimpose monopolies and controls over the whole of its area? Will the Minister explain how he imagines the powers would be used, the circumstances in which the Government might approve their being used, and how such exclusive powers would be ceased in the event that it became apparent that competition was required in order to reinvigorate a service that had been dulled by monopoly powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall be brief. In our view, amendments Nos. 390 and 449 have no practical effect. The hon. Member for Bath is right. It is well understood that in the statute references to the singular include the plural. Therefore, when clause 104 speaks of granting to ``another person'' the exclusive right to operate local services, it does not prevent a local authority from letting a series of quality contract contracts or letting a quality contract contract to a consortium including a number of different operators. The point is simply that bus operators at large would no longer be able to operate within a quality contract area unless they were party to the quality contract contract. To that extent, any operator under a quality contracts scheme enjoys exclusivity as far as his particular contract is concerned. The amendment would achieve nothing that is not already provided for in the Bill.
<P>
On the apparent contradiction to which the hon. Member for Bath alluded, ``authority'' covers the making by a single authority and ``authorities'' covers joint schemes. It is a drafting technique to make it clear that both types of schemes are covered. I hope that is helpful to the hon. Gentleman. As he desired, I have placed that on the record.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Poole explained, amendment No. 19 would amend the concept of a quality contracts scheme under the Bill. As drafted, the Bill is based on the principle that once a quality contracts scheme is in operation, local bus services can be provided within the area of the scheme only if they are within the terms of the quality contract. Thus, clause 104(4)(a) refers to an ``exclusive'' right to operate services to which the contract relates.
<P>
The amendment aims to remove that exclusivity. In drafting terms, it would not have the desired effect since other provisions in the Bill—notably clauses 104 and 109—would continue to apply. They disapply the general rights of bus operators under the Transport Act 1985 to run bus services within the area of a quality contracts scheme. However, it is not my intention to nitpick, so I shall address the point of principle.
<P>
The basic point about quality contracts as defined in the Bill is that they are an arrangement under which the local authority determines the bus network, frequency and fares, and lets a contract to a single operator or consortium to provide services to meet the local authority specification. This was discussed at some length on amendment No. 18. The presumption in such circumstances must be that the local authority decides what bus services are needed in a given area and to what standards they should be provided. The authority then secures those services by means of a quality contract for a given period of time, with payment of any necessary subsidy.
<P>
If it were possible, as is the apparent intention of the amendment, for other bus operators to continue to operate within a quality contract area, they would be able to compete with the contracted service, thereby undermining it. I cannot think that that is in anybody's interest. It would damage the commercial viability of the quality contract service and could, in the extreme, lead to its demise. It could certainly lead to the local authority having to pay more in subsidy, which would be bad news for local council tax payers.
<P>
As I have made clear, there seems to us to be no practical scope for a mix-and-match option in which commercial freedoms could co-exist with a quality contracts arrangement, The quality contracts scheme must, by definition, involve the grant of exclusive rights to operate within the area of the scheme and, with the best will in the world, we see no grounds for providing otherwise.
<P>
There may be room for discussion about whether it is appropriate to adopt the quality contract approach in any particular case, but once that decision is taken, it is not easy to see how two different regimes could co-„exist.
<P>
On the individual points made by hon. Members, I say candidly to the hon. Member for Poole that the Government share his reluctance to lose the benefits of competition and this part of the Bill is clearly intended to be used sparingly. That is exactly what we would expect, which is why we are setting a clear, high threshold before quality contracts might come in.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Under-Secretary explain to the hon. Member for Croydon, Central the Government's reluctance to lose the benefits of competition in the bus industry, which is quite a turnaround from the position of the Labour party when the buses were deregulated? The hon. Member for Croydon, Central is accusing me of a U-turn, when it is the Labour party who is doing it.
<P>
<H5>11.l5 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central on the success of bus services in London. In the period after bus deregulation in 1985 and privatisation in 1985 and 1986, 30 million passenger journeys were lost each year in bus services outside London. On the whole, bus services in London have remained stable. They have grown at certain periods, but more recently there has been a slight decline in bus usage in London. However, London's bus services have on the whole been successful. It is arguable that special factors are at work that help to sustain a high level of bus patronage. There is lower than average car ownership in London, it is densely inhabited and access to bus services is easier for most Londoners. Also the sustainability of London's bus services benefits from the tourist industry, which enables evening and late night bus services to be operated—that is not the case outside London. None of those special factors detracts from the broad success of buses in London. My hon. Friend was right to make the point.
<P>
The Government do not wholly share the rose-tinted vision of the hon. Member for North Essex of bus deregulation and privatisation, although they recognise the statistics that he deployed—they were published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I am glad to see that his attention to our publications is assiduous as ever.
<P>
Clearly, we accept that competition has conferred a number of benefits. We wish to sustain and encourage those. We do not want an easy transition to the local monopolies implied by quality contracts. The Bill ensures that there will be no easy transition. Having said that, if the local market is deemed by the local authority to have palpably failed, we are empowering local authorities to fulfil their bus strategies by means of quality contracts.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me whether I expect quality contracts to be introduced. Let me say categorically—a position that I have maintained throughout our discussions of these matters—that I do not intend to be drawn. It would be inappropriate for a Minister to lay down the paths towards quality contracts and to create a framework of acceptability that, under the Bill, it is ultimately down to the local authority to create. The Bill states that it is the responsibility of the local authority ultimately to make the case to the Secretary of State for the introduction of quality contracts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Clause 106 makes it clear that quality contracts can come into force only if approved by the appropriate national authority. They will be creatures of the Secretary of State, albeit initiated by a transport authority. It is incumbent upon the Minister to explain the circumstances in which he imagines that the Secretary of State would approve the reimposition of monopolies, which could remove the livelihoods of bus drivers and employees of bus companies that will be denied the opportunity to run services that they are running. I hope that all members of the Committee are worried that such circumstances could arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As our discussion of the Bill develops, we shall have ample opportunity to deal with the potential effects on bus operators and their staff of quality contracts. This is not an appropriate stage at which to deal with them. I reiterate that it will be for local authorities to make the case for quality contracts. It would be inappropriate at this point for a Minister to provide further guidelines than those that already appear in the Bill, where the criteria upon which local authorities come to their decision and make an application are clearly set out.
<P>
I will, however, deal with the valid point raised by the hon. Gentleman about the extent of quality contracts areas. Clause 104 provides for quality contracts in the whole or part of a local authority's area. In producing a quality contracts scheme, it is up to the authority to decide the relevant area of application. Given the radical departure that quality contracts schemes represent, our provisional view is that the area needs to be cast fairly widely as we would be replacing the current open-market arrangements with an exclusive contract for a period of years. However, it is for local authorities to decide in given circumstances what is appropriate. They will want to take into account the extent to which bus operators are likely, on an unconstrained commercial basis, to provide bus services outside the quality contract area and the level of frequency and the standards that they want.
<P>
Finally, on local and rural bus services, I should probably not have allowed myself to be drawn down that path, but I suspect that I initiated it—it was such good fun yesterday. The hon. Member for North Essex protested that such funding might more appropriately be devoted to community services such as dial-a-ride. We already make more than £4 million available each year through the rural transport partnership scheme, operated by the Countryside Agency, for the type of community scheme that he mentioned. It is extremely successful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the £4 million given to the Countryside Agency for community schemes is of equal value for money, considering the many thousands of passengers that they carry, as the £32 million a year devoted purely to scheduled bus services through the rural partnership bus challenge? Would he consider it worth rebalancing and getting far more transport for the amount of money devoted through the community, voluntary and dial-a-ride schemes rather than scheduled bus services? Why does he not allow the county councils and transport authorities to decide for themselves, rather than determining the matter centrally, as he does through the rural partnership bus challenge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We are in the business of trading figures. The rural bus grant initiative has led to the creation of 1,845 new and enhanced bus services in the countryside, carrying 10 million passengers each year. That is a sizeable commitment to the countryside, which the Conservative party, when in government for 18 years, never contemplated. The Labour party is seriously committed to the countryside.
<P>
If I have already demolished the hon. Gentleman at the macro level, let me turn to the micro level, and the Dengie village link, which we were celebrating so joyfully in Burnham-on-Crouch yesterday morning. In October 1999, before the new Dengie village link was introduced, 5,000 bus journeys were made each month in the locality. In January 2000, three months after the inception of the scheme, there were 9,000 journeys a month. That seems a fair success. My announcement yesterday in the yacht club in Burnham-on-Crouch of an extension of the rural bus grant subsidy for a further three years, at a cost nationwide of £100 million, was greeted with acclaim by many of the local Essex people present.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Bath will now be willing to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> It is clear from the sudden end to the Under-Secretary's speech that he thought that he was still in Burnham-on-Crouch, speaking to the good burghers of that no-doubt wonderful town. Were I the hon. Member for North Essex, I would be delighted that one of the towns—or perhaps it is a village—in my constituency had had so many references made to it in such a short time in the House. I have no doubt that the users of the Dengie village link will be equally pleased to know that, if I have counted right, that is the eighth time that the Dengie village link—that is now nine—has been mentioned.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is extraordinary that it has been referred to so many times, given that it is not mentioned in any of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex wishes to intervene and I suspect that we are about to go into double figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The crowd that evidently acclaimed the Under-Secretary at the yacht club did not include the chairman of one parish council; she refused to attend because the only way that she could get there was by car.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. You rightly pointed out, Mr. Gale, that we have had a more wide-ranging debate than one might have expected given the relatively simple nature of the amendment and the response by the Under-Secretary. It is worth reflecting that the hon. Member for North Essex did the Committee a great service by drawing our attention to the fact that there is no simple correlation between deregulation and the reduction in the number of passenger journeys and that was acknowledged by the Under-Secretary.
<P>
I hope that all members of the Committee will accept that issues such as increasing car ownership, the reduction in population density, the real rise in fare prices and even poor signage and so on have all had a part to play in the decline in bus use. Knowledge of those factors and the recognition of problems surrounding them is important for local authorities and others who want to improve bus ridership as one means of reducing road congestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I agree about the bus industry. It is still extraordinarily immature, particularly in its marketing. It is often difficult to fund out where services run unless one is already deeply familiar with an area. We need to give the industry room to develop and the reimposition of monopolies will take the initiative away from it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I certainly agree about the urgent need for more imaginative solutions to the way in which we are promoting and developing bus services in different parts of the country and the way in which they interlink with other forms of transport, such as the community schemes that both the hon. Member for North Essex and the Under-Secretary were discussing at Burnham-on-Crouch.
<P>
The other useful point to come out of the debate has been the distinction between quality partnerships and quality contracts and the desirability of those two different mechanisms. It is probably accepted—the Under-Secretary may wish to confirm this clearly on the record—that the vast majority of those who have been consulted are infinitely more enthusiastic about quality partnerships and are of the view that quality contracts should only be a last resort. The heavy hand of regulation should be introduced only if, there is evidence that local authorities are unable to deliver their local transport and bus plans.
<P>
<H5>11.30 a.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that it is accepted that there is greater support for the less heavy-handed regulation of quality partnerships. The Committee may be interested to know that even National Economic Research Associates—hardly an extreme left-wing organisation—when it looked about two years ago at the initial plans for quality partnerships and some form of fairly heavy re-regulation, such as we now see under the guise of quality contracts, concluded in its report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the basis of the admittedly limited information on impacts that we have obtained, it appears that quality partnerships offer the prospect of significant gains in public transport patronage, given relatively modest increases in local authority expenditure.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is from a body that is opposed to re-regulation and to the quality partnerships aspects of the Bill.
<P>
It is my opinion—and I believe that of the Committee—that we should see quality contracts as a last resort.
<P>
The other point on which the Under-Secretary began to touch—perhaps the Committee would have welcomed a little more detail—and on which I suspect I might also have agreed with him, is that a number of lessons are still to be learned about the contracting processes within the bus industry. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central referred to London, where there is greater regulation than elsewhere. He used that to justify arguments linking regulation and bus ridership. I hope that he and the Minister have studied in some detail many of the problems in London in the contracting process. There are technical, commercial and regulatory difficulties and the latter will be made even worse with the introduction of the Competition Act 1998 which we shall be discussing later. Will the Minister be prepared to deal with, for example, cross-subsidies within a quality contract arrangement of the sort that would be possible within a quality partnership?
<P>
The Minister said in response to the hon. Member for North Essex that later in the Bill he wanted to talk about the effects of quality contracts on both operators and their staff. I urge him also to tell us, when we come to the relevant part, about the impact on local authorities, unless they are given considerable assistance, in learning from the lessons of the contracting arrangements in London.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for North Essex seems to believe that the quality contracts arrangement will be all-embracing for provision within the local authority area, Will the Under-Secretary confirm that while the quality contract ensures that a local authority can practically—that word has now been introduced—implement its current bus strategies economically, efficiently and effectively, it need not cover all the services in an area? My understanding of clause 107 is that it provides for the exclusion of specific local services and even of whole classes of service, so the quality contract does not have to be all embracing. Within a local authority area, a contract could be provided for certain services but there could be a significant amount of competition in respect of many other services in that area.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is incumbent upon the Minister to explain to the Committee in more detail the circumstances in which he imagines a quality contract would be approved? Merely to say that he does not intend to get involved with that, as though he had a quasi-judicial role in it, is not good enough. Will the hon. Gentleman join me in asking the Minister—perhaps when we come to clause 106—to explain the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to approve a quality contract?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Knowing the Minister's approach to the Committee, I am sure that when we reach clause 106, he will give us a fairly lengthy exposition of his understanding of the clause and the very matters that the hon. Gentleman raises. I have no wish to put words into the Minister's mouth, but the tests laid down in clause 104 seem to be both fairly stringent and clear. Under later clauses, local authorities seeking to make a quality contract are required to meet conditions on consultation with the various bodies referred to in the Bill. However, no doubt the Minister can answer for himself.
<P>
Those are my general point. I suggest that one of the merits of the quality contract is that it exists as a fairly tough form of reregulation, but is, on the whole, not something that people particularly want to use. It is there as a tool to be used if necessary; its very existence serves as a ``threat'' to those who are not prepared to get their heads together to work on the development of a high-quality partnership scheme, which is the preferred alternative. It is because of its potential use in that way that we continue to support the parts of the Bill that relate to quality partnerships.
<P>
On the amendment, the Minister has given the answer that I expected. I am grateful that he has placed it firmly on the record that the reference to the singular includes the plural. More than one contract can exist in an area and there may be a series of contracts with different operators, or equally—as the Minister has rightly said—the contract can be a single contract with more than one operator. I am grateful for that clarification being firmly placed on the record. Because of it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 595, in page 62, line 8, after `frequency' insert `, fares'—[Mr. Hill.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 507, in page 62, line 15, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) A quality contract may not be made on terms which include any payment by the person undertaking to provide the local service to the authority,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have started to discuss quality contracts and we have established that although the Minister intends the provision to be a last resort—as the hon. Member for Bath said, ``a threat''—there is nothing in the legislation to stop quality contracts being used more generally. The reason that we want to insert the new section is that we fear that the authority and the bus operator may be tempted, where there is a monopoly quality contract, to create a position wherein funds are provided to the authority for the provision of that contract.
<P>
Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A quality contract may be made on terms—
<P>
(a) which include provision for the making of payments by the authority or authorities to the person undertaking to provide the local service, and
<P>
(b) requiring one or more of the parties to provide additional facilities or services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sounds reasonable, in that a bus lane might need to be provided, or certain facilities allied to the provision of a particular bus service; therefore, some funds from the authority to the operator, or some joint funding of a facility, might seem reasonable. However, the provision is quite generally drawn and our fear is that ``additional facilities or services'' might be interpreted more widely.
<P>
The authority might say to the bus operator, ``Well, we would like to give you this quality contract. If you were to provide this facility with perhaps additional facilities down the road—which may or may not be related to the provision of this particular service—then we will smile on you and have a contract with you.'' In effect, we would move through the regulatory regime to a franchising system whereby local authorities appreciate that if they use quality contracts, they can put the screws on private bus companies to make provisions for facilities in towns that may or may not be related to the provision of bus services. That is why we are moving the amendment.
<P>
We seek assurances from the Minister that that will not happen and that this part of the Bill will be related purely to the provision of facilities such as bus lanes, bus shelters or perhaps station improvements, with nothing else thrown in. We all know that, at times, local authorities are under pressure; a local authority might anticipate squeezing some money out of an operator on a highly profitable route to provide services on a totally different route in the borough. Our concern, to create a degree of protection under monopoly provision. As the Bill is worded the bus companies should not be put in a position of providing moneys or additional facilities, which would, in effect, be bidding for the provision of contract services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I have to resist the amendment because it would make bidding by bus operators for quality contracts quite unbalanced. The Committee will realise that an essential part of the policy is that there should be competitive tendering by bus operators for quality contracts. Clause 110 makes that clear. It is important that those tenders should be for positive or negative prices. That is to say, in assessing what bid to put in, a bus operator should have to assess whether the services involved can be run at a profit. If he concludes that the services will be loss making, he will bid for the local authority to pay him to run them, so the price will be negative. The Bill provides for that, to put the matter beyond doubt. However, if the operator concludes that the service can be run at a profit, he will put in a bid for a positive price to win the right to run the service. That means that the competitive bidding process will gain the local authority a share of the operator's profits, which may also be expressed in terms of facilities.
<P>
The amendment deprives the local authority of the opportunity to have a share in the potential profits, however large they might be. That is wrong in principle and odd in practice. It means that the maximum bid that an operator could legally make would be zero, and if there were more than one zero bid a local authority might find it hard to choose between them. There is an express provision in the clause for a negative price: that is, for a local authority to pay a bidder to put the point beyond legal doubt. However, it is much more usual for a bidder to offer a positive price, so no special legal provision is needed.
<P>
I point out to the Opposition that our old friend, the Railways Act 1993, made exactly that provision in relation to rail franchises. Would-be rail franchisees are quite capable of putting in a bid that requires subvention from the Government, as has occurred extensively. They are equally capable of making a positive offer. On the basis that the practice is almost hallowed by the arrangements introduced by the preceding Administration in the Railways Act, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am astonished by the Minister's answer to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole. He is effectively sanctioning the ability of local authorities to go into business as bus franchisees, acting like the franchising director on the railway. The parallels are not adequate to enable him to say that, because we do it on the railway, we should do it on the buses. First, the railway has very limited capacity; secondly, it is a highly capital-intensive operation; thirdly, of its nature, the tracks are a monopoly. Those circumstances do not exist on the buses.
<P>
We all agree that, if the powers are to exist—we do not agree whether they should—they should be used sparingly. If the Minister is confronted with a proposed bus quality contract scheme, where the monopoly provided will not only return a profit to service the capital and pay the shareholders, but will pay a premium to the local authority, it is probably not a service that should be denied the virtues of competition that the Minister says he is reluctant to relinquish. I fail to see the justice of introducing monopolies that will be so lucrative that they provide the opportunity for operators to pay a premium in order to bribe the local authority into giving them the opportunity to gain a monopoly.
<P>
The intention behind the measure is to stop bus operators paying sweeteners to local authorities to gain monopoly routes. It is abhorrent to the concept of better provision of public transport that operators should be able to pay the local authority to exclude the competition from a route that they think is lucrative enough not only to make a profit, but to pay the local authority. That is a serious mistake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that in providing a network in the interests of the public, market conditions will be generated, especially if there is a sole provider, and excess profits may be made? In those circumstances, it is only right that the public share in the excess profits. The hon. Gentleman is talking about a different economic model, where those conditions do not prevail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If a bus operator is making what the hon. Gentleman calls ``excess profits'' on a route, there is provision to regulate the price of tickets. In the interests of the passengers, they should not be fleeced to pad out the profits for the local authority, which is what the clause implies.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is saying that passengers should pay more than they need to for a monopoly service which has no competition so that the bus operator can pay a premium to the local authority. That is a stealth tax on bus transport. Local authorities will be fleecing bus passengers—[Interruption.] Labour Members may laugh, but it is an outrage. The poorest people tend to travel on buses—those without cars or recourse to other forms of transport—yet by rejecting the amendment the Minister is saying that not only that bus companies should be able to service their capital, debts and shareholders, but that there should be so much fat in the contract that they can splurge it towards the local authority. I am astonished that the Minister is going down this road.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that if a contract is drawn up in good faith and provides a good network at a reasonable price, and in practice there is much more patronage and revenue than was expected, the public should not have a share of the excess profit? Or is he saying that that should be stuffed in the wallets of the contractors?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman misses the point. There are two solutions to the problem. First, perhaps the passengers should get a better value service by having the ticket prices cut. The alternative is for the service to be opened up to competition so that more services are provided rather than the monopoly being maintained. I put it to the hon. Gentleman and to the Minister that if a monopoly contract is fat enough to throw off what the hon. Gentleman calls ``excessive profits'', the service should not be subject to a bus quality contract. While there might be a tentative argument for pump-priming a new service with these powers, once a service is returning a decent profit and a premium to the local authority, it should be opened up to competition. We should not provide in the Bill for local authorities to turn into franchising directors of profitable services, garnering income from monopoly services that they provide to a grateful public. When one opens services up to competition, one gets more service, lower prices and more investment in bus services than if the local authority were creaming off the profits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman doth protest too much. I fail to see the distinction that he sought to draw initially between the monopoly on a railway service and the proposed bus monopoly that is part and parcel of the quality contracts concept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Very simply, on a railway one can run a limited number of services; on most roads, there is no practical limit to the number of bus services that can run. As we look at the decline in bus services in the past century, it is easy to see that there is plenty of spare capacity for additional services to be run that need not necessarily interfere with the services that are already running.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I begin to feel that the hon. Gentleman has failed to grasp what quality contracts are about. They will be introduced only where there is an insufficient frequency of service and where local authorities decide that they need to take this special move to provide that level of service. At the end of the day, it will be for bus operators to decide whether they can operate bus services at a profit.
<P>
We expect quality contracts to be an unusual development. It is a new an interesting doctrine from the Conservative party—the party of the ratepayer and the poll tax payer—that local ratepayers should not benefit from bus profits. Of course they should. As for fleecing the passenger, I remind the hon. Gentleman that the determination of fare levels will be one of the powers conferred on local authorities under quality contract arrangements. I doubt that it will be one of the intentions of accountable, elected local authorities to be seen to be fleecing the passenger in the dramatic way described by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This is a highly competitive and entrepreneurial industry. I foresee a scenario where bus operators will be sidling up to local authorities, nudging them gently and saying, ``If you gave us a bus quality contract on that service, we could pay you a substantial premium.'' Where is the protection to prevent such a conversation from taking place? Can the hon. Gentleman give an assurance that that activity will not take place when bus operators realise that they can buy themselves a monopoly on lucrative routes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The protection is to be found in the transparency of the consultation process on the proposing of a quality contract and in the scrutiny that such arrangements will receive from the national authority—in Wales, the National Assembly for Wales and, in England, the Secretary of State. This is a transparent process and, as we regard it as being an important and qualitatively different step, it will be subject to the most intense scrutiny. I have no doubt that those authorities will be alert to precisely the sort of shenanigans that the hon. Gentleman identified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I apologise to the Committee for missing the early part of the debate On the last intervention by the hon. Member for North Essex, does my hon. Friend agree that bus operators throughout the country will be interested to learn of the hon. Gentleman's opinion of the way in which we conduct our affairs? We invite him to make similar comments outside the protection of this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I reiterate my hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This has been an interesting and illuminating debate. Central to our concern is that we will move towards a monopoly, in which there will be sweetheart deals between bus companies. There are a limited number of major bus companies nationally and most capitalists, given half a chance, will try to create a local monopoly. Local authorities, as we all know, are often strapped for cash or looking for resources. That combination could cause difficulties. If local authorities see that in certain circumstances there may be some financial incentive, it could push them along that route and away from competition, where there is at least some market level for fares, once the subsidies put in by the authority and Government are taken into account.
<P>
Those who travel on buses will be the losers if sweetheart deals are made between local authorities and bus companies. That is our principle concern and we are not satisfied. We would like to vote against clause 104 stand part of the Bill, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Opposition have not tabled any amendments to the clause, but I should like to ask one or two questions about it. Notably, it concerns who should be consulted about the possibility of a bus quality contract scheme. The Minister will recall that I mentioned that imposing a bus quality contract might exclude existing operators from providing their current services. He said that competitive tendering will be used, so the process will be more akin to the local authority letting a contract for the procurement of services. Those processes will be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 which, as we know, require consultation not only with employees of the services concerned but with their representatives. I hope that the Minister will make it clear to local authorities that, when they are tendering for the services, they need to consult with the trade unions that represent the employees.—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Robert Ainsworth) is laughing, but I am simply pointing out that, although that is the law, the Bill does not specify that the 1981 regulations have to be observed. Is that a lacuna in the Bill and should there be a cross-reference to that legislation to protect the rights of employees who may lose their jobs as a result of the imposition of bus monopolies?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The regulations go further and involve compensation if the bus company that takes over services puts other people out of work. Will the Minister explain whether the local authority or the bus company that wins the contract is liable for employment rights and compensation payable to those who lose their jobs? Is a bus company obliged to re-employ the bus drivers and staff who are losing their jobs as a result of the imposition of a bus quality contract?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I, too, should like to say a few words about this aspect of the clause. My hon. Friend makes a good point about TUPE regulations and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. As the Bill is drafted, under clause 110 the quality contract
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>must not exceed five years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister reassure us that after a five-year period is over, if the same company and the same authority enter into a new contract, the consultation procedure will kick in before either an extension or a renewal? There are problems. In a given area, a number of companies may be running services to start with and when one consults one may have the choice of a number of businesses. If one moves towards a monopoly that lasts for five year and one relies on consultation through one newspaper that circulates in the area concerned, one may end up with only one bus operator. My concern is that, after five years, the business that has undertaken the quality contract might have a lock on the geographical area. It is important that the second consultation after five years should be wider. After a monopoly has been established in an area the number of those consulted, and the obligation to consult, may be more limited.
<P>
We heard in the previous debate about the prospect of a cosy deal between bus companies and local authorities. There may be a financial incentive for a local authority not to advertise too far and wide if it already has a preferred partner. We are looking for a number of reassurances from the Minister on the consultation process.
<P>
We also want to draw attention to the circulation from the Joint Committee on the Mobility of Blind and Partially Sighted People, which generally welcomes the provision. However, it is concerned that it should also be consulted because partially sighted people have specific problems. If one is moving towards a monopoly, provision of low floors and other facilities, and whether messages are recorded or visual are important to people with disabilities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I find it interesting that the passion for the protection of staff in connection with the clause has not led to the Opposition bothering to table any amendments on the subject. That in no way suggests that that passion is not entirely heartfelt.
<P>
Let me begin by setting out the purposes of clause 105.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Until the Minister described this process as akin to franchising, it did not occur to me that the TUPE provisions would apply. That is why I have raised the subject now. I should like to have tabled amendments, but I thought it appropriate to take the opportunity to question the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We shall return to the TUPE provisions in due course. I was about to set out for the benefit of the Committee the general purposes of the clause. As with quality partnership schemes, we are anxious to see that widespread consultation takes place. It is important that local transport authorities should canvass a broad range of views on proposals that are likely to have a major impact in their area, so the clause provides for the publication of notices in much the same way as for traffic regulation orders, and for consultation with all the key stakeholders, including bus operators, bus users, other local authorities affected, the traffic commissioners and the police. The hon. Member for Poole asked whether the trade unions would be consulted in the process. The answer is that clause 105(3)(g) stipulates that consultation may be carried out with,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other persons as the authority or authorities think fit.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is ample provision in the Bill, therefore, for consultation with the representatives of organised labour in the process.
<P>
Subsections (1) and (2) require the publishing of a notice in at least one local newspaper, describing the proposed scheme, stating the reasons for it and explaining where a copy of the scheme can be inspected. Subsection (3) imposes requirements about consultation on proposed quality contracts schemes. The range of bodies is similar to those to be consulted in quality partnership schemes, but in the case of bus operators—which is the point raised by the hon. Member for North Essex—it goes a little wider to include any holders of public service vehicle licences or community bus permits who would be affected by the quality contracts scheme. Subsection (4) allows the authority to modify a scheme in the light of consultations.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Poole's comments, consultation is concerned with the making of the scheme, which can last for up to 10 years. Tendering can be for up to five years for the individual contract, but re-tendering does not attract the full rigours of consultation and we see no special reason why that should be the case.
<P>
There may be no need for compensation for staff—a matter that was raised by the hon. Member for North Essex. After all, existing operators may individually or in consortiums win the tender, or the winner may take on staff from those who have lost in the tendering process, or staff may be redeployed. In any case, that will certainly not be a cost for the local authority.
<P>
On the transfer of undertakings or a takeover, typically we are dealing with the takeover of a going concern. That situation might apply if a winning bidder took over the vehicles and staff of the unsuccessful bidder. It all depends on circumstances and arrangements between operators. Again, it is not a matter for the local authority. I hope that that deals with some of the issues raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am coming at this subject relatively unprepared, Mr. Gale, but I am ready to bank on the fact that the Minister's advice will be a little lacking on TUPE. The TUPE provisions were originally framed under the acquired rights directive to apply to takeovers. That directive was then extended by successive rulings of the European Court of Justice to include transfers of contracts—a contract became an undertaking. The Minister is now saying that the transfer of an undertaking would occur only if the vehicles and the route were being transferred. What is an undertaking and at what point an undertaking is transferred are just the sort of questions that the European Court of Justice loves and that trade unions beloved of the Labour party love to take to the European Court.
<P>
I urge the Minister to look at this problem more carefully because I am prepared to bet that European law will take a broad view of what constitutes an undertaking and that if a bus company goes bust as a result of being excluded from a quality contract area, the employees will have recourse to some authority or company for compensation. If that is the case, the obligation to consult must go beyond persons holding a public service vehicle operator's licence or a community bus permit. The employees of the bus services concerned must be consulted and, indeed, their representatives, which is why I mentioned trade unions. That is the way the system works.
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer, but perhaps the Minister will undertake to write to Committee members on the matter. It may be something to which we shall need to return at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I do not wish to detain the Committee either, Mr. Gale, but a couple of points arise from the comments of the hon. Member for North Essex. I should like to underline some of the responses that my hon. Friend the Minister made to him on the clause. Aside from the crocodile tears that the hon. Gentleman cries for the workers displaced, there is the serious point that they and their representatives should be consulted, which I am sure that my hon. Friend will concede.
<P>
Furthermore, my hon. Friend mentioned compensation. Should smaller operators who operate just a handful of routes find themselves excluded under the terms of the clause, they will have no option to move anywhere else because they will not be in a position to do so. They will go bust. My hon. Friend should consider that carefully. While he is doing so, he should also consider something else. Many of the larger companies, such as the one that I chair, have good pension arrangements for their staff. If Travel West Midlands, or a similar organisation, lost its franchise—because quality contracts are franchising under another name—many of the staff could be adversely affected if the incoming operator declined to adopt what I referred to earlier as a mirror-image pension scheme.
<P>
I have no wish to detain my hon. Friend or the Committee unduly on the clause, but these are important matters. Before glibly accepting the principle of quality contracts, let me say again to my hon. Friend, in response to the comments of the hon. Member for North Essex, that if they are so lucrative, why are all the bus operators against them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is interesting to hear the hon. Gentleman talk about glibly accepting quality contracts when he, having spoken against them on Second Reading, has just glibly argued in favour of them.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman amuses himself with his clever debating points, but that is all that they are. As I said, operators do not favour quality contracts and I asked my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to underline that they would be viewed as a last resort. I accept, as does every Labour Member, that there may be no alternative to them in certain circumstances. I have not voted for quality contracts; I have only accepted reality, which the hon. Gentleman is not very good at.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): Or any of his colleagues!
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I would not say all of them: I shall not be tempted down that road or else the term ``irascibility''—non-existent in the course of this Committee—may rear its head again.
<P>
The clause raises serious points and I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will deal with compensation, particularly for smaller operators who have nowhere else to go, and with pensions. Many trade unionists—to quote the group newly beloved of the hon. Member for North Essex—fought hard for many years for better working conditions and pensions and they would not want a them to be prejudiced by legislation enacted by a Labour Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East makes an important point. The Bill is silent on what happens to those who may have to leave or vacate a particular area. According to the companies with which I have spoken, the presumption that they can just move is not necessarily the case. Whether companies own a bus station, repair facilities or whatever, they often have roots in a particular community. Bus drivers live in a particular locality. When people are excluded from a locality, it can cause economic problems for the companies involved.
<P>
Even worse, if a quality contract exists in a particular area and it pushes some of the more marginal operators next door, it could lead to substantially greater competition among the next door routes, which could put other operators out of business. Five companies in a specific area might have to opt for more limited resources because they cannot operate effectively there. We heard in a previous debate how a large bus company might do a deal with the local authority. It might well be happy, but the more marginal companies that are pushed out will not be.
<P>
I do not expect the Under-Secretary to answer my question today, but it needs further examination. The consequences of providing a contract in an area where various companies are in competition could be serious. We may have to return to that problem on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall try to be brief. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East for drawing the Committee's attention to the fate of operators who find themselves non-participants in quality contract schemes, and for mentioning compensation and pensions. Let me reassure him that the Committee will return to those matters when we reach clause 107, which deals with transitional arrangements rather than consultation. The hon. Member for Poole also raised similar points about transitional circumstances and I note that the Opposition have tabled several amendments to clause 107. I am usually the last person to shy away from debating an argument, but I repeat that it would be more appropriate to deal with those issues later.
<P>
Part of the process of a Standing Committee is to raise ``What if?'' questions, and the hon. Member for North Essex asked an important one about transferred undertakings. I am grateful to him for raising that interesting and important issue. I undertake not only to consider it, but to advise the Committee on the Government's views on it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that undertaking. I listened to the speech of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East, and apart from the friendly jibes that we usually hurl at each other, we agree that the Bill is silent on some serious issues. That underlines the fact that reimposing selective monopolies is fraught with difficulty, and we have not even begun to discuss the competition features of doing so. Frankly, I am bold enough to say that the clause is a mess.
<P>
I shall not press the clause to a Division, as we did on a previous clause, because we have made our point, but the Committee has heard enough to realise that the reimposition of bus monopolies is ill thought out and ill advised. The fact that the Government have made it clear that the provision constitutes a last-resort mechanism shows that they are trying to put as much distance as possible between the proposal and the reality of bus policy in future. We may have been debating an academic clause that might never be used.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Under the Bill as drafted, the Secretary of State, or the National Assembly for Wales, must approve quality contracts. Concerns about competition law have been a theme of our debates on the clauses relating to buses. Many companies are concerned about the Competition Act 1998, which will come into force—
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning </B>(Mr. Nick Raynsford): Tomorrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Yes, tomorrow. That Act contains draconian provisions about which many bus companies and operators are concerned. Therefore, we propose that instead of approval being in the hands of the Secretary of State, it should be in those of the Competition Commission, which could consider each quality contract and determine whether it is in the public interest.
<P>
As this morning's debate showed, there are concerns about how quality contracts will operate, about the relationship between operators and public authorities, about ticket prices and about whether some contracts will operate in the public interest. We believe that allowing the Competition Commission to determine such matters would ensure that quality contracts could proceed only if they operate in the public interest. That is the principle of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I have studied the amendments in detail. Confusion has arisen, especially in amendment No. 516, which is the nub of the issue. Has the hon. Gentleman studied his own amendment? He proposes that the Competition Commission should have the power to investigate whether the Secretary of State, or the National Assembly for Wales, has acted in the public interest in relation to a scheme. The commission would presumably follow its normal reporting procedures. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, under its normal reporting procedure, if it funds no fault its report is binding, but if it finds fault it has to submit the report to the Secretary of State, or the National Assembly for Wales, for a decision on what action to take? The impact of the amendment would merely be that another body would send its report to the Secretary of State, who will take such decisions in any case, so it would have no effect other than to add a tier of bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for explaining our amendment. The key point is that competition law is a problem and we are hoping for some reassurance from the Government about how this will operate. Under quality contracts we have a system whereby the Secretary of State must give the approval. It has been illustrated in our debates this morning that we are concerned about that acting against the public interest. We have not yet been fully reassured by the Government about how this part of the Bill will operate in conjunction with the 1998 Act, which comes into force tomorrow.
<P>
I am sure that the right hon. Member for Bath [Laughter.]—I am anticipating by a few years—is right that, as it is worded, amendment No. 516 might not do what we hoped, but we are trying to engender debate. Some of the bus companies have raised their concerns about competition law. In an earlier debate in Committee, the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East said that the Government ought to issue exemptions. We have not heard any proposals on that so far, but the Confederation of Passenger Transport has suggested some options for consideration, and on the topic of individual exemptions one of its concerns was the practical difficulties. Its briefing note says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, in practical terms, it is most unlikely that a single operator would be minded to ask for the regulatory authorities to exempt an agreement particularly in the light of the proposed fee of £13,000.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are concerns, and individual exemptions may not be the answer. I hope that when the Minister comes to amendment No. 516 and the subject of competition, he will tell us how the Bill will interact with the Competition Act 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Amendment No. 516 would do nothing other than add a tier of bureaucracy and expense and would ultimately leave the decision with the National Assembly for Wales or, in the case of England, with the Secretary of State. Amendment Nos. 471 to 477 and 482 suggest an alternative.
<P>
At the moment, the Committee has accepted that the final decision on matters related to the appropriateness or otherwise of a quality contract should lie outside the remit of the local authority concerned and that it is appropriate that there should be another decision-making body finally to approve or reject a contract proposal. I accept that broad principle.
<P>
What would be the appropriate decision-making body? In the Bill it is ``the appropriate national authority''. The amendments would change that to ``the appropriate regional authority'' and amendment No. 482 says that that should be ``the regional assembly'', otherwise referred to in some parts of the country as the regional chamber. That would apply during the interim phase between now and the day—I hope it is not too far distant—when we have genuine regional government. [Interruption.] Hon. Members suggest that I should not hold my breath. I suspect that it will not come as quickly as I wish, but given the commitment by the Government to move in that direction, which will have the support of the Liberal Democrats, I am confident that our combined forces of light will move towards devolved government in this country. That commitment has already been demonstrated by devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the proposal for London will be upon us before too long. Our amendments propose that we reflect the desire that is felt by the majority of the members of the Committee for decision-making to be devolved to the lowest appropriate level. We suggest that that should be at a regional rather than at a national level. The Committee will accept that a regional assembly would be in a far better position than the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to consider the various schemes in the context of regional transport plans.
<P>
<H5>12.30pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith:</B> What exactly does the hon. Gentleman think will replace the National Assembly for Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. As I was speaking, I realised that I was talking nonsense and I am pleased to have the opportunity to set the record straight. The National Assembly for Wales is, in effect, the regional government for Wales and it would be most appropriate for it to make such decisions. I was talking about what should happen in England and I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for helping me out of that hole. My colleagues who serve on the National Assembly for Wales would have wanted to do nasty things to parts of my body, had he not intervened. [Interruption.] I am becoming concerned, Mr. Gale. I shall not say what I was thinking. It would be inappropriate and you would rule me out of order immediately. I was about to refer to something about which you informed the Committee about earlier, but I shall avoid temptation.
<P>
A decision about the approval of a quality contract must be made at a higher level than that of individual local authorities. It will be done far better at a regional than at a national level, hence our amendment. I have made clear our opposition to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Poole because they would achieve absolutely nothing.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This has been an interesting exchange and, no doubt, we could have debated the merits of regional government at even greater length, although I am not sure that you, Mr. Gale, would have encouraged us to do that. As the hon. Member for Bath said, amendments Nos. 471 to 478 would give to the appropriate regional development authority—rather than the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales—the function of approving quality contract schemes. Amendment No. 482 would instead give the approval function to the appropriate regional assembly. I am full of admiration for the reputation of the hon. Gentleman and his party for flexibility and their mix-and-match approach to policy. It is so refreshing to see such openness and adaptability. I shall address that either/or approach by dealing with his two options in turn.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 471 to 478 on regional development authorities—option 1, as I shall call it—are not appropriate. Regional development agencies have no statutory functions in connection with transport, It is true that they are providing input into the regional transport strategies that are being developed by regional planning bodies. However, RDAs are not the bodies to second-guess local authority decisions on bus quality contract schemes or to exercise wider public interest powers.
<P>
Option 2 would make the appropriate regional assembly the approving body for quality contract schemes. The term ``regional assembly'' has no statutory meaning, so the amendment would not work in practice. The phrase may refer to the regional chambers that we have encouraged, which are voluntary groupings of local authorities and other key regional stakeholders that are designed to provide an additional measure of regional responsiveness to the work of the RDAs and to wider regional issues. They are neither directly elected nor appointed bodies and it would be odd to give them the responsibility for the final decision on an area's bus quality contract schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct that they are not statutory bodies, but the Government require their existence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That may be so, but it is difficult to see how a non-statutory body could be recognised in statute, especially for the purposes set out in the amendments.
<P>
Whether it would in due course be right to delegate approvals to directly-elected regional assemblies is an interesting question. Such assemblies have not yet been established. Like my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, I share the hon. Gentleman's passion for regionalism, but we will have to cross that bridge when we come to it.
<P>
In any event, the main reason why the clause reserves to the Secretary of State, or the National Assembly for Wales, the right to approve a quality contract scheme is to provide a degree of control over the process. As we have said, quality contracts are a big step. They are a dramatic move away from the present arrangements, which allow bus operators to determine how best to respond to the needs of their passengers. In the circumstances, we think it entirely appropriate that the Bill provides for prior approval from the relevant national body. The Secretary of State—or the National Assembly for Wales—is best placed to oversee the arrangements, to ensure that local authorities have met the tests set out in clause 104, and to be satisfied that, under the clause, it is in the interests of the public that the quality contract scheme should be made.
<P>
For the same reasons, approval of a proposed scheme is not an appropriate function to give the Competition Commission, as proposed by amendments Nos. 508 to 515. The new Competition Commission has assumed the reporting role of the former Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It also has the function, in certain circumstances, to hear appeals against the decisions of the Director General of Fair Trading. However, the work of the Commission is all to do with competition, which is not the essential issue in regard to quality contracts. To develop that point a little, the job of the Competition Commission is to make a judgment on public interest, but subsection (4)(b) already requires the national authority to consider the interests of the public. There is no reason why the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales should be unable to do that.
<P>
On the more general point about the application of the Competition Act 1998, there is no intention to alter the competition rules under that Act. The Act would not apply to a local authority letting a quality contract. The local authority would act under the provisions of the Bill, including in regard to open tendering requirements, as set out in clause 110. The Office of Fair Trading has been apprised of the legislation and has offered no comment on it.
<P>
I repeat that the Secretary of State—or the National Assembly for Wales—is required under the clause to be the confirming authority, as it were, for a quality contracts scheme. Such confirmation involves being satisfied that all the relevant criteria have been met and that it is in the public interest that the scheme is made. So there is a public interest issue, but it is not one that properly falls to the Competition Commission to consider. The Bill already contains perfectly sensible provisions to safeguard competition, in this case competition for the market. Clause 110 specified in some detail all the requirements for tendering for quality contracts, including the requirement that tender invitations must be sent to anyone who asks for them.
<P>
The Secretary of State, or the National Assembly for Wales, will consider more than competition. The appropriate national authority will examine transport policy, especially bus transport, in the wider sense of levels and quality of provision, possible alternative approaches, broader social objectives relating to modal shift, the role of the car and pollution control, to give some examples. Those seem appropriate matters for the national authority rather than the Competition Commission.
<P>
Nor would it be appropriate to allow the commission to investigate the Secretary of State's decisions, as I understand amendment No. 516 would. The hon. Member for Bath has demonstrated the absurdity of the Competition Commission's investigating the entity to which it reports. To nit-pick slightly it would be mildly absurd to allow the commission to investigate and report on its own decisions, although that would seem to be the effect if the amendment were taken with amendments Nos. 508 to 515. In light of those remarks, I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his response. I am not entirely reassured that the 1998 Act will not apply to the clause, but I am sure that the fact that he is sure that it does not is on record will provide some comfort to a poor bus company director in difficulty in future. I am not sure how reassured I am that the OFT has said nothing about the proposals. I would be slightly happier if it had given a positive sign that it was happy. Nevertheless, having had a useful debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale, for having grouped with amendments Nos. 450 and 451 amendments Nos. 517 to 521, tabled in the name of the hon. Members for North Essex and for Poole.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 517 to 521 are bizarre in the extreme. Only a moment ago, the Under-Secretary accused the Liberal Democrats of having a mix-and-match approach to policies. Amendments Nos. 517 to 521 are an admirable demonstration of such an approach. Only a few moments ago, the hon. Member for Poole said that he was worried about protecting bus companies in difficulty. However, amendment No. 517 would reduce the period in which a scheme must come into operation from 21 to 12 months, allowing little opportunity for a company that is not included in a scheme to find alternative use for its vehicles and staff. The amendment is extremely bizarre, given the anxieties expressed only a few moments ago about the need to consult trade unions and protect bus companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Before I give way to the hon. Gentleman, I should like to make another point about his amendments, on which I am sure that he will want to comment. In terms of mix and match, amendments Nos. 518 and 519 are the most bizarre that have been tabled since we began our proceedings. I am completely confused, surprised and staggered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I wanted to intervene because I might save him from being so excited. Does he not know a probing amendment when he sees one?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Of course, I know a probing amendment when I see one. Conservative Members have defined nearly every amendment that they have moved as being probing from the opening words that they utter, which are usually in the form, ``What would the Minister like to tell the Committee about the clause?'' I appreciate that the amendment is probing, but to suggest a reduction from 21 to 12 months is an odd way to probe, given that it is inconsistent with all that Conservative Members said earlier. Indeed, under a probing amendment, they would have suggested that the change should be from 21 to 42 months, which would have been consistent with the concerns that have been expressed. To describe amendments Nos. 518 and 519 as being probing without defending them in any other way is bizarre.
<P>
Under amendment No. 518, the word ``ten'' in subsection (2)(e) would be replaced with the word ``five''. Under amendment No. 519, the word ``ten'' in that subsection would be replaced with the word ``twelve''. Conservative Members are trying to have their cake and eat it. Those amendments are not logical. There must be more to them than their merely being a pair of probing amendments, given that one of them would have been sufficient on its own. Therefore, I am looking forward to the speech in defence of those amendments that the hon. Member for Poole will give in a moment. No doubt, he is refreshed by his week's enjoyment in New York and elsewhere. I congratulate him on the reasons why he went to New York.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 450 and 451, which I tabled, are not probing; they are very serious.
<P>
Under amendment No. 450, we would amend the amount of time in which the authority could make a scheme after it has been approved by the national authority, whether the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales. Under the Bill, the authority will have six months in which to make the scheme, as approved, whereas it would have up to 12 months in which do so under that amendment. The reason why we suggest that is simple: it is possible that the national authority will change to the proposed scheme during the approval process. If it is not likely to do so, there is no point in seeking such approvals.
<P>
The national authority must review the changes to discover how they affect various aspects of the scheme, such as the requirements on the authority or those on the operator, the operator's willingness to continue with the scheme as amended and the aim of the contract in relation to the local transport plan. Giving the authority 12 months in which to decide to go ahead with the scheme as amended by the national authority would provide it with greater flexibility.
<P>
Amendment No. 451 would change the specification of the date on which the quality contract comes into operation. That would not be a change from 21 to 12 months, as proposed by Conservative Members, but one that would be far more flexible. We would allow the date to be determined and specified in the local transport plan, which must have the approval of the appropriate national authority. That would be consistent with the clauses on partnership schemes under which similar arrangements will exist. It would allow authorities to take account of the circumstances in which they apply the scheme. For example, they may create a scheme that is urgently needed to replace a service that is finishing, in which case the authority could specify a much earlier date to ensure that passengers on that route or routes would continue to be provided with a service. However, if the creation of a scheme would mean that certain operators were no longer able to operate in that area, the date could be set later. That would allow a longer period for the operator to re-allocate staff and resources perhaps to another area, although the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East will no doubt say that, in many cases, no such options are available.
<P>
A small operator who only operated previously on that route may need longer to relocate than face the liquidation and worries to which the hon. Member for Poole referred Our amendment would offer greater flexibility. It is consistent with earlier parts of the Bill and takes into account the concerns that were raised from both sides of the Committee during our debate. If a scheme were needed urgently, the amendment would enable that to be carried out, too.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 450 and 451 were worded precisely to ensure that we meet the concerns that have been raised by many local authorities and operators about the wording of the Bill. I hope that they will be treated as proposals that are more than probing amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am glad that the hon. Member for Bath has enjoyed our probing amendments. When trying to amend the Bill to engender debate, we get some things right and some things wrong. Given what we have heard today, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that our figures are going the wrong way—certainly in terms of the 21 months. As we said earlier, 21 months is not a long time to relocate a business or to change routes when a contract comes in. Our amendment, which would make the period one of 12 months, is wrong on this occasion. In the light of the comments of the hon. Member for Bath and our general debate, the other figure that we wanted to adjust would not hit the mark. However, it has been useful to discuss clause 107 and, as I said, although we have not hit the mark with these amendments, I am sure that there will be others that will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It goes without saying that I understand that members of the Committee are keen to probe us about dates and time scales for quality contracts and I am glad to have the opportunity to explain our thinking. Before turning to the amendments, I wish to make a general point that, in establishing dates in the Bill, we sought to balance two considerations: the legitimate interests of the operators in the making of what would clearly be significant changes and the interests of local authorities, which will naturally be keen to press on.
<P>
Amendment No. 450, to which the hon. Member for Bath spoke, concerns the time between the approval of the scheme by the appropriate national authority and the date on which the local authority can make the scheme. The amendment would change
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not later than six months<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not later than twelve months.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I feel obliged to resist the amendment, because the time limit is designed to stop schemes hanging around unfulfilled. When the national authority's approval has been given, all those concerned, especially the operators, deserve to know where they stand. Six months seems long enough for the local authority to make the necessary preparations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I expected the Minister to respond differently and to say that my amendment was not necessary because, after the period of approval, that would have meant that the various amendments that were being proposed by the national authority had been taken into account and that it would be reasonable for the local authority to get on with it. Does the hon. Gentleman expect that the time at which an approval is to be given is the time at which all details of suggested changes have been considered and approved by the Secretary of State? Or is the approval process to be one in which the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales gives approval subject to several additional inclusions? If it is the former, there is no problem, but if it is the latter, there is a significant problem with the time scale that he proposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. With the exception of relatively minor details that might relate to the contract, we expect the approval by the Secretary of State to be the end part of a long process of consultation, tendering and consideration by the local authority. Once the approval is given, we must naturally expect and facilitate a rapid movement to the implementation scheme by the local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise for pursuing the matter, but it is serious. The Minister said that the approval may be the end part, but he also said that it could have what he defined as minor changes. What happens when local authorities submit contract proposals that the Secretary of State approves, but to which he demands ``minor'' amendments that the authorities or the operators will not accept? They will be required to introduce the proposals within six months with no right to appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is true that the Secretary of State's approval can be subject to initial modifications under clause 106(3), which provides for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>written representations to the appropriate national authority about the scheme.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The shape of the quality contract is finalised under the terms of clause 106(6), when
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the appropriate national authority may approve the scheme either with those modifications or as proposed under subsection (1).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We will naturally allow for modifications to be made to the scheme as approved by the Secretary of State, but the large shape of the quality contract will be that presented to the national authority at the end of a significant process of consultation and tendering. Therefore, we would expect that the time scale for further appeal and modifications would be relatively limited, which is consistent with the time scale of six months in the Bill.
<P>
The usual suspects confirm that the local authority will reconsult under terms of clause 106(5), so there will be a process for reconsultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I promise that unless the Minister provokes me, I shall not seek to intervene on him again. He is right to say that the Bill allows for reconsultation on changes to the contract, but the contract must be introduced within six months of the Secretary of State finally approving it. If the Secretary of State requires modifications in that final approval, it may not be possible in the six-month period for all the consultation to take place and for there to be agreement. Some bodies party to the contract may not be prepared to accept the modifications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We will allow a period of six months for that process of further reconsideration, representation and modification if need be, and it is incumbent on the hon. Gentleman to explain why that is inadequate. In our judgment, six months is adequate, bearing in mind that in all normal circumstances there will have already been an extremely lengthy period of consultation and consideration of the arrangements for the quality contract proposed by the local authority. A local authority that has recognised that an important step change has to be made in local bus service arrangements must not be able to delay it almost indefinitely, which would be the effect of the amendment. The Bill suggests a minimum of 21 months, and amendment No. 451 would allow for no minimum period at all. The time gap would be whatever the local authority said it should be in its local transport plan and bus strategy—
