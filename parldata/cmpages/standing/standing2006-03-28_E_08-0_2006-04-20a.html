Schedule.'.</div><a name="06042072000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000508"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Before

lunch I was saying that I hoped to see the Liberal party join the

emerging consensus between the Labour and Conservative parties on how

to tackle underperforming schools. I will leave the hon. Member for

Brent, East (Sarah Teather) to explain amendment No. 66, but suffice it

to say that if she decides to press it to a vote we will certainly

oppose it, as what it proposes is outwith the spirit of the White Paper

and the Bill, both of which we

support.</div><a name="06042072000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 180 and 182 stand in the name of the hon. Member for Bury, North

(Mr. Chaytor), who is not joined on this occasion by his partner in

crime the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods). Durham

is a beautiful city; although it is one of the few places where I did

not go to school, I did go to university there. The amendments appear

to contradict the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views about giving 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>certain groups of electors rights over and above the rights of the

electorate as a whole, which he expressed in relation to amendment No.

179 and the proposal that 50 parents should be able to trigger a notice

under clause 7.</div><a name="06042072000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments state that the Secretary of State may not refuse consent for

a local authority to establish a community school in circumstances

where the local authority can demonstrate that such a proposal is

supported by a certain number of parents. Well, how about 50 parents?

Did the hon. Gentleman have such a number in mind when tabling his

amendment?</div><a name="06042072000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 182 would impose the requirement for a ballot among certain

categories of parents wherever there are proposals under clause 7 for a

new school. Would not that create special rights for those electors

over and above others? That should be the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

objection to his own amendments. My objection is that the amendments

will thwart the objective of trying to create a more diverse range of

schools by turning every new proposal into a major political campaign,

the threat of which would put many groups of parents or others off

venturing down that route in the first place.</div>

<a name="06042072000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Conservative party agrees

with paragraph 5.14 of the regulatory impact assessment, which

states:</div><a name="06042072000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Through

the clarification of the local authority role in relation to school

organisation, and the provision of a decision-making framework which

supports diversity and innovation, more schools will have a character

that supports the development of an individual ethos and enables them

to take responsibility for their own future progress. This will

increase the range of choice for parents and the potential for

innovation and improved

standards.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments that the hon. Gentleman has tabled will jeopardise or slow

down the implementation of that approach, which we believe is the

correct one. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to the

amendments.</div>

<a name="06042072000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000509"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): I shall speak to amendment No.

66, but I shall also comment on the whole group. The hon. Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said that the amendments and

the clause go to the heart of the Bill. I would say that the amendments

do something much more profound and go to the heart of our

understanding of the nature of the relationship between central and

local government. The presence in the clause of the phrase</div>

<a name="06042072000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with the consent of the Secretary

of State&#148;</div> <a name="06042072000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">says something

profound about the Government&#146;s understanding of their

relationship with local government. The fact that the Conservatives

want to remove local authorities&#146; ability to have a role in

providing education says something similarly profound about their

relationship with local government.</div>

<a name="06042072000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">What should local government

be? Is it an arm of the Government&#146;s public service delivery, or

a discrete, autonomous, directly elected tier of government, able to

make its own decisions, accountable to the local community, free to

pursue local policies relevant to local people, and&#151;this is the

key point&#151;free to disagree with central Government? That thought

should be at the heart of our consideration of the relationship between

central and local government. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>Are we prepared to give those in local government the right to disagree

with central Government policy because that is what is wanted by local

people, who elected them, on the basis of their manifesto, to do

something that was important for them in their own area?</div>

<a name="06042072000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government like to pay lip

service to the idea of localism, but whenever they are presented with

an opportunity to legislate, they cannot resist centralising powers. As

we have heard, the clause contains one of 60 mentions in the first 70

pages of the Bill of action by the Secretary of State. Subsection

(5)(b)(ii) demonstrates that even when the Government are prepared to

devolve with one hand, they centralise with the other. That is not good

enough.</div> <a name="06042072000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth

looking at some of the conflicting statements that the Government have

made. For example, the 10-year plan of the Office of the Deputy Prime

Minister contains a local vision. When I looked at that pretty flimsy

document, I did not think that it was much of a vision. Nevertheless,

one of the objectives it lists

is</div><a name="06042072000025"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;devolution and

delegation to the front line, giving local leaders responsibility and

accountability and the opportunity to design services around the needs

of local people&#148;.</div> <a name="06042072000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a

previous sitting of the Committee, when we were discussing clause 1,

the Minister for Schools said,</div>

<a name="06042072000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am not arguing that

locally elected politicians do not have difficult decisions to make

about local priorities. That is what they are elected to do and that is

an appropriate role for local government.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report, Standing Committee E,</i>30 March 2006; c.

107.]</div><a name="06042072000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later, she said,</div>

<a name="06042072000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Local authorities have

an important role to play in school organisation in the broadest sense.

The legislation will increase that role.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 30 March 2006; c.

120.]</div><a name="06042072000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure that clause

7 supports that view. Later still, the right hon. Lady said,</div>

<a name="06042072000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;local authorities should be able

to determine their own arrangements to make sure that they work for

their parents and their community.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,

Standing Committee E,</i>30 March 2006; c.

153.]</div><a name="06042072000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the heart of the

issue. Are we prepared to give local authorities the freedom to make

decisions based on what local people want or are we

not?</div><a name="06042072000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Conservatives

also have conflicting views on localism, as I know from having

discussed such matters privately with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis

and Littlehampton. He is not entirely sympathetic to his party&#146;s

current fashion of going local&#151;perhaps he will intervene on me

if he disagrees&#151;but the leader of his party has

stated:</div> <a name="06042072000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

believe that government should be closer to the people, not further

away. We want to see more local democracy, instead of more

centralisation.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that

is the Conservatives&#146; view, why would the hon. Gentleman vote

against our amendment, which would ensure far more local accountability

and less centralisation? That is what his party leader is advocating as

one of his latest new policy wangles.</div>

<a name="06042072000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group of amendments goes to

the heart of our understanding of the proper relationship between

central Government and local government. The hon. Member for Bury,

North, who will speak to his own amendments, has attempted to fetter

and define the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>Secretary of State&#146;s discretion. I am sure that that will at

least narrow the scope for the Secretary of State to intervene, but

that is not good enough for us. This is a matter of principle, and we

will pursue it.</div>

<a name="06042072000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000510"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): I shall speak to

amendments Nos. 180 and 182. Amendment No. 182 would amend schedule 2,

not clause 7, but that does not matter for now because its spirit is

identical to that of amendment No. 180.</div>

<a name="06042072000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some sympathy with

amendment No. 66, which is why I put my name to it. It is important in

that it has enabled us to explore the arguments for and against the

Secretary of State&#146;s veto. I am far more concerned about arguing

the case for amendment No. 180, which makes the point that if the

Secretary of State is to be given the power to exercise a veto, there

would be a contradiction with the spirit of the White Paper and the

Bill&#151;which give greater emphasis to the voice of

parents&#151;if that veto were exercised when a significant number of

parents wished their children to attend a new community school. At the

heart of this group of amendments, and the other two groups of

amendments to the clause, is the precise relationship between the roles

of parents, the local authority and central Government. It is misguided

to characterise this as a debate between those who are utterly

centralist and those who put the voice of parents at the forefront of

every decision about the future of our schooling system. I do not see

it that way. It is a question of striking the right balance between

parents, the local authority and central

Government.</div><a name="06042072000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without

revisiting the debate on the previous group of amendments, specifically

amendment No. 179, my argument with the arbitrary selection of 50

parents as an automatic trigger for a new school is that it ignores

certain practical realities. For example, if there were another group

of 51 parents who campaigned vigorously against the opening of a new

school, how could it be logical to allow the voice of the 50 to have

priority? If those 50 parents happened to have children in year 11 and

were unlikely to have any future interest in the school, how could it

be logical to give them the key power to influence the building of a

new school?</div><a name="06042072000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said in

our debate on the previous group of amendments that I was fearful that

the Opposition might take on board some of my criticisms and thereby

improve their amendments, but I am now relaxed because it is clear that

they have not. If they wished to improve the amendment, it would surely

make more sense to establish a percentage of the eligible body of

parents as the threshold figure to trigger the request for a new

school. Fifty parents in a rural area with a small school may be an

overwhelming majority of eligible

parents.</div><a name="06042072000037"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000511"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way

and for his helpful advice. If we were to table such an amendment on

Report, would it attract his

support?</div><a name="06042072000038"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000512"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> It would give me food for thought. However, I

have phrased amendment No. 180 to take that point on board. Plucking

out an arbitrary figure or percentage in Committee is probably not the

best 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>way to proceed, which is why my amendment suggests that such matters

should be dealt with by regulations under secondary legislation,

because that would allow for a period of more careful consideration and

consultation on what the right percentage should

be.</div><a name="06042072000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.

Friend the Minister&#146;s explanation of why the Government

considered a threshold and rejected it is probably sound. Arbitrary

figures in such circumstances can lead to all kinds of unintended

consequences. It is probably better to come to a judgment with all the

evidence than to have a single trigger, because single triggers can

vary by accident. For example, the expulsion of two children from a

school would affect the threshold for the number or percentage of

parents who could demand a new school. Such small, practical matters

must be considered, which is why the issue would be dealt with better

by secondary

legislation.</div><a name="06042072000470"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15

pm</div><a name="06042072000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have spent

most of the 20 or 30 years of my political life encouraging the voices

of parents to get more of them involved in decisions on their

children&#146;s education and the overall planning of education in

their local district. That is not easy. We should not overestimate the

simplicity of such matters. I am arguing not against giving parents a

voice, but in favour of balancing the voice of some parents with that

of others and the wider community. We have to recognise that in

planning a local education service, there needs to be an authority that

takes on board the interests of all parents and children in the

district&#151;not only the interests of parents of children currently

in school, but those of the next generation, looking 10 or 20 years

ahead. We need an authority that can look not only at the current wider

situation, but take longer-term decisions. Understandably, most parents

are interested primarily in what happens to their own child, in their

own school, for the period that that child is at that school. That is

why I have put down markers pointing out that handing over supreme

decision making to a small number of parents probably is not in the

longer-term community

interest.</div><a name="06042072000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Factors

relevant to school performance also are at the heart of the amendments.

The weakness in the Conservatives&#146; argument is that they start

from a hugely ideological position that local education authorities are

disastrous bureaucratic obstructions to the advancement of education in

this country. Frankly, if that is their view, I am surprised that they

are even fielding candidates in the local elections in two

week&#146;s time, but that is something that they will have to

discuss with their own

electorate.</div><a name="06042072000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a

view defies the reality that, during the 136 years in which we have had

some form of local education authority in the United Kingdom, the

schooling system generally has advanced. Levels of achievement among

our children have improved significantly&#151;if they have not always

improved year on year, they are certainly doing so now&#151;and local

authorities have played an important role in that. That is not to say

that local authorities are the driving force behind the quality of

education, or that there are not better and poorer local authorities,

but to take as a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>starting point a sweeping generalisation that local authorities are an

obstruction and make no contribution whatever to the provision of

quality education in a given area is

non-credible.</div><a name="06042072000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we

look at Ofsted&#146;s frequent thematic and annual reports, and its

reports on individual schools, we do not find it drawing a hugely close

relationship between the performance of an individual school and that

of a local authority. The fact remains that there are many local

authorities in the United Kingdom that in recent years have received

extremely good Ofsted reports, but still contain schools that are in

difficulties. Furthermore, there are many good local authorities in the

United Kingdom that more recently have obtained extremely good reports

from the comprehensive assessment conducted by the Audit Commission,

but that still contain within their boundaries schools in great

difficulties. It is a mistake to assume that there is a direct

relationship between the quality of the local authority and that of the

education in all the schools within that authority's

borders.</div><a name="06042072000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000513"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): Does the hon.

Gentleman agree that the ideological position is not ours, because we

did not produce the White Paper or the Bill? As I have said, the White

Paper will take power away from local authorities and give it to

parents and to governing and parent councils, which would be a move

away from LEAs. That is because the Prime Minister and the Minister

recognise that the LEAs are failing. It is not our ideological

position; we did not produce the White Paper. The hon.

Gentleman&#146;s party

did.</div><a name="06042072000045"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000514"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> With respect, I suggest that the hon. Lady reads

the White Paper and looks at the Bill more carefully, because that is

not my interpretation. The White Paper argues for a different

relationship between schools and their local education authority, not

for the abolition of LEAs. The failure of the main opposition party to

understand the shifting relationship between schools and LEAs is at the

heart of the weakness of its position on the Bill and of its

amendments.</div><a name="06042072000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would

have thought that there was overwhelming consensus among those involved

in the management and evaluation of education that the key factors that

determine whether a school succeeds are: the quality of management and

teaching; the nature and the flexibility of the curriculum; the

admissions policy that determines which children gain access to which

schools; and wider issues such as parental engagement and the

relationship with the local community. Those are the themes that come

out time and again in Ofsted&#146;s specific reports, thematic

reports and annual reports. I do not recall any Ofsted report saying

that the way for a school to improve its weaknesses would be simply to

transfer its ownership from the local authority to an external

body.</div><a name="06042072000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not arguing

against greater diversity of ownership; I think that it has a role in

injecting an element of competition into the system, which I believe

helps to drive up standards. What I am arguing against is the

simplistic assumption that diversity of ownership can in itself

override the key factors of the quality of management, leadership and

teaching, the flexibility of the curriculum and the nature of the

intake.</div>

John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): The

hon. Gentleman is absolutely right about the criteria that define a

good school. They might be summed up as expectations. Expectations are

critical in all the areas that he described&#151;leadership, quality

of teaching and learning, and the quality of the home-school

relationship. He is also right that those things are, in essence, more

important than structure, but structure can be inhibiting. We should

consider the role of those who manage and resource schools&#151;those

to whom the schools are answerable&#151;because they can inhibit the

qualities that he described. That is at the heart of the White

Paper&#146;s consideration and the Bill, is it

not?</div><a name="06042072000049"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000516"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I agree that those factors can inhibit, but they

can also encourage and strengthen. For every one example of a school in

difficulties that happens to be a community school, or that happens to

be located in the area of a less than effective local authority, any

Member of this House could, from their experience and constituencies,

quote examples of first-class, high-performing community schools, and

local authorities that are instrumental in driving up performance

across their district. I do not imagine for one moment that the

Opposition will listen to, or take on board, what I say, but I want to

get it on record that the sweeping generalisation that LEAs are an

obstruction to the advancement of educational improvement is naive and

misguided.</div>

<a name="06042072000050"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000517"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman paid as much

attention to my remarks as I am paying attention to his. The purpose of

the amendments was not to say that local authorities are incapable of

providing a decent education; if that was our view, we would not

support the Bill at all, because as the Minister said, it gives new

powers to local authorities. We are comfortable with that. The

amendment is all about providing diversity, because at the moment the

overwhelming majority of schools are community schools. The hon.

Gentleman has himself said that the injection of diversity will help to

drive up standards. If we continue to produce more community schools,

we will decrease diversity, because community schools are the

overwhelming majority of schools in this

country.</div><a name="06042072000051"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000518"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> It is true that the majority of schools are

community schools. However, the concept of diversity should be

considered more widely than simply in the context of governance and

ownership. There is a powerful argument to be made that the key

weakness of our system for many years&#151;I do not put a date on

that; I am not pointing the finger at the Conservative

Government&#151;has been the absence of diversity within our schools

and of sufficient flexibility within the curriculum. Those things are

as important as providing a diversity of schools with slightly

different

characteristics.</div><a name="06042072000052"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000519"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I strongly endorse the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

point about the importance of diversity within schools; we do not

concentrate on that when we get so focused on the diversity of

structures. Does he agree that, in preventing the setting-up of any new



<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>community schools, the effect of the Conservatives&#146; amendment

would be to reduce choice, not increase

it?</div><a name="06042072000053"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000520"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> That is exactly the point I made earlier; it

would be a contradiction if the Government who wanted to encourage a

greater voice for parents and greater parental involvement used the

Secretary of State&#146;s veto to deny the clearly expressed wishes

of parents.</div><a name="06042072000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that his amendment was

designed to achieve greater diversity. I fully accept that the

Opposition&#146;s position is not to abolish local authorities

completely or take them out of the system. However, I challenge their

unquestioned assumption that the mass transfer of community schools to

foundation school or some other status would inevitably lead to higher

standards and better opportunities for children in a way that could not

be achieved by other means.</div>

<a name="06042072000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I endorse what my right hon.

Friend the Minister said earlier about the range of measures that the

Bill encourages when schools have clearly been in difficulty for some

time. Pointing the finger at the local education authority as the sole

cause of a school&#146;s difficulties is absolutely misguided. In my

experience, when a school is in difficulties it is

largely&#151;almost entirely&#151;due to a failure of management.

The simplest way of turning a school around must be to improve the

quality of management and leadership; everything else follows from

that.</div> <a name="06042072000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I challenge the

notion that the mass transfer of community schools to foundation school

status would have a dramatic and sweeping effect. Earlier, the hon.

Gentleman gave figures about the differing performances of foundation

schools and community schools at GCSE. I think he said that of

community school and foundation school pupils respectively, 38 per

cent. and 44 per cent. got five A* to C grades. Those are raw

statistics, which we have to consider carefully. They take no account

of the respective intake of those categories of school, or of the level

of achievement of the children who go to them aged 11. That undermines

any argument that the hon. Gentleman is making. It was significant that

he decided at that point to focus on the raw statistics, whereas

previously when talking about underperformance he focused on

value-added measures rather than raw statistics. If we want to compare

the performance of foundation and community schools, we should look at

the aggregated, value-added statistics. I do not know what they are,

but they should be

explored.</div><a name="06042072000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000521"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Edward Leigh</b> (Gainsborough) (Con): To better inform the

Committee, I have obtained some results from schools in the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s constituency. Some 35 per cent. of pupils at Broad

Oak high school, a community school, achieved five A* to C

grades&#151;level 2&#151;while those at Bury Church of England high

school, a voluntary-aided school, achieved 76 per cent. Why does the

hon. Gentleman think that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000522"></a>Mr.

those figures, because they bring me to the exact point I was going to

make. I should like to put on 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>record the figures for the comparative intakes for schools in London,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000524"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I am going to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

question. I can see that he is restless. The answer in terms of the two

schools in my constituency is that their differential intake is

significant. The Broad Oak school represents one of the poorest parts

of my constituency. It is an excellent school that has made great leaps

forward in recent years. It happens to be located about 100 yd from

where I was born, so I know it quite well. Bury Church of England high

school is also an excellent school, but its intake spreads for a radius

of about 25 miles. If the hon. Gentleman compares the two

schools&#146; intake, the figures for free school meals and number of

children whose first language is not English, that will give him the

answer to his

question.</div><a name="06042072000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come back

to the situation in London and the most recent figures for the intake

of community schools and foundation schools. If we look at the ethnic

mix in London&#146;s foundation schools, we find that the proportion

of children from Afro-Caribbean backgrounds is about 50 per cent. lower

than in community schools. The proportion of children from Bangladeshi

and Pakistani backgrounds in foundation schools is also about 50 per

cent. lower than in community schools. If we look at the free school

meals index, we find that the proportion of children on free school

meals in Roman Catholic and Church of England schools is about 50 per

cent. lower than in community

schools.</div><a name="06042072000062"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000525"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The left often wax lyrical about the idea that

somehow intake is to blame or is responsible for the performance of a

school. I believe that the school itself is either a good school or a

poor school. If we consider the children who qualify for free school

meals in foundation schools and voluntary aided schools, we see the

same results: 16.8 per cent. of children in community schools who

receive free school meals achieve five or more good GCSEs, compared

with 23.7 per cent. of such children in voluntary aided schools and

20.4 per cent. in foundation schools. Even for those children,

foundation and voluntary aided schools perform

better.</div>

<a name="06042072000063"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000526"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I am not waxing lyrical, nor am I pointing the

finger of blame at any single factor among all the factors affecting

school performance. I am saying that the naive assumption that

transferring a school from one status to another will automatically

improve conditions is just not tenable. There are many easier ways to

improve school performance before taking that step.</div>

<a name="06042072000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Widening diversity in the

important 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>option&#151;that is why I was prepared to support the Bill on Second

Reading&#151;but I do not see it as a panacea. We are misguiding and

deceiving ourselves if we lead ourselves to believe that it is. Nor do

I think that the Government necessarily think that it is the only

possible course of action in response to clear cases in which schools

have been underperforming for a number of

years.</div><a name="06042072000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had better

bring my remarks to a close, but I want to make the point that

amendment No. 180, which calls for the ballot of parents, would be

helpful to those who want to change the status of schools, because it

would give greater legitimacy to the call for a change of status. The

difficulty with the alternative approach of having a minimum number of

parents is that it would remain a divisive issue, because almost

certainly there would be an equal or greater number of parents who

would feel aggrieved that a small minority had been able to secure

their own preference for a change of status. I commend amendments Nos.

180 and 182 to the

Committee.</div><a name="06042072000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000527"></a><b class="B">Dr.

make a few comments in opposition to amendment No. 26, but before doing

so I should say to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton

how terribly sorry I am that he did not go to school in Durham. We have

some excellent schools in Durham&#151;I should add that they are

doing particularly well under the current Government&#151;and I am

sure that one of them would have wholeheartedly welcomed the hon.

Gentleman.</div> <a name="06042072000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman referred to the majority report of the Education and Skills

Committee, of which I am a member. We asked the Government to consider

allowing local authorities to put forward proposals for community

schools in competitions for a new school. Support for that in the

Committee was pretty widespread, with the exception of the official

Opposition. We are very happy that the Government listened to the

arguments that were put forward; that clearly demonstrates that they

are in listening mode.</div>

<a name="06042072000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is because it is Labour

Members who do not want to be unduly prescriptive, particularly about

parents&#146; wishes, where there are good local reasons for a

community school being proposed. We recognise that there may be a

limited set of circumstances in which it would be appropriate for a

community school to be proposed. Nevertheless, if we are to enable

local authorities, parents and others to respond to local

circumstances, it is obviously vital that this possibility

exists.</div> <a name="06042072000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to

emphasise the point that this opinion was widespread in the Select

Committee, because it is the official Opposition who are terribly out

of line in respect of allowing new community schools to be proposed. In

this morning&#146;s sitting we heard a lot about parent power. I

think that the Opposition were supporting that, but they seem to be

prescribing when they will support it, and that is

illogical.</div><a name="06042072000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000528"></a><b class="B">Greg

Mulholland</b> (Leeds, North-West) (LD): I shall speak to

amendment No. 66. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East talked

about the new localism that is sweeping the other two parties at

present; they 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>are finally catching up with the Liberal Democrats in that regard.

Localism is of course supposed to be at the heart of the Bill. We are

told that it is specifically about parental choice. However, if it is

about parental choice, and if parents want a new community school, why

on earth should they not be allowed to have one without the Secretary

of State having to give her

say-so?</div><a name="06042072000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recently

had a school reorganisation in my constituency. We have some excellent

schools in the locality, but it was notable that there was a very

strong body of opinion in support of one of the local community

schools. It has excellent results, which are comparable to those of the

local voluntary aided and voluntary controlled schools. Therefore, in

some areas there is a strong body of opinion among parents that a

community school is right for their area, for very clear

reasons.</div> <a name="06042072000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Conservatives&#146; animosity to community schools is a strange

premise when sat next to their supposed commitment to parent power. It

is clear from the messages coming through that they regard community

schools as second-rate&#151;as schools that do not compare favourably

with other schools. That is an interesting message to put across to all

the parents and governors of the excellent community schools that there

are throughout the country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000536"></a>Greg

criteria will the Secretary of State be using to judge matters? Will

the right hon. Lady give an example of when the veto would be used,

because that will make the issue more clear? Why are the Government

prescribing the setting up of a particular school? Surely it should be

a matter of local choice that is based simply on local want and need.

Research undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research

shows that there is no significant difference between types of schools

in the improvement in pupil performance between prior attainment at key

stage 2 and GCSE. It means that there is a flaw in the arguments

expressed by Conservative Front Benchers about amendment No. 76. As the

hon. Member for Bury, North made clear, we cannot simply look at

results without examining intake, admissions policies and the

percentage of children receiving free school

meals.</div><a name="06042072000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The simple

fundamental point is that we all believe in parental choice. We are

told that it is the purpose of the Bill yet, without the Secretary of

State&#146;s say-so, parents will not be given the opportunity to set

up a new community school. That is perverse. There is no reason why

local authorities should have to seek permission from the Secretary of

State to build a new community school if the community wants one. It

flies in the face of the localism that is supposed to be at the heart

of the Bill. I suggest that, if the Minister wants this to be a truly

local education Bill, the veto is dropped. We will then support the

clause. Alternatively, she can continue to pander to the

Conservatives.</div><a name="06042072000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000537"></a><b class="B">Meg

are having an interesting debate on the group of amendments. I wish to

speak to amendment No. 66 because I am sure that there is a cross-party

consensus on the belief of decentralisation and local decision making,

something that I began championing at the start of my political career

and shall continue to champion. It is important to remember the

and supporting schools in their

be interesting to comment briefly on the ability of parents to

recognise whether a school is good. I believe in parent power, but

Ofsted figures have shown that parents&#146; views of a

school&#146;s performance are often out of kilter with its actual

performance, particularly at primary level where loyalties to the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>school kick in without parents using their critical faculties or having

access to the classrooms. Some schools shut parents out, so they are

not always able to tell what is really going on. I welcome the emphasis

that the Bill puts on the strategic role of the local authority, giving

it enhanced powers to direct what happens in the local area and to

commission good education.</div>

recognise that local education authorities have failed in the past. I

have had the misfortune to represent three different London boroughs

that have had difficulties with their education systems. I am now the

Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch. Hackney LEA failed its

children, so the Government intervened and established the Learning

Trust, which, in conjunction with strong political executive leadership

from the elected Mayor and his cabinet colleagues, has now set a clear

direction for education in Hackney.</div>

<a name="06042072000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trust has listened to what

parents want&#151;more mixed and non-denominational

schools&#151;and has set out in conjunction with Government to

deliver those things by the mechanisms that they have made available.

It has embraced such schools as part of a family of Hackney schools set

up and established by the political and education leadership of the

borough.</div> <a name="06042072000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">We see the

benefits of good LEAs, soon to be children&#146;s authorities. It is

right that they are to have this new important strategic role, but we

also need a mechanism whereby Government can step in when LEAs or

children&#146;s authorities fail their children. It would be wrong

for LEAs that are not doing a good job to be allowed to go their own

way and to continue on a path that is not good for local children and

is not delivering for

them.</div><a name="06042072000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There must be a

balance. I believe that local decisions should be made at the most

appropriate level. I am keen to hear from my right hon. Friend the

to use the veto. It should not be used willy-nilly, but it should

exist, just as in planning there is a mechanism for a call-in to the

Secretary of State or, in London, to the Mayor of London. I am keen for

the Minister to emphasise exactly when she thinks the veto could be

used. I hope she will tell me that she is not planning to use it all

the time. She is on the record as saying that she would not be keen to

veto routinely. Will she give us an idea about where the balance would

lie?</div>

bias in favour of one school or another&#151;in favour of community

schools or against them. We are simply trying to reflect what parents

want. Parents are probably pretty vague about what a community school,

a voluntary aided school or a voluntary controlled school is. I am

sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not allow me to intervene on his

speech, even though I am happy to give way to him. I must say to him

that all parents can do is look at results.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000540"></a>Mr.

way.</div><a name="06042072000093"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000541"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> I did not take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

intervention simply because it immediately followed another

intervention. I was waiting for him to ask to intervene again and I

would have been happy to give way, but he did not do

so.</div>

<a name="06042072000094"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000542"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I did try a second time, but let us not dwell on

it.</div> <a name="06042072000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">As was said very

honestly by the hon. Member for Bury, North, for the most part parents

are interested only in their children and in their children&#146;s

school&#151;why should they not be? They want to get their children

into the best schools and they can look only at the results.</div>

<a name="06042072000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">For instance, a parent in

Leeds, North-West would see that the 79 per cent. of Abbey Grange

Church of England high school&#146;s pupils achieved five A* to

C-grade GCSE passes. It is a voluntary aided school. Lawnswood school

is a community school. Parents would not have any particular bias

against community schools, but only 42 per cent. of its pupils achieved

five passes at those grades. I believe that Prince Henry&#146;s

grammar school in Otley, which is a comprehensive school and is

voluntary controlled, achieved a figure of 73 per cent., and Ralph

Thoresby high school, which is a community school, achieved 58 per

cent.</div> <a name="06042072000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not a

question of being for community schools or against them. The evidence

tends to show that voluntary aided or voluntary controlled foundation

schools have a better record. I fully accept that the hon. Member for

Leeds, North-West has local knowledge about Leeds, North-West and I

have none. I can look only at the results and I suspect that that is

also what parents do. They do not know in detail about those schools

until they look at the results and I have outlined what they will

find.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000543"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument underlines

the fatuous nature of league tables. As many hon. Members have already

made it clear, the raw results often depend far more on the intake and

the area. The conclusion that one school is inevitably better because

the children get better results cannot be drawn by comparing them; that

is not an accurate

distinction.</div><a name="06042072000099"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000544"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am not sure how else parents draw a conclusion.

Apparently, the Liberal Democrats are now against any evaluation

available to parents.</div>

<a name="06042072000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">League tables are quite useful,

but of course they do not explain the whole story and there may be

other reasons why parents want their children to go to a particular

school. I shall not discuss the schools in the constituencies of all

Committee members, just those of hon. Members who have spoken in this

debate. Let us consider the schools in the constituency of the hon.

Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier). Cardinal Pole

Roman Catholic school, a voluntary aided school that is presumably in a

difficult area, has a 53 per cent. pass rate. However, Homerton 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>college of technology has a staggeringly low 23 per cent. pass rate. The

hon. Lady can intervene on me, but if I were a parent living in

Hackney, I should much rather see my child get into Cardinal Pole Roman

Catholic school, with 53 per cent., than Homerton college of

technology, with 23 per

cent.</div><a name="06042072000101"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000545"></a>Meg

Hillier:</b> The hon. Gentleman is comparing apples and pears.

Homerton college of technology is in the process of closure as a school

and will be reopening as a new city technology academy. It has been

unwinding as a school and has had

problems.</div><a name="06042072000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">School GCSE

passes in Hackney have increased from 30 per cent. to 47 per cent. over

the past two and a bit years, which is greater than Westminster

schools, if that is of any interest to the hon. Gentleman. One new

school is opening in September, another is due to open in September

2007 and a further two or three city technology academies are in the

pipeline.</div><a name="06042072000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sorry for my

long intervention, Mr. Cook. However, education in Hackney is on the

up. The hon. Gentleman cannot compare Homerton and Cardinal

Pole.</div><a name="06042072000104"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000546"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am sure that it is on the up. I am not trying to

decry the difficulties from which Hackney suffers or has faced in the

past. The fact is that in the past it has had some of the worst results

in the country, although no doubt it is making progress, which is good.

All I am saying is, how else can parents make such

judgments?</div><a name="06042072000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whichever

Committee member&#146;s constituency we look at, we seem to find an

extraordinarily common pattern emerging. Let us deal with the

Minister&#146;s constituency. Why does Arrow Vale community high

school, a community comprehensive school, achieve 34 per cent. and St.

Augustine&#146;s Catholic high school, which is also a comprehensive

and presumably has to abide by all the regulations ensuring that it is

a proper comprehensive school, get 71 per cent.? No doubt she will tell

me that there is a reason for that. There must be a pattern

emerging.</div><a name="06042072000106"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000547"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give

way?</div><a name="06042072000107"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000548"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I give way to the

expert.</div><a name="06042072000108"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000549"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I am not clear what conclusions the hon.

Gentleman is drawing. He is in a state of denial about the impact of

geography, social class, the first language of the family and previous

educational achievement. The only conclusion that we could draw from

his argument is that everyone should convert to Catholicism. What else

is he

saying?</div><a name="06042072000109"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000550"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am not in denial. If we look at the value-added

impact on schools, a consistent picture emerges of voluntary aided,

voluntary controlled or foundation schools performing better than

community schools. Parents look at the league tables and come away with

that inevitable conclusion about their own area.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div><a name="06042072000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am quite lucky in my

constituency. I could mention Caistor grammar school, which has 98 per

cent.&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06042072000111"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000551"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. Can we make this the last example,

please?</div><a name="06042072000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000552"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Yes, I do not want to weary you, Mr. Cook. I will

not talk about the Queen Elizabeth high school, with 98 per cent. But

what about the William Farr Church of England faith school in

Welton&#151;a comprehensive school with a comprehensive

intake&#151;with an 80 per cent. pass rate, compared with Cherry

Willingham community school with only a 50 per cent. pass rate? What is

going on? Cherry Willingham is only three or four miles from Welton.

Both schools are in suburban, middle-class, prosperous villages in the

east midlands, just north of Lincoln. Why does William Farr Church of

England school, have an 80 per cent. pass rate when Cherry Willingham

community school&#146;s is only 50 per cent.?</div>

<a name="06042072000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a matter of huge

concern for parents, is it not? They are not interested in all the

debates between political parties. With my local knowledge, I know what

they are desperate to do. They are desperate to get their children into

William Farr Church of England school, because of its results. It has

an entirely old-fashioned catchment area. Anyone who lives within 3,000

yd of it gets in; anyone who lives 3,001 yd from it does not. It

happens to have a superb head teacher. It is a very good school with a

wonderful ethos, and it delivers the

results.</div><a name="06042072000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the

hon. Member for Leeds, North-West that we are not biased against a

particular type of school just because it is called a community school,

although those schools happen to be the ones run by local authorities.

We are just reflecting what parents tell us. They are voting with their

feet. They want to get their kids into schools that deliver the best

results, and when they look at the various schools, they find that

those are the schools with more independence&#151;precisely the type

of school that the Minister wants.</div>

<a name="06042072000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why the Minister is one

of the forces of light. We modernisers must fight together against the

reactionary elements on the Liberal Democrat Benches. We are on the

same side in this. That is what the whole debate is about: our two

parties are at one on the issue, and we are fighting a rearguard action

against the Liberal Democrats, because they do not seem to understand

what is going on in the real world. They are still living in a world in

which the local authority knows best. It does not. Parents know best,

and that is why the amendments to which my hon. Friend the Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has been speaking are so worth

while.</div><a name="06042072000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000553"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jacqui Smith):</b> Let me gather

together the remaining scraps of my career following the words of the

hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). We have had a very good

debate on the amendments and clause 7&#151;quite rightly, because the

clause and this part of the Bill are fundamental to the development of

our overall policy to raise standards by introducing a new relationship

between schools, local authorities, parents and central

Government.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div><a name="06042072000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with

my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North that this is not a debate

about centralism versus localism. It is a debate about how we envisage

the new role of the local authority, building on the

Government&#146;s work in the &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;

change for children programme, the 10-year child care strategy, the

&#147;Youth Matters&#148; Green Paper and our 14-to-19 reforms.

They all reflect the idea of the local authority as strategic planner

and commissioner&#151;a role, interestingly enough, that the hon.

Member for Brent, East argued strongly for during debate on clause

6.</div><a name="06042072000118"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000554"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The Minister will recall that I said that local

authorities should have both roles. My argument now is that we should

have both roles for schools as

well.</div><a name="06042072000119"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000555"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> That is the case, and it will continue to be the

case after the passage of the Bill. The point, though, is that in

keeping with the argument that we have made generally about local

government, the schools White Paper said that we now need to extend

that role to the school system, building on existing good practice in

many local

authorities.</div><a name="06042072000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

intention of the Bill is to do precisely that. During debate not just

on clause 7 but on previous clauses, we have discussed how local

authorities will increasingly be commissioners of education, acting as

the champions of pupils and parents, promoting choice and diversity and

safeguarding and assuring quality. This part of the Bill puts more

flesh on the bones by making specific provision for opening and closing

schools and making changes to them. The arrangements will put in place

a new framework to consolidate the local authority&#146;s role as

commissioner of provision and open up opportunities for other providers

to supply the necessary

places.</div><a name="06042072000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move to the

specifics of the amendments. Amendment No. 26, which is linked to

amendment No. 21, aims to remove the Secretary of State&#146;s

ability to give consent for a local authority to publish proposals for

a community school as part of the competition. Part of this debate has

been about the history of the development of that policy from the point

at which we published the White Paper. We said that in keeping the

local authorities&#146; commissioner role, it was appropriate that no

more community schools be

established.</div><a name="06042072000473"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

pm</div><a name="06042072000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.

Friend the Member for City of Durham pointed out, since then, as we

have taken forward the proposals, we have listened carefully to

representations from hon. Members&#151;in particular, my hon.

Friends&#151;and incidentally to representations from the

cross-party, Conservative-dominated, Local Government Association.

<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Lord Sandy indeed. We now agree that, in some

circumstances, a new community school might make

sense.</div>

<a name="06042072000123"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000556"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Can the Minister assure the Committee therefore that

had there not been an impending Labour rebellion, that concession would

not have been made?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div><a name="06042072000124"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000557"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> It is not a case of rebellion. As my hon. Friend

the Member for City of Durham said, it is a case of our publishing a

White Paper and responding to the subsequent representations. That is

how sensible Governments

behave.</div><a name="06042072000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7

allows local authorities to enter a community school into a competition

with the consent of the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Member

for Hackney, South and Shoreditch, and the hon. Member for Leeds,

North-West have asked me to give a bit more detail about the criteria

that the Secretary of State would use. It is worth reminding the

Committee&#151;particularly the hon. Gentleman, given his

question&#151;that on Second Reading, the Secretary of State agreed

that there should be further discussion in Committee about the criteria

for allowing a community school to be entered into a competition, and

about whether those criteria should be set out in

legislation.</div><a name="06042072000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right

hon. Friend and I are women of our word, which is why, having given

further thought to the matter, I can give the Committee more

information about the way in which we want the system to work. We want

to bring clarity and transparency into the system, and remove some of

the uncertainty about when a community school can be entered into a

competition. That is why on Report we will bring forward amendments

that will require the Secretary of State to make regulations to specify

criteria that when met would allow local authorities to enter a

community school into a competition without the need for explicit

consent, and set out in the Bill the issues with which such tests

should be concerned, such as the educational standards and diversity of

existing schools in the authority. My hon. Friend the Member for

Hackney, South and Shoreditch rightly identified those as important

elements of good local authorities, which we should be encouraging.

Regulations will also set out criteria and tests that will debar some

local authorities from entering a community school into a competition

completely. We shall provide illustrative regulations for

that.</div> <a name="06042072000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say a

little more about those tests. As I said, we want to give certainty and

reassurance to high-performing local authorities with diverse

provision, but we also want to demonstrate to the weakest and least

diverse authorities that they should open up opportunities to other

providers in order to drive up school standards. The regulations will

allow local authorities with an annual performance assessment of

4&#151;the highest score&#151;to enter a community school into a

competition automatically, without the need for the Secretary of

State&#146;s consent. We should trust those high-performing local

authorities to decide what type of school would best serve the needs of

their communities. Currently, there are 11 local authorities with an

APA of 4.</div> <a name="06042072000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">For reasons

that I outlined, three groups of local authorities will not be

permitted to propose a community school: local authorities with an APA

of 1, which are those with the poorest performance in children&#146;s

services; local authorities with an APA of 2 and in which less than 15

per cent. of schools are foundation or voluntary schools; and local

authorities with an APA of 2 and more than 15 per cent. of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>schools in Ofsted category 4&#151;in other words, badly-performing

authorities that either have a large proportion of schools that are

failing or have low levels of

diversity.</div><a name="06042072000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,

hon. Members will note that the requirement to have 15 per cent.

foundation and voluntary schools is rather more stringent than the

requirement for 10 per cent. of places to be provided by trust or

voluntary schools or academies, as was envisaged by amendment No. 88 to

clause 2, tabled by Opposition Members. We think there should be at

least 15 per cent. of such schools before community schools are allowed

in those authorities.</div>

<a name="06042072000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remaining 130 local

authorities will be able to enter a competition with the Secretary of

State&#146;s consent.</div>

<a name="06042072000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local authorities that do not

fall into the criteria set by the regulations will, as the Bill now

provides, be able to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s consent to

enter a competition. The Secretary of State will of course decide each

case on its individual merits, but I can assure my hon. Friends that

there will be no automatic presumption against a new community school

and that my right hon. Friend will use objective criteria to inform her

decisions. Those criteria will include the openness of the local

authority to new providers, its track record in promoting diversity,

and standards in local schools and the local authority

overall.</div> <a name="06042072000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the

Secretary of State would consider every case on its merits, for

guidance, and for the Committee&#146;s information, I can say that

she would generally expect to approve requests from local authorities

to enter a community school into a competition in the case of local

authorities with a rating of 3 in the most recent CPA/APA and with a

lower than average percentage of schools in Ofsted category 4, or with

a higher than average percentage of voluntary and foundation schools

and academies. Some 90 authorities would fall into that

category.</div><a name="06042072000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think

that those are fair and clear criteria that provide an incentive for

local authorities to improve educational standards and to increase

diversity in their provision. It is also worth emphasising that in

approving the request for an authority to publish proposals for a

community school in a competition, we will not be giving a green light

for the new school to be a community school. In those circumstances,

the schools adjudicator will make the final decision on whether the

proposals should be approved. The adjudicator will consider the

authorities&#146; proposals and any others that have been submitted

by other bodies, and will have regard to guidance issued by the

Secretary of State. That will emphasise the need to consider all the

proposals on their merits and to make a judgment on which proposals

will best meet the needs of the area and the community and contribute

to high educational standards.</div>

<a name="06042072000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made clear our

commitment to choice and diversity through this clause and our approach

to reform. We hope that many new providers will come forward in

response to the invitation to bid in a competition. Where that is not

the case or the authority has a clear idea for a school that it wishes

to propose, it is right that it should be able to do so. We think that

the arrangements will strike the right balance between encouraging a

more diverse and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>responsive system and allowing continued close local authority

involvement when there are particular reasons for

that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000558"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Will my right hon. Friend clarify one set of

circumstances? Does she accept that, in the case of a large local

authority that included a considerable number of medium-sized towns

with only one school, one of the unintended consequences of extending

the diversity of the authority&#146;s overall provision could be to

reduce the diversity within a given catchment area? For example, if a

community school in difficulties was the only school serving a town and

had to be replaced by either a Church of England school or a Roman

Catholic school, that would reduce the freedom of choice for some

parents who would rather choose a secular school than a faith school.

How would that problem be managed? A large number of authorities could

be in precisely that

position.</div><a name="06042072000136"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000559"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> In the criteria that I have spelled out, the trump

criterion is the annual performance assessment of the local authority.

The standards and quality of the local authority come first: if it is 4

or 3 and has few failing schools, it will be able to propose a

community school in a competition regardless of levels of diversity. If

it is less well performing, such factors will be more important. The

case that my hon. Friend made was more about the choice between a faith

school and a non-faith school than about that between a community

school and a non-community school. In a competition, that might be one

of the factors on which representations are made by parents for

consideration, and something that the local authority might want to

bear in mind&#151;assuming that it has not entered the competition

itself&#151;in deciding between proposals. It is a reasonable

representation to make, and a reasonable factor to be borne in mind by

a local authority in such circumstances.</div>

<a name="06042072000137"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000560"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> To pursue that point, is my right hon. Friend

saying that in the course of the judging of the competition, there will

be a process in which parents will be able to express their views on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000561"></a>Jacqui

else?</div><a name="06042072000140"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000563"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> No, that is not what I said. There are such

circumstances, but they relate to clause 9. I was outlining the

criteria that the Secretary of State would bear in mind in determining

whether a local authority could enter a community school into a

competition, so I spoke in the context of the competition provisions of

clause 7. Permission to enter a community school into a competition is

not endorsement of that school but acceptance that it may take part in

the competition. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div>The competition would, of course, be judged by the adjudicator in those

for a new community school, as distinct from a new school in general,

be fully taken into account. However, we think that, in judging a

competition, the adjudicator&#151;or the local authority, if it has

not entered the competition&#151;is best placed to consider that. In

other words, parental demand and parental views are best exercised in

influencing the decision about the result of the competition rather

than that about the entrants to it. I shall explain in some detail how

I think that should operate.</div>

<a name="06042072000144"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000566"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> As I understand it, the Minister has said that under

the new guidance, 101 authorities will be able to set up a community

school should they wish to do so, and about 73 either will not or

probably will not, because they are in categories that will not be

allowed to set them up. What is her estimate, as an experienced

Minister, of the likelihood of the 101 authorities allowing new schools

to be set up through competition rather than setting up community

schools? Will they go for the community schools or will they use the

provisions of clause 7, notwithstanding the fact that she is now saying

they can set up community schools?</div>

<a name="06042072000145"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000567"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Let me be clear: I did not say that the criteria

that I outlined were criteria for local authorities to set up community

schools. They are criteria allowing local authorities to enter into the

competition that is provided for in clause

7.</div>

<a name="06042072000474"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

pm</div><a name="06042072000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given

everything that we said in relation to clauses 1, 2 and 3, I hope that

local authorities will take what I think is the strong strategic role

of commissioner&#151;that they will lay down the terms of the

competition, encourage new providers to come forward, and use their

abilities to judge between the new providers. That is what I would

prefer to see in future, but I also believe&#151;not least because of

the representations that we have received and the arguments made about

choice, diversity and standards&#151;that there might be

circumstances in which it would be appropriate for a local authority to

enter a community school in a competition. Those circumstances would be

defined by the criteria that I have just

outlined.</div>

<a name="06042072000147"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000568"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that

clarification. It was extremely helpful and encouraging. Will she

commit to putting that exhortation into guidance for local authorities,

so that they too understand the Government&#146;s

intention?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div><a name="06042072000148"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000569"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I think that clause 2 is that exhortation. All our

debate was about that point, and at the beginning of my contribution I

said that we envisage the local authority&#146;s new role as that of

commissioner, encouraging new provision in the system. That was the

exhortation, if exhortation is

needed.</div><a name="06042072000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

shall deal with amendment No. 66 before returning to the important

issue of parents&#146; and others&#146; role in the process. As we

have heard, the amendment would allow local authorities to publish

their own proposals for community schools as part of the competition

without the consent of the Secretary of State and without satisfying

any of the criteria that I have outlined. I explained fully how and why

we will determine whether a local authority will be able to make a

proposal for a community school in a competition, what the criteria are

and, more fundamentally, what that implies about the new role of the

local authority.</div><a name="06042072000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

find ourselves occupying a sort of third way between those who think

that it should not be possible, whatever the circumstances, for local

authorities to enter community schools into competitions and those who

think that the local authorities&#146; role should not change at all

and that the status quo should prevail. That makes me think that we

have got it just about right, but of course I prefer to defend our

proposals on their intrinsic merits rather than merely on the ground

that they are the third way.</div>

<a name="06042072000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate that we want local

authorities to move decisively into a commissioning role. We want to

open up opportunities for new providers and to ensure that the local

authority does not have a de facto veto on new providers by making it

difficult for them to compete against the predominant provider in an

area. We also recognise, however, that it will sometimes make sense for

a local authority to enter a community school into a

competition.</div><a name="06042072000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 76 would limit the Secretary of State&#146;s power to allow a

local authority to publish proposals for a new community or community

special school unless it could provide evidence that such a school

would lead to better results. Although I welcome hon. Members&#146;

commitment to secure measures focused on raising standards, I think

that the proposal is unnecessary and impossible to implement and would

almost certainly lead to unnecessary wrangling and delay.</div>

<a name="06042072000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In setting

out the criteria, I have focused not only on their being fair and

objective but on the local authority&#146;s contribution in its

overall function of raising standards and in raising standards of the

schools in its area. The criteria are not speculative and difficult to

prove like the requirements proposed in the amendment. Although I have

some sympathy with the amendment&#146;s objective, I hope that hon.

Members will feel able not to press it, given my assurances concerning

the criteria for the Secretary of State&#146;s consent.</div>

<a name="06042072000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Speaking to amendments Nos. 180

and 182, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North expressed some

important arguments about the role of parents and emphasised our desire

to develop a new more responsive relationship between the local

authority role and consideration of the views of the broad swathe

of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>parents in an area, and how that links to the relationship with schools.

I understand why my hon. Friend wishes parents to have a significant

voice in such matters. We must find a balance between central

Government, local government, and parents and others with an interest

in education

provision.</div><a name="06042072000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

hope to reassure my hon. Friends by spelling out the way in which we

envisage the process working and the role that parents will have at

different stages. Before publishing an invitation for proposals in a

competition, a local authority must consult widely in the area. Indeed,

before the required statutory consultation on the competition, the

authority might wish to consult on a range of possible options to meet

the need for places in the area. It would certainly make sense for it

particularly to seek the views of parents on its plans. Parents&#146;

views are also built into competition arrangements at a later stage,

when the authority is required to organise at least one public meeting

to inform the public of the proposals received and the arrangements for

making objections and

comments.</div><a name="06042072000156"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000570"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> May I take the Minister back to the circumstances

in which local authorities would not be allowed to enter the

competition to provide a community school? Let us suppose that a

competition was held for a school in, say, a new estate and no outside

competitors came forward? Would the area be left without a school

because the local authority was not allowed to step

in?</div><a name="06042072000157"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000571"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> No, because, as we made clear in the White Paper,

the local authority would always have the fall-back position of being

able to propose a foundation school within the area. There would be no

possibility of there being a community without a school. The local

authority has the important role of consulting parents and others about

the proposals before their

publication.</div><a name="06042072000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 182 would specifically require a ballot of parents in the area,

with majority support required before a proposal in a competition could

be considered further. Let me explain how the system should work and

the role that parents will have. Clause 8 provides that before the

local authority publishes its invitation to make proposals in a

competition, it must consult appropriate persons, having regard to

guidance from the Secretary of State. As my hon. Friend the Member for

Bury, North said, a wide range of stakeholders will probably have an

interest in the proposals. The guidance makes it clear that parents

must be consulted, but so should schools that are to be closed as part

of a reorganisation, primary schools whose pupils would move on to a

proposed secondary school, other local authorities, school staff, local

dioceses, the learning and skills council, district and parish councils

and relevant Members of Parliament. The views of all those individuals

and bodies are important and will be taken into account before the

specification for the necessary school in an area is

finalised.</div>

<a name="06042072000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,

paragraph 5 of schedule 2 provides that regulations may make provision

for objections and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>comments on the proposals when they are published. At that point, as I

said earlier, it would be appropriate for the local authority to ensure

that public meetings are held so that the proposals can be considered.

The illustrative regulations that have been made available to the

Committee show that people may object to or comment on the proposals,

as happens now. The decision makers&#151;the local authority or the

adjudicator&#151;will have to take any comments or objections into

account when considering the proposals and will need to satisfy

themselves that proper consultation took

place.</div><a name="06042072000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

arrangements give ample opportunity for all concerned to make their

views known to the local authority that is holding the competition,

anyone thinking of bringing forward proposals, and those who will be

deciding the competition themselves. I do not think therefore that

there is a need to introduce expensive and cumbersome procedures such

as a local ballet. In fact, I agree with what my hon. Friend said on

Tuesday,

that:</div><a name="06042072000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

question is to what extent campaigns by comparatively small number of

parents are representative of the parent body as a whole. It seems that

the only way to get an answer to that question is through the

collective voice of the people of Bury, North and of Bury, South in the

municipal elections on 4

May.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went on to

say:</div><a name="06042072000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

important to support the normal procedures of democracy rather than

invent devious ways to subvert them.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 18 April 2006; c.

269.]</div><a name="06042072000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that he is

absolutely

right.</div><a name="06042072000163"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000572"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Let me make two quick points. First, if amendment

No. 180 were to be accepted by the Government, it would be difficult

for the Conservatives to vote against it because it is precisely the

mechanism that they proposed in the Education Reform Act 1988, by which

people would have had to vote annually on whether to become a

grant-maintained school. Secondly, amendment No. 180 is subtle because

it does not allow parents to subvert the democratically expressed wish

of the local authority, but merely gives parents the opportunity to

endorse the decision already taken by that

authority.</div><a name="06042072000164"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000573"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I do not doubt that my hon. Friend&#146;s

amendments are extremely subtle. However, I have spelled out the

subtleties and practicalities in the way in which we expect parents and

others to be consulted both before the publication of the competition

proposals, and on the judgment on those

proposals.</div><a name="06042072000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

provisions show that the proposals will be considered properly, and I

hope that my hon. Friend will agree that his amendments are therefore

not needed. It is absolutely right that I have had this opportunity to

spell out the important role that local parents and other stakeholders

will

have.</div><a name="06042072000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

have tried to explain why I think that the Bill as drafted achieves the

right balance, including the clarification that I hope that I have been

able to give about the criteria that we will use for allowing or not

allowing local authorities to enter community schools into

competitions. The process will encourage a more 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div>diverse and dynamic education system while allowing the possibility of

new community schools where the case is sufficiently strong. On that

basis, I invite all hon. Members not to press their

amendments.</div><a name="06042072000167"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000574"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> This has been a good and thorough debate on an

important set of amendments. We have had important new information from

the Minister that is very welcome&#151;up to a

point.</div><a name="06042072000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberals

seem to blame me for the original vision that the Government had for

the Bill. All our amendments would do is restore to the Bill the

Government&#146;s original vision. The Prime Minister said:

</div><a name="06042072000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We need to

see every local authority moving from provider to

commissioner&#148;.</div> <a name="06042072000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

what the amendments would do. On page 116, the White Paper&#151;I did

not write it, the Government

did&#151;says:</div><a name="06042072000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

will also remove the right for local authorities to publish their own

proposals for the establishment of new community

schools.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the

vision in the White Paper, and that is what the amendments seek to

do.</div><a name="06042072000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may say so,

it is slightly disingenuous of the Minister to say that the Government

consulted and listened to representations. In reality, those

concessions were made to Labour rebels in the face of a possible

defeat. They did not need to make those concessions, which contradicted

their own judgment, and in the end did not even succeed in quelling the

rebellion. We could have had a much stronger Bill. The Bill would still

have received a majority of 343 if the Government had not made those

concessions and stuck to the original vision in the White

Paper.</div><a name="06042072000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

made some important announcements on the Secretary of State&#146;s

veto on local authorities proposing new community schools. We shall

look in detail at those provisions when they are published. On the face

of it, from what the Minister has said, they appear to reflect the

Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee&#146;s majority

report, when they

said</div><a name="06042072000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where a

local authority with a good track record in education proposes a

community school that will command the support of parents, the

Secretary of State will not normally

intervene.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

has set out several categories of local authorities that will, in

principle, be able to propose a community school as part of the

competition arrangements and groups of local authorities that will not.

She said that local authorities with an APA of 4 will automatically be

barred from so

doing&#151;</div><a name="06042072000475"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

pm</div><a name="06042072000174"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000575"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> No. Four is the best

score.</div><a name="06042072000175"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000576"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Yes&#151;sorry. Authorities with that score will

automatically be allowed to propose a community school if they wish.

Three groups of local authorities will not be allowed to do so: those

with an APA of 1; those with an APA of 2  if less than 15 per

cent. of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>schools in their area are foundation or voluntary schools; and those

with an APA of 2 if 15 per cent. or more of their schools are Ofsted

category 4. From my calculations, there appear to be 32 local

authorities or thereabouts in that category. It would be helpful if the

Government published lists of the local authorities in question. I

shall table a parliamentary question asking the Government to do so. We

should know who they are and what other action has been taken to deal

with them. There is another list of 30 local authorities that will

probably not be able to propose a community school within the

competition arrangements under clause 7.</div>

<a name="06042072000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be a pity if the

provisions turn out to be concessions to the rebels when we look at

them in more detail, but I am pleased that the worst-performing local

authorities will not be able to propose a community school. I also

welcome the Minister&#146;s saying that she hopes and expects that

local authorities will use the competition provisions of clause 7 and

invite and encourage new providers to propose schools in the local

authority area, and that the ability to propose a new community school

will be the exception, rather than the rule. We will monitor the

implementation of these provisions once clause 7 is

implemented.</div><a name="06042072000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

amendment No. 26 expresses an important point of principle. It returns

the Bill to the original vision of the White Paper and turns into law

what we all know to be the genuine judgment of the Prime Minister, the

Secretary of State and the Minister about what is in the best interests

of this country. In view of its importance, we shall press for a

Division.</div><a name="06042072000178"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000577"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The presence of the Secretary of State&#146;s

veto in the clause is a fundamental point of principle. I am pleased to

hear from the Minister that the Government will table amendments on

Report that at least increase the transparency of the Secretary of

State&#146;s use of the veto. Nevertheless, it will remain in the

Bill, which is not good

enough.</div><a name="06042072000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the

Government have set up the 200 academies that they say they would like

to set up, they will become the largest maintaining authority in

England. This is a thoroughly centralising measure that allows them to

be the largest maintaining authority and have a veto that will

effectively overrule local decision making on the kind of provision

that people want. That is not acceptable to the Liberal Democrats as a

localist party. We shall push this matter to a vote, because it is a

fundamental point of

principle.</div><a name="06042072000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister quoted back at the hon. Member for Bury, North a point that he

made in an earlier sitting&#151;that the best decision maker is the

collective voice at the ballot box. That is our point, too. The best

decision maker in this case is the collective voice at the ballot box,

which is why we should leave it to local authorities to decide. We will

press amendment No. 66 to a

vote.</div><a name="06042072000181"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000578"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> In view of the Minister&#146;s explanation and

the promise of further amendments on Report on the exact criteria that

will be used for the exercise of the veto, I shall not press amendments

Nos. 180 and 182 to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000629"></a>The

now.</div>

<a name="06042072000243"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000630"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Understood, Mr. Cook. I shall make those remarks

at the end of my speech.</div>

<a name="06042072000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Education and Skills

Committee reported on academies in March 2005. Its report questioned

whether the average extra &#163;7,000 per pupil was delivering value

for money and concluded that the programme should be halted pending a

proper evaluation. Our amendment would enable the Government to do that

if they choose&#151;suspend the further provision of academies

subject to an evaluation. It would not force the Government to do so;

it is merely an enabling

amendment.</div><a name="06042072000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select

Committee found that the Government seemed to be proposing a major

expansion of a largely untested scheme. It found that academies have

mixed academic results in terms of both improvement and actual results,

which we discussed earlier in this debate. The Government argue that

they need a lot more time to demonstrate that improvements are

occurring under the new scheme. However, they argue at the same time

that it is so urgent and vital to improve standards that we must push

on with it. They cannot make both arguments

concurrently.</div><a name="06042072000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor

Stephen Gorard of York University, who was quoted by the Select

Committee, felt that standards had been raised by changing intake. We

were discussing that point just a few moments ago. He found that only

one of the early academies was still serving the most disadvantaged

pupils in the area. Given that the whole point of the academy scheme

was to serve the most disadvantaged pupils, that is a matter for some

concern. It is less of a concern in academies that replace existing

failing schools, but the Committee thinks that setting up new schools

in an area will lead to concerns about cherry-picking from other

schools.</div><a name="06042072000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

70 addresses a number of concerns with an impact on other schools,

particularly the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>question whether academies are excluding more young people, manipulating

their intake or their pupils by excluding the most difficult. The

Department&#146;s figures show that in proportion to the school

population twice as many pupils are excluded from academies as from

other schools. More worryingly, they also show that twice as many

children with special educational needs are excluded from academies

than from other schools. That is of particular concern. In earlier

debates, we have discussed the vulnerability of young people with

special educational needs and the necessity of ensuring that schools

are flexible and sensitive enough to deal with those issues. Given the

Department&#146;s statistics, I feel that it is a cause for

considerable concern.</div>

<a name="06042072000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of specifics are

mentioned. The King&#146;s academy in Middlesbrough, for example,

seems to suspend or exclude 10 times as many students as the average

school in the area. Ofsted found that the number of exclusions in West

London academy was similarly high.</div>

<a name="06042072000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Academies are not bound by

Government guidance on exclusions. For example, an independent appeals

procedure is not required: appeals are allowed only if the school

wishes, and they are made to members of the governing body rather than

externally. Also, academies do not lose money when children are

excluded as other schools in the system do. When pupils are excluded

from community schools, the schools face a financial penalty. When

academy students are excluded, the academy is allowed to keep the money

for that financial year.</div>

<a name="06042072000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means that the playing

field is not level. Many people have expressed concerns that the new

schools are not accepting their fair share of difficult pupils. The

local authority ends up accepting the pupils excluded from other

schools who fall through the net, and not everybody has a fair chance

to attend the school that they

choose.</div><a name="06042072000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000631"></a><b class="B">Ms

Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): Does the

hon. Lady concede that it is perfectly possible for a good local

authority to reach an agreement with the sponsors of an academy to

share excluded pupils, just as it does with its community schools? Does

that not explain why, initially, the Liberal Democrats in Sheffield

instigated the city academy proposals for that

city?</div><a name="06042072000252"></a>

Our amendmentsays that there should be no inducement, financial orother&#151;perhaps we should include peerages while we are talkingabout that&#151;to provide an academy. Local authorities should beallowed the flexibility to choose what kind of school they willprovide.</div><a name="06042072000263"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000642"></a>MegHillier:</b> Will the hon.

Everyone is getting veryexcited.</div> <a name="06042072000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number oflocal authorities have alleged that the Government have threatened towithhold funding from &#147;building schools for the future&#148;unless they provide an academy within their mix of schools. I know thatthe Secretary of State denies that, but it has been stated fairlyconsistently. Boroughs complain that their hands <div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>are tied and that they have not been given freedom of choice as to whatkind of schools they should provide.</div><a name="06042072000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me quote twoexamples. Sunderland city council accused the Government of withholding&#147;building schools for the future&#148; money unless it agreedto provide an academy, and Darlington city council also claimed thatsuch money would not be quickly forthcoming unless it built an academy.The problem is that such statements are made time and again. ThenLabour Members ask why, if it is not an efficient use of resources andthe Government should consider other options, local authorities goagainst the national argument. We have just heard why that happens:pressure is put on them to go down one route. They are not given thefreedom to choose what is suitable for their local area, and they arealso concerned because they have been told that money for repairs willbe withheld. That is not good enough. I hope that the Minister willrespond to thosepoints.</div><a name="06042072000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me makesome general remarks about the clause. We stated that the Secretary ofState&#146;s veto was for us such an important matter of principlethat we would vote against the clause. Given that our concerns have notbeen addressed, we will do so. This is such an important point ofprinciple that we are not prepared to let the clause go through withthat provision remaining in theBill.</div><a name="06042072000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042072000644"></a><b class="B">AnnetteBrooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I wish to make afew brief comments in support of the amendments in my name and those ofmy hon.Friends.</div><a name="06042072000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000645"></a>TheChairman:</b> Order. Make them a little more loudly,please.</div><a name="06042072000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000646"></a>AnnetteBrooke:</b> I do apologise, Mr.Cook.</div><a name="06042072000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without beingrepetitive, I say to the Committee that the amendments raise some basicpoints and questions. The lead amendment would allow the Secretary ofState to suspend the establishment of new academies while their overallsuccess is being evaluated.</div><a name="06042072000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question of what to doabout underperforming and, in particular, failing, schools has been themain point of debate on this clause. Clearly, action must be taken whena school is failing, for which there might be a whole host of reasons.Often, leadership is a contributing factor, but there are likely to bemany others. I have sympathy with the points that have been made. Whenyoungsters are losing out, we need to do something dramatic such asclose certain schools and start afresh. The question is: how do westart afresh? We will need to establish in those schools a new ethos,pride and esteem, and strong leadership. That isobvious.</div><a name="06042072000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schoolsin my constituency that do not perform as well as some of the othersoften lack funding, and have lacked it for a long time. Often thatoccurs when a school falls under a bigger authority that covers a mixof urban and rural areas. As a result, some schools are very neglected.All of those things contributed to underperformance and, ultimately,failure.</div><a name="06042072000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need allof those ingredients. The amount of money that is being put intoacademies, in one way or another, is a welcome injection. Obviously,that could <div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>have been invested elsewhere. For instance, it would be interesting ifwe could have a controlled experiment in which a community school isreopened, with the same level of funds and the freedoms given in thecurriculum, to see whether we need total detachment from the localauthority.</div><a name="06042072000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we lookat the various academies, it is easy to see that there are differentperceptions of the analyses of the results so far. It is reasonable tosay that there are mixed results from academies that have been inbusiness long enough to have been assessed. For instance, Unity cityacademy has had its year already in which to turn round, but communityschools are being told, &#147;It&#146;s easy, you can turn round within a year, or at least make progress.&#148; It is important thatwe get the principles of what is needed&#151;good leadership andresponsible resourcing&#151;without running into structuralsituations, and arguing that one structure is better thananother.</div><a name="06042072000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heardfrom my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East that, statistically,exclusion rates tend to be high in failing schools, which one mightexpect given the nature of those schools, but not to such an extent. Onthe lack of a level playing field as regards financing, will thepriority given to children in care apply to academies? I should like toask the Minister about that, because it is important that we have theequality of access about which we are all concerned. It is notunreasonable to ensure that there is a clear and proper, unbiasedevaluation ofacademies.</div><a name="06042072000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving onto the third amendment in the group, my hon. Friend made a strong pointabout the fact that there has not necessarily been freedom of choice.As a previous chairman of education, I know that people make thechoices and take the ways forward that are best for the children undertheir authority, and those choices are clearly influenced by what is onoffer. They have to do the very best. However, if there is a gravedistortion of choices from Whitehall, perhaps we are not getting thebest outcomes. There is an initial benefit with the cash injection, butare we really getting to delivery? That is how the amendments aboutwhich we are talking linktogether.</div><a name="06042072000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">There arelots of questions about academies. I hope that, for the youngpeople&#146;s sake, the academies will be successful. At the veryleast, the jury is out. I urge the Minister not to rush along the routeof diverting further resources and effort through political tinkeringfrom Whitehall, which is what happens when people are dishing money outand influencingchoices.</div><a name="06042072000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">It isimportant that we know what we are doing, give the best possibleencouragement to turn schools round and allow long-term sustainableimprovements to be generated. I fear that we will not see any moderateimprovements sustained. Inevitably, there is newness, excitement, extramoney and opportunities in academies, including freedom with thecurriculum, but we have to match those things and do what is best forour young people. I suggest, yet again, that the jury is out. Why rushahead with academies in thesecircumstances?</div><a name="06042072000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000647"></a>Mr.Gibb:</b> The amendments and the comments of the hon. Memberfor Brent, East firmly establish the Liberal Democrats&#146;opposition to the autonomy and <div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>independence that characterises the concept of the academy school. Itseems as though the localism enshrined in Liberal philosophy extendsonly to local manifestations of the state sector bureaucracies, notdown to the level of the localschool.</div><a name="06042072000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The academyprogramme is in its early stages, but that does not mean that we shouldhalt it, as the amendment states. It is a pity that my hon. Friend theMember for Gainsborough, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee,has stepped out of the room for a moment because I can tell theCommittee that the National Audit Office says, at paragraph 2.49 of itsreport, &#147;Improving poorly performing schools inEngland&#148;:</div><a name="06042072000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Thoughthese are early results for academies, there are signs of continuingimprovement. The 2004 Key Stage 3 test results for 14-year olds atacademies improved faster than the national average: 9 per cent inEnglish and mathematics compared with a national average improvement of6 and 7 per cent in English and mathematicsrespectively.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">PriceWaterhouseCooperssecond annual report on academy evaluationsays:</div><a name="06042072000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The mostrecent high-level performance information shows that of 11 academieswhich were open in 2004, six have improved their GCSEperformance&#148;</div><a name="06042072000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">at five ormore A* to C grades</div><a name="06042072000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;andfive have not. These results suggest a rather mixed picture ofperformance across open academies. However, when considering thesefigures, it is important to note that of these 11 academies, eight hadonly been open for one year. In these academies, the pupils to whom theGCSE results relate were therefore taught for four years in thepredecessor schools and only two and a half terms in the newacademy.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Themost interesting aspect of PriceWaterhouseCoopers report is how theethos of academies has changed expectations.

For example, 8 out of 10pupils in the survey said that &#145;the teachers at this Academyreally believe that all pupils can achieve&#146;, and similar numbersof staff surveyed said &#145;staff at this Academy believe that allpupils can achieve regardless of their socialbackground&#146;&#148;.</div><a name="06042072000477"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3pm</div><a name="06042072000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The best databy which to determine whether academies are likely to succeed are thoserelating to city technology colleges, which are similar in structure toacademies. They have been open for many years, so they provide good anduseful data. In 2004-05, 65.9 per cent. of pupils at city technologycolleges achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, includingEnglish and maths, compared with just 38 per cent. in communityschools. In an interesting parliamentary answer from the Minister on 6April, it is clear that city technology colleges have the highestachievement rate among those on free schoolmeals.</div><a name="06042072000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Theproportion of pupils receiving free school meals who achieved five ormore GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and maths, was 16.8 percent. for community schools in 2004-05. That figure increased to 20.4per cent. for foundation schools and to 23.7 per cent. for voluntaryaided schools. However, the proportion of pupils receiving free schoolmeals who achieved <div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>five or more GCSE at grades A* to C in city technology colleges was astaggering 58.3 per cent. Similarly, the proportion of pupils withspecial educational needs who achieved five or more good GCSEs,including English and maths, was 6.7 per cent. at community schools and36.2 per cent. at city technologycolleges.</div><a name="06042072000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000648"></a>SarahTeather:</b> Does the hon.

Sometimes, we must consider such matters with an open mind. Weshould visit the schools and see what is going on. It is clear thatthey have a different approach to education from the community schoolsthat they have replaced, which is how they have achieved their results.It is easy to look around for other reasons why the schools areachieving, whether it is because of their intake, the money or the factthat they are new buildings designed by Lord Foster or whatever, butthe actual reason is the ethos of the schools that have beenestablished.</div><a name="06042072000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given thesimilarities in structure between CTCs and academies, we should payheed to such data when debating the structure of schools that webelieve to be the most beneficial for raising standards. I have visitedtwo city technology colleges so far. The ADT college in Wandsworthtakes a banded intake. Last year, 70 per cent. of its pupils achievedfive or more GCSEs at grades A* to C. The Thomas Telford school inTelford also takes a banded intake, but it is based on the nationaldata of the range of abilities. At that school, 100 per cent. of pupilsachieved 12 or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, and that 100 per cent.figure includes English andmaths.</div><a name="06042072000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we wouldexpect from a national banded intake, the school&#146;s proportion ofchildren who are entitled to free school meals, 11 per cent., issimilar to the national average of 14 per cent. Something is happeningat Thomas Telford that is not happening in other schools with similarintakes; otherwise the national average would be 100 per cent., as itshould be if what is happening at the Thomas Telford school wasreplicated throughout thecountry.</div><a name="06042072000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those schoolsshow how independence and autonomy&#151;the hallmarks ofacademies&#151;can help to deliver a high quality of education. Someacademies have not so far achieved the level of excellence of citytechnology colleges, but that has partly been due to the programmebeing in its early stages. However, the truth is that academies can gowrong when the wrong people are appointed as heads or when untried anduntested experiments are inflicted on a school and its pupils. Thoseare often the same reasons why many community schools fail. That is whyI believe that we need to focus not only on structuralreform&#151;important though that is&#151;but on what actuallyhappens in theclassroom.</div><a name="06042072000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let usconsider the Unity city academy in Middlesbrough, referred to by thehon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke). Only 12 ofthe 200 pupils taking their GCSEs there achieved a grade C in maths andEnglish, compared with 17 pupils at the two predecessor schools.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000650"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I agree with many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

points. Would he agree that, when a school runs into such problems,

intervention at the earliest possible time is crucial? In the case of

academies, we shall have to see whether that intervention is flexible

enough when it comes from the Department for Education and Skills, or

whether a good local authority might have picked up the problem

sooner.</div><a name="06042072000298"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000651"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The hon. Lady makes an important point, but in all

the cases that I cited, the head was replaced pretty rapidly. I am

aware of community schools where heads languish, year after year,

producing poor results, and where nothing is done by the local

authorities. The structure of academies is more likely to lead to early

intervention, because those who have put their money and their

reputation on the line do not want the academies to fail. They will

take action, probably earlier than many local authorities

would.</div> <a name="06042072000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a pity

that the head of the school in Ealing had not researched the approach

taken by the best-performing schools before embarking on his damaging

experiment. Last year, at the Wellington school in Trafford, a

secondary modern school, 73 per cent. of pupils achieved five or more

GCSEs at grades A* to C. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div>When English and maths are included, the figure is 66 per cent. None of

those figures include GNVQs. That school ensures that every teacher has

ownership of their own classroom, which also acts as the

teacher&#146;s office, to which he or she can retreat to prepare

lessons, and work after school hours and in free periods. Wellington

school is immaculate. Behaviour there is exemplary and standards are

extremely

high.</div><a name="06042072000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Structures are

important, but so too are the issues that relate to best practice and

to eschewing ideology, whether of the right or left. It is ideology

that has been so damaging to our education system over the past 40

years, and continues to be damaging in too many of our

schools.</div> <a name="06042072000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard

to amendment No. 152 and the proposal to prohibit financial incentives

from the DFES to encourage the establishment of academies, I agree with

the Minister when she says that there are no such incentives other than

the &#147;building schools for the future&#148; programme, which

will eventually apply to all schools in the country. She will accept

that academies will of course have access to the capital funds provided

by the sponsoring business or organisation, but such funds would

presumably be available to schools that acquire a foundation. Will the

Minister clarify that position too? I await her response to the Liberal

amendment.</div>

<a name="06042072000302"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000652"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> I shall speak briefly on a couple of points

that were missed or misrepresented. An additional cost is clearly

associated with academies when compared with maintained schools. Our

figure is &#163;21,000 per pupil per year, compared with

&#163;14,000. If that does not influence improved results, I do not

know what does. We cannot possibly take that out of the equation. As we

have heard from the evidence&#151;evidence that the hon. Gentleman

acknowledges&#151;the programme simply has not justified the extra

expenditure.</div><a name="06042072000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should

also like to talk about Conservatives&#146; supposed localism in this

matter. Academy policy is dictated from the Department in Whitehall. To

describe that as a local policy is extraordinary, and is very much at

odds with our genuine vision of local choice based in the community. My

point, however, goes back to parental choice. The idea that imposing

academies on communities gives the kind of parental choice that the

hon. Gentleman is talking about and the kind of vision that we can all

agree on simply does not stack

up.</div><a name="06042072000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have seen the

imposition of faith-based academies in certain areas. In Leeds, Braim

Wood school, which had a large number of Muslim pupils, was replaced by

a Church of England academy. The same thing happened in Leicester and

in south-east London, and no secular alternative existed. That is not

parental choice.</div><a name="06042072000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

must also accept that under the academy programme as it currently

stands, the Department for Education and Skills can impose academies

against parental wishes. In Barnsley, only 39 per cent. of parents were

in favour of the academy, and a similar thing happened in

Liverpool.</div>

<a name="06042072000306"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000653"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend illustrated the advances made by

city technology colleges, and highlighted them 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>as forerunners of academies. How many CTCs has the hon. Gentleman

visited, and have those visits enlightened his view on the

subject?</div><a name="06042072000307"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000654"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> As the hon. Gentleman well knows, because I

told the Committee, I have been in my position for a matter of weeks,

so I have not yet done so. I have concentrated on visiting those

excellent schools that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton mentioned, and I shall continue to do so as a starting

point. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is a

sensible one. How can he talk about a localist policy imposed from

Whitehall?

</div><a name="06042072000308"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000655"></a>Ms

Angela C. Smith:</b> I challenge the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

assumption that all local authorities who choose to have academies are

forced to do so. In Sheffield, the initial approach to establishing

academies came from a Liberal council and was continued by Labour out

of choice. Some 99 per cent. of parents in the school chosen to convert

to academy status were in favour of a city academy. Like the Liberal

Democrats, we made that choice because that inner-city school would

have closed if we had not done something

soon.</div><a name="06042072000309"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000656"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> The case that the hon. Lady mentions is one in

which parents quite clearly wanted an academy. We are not saying that

when that happens, one should not be

created.</div><a name="06042072000310"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000657"></a>Andrew

Gwynne:</b> The hon. Gentleman is generous in giving way. In

Stockport, which as he knows has a Liberal Democrat-controlled council,

the pursuit of an academy is being led by the local authority. Is he

saying that the local authority is

wrong?</div><a name="06042072000311"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000658"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> The hon. Gentleman puts forward our view of

localism excellently. At a local

level<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06042072000312"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000659"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. There is far too much hullabaloo. We

shall conduct our discussions according to &#147;Erskine May&#148;

and Standing Orders. That means that everyone will have the chance to

be heard, and I shall see to it that that is

so.</div><a name="06042072000313"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000660"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> Thank you, Mr.

Cook.</div><a name="06042072000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">At a local

level, people have to make decisions that they believe will be in the

interests of their local community. Let us be realistic&#151;because

this and earlier Governments have been so centralising, every local

authority has to work within the framework of legislation. If they have

to make certain decisions within that framework, that is perfectly

reasonable.</div><a name="06042072000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I go back

to my previous point on the influence of private sponsors. I still do

not feel that that question has been adequately dealt with,

particularly given that when the academy proposals were first

suggested, 20 per cent. of the cost was going to be met by private

sponsors. That ended up being about &#163;2 million, when the cost of

the academies was up to &#163;38 million. Yet the same influence over

the curriculum, staffing 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div>decisions and ethos is still there. How can that possibly be called

local accountability?</div>

<a name="06042072000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the Minister one simple

question. She is well aware of, and has acknowledged in debates, the

issue of results in respect of academies, specifically relating to the

issue of intake, powerfully raised by Professor Stephen Gorard of York

university in his evidence to the Select Committee. There are also

other issues, such as exclusions. What will the Minister do to give

people confidence that the academies will not have a distorting effect

on local education provision as a whole? That is why we tabled

amendment No. 70, which is key.</div>

<a name="06042072000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">If parents want academies under

the current system, they should have them. However, if they are not

wanted by parents or local authorities, they should not be imposed.

There should not be extra financial incentives to influence the

decision, as there clearly have been through &#147;building schools

for the future&#148;. We want the Minister to say that academies are

not a panacea. They are still unproven and there are serious issues

that need to be

resolved.</div><a name="06042072000318"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000661"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I want to make a technical point about amendment

No. 69, which would give the Secretary of State the power to suspend

the inclusion of academies in competitions for new schools for as long

as it took for their effectiveness to be evaluated. Its practical

significance would be negligible, as the exercise of the power would be

at the discretion of the Secretary of State. In any case, under current

legislation on academies, proposals for academies may be brought

forward at any time outside competition. Technically, amendment No. 69

is pretty feeble.</div> <a name="06042072000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for Brent, East was completely honest. She was not

interested in the technicalities of the amendment. What she was

interested in and what we have received is an unhealthy cocktail of

diatribe, anecdote and misrepresentation on the development of

academies. More significantly, we have had an amendment and discussion

based on a false premise&#151;that somehow the approach to and

achievements of academies are unproven.</div>

<a name="06042072000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us get a few facts on the

record. We already know that academies are working; the proportion of

pupils gaining five or more good GCSEs has risen from 21 per

cent.&#151;</div><a name="06042072000478"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.19

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000662"></a>The

Chairman:</b> May I ask hon. Members to deactivate their

pagers or mobiles, if they had them on during the Division, or to rig

them for silent

running?</div><a name="06042072000324"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000663"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> When we were interrupted I was attempting to get a

few facts into the debate about academies. I had just pointed out that

it is not the case that the success of academies is unproven: actually,

the GCSE results show that in 2005 the proportion of students gaining

five or more good GCSEs had risen 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>from 21 per cent. in academies&#146; predecessor schools to 36.4 per

cent. in the academies.</div>

<a name="06042072000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we want not only more recent

but more wide-ranging information, we can look at the

recently-published key stage 3 results, which show that academies are

continuing to make strong increases in the numbers of their pupils

reaching level 5 or above at key stage 3. In many ways, that figure is

more representative because most academies have children who have had

their key stage 3 assessment, whereas many have not yet had cohorts

take their GCSEs.</div><a name="06042072000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

key stage 3 results published last month show that yet again&#151;as

with GCSE results&#151;academies are raising standards. Overall,

academies are showing an increase in the number of pupils reaching

level 5 or above at key stage 3&#151;of 8 per cent. in English and

science, and 7 per cent. in maths. Those figures are all much higher

than the national average increase. In academies, the average points

score at key stage 3 has risen by 1.1 per cent.&#151;nearly three

times the national average increase for all schools, which is 0.4 per

cent. That is evidence that academies are improving their academic and

exam performance.</div>

<a name="06042072000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is backed up by the

positive assessments from recent Ofsted inspections and the ongoing

independent PricewaterhouseCoopers evaluation of the programme, to

which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred.

Furthermore, academies are proving hugely popular with parents and

students. For example, the City of London academy in Southwark received

about 1,200 applications for 180 year-7 places for September 2005.

Almost all academies are heavily over-subscribed.</div>

<a name="06042072000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that the status quo is

not working for some of our most deprived children. The schools that

they are or were attending have failed them, year in, year out. To

delay the establishment of academies would be to risk failing yet

another generation of children. Waiting, or carrying out some bizarre

controlled experiment, as suggested by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset

and North Poole, might be the approach that the Liberal Democrats want

to take, but the Government are frankly not prepared to see some of the

most deprived children in our communities continue in schools that do

not enable them to fulfil their

potential.</div><a name="06042072000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us

consider the inclusive nature of academies. As I have said, the most

important point is that academies are established in disadvantaged

areas. Overwhelmingly, if they are over-subscribed, proximity is the

key priority in their admissions arrangements. Section 482 of the

Education Act 1996, as amended, requires that the children at an

academy be wholly or mainly drawn from the local area. They are local

schools, attended by local families, but the difference is that,

whereas before, parents would do almost anything to send their children

to schools further away, rather than the predecessor school, local

parents trust and choose academies for their children.</div>

<a name="06042072000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Academies are required by law

to cater for children of all abilities. They must take part in local

admissions forums and have regard to their advice to ensure that

admissions arrangements are co-ordinated locally, consult on their

admissions arrangements each year, and have regard to the special

educational needs code of practice and statutory guidance on inclusion.

In 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div>relation to the specific point about the looked-after children

improvements that we are making in this Bill, they will apply to

academies as well. The route may be different&#151;it will be through

the funding agreement and direction from the Secretary of

State&#151;but the effect will be the

same.</div><a name="06042072000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2005 PWC

evaluation confirmed that academies are inclusive. For example, it

found that the average level of academy pupils&#146; prior attainment

at key stage 2 is near the bottom of the national spread: it is lower

than that of other local schools with an overlapping intake. It also

found that academies have been drawing pupils from within the local

feeder primary schools whose average key stage 2 attainment is even

lower than the overall average for their primary school. So they are

doing a good job with some of the pupils with the least good prior

attainment in the

area.</div><a name="06042072000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The average

number of pupils known&#151;from available data&#151;to be eligible

for free school meals in the 2004 year-7 academy intakes is 34 per

cent. compared with a national average of 14 per cent. Because more

families are willing to trust academies, there are now more pupils on

free school meals in academies than there were in their predecessor

schools. </div><a name="06042072000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

exclusions, of course academies are established in disadvantaged areas,

where generations of pupils have been denied the quality of education

that we would have wanted them to have. Some academies have had a large

number of disruptive pupils, and some of those have been excluded.

However, they are working incredibly hard and behaviour in them is

improving, with the result that the number of exclusions has fallen.

The hon. Member for Brent, East referred to the King&#146;s academy.

That academy permanently excluded 28 pupils in 2003-04 whereas in the

last year of the predecessor school 37 students were referred to

Middlesbrough&#146;s pupil referral unit&#151;so fewer pupils were

excluded by the academy than were taken out of the predecessor school.

The situation is the same in respect of fixed-term

exclusions.</div> <a name="06042072000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its

first year, the Manchester academy excluded 80 per cent. fewer pupils

than the predecessor school had done, and in the summer term 2004

exclusions from the city academy in Bristol were also down by 80 per

cent. on the previous year under the predecessor school. It is not true

that the contribution of academies is unproven. It is beginning to be

proven: academies are turning round the opportunities for their

children. As I suggested earlier, I am not willing to put that progress

on hold to please the prejudice of the Liberal Democrats.</div>

<a name="06042072000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of amendment No. 70

would be to require a local authority, in deciding between proposals in

a competition, to have regard to the effect of an academy on other

schools in the area. I can reassure hon. Members that local

consultation is already required in the development of every single

academy proposal. All those with an interest have to be consulted,

including neighbouring schools, FE colleges and sixth form colleges.

All concerned have the opportunity to make their views known.</div>

<a name="06042072000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are clear that academies are

required to be part of the local family of schools, sharing their

facilities and expertise with other schools and with the wider

community, and contributing to raising standards in the area. We are

confident that academies will have a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>positive impact on neighbouring schools as they increase choices for

pupils and help to regenerate the communities in which they are

located. For example, at the Capital city academy in Brent, the school

sport co-ordinator programme is already making extensive links with

other primary and secondary schools. I am sure that the hon. Lady would

not want to see that removed from her constituency.</div>

<a name="06042072000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the effect of

amendment No. 152 would be to prohibit the Secretary of State from

offering an inducement to a local authority that is deciding a

competition for a new school that includes proposals for the

establishment of an academy.</div>

<a name="06042072000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me reassure hon. Members

and put right the comment that was repeated twice about the funding

differential. Academies are funded in recurrent terms at a rate

comparable to that used for all the other maintained schools in their

locality. Academies&#146; building plans are based on the same cost

benchmarks as those of all other schools whose buildings are approved

by the DFES. So academies do not receive any more funding than other

schools. In receiving an initial substantial capital investment in

their buildings, they are simply sharing in this Government&#146;s

ambitious capital plans to replace or modernise every secondary school

in the next 15 years.</div>

<a name="06042072000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I am asked

about my priorities, I will say that I believe that the investment in

academies is worth while when it gives new opportunities to communities

that have been failed educationally for generations. It is part of a

programme that will benefit every school in the country, and which is

already producing record levels of investment, particularly under

&#147;building schools for the future&#148;. Given those levels of

investment, I do not think it is unreasonable that the Government

should say that, where secondary schools are deemed to be failing or

underperforming, we expect local authorities to consider objectively

the potential role of academies as part of their &#147;building

schools for the future&#148; strategy. The programme is about

transforming not only the fabric of buildings but educational

opportunities for children in those

areas.</div><a name="06042072000480"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000664"></a>Andrew

Gwynne:</b> On &#147;building schools for the

future&#148;, the Minister will be aware that in Tameside, we are

looking at rebuilding seven secondary schools in the largest

school-building programme in the borough since the 1950s; a substantial

investment is to be made. Originally, it was proposed that there would

be one academy, but Tameside council is considering increasing the

number to three&#151;not because it is being forced to by the

Department, but because it wants to. The council foresees a real,

positive impact on the whole Tameside school family from having those

academies form part of the network of schools in the

borough.</div><a name="06042072000341"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000665"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> My hon. Friend strongly makes the case on why

forward-looking local authorities that care about provision for their

pupils are considering academies as a serious option as they take

forward their &#147;building schools for the future&#148;

proposals. That is right and it is happening. Where there are problems

of failure 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>or underperformance and an authority is not proposing to utilise the

academies programme to address it, it is not unreasonable to expect the

authority to demonstrate that it has alternative strategies in

place&#151;and the capacity to implement them&#151;that are at

least as likely to achieve the necessary improvements. Such a case can

be made. The BSF project involving South Tyneside and Gateshead

authorities does not include any academy proposals and its education

vision has been approved by Ministers.</div>

<a name="06042072000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is important is what makes

a difference for children and young people. We should celebrate the

contribution that academies make to turning around the life chances of

some of the children in this country who need it the most, and reject

the prejudice of the Liberal Democrats and their

amendment.</div><a name="06042072000343"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000666"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> This has been a helpful debate, albeit a little

fractious on occasion. I want to clarify a few points.</div>

<a name="06042072000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some local education

authorities complain that they feel as though they are being bribed, or

that their hands are tied and they are not able to exercise their

preferred choices in a local area. They say not that they are being

asked to consider including an academy in their mix of schools, but

that they are being forced to do so, which is a different matter. A

local authority might be put in a real dilemma if the sponsors coming

forward in the area are all faith-based but there is already

over-provision of faith-based schools in the area and the authority is

aware that parents want something else. Having a competition and

encouraging sponsors to come forward does not necessarily mean that

those that do come forward will be appropriate or desirable for the

local area.</div><a name="06042072000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank

the Minister for putting on the record her comments on children in

care. That was helpful, and we will look into the issue. With those few

points, and with the time in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000692"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The explanatory notes on clause 8

state:</div><a name="06042072000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

clause provides that before publishing a notice under clause 7, local

education authorities in England must consult such persons as they

consider to be appropriate, and in discharging this duty they must have

regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State. <i class="I">Subsection

(2) </i>provides that regulations may require local education

authorities to take further steps to promote public awareness of the

proposals brought

forward.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment

would prevent vastly different practices from developing because it

limits the consultation to parents. It is a probing amendment. It

brings us to an element of our discussions that has loomed large today

in the considerations of Committee members of all parties: the role of

parents in this process.</div>

<a name="06042072000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">A different view of the role of

parents has begun to emerge. I do not take the view that parents are

the only people who have an interest in the education of children. In

an earlier sitting, I spoke about the pivotal role of the educator and

how we ought to elevate teachers in our estimation because they are

important people in whose hands we place the future. However, in

respect of the intentions behind the Bill, the most likely drivers of

the type of change that the Minister mentioned in the last debate are

parents. Parents are the people who are likely to make the most

difference and to want to do so. I believe, as does the Minister, I

think, that that difference can mean renewal, and renewal is vital if

we are to address some of the problems of our most disadvantaged

communities and most struggling schools. This probing amendment is

designed to tease out from the Government just how pivotal they

consider parents to be in this process.</div>

<a name="06042072000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents are surely the most

appropriate people to consult. Although I acknowledge that there are

differences in the Committee about the precise role of parents, we all

understand that parents are very important. The hon. Member for Bury,

North, in one of his typically well informed interventions, listed the

things he believes add up to a good education. He talked about the

home-school relationship and the important role that parents play in

motivating children, preparing them for school, interacting with the

school, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>and setting a context in which good education is likely to flourish. As

I have said, however, although all Committee members understand that

parents are important, the relative nature of their importance is

something we may differ about.</div>

<a name="06042072000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The so-called alternative White

Paper, to which the hon. Gentleman and others put their names,

highlights some of those differences, because it specifically addresses

the role of parents in the process that lies at the heart of the Bill,

which is essentially the establishment of new schools and the renewal

that that can bring. The alternative White Paper states:</div>

<a name="06042072000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The commitment of

parents to their children&#146;s education and the opportunities that

can be created for their participation in their children&#146;s

school is important.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

goes on to

say:</div><a name="06042072000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Not all

pupils have parents who are engaged equally or wish to

be.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also says that

the assumption

that</div><a name="06042072000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Parent

power is...always...present and just waiting to be unleashed

in a way which will be wholly

beneficial&#148;</div><a name="06042072000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">should be

challenged.</div><a name="06042072000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course

it is true that parents vary and that some people are more engaged and

committed to the interests of their children than others. We could

leave it at that and be comfortable with that status quo. However, if

we take the Conservative view that by giving parents the incentive to

become more involved and enabling them to make a difference, one is

likely to unleash new potential, it is important that we ensure that

the Bill contains provisions that maximise parental influence. We do

not disagree that the current picture is patchy. The difference between

us centres on our belief in the potential of parents to make a

difference. That has been highlighted by the comments that have been

made in previous debates and emphasised by the

amendment.</div><a name="06042072000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">There might

also be a difference in our views on how local authorities could choose

to use the consultation process to inhibit the energy of parents that I

have described. I am not naturally a cynical person. As you probably

know, Mr. Cook, I am a romantic<i class="I">&#151;[Laughter.]</i> I make no

bones about my romantic idealism, for it is at the heart of my

politics. I am, not cynical, but a little doubtful&#151;perhaps even

sceptical&#151;about the intent of some of those who, faced with the

legislation, may erect obstacles to the achievement of the

Government&#146;s purpose. It might be that there will be people who

see the consultation process as a way of slowing down and

inhibiting&#151;</div><a name="06042072000390"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000693"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> No!</div>

<a name="06042072000391"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000694"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend is even less sceptical and even more

of a romantic than I am. Some people might see the process as a way of

frustrating the intent of the Government and the purpose of the Bill.

Conservative Members believe that by simplifying the consultation

process, as the amendment would do, we will prevent any malcontents who

might use this part of the Bill to slow down the process, or perhaps

even stop it, from having their way.</div>

<a name="06042072000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that effort, we are at one

with the Prime Minister. I do not say that he always gets it

right&#151;hon. Members would hardly expect me to say that here or 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>anywhere else&#151;but in introducing the White Paper, he was right

about the potential of parent power. Judging by the contributions that

they have already made and what I assess to be their good intentions, I

am certain that all Committee members want schools to improve in those

areas where they are currently struggling and want every child to

achieve their educational potential. However, as Abraham Lincoln said,

we will not be able to help men permanently by doing for them what they

could and should do for themselves. By giving people the opportunity to

become more involved in their children&#146;s education, in the

running of schools and in the birth of new schools, we can make a real

difference to those disadvantaged communities and those children who

might otherwise struggle.</div>

<a name="06042072000481"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4

pm</div><a name="06042072000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">The White Paper

is clear. It states at paragraph

2.1:</div><a name="06042072000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are

determined to transform our school system into one that responds better

to the needs and aspirations of parents. Every parent should be

confident that the system is delivering for their child. Every

community should be confident that all parents can choose an excellent

school. And the nation needs to ensure that areas of underperformance

which undermine our efforts to improve social mobility are tackled

vigorously.&#148;</div><a name="06042072000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">And at

paragraph 2.2, it

says:</div><a name="06042072000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To

create real choice and diversity for parents, we need...an easy

route through which parents can generate change; and...new

providers rooted in their

community&#148;</div><a name="06042072000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">and stimulated

by parental activity. As I say, that spirit that underpinned the White

Paper could be frustrated unless the Committee accepts our amendment,

which would further the aims of the White Paper by ensuring that there

is an easy route by which parents can generate change.</div>

<a name="06042072000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not be doubtful in

any way about the mountain that parents will have to climb to generate

a new school. It will not be easy. To gather sufficient numbers of

parents with the will and wherewithal to establish a new school in

their area is not an easy task. Earlier in Committee, the hon. Member

for Brent, East talked about getting 50 parents together, and said that

that was not a great number, but I disagree. I share the view of my

hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that getting

50 parents together, getting families to commit and getting people to

believe that they can make a difference will be a tough job. It is our

task to make that job as easy as possible, and not to allow further

barriers to be put in their

way.</div><a name="06042072000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">In proposing the

amendment, I believe that we are acting in the spirit of the White

Paper and improving the Bill. We are making a strong statement for

parent power. I believe in parent power not for its own sake, but

because it can make a real, positive difference to the interests of our

children.</div> <a name="06042072000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now

say a word about the amendments in this group tabled by my hon. Friend

the Member for Gainsborough. I understand his intent in tabling them.

He will speak for them with his usual wit and elegance, and we will

have a chance to respond to what he

says.</div><a name="06042072000399"></a>

emphasis of, for example, the role of Churches and neighbouring schools

is born of his determination to ensure that new schools work as closely

as possible with the community in which they sit and take account of

the important advice and influence that Churches and other bodies can

bring to bear. I simply wonder&#151;I shall be interested to hear his

dynamism, energy, and clear-sighted purpose. They may themselves have

become part of an educational orthodoxy that, rather than embracing

renewal and improvement, might be unhelpful to our pursuit of those

things. I simply say to my hon. Friend that we do not want to put any

barriers in the way of parents who desperately want to make a

Leigh:</b> My amendments were probing amendments, and after

the eloquence displayed by my hon. Friend, they are now even more

probing than they were before. For all that, when coupled with my hon.

Friend&#146;s amendment, they do a useful job. We are going to elicit

a wide range of possible consultees from the Minister and discover what

she means by saying that the local education authority must</div>

it must be clear by now, even if members of the Committee have not read

my vision, but we are where we are. It is extremely unlikely that I

shall be able to convince the Minister of the virtue of that viewpoint,

although I am confident that, over the course of this Parliament, I

will convince those who lead for my party on education.</div>

<a name="06042072000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not speak for the

Conservative party. The virtue of being a Back Bencher is that one can

be a sort of outrider for the

party<i class="I">&#151;[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> There is no harm in that.

All political parties need people to think creatively, which is what I

try to do. That is my role, as it is in part the role of my

amendments.</div> <a name="06042072000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister will have to address the problem. I shall not labour the

point&#151;I made it this morning with regard to our experience with

grant-maintained schools&#151;but I suspect that, as my hon. Friend

says, she will find that unfortunately not everyone shares her

enthusiasm for the establishment of trust schools. With a clause such

as clause 8, I fear that local education authorities will use

consultation as a means of obfuscation or of putting barriers in the

path of those wishing to set up trust

schools.</div><a name="06042072000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who should be

consulted? Obviously someone should be consulted, otherwise what is the

point of such a clause? My hon. Friend is right that there is no harm

in consulting parents. One of the problems with 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>that, as we all know, is that parents are rightly focused on their

children at the time of their education, and it is difficult for them

to take a strategic view. That is the argument continuously advanced by

the hon. Member for Bury, North, by Members of the Liberal party and

others.</div> <a name="06042072000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are parents

best qualified to have a view&#151;or, as I suggest in my amendments,

does the Minister envisage that local authorities will

consult</div> <a name="06042072000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the chairman of

governors of all maintained schools in areas adjacent to the proposed

school&#148;?</div><a name="06042072000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would seem

to be a fairly sensible point of view, would it not? Presumably,

therefore, the Minister might agree.</div>

<a name="06042072000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">If someone wants to set up a

new faith school, based on a trust, will the local authority follow the

spirit of amendment No. 348, which

states:</div><a name="06042072000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the case of

religious-based schools, the relevant church or religious

authority&#148;.</div><a name="06042072000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">One would

think that that was sensible, but what do we mean by faith school? In

the recent census, a large number of people apparently said as a joke

that they were part of the Jedi knights religion, because a newspaper

has suggested that it would be a good way of irritating the

authorities. Would I be allowed to set up a Jedi knights faith school?

If I said that I wanted to set up a Catholic school, what sort of

Catholic school would it be? Would I have to consult the bishop and the

local hierarchy?</div> <a name="06042072000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

would be useful to know the Minister&#146;s view of who should be

consulted. The amendments, by their all-embracing nature, should

encourage the Minister to do precisely

that.</div><a name="06042072000413"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000698"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I shall be brief. I shall refer mainly to

amendment No. 159, moved the hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings (Mr. Hayes) rather than the outriding amendments.</div>

<a name="06042072000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would remove the

requirement for local authorities to consult more widely than school

parents. The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked whether parents were

less qualified than others to have a view. They are not less qualified,

but we should accept that schools have a more important role than

teaching those young people attending the school at the time. We should

consider the wider policies of extended schools, early-years centres

and children centres, and community use of facilities out of school

hours. It is important that the community is consulted on the criteria

used when a new school is set up. Consultation is not necessarily about

slowing things down; it may be simply a matter of ensuring that a

school is appropriate for local need and that consideration goes wider

than the young people at the

school.</div><a name="06042072000415"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000699"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> The clause to which the amendments relate is all

about the requirements to consult prior to issuing proposals for a

competition and how those proposals should be brought to the attention

of various groups. The amendments largely relate to the situation on

the consultation prior to the issuing of the notice for

competition.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div><a name="06042072000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

159 would mean that the local authority had to consult parents in the

area, not anyone else, before it published a notice inviting proposals

in a competition. That is the technical effect of the amendment.

However, I think that this is a probing amendment, because the clause

currently requires the authority to consult those it considers it

appropriate, having regard to any guidance from the Secretary of State.

I have some sympathy with the importance that the amendment gives to

parents. We had a good discussion about that in relation to amendments

Nos. 180 and 182 to clause 7 which were tabled by my hon. Friend the

Member for Bury, North. There is significance in ensuring that parents

are involved. Of course, they should be consulted about proposals

affecting provision in their area and their views should be treated

seriously, but that does not mean that nobody else should be

consulted&#151;and that would be the effect of the

amendment.</div><a name="06042072000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that

this is a probing amendment, perhaps I should just clarify who we think

should be consulted about statutory proposals. Among those who we think

should be consulted are the local Member of Parliament for the area

that the school is intended to serve; any MP whose constituents are

likely to be affected by the proposals; the local district or parish

council for the area where the school is to be situated; and other

schools in the area, including those in an adjoining local education

authority that may be affected by the proposals, whether community,

foundation, voluntary, or special schools.</div>

<a name="06042072000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any local education authority

likely to be affected by the proposals should be consulted, including

neighbouring LEAs where there may be significant cross-border movement

of pupils, as should parents and staff in the area who might be

affected by the proposals, including parents of pupils at feeder

primary schools and those living in, or who have children attending a

school in, the area of an adjoining LEA.</div>

<a name="06042072000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local Church of England and

Roman Catholic diocese should be consulted, as should anyone else who

has previously expressed an interest in setting up a maintained school

and others who might be willing to come forward as promoters. If the

proposed school is likely to affect a school with a particular

religious foundation, the appropriate diocesan authorities, or, where

there is no diocesan structure, the national faith group that provides

that school, should be consulted.</div>

<a name="06042072000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should also be

consultation with any trust or foundation providing a foundation or

voluntary school that does not have a religious character, if the

proposed school is likely to affect such a school. If the proposals

affect the provision of full-time 16-to-19 education, the Learning and

Skills Council should be included. Any other interested party should be

consulted. For example, the early years development and child care

partnership should be consulted, where proposals would affect early

years provision, as should all those who benefit from a contractual

arrangement giving them the use of the premises. That might cover the

point made by the hon. Member for Brent,

East.</div><a name="06042072000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accepting the

amendment, virtuous though its emphasis on parents is, would

disfranchise a large number of interested people whom we think have a

legitimate interest in the opening of a new school that will affect

them, whether they support the proposals or 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>are opposed to them. There should be a recognised route for interested

parties to make their views known.</div>

<a name="06042072000422"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000700"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the

list. She will have noted that I was worried about there being

differences between one locality and another&#151;that some

consultees might be included in one place, but not in a neighbouring

area. She has made it clear that the guidance will not allow that.

However, does she feel that parents should merely be included in that

list or that there should be a special role for parents, a parallel

process? Just listing local parents with all those other groups would

be rather to undersell their

significance.</div><a name="06042072000423"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000701"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> The hon. Gentleman has a fair point in that the

nature of the consultation will differ according to different groups;

if it did not, that would be completely unreasonable. Sending a letter

may be perfectly adequate consultation for a neighbouring local

authority, but doing that or publishing a notice would not be adequate

for parents, unless we could ensure that it got to them.</div>

<a name="06042072000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman makes a

reasonable point; there should probably be a differentiated approach to

how the consultation is carried out. However, it is important that

there should be clear emphasis on who should be consulted in each

circumstance. That is why the guidance is

statutory.</div><a name="06042072000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 331 and 348 would insert requirements to consult the head teachers

and chairs of governors of all maintained schools in the area, and, in

the case of any religiously based schools, the relevant Church or

religious authority. Given what I have said, I hope that I have

reassured the hon. Member for Gainsborough that not only are we not

opposed to such provisions, but we think that heads, chairs of school

governing bodies and appropriate religious authorities should be

consulted.</div> <a name="06042072000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not

think it necessary to put that in the Bill, but the duty to consult

such people as appear to the authority to be appropriate should be

represented in the statutory guidance that we shall issue in respect of

the clause. I have said that the guidance will specify that other

schools in the area must be consulted and that if the proposed school

is likely to affect a school that has a particular religious character,

the appropriate diocesan authorities&#151;or, if there is no diocesan

structure, the national faith group that provides the

school&#151;should be consulted too.</div>

<a name="06042072000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not open to the authority

to disregard the statutory guidance. If it did not consult one of the

listed persons, that would be prime facie evidence that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>the consultation had not been properly carried out, and that would need

to be rectified before the competition proceeded.</div>

<a name="06042072000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance will require full

consultation on the proposed competition, including local schools,

religious authorities, local parents and other

stakeholders.</div><a name="06042072000429"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000702"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> There is a clear structure in respect of existing

faith schools, particularly in relation to the role of the diocese.

Will the Minister remind me how that structure would be replicated in

the case of a new trust school? It would be unfortunate if people

wanted to produce schools based on sects within a religion divorced

from mainstream religion. What checks and balances does the Minister

envisage?</div><a name="06042072000430"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000703"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> That takes us back to this morning&#146;s

discussion, in which I said that I would bring to the Committee

guidance for decision makers about the process that a school governing

body would go through in acquiring a relationship with a particular

trust and that would enable us to set down the criteria for that

trust.</div> <a name="06042072000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.

Gentleman is arguing that a sect would not be beneficial to the

advancement of education at a school, he should know that it would be

prohibited by the fact that advancement of education would be one of

the statutory objects of the trust. I have made it clear that the

statutory guidance will state that the appropriate diocesan

authorities&#151;or the nationally recognised faith bodies of

religions without such authorities&#151;should be consulted. In light

of those reassurances about the full consultation on the proposed

competition, I hope that the hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings will feel able to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06042072000432"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042072000704"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I have scarcely felt more reassured. The right hon.

Lady generously described the groups that will be consulted. I note her

point that different groups may require a different approach to take

account of their sensitivities and their role in the process. She is

right that that satisfies those of us who want to see parents at the

very heart of the process.</div>

<a name="06042072000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am conscious of the time, Mr.

Cook, and that my beautiful wife and son are waiting for me to go to

tea&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>

&#147;Where?&#148;] I am not telling hon. Members today, but I will

report back when we next meet. On that happy note, I beg to ask leave
