Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added 
to the Bill.
<H4><center>New Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Vertical agreements and land</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. (1) The Secretary of State may by order provide for any 
provision of this Part to apply in relation to 
<P>
(a) vertical agreements, or
<P>
(b) land agreements,
<P>
with such modifications as may be prescribed.
<P>
(2) An order may, in particular, provide for exclusions or 
exemptions, or otherwise provide for prescribed provisions not to 
apply, in relation to 
<P>
(a) vertical agreements, or land agreements, in general; or
<P>
(b) vertical agreements, or land agreements, of any prescribed 
description.
<P>
(3) An order may empower the Director to give directions to the 
effect that in prescribed circumstances an exclusion, exemption or 
modification is not to apply (or is to apply in a particular way) in 
relation to an individual agreement.
<P>
(4) Subsections (2) and (3) are not to be read as limiting the 
powers conferred by section 70.
<P>
(5) In this section 
<P>
"land agreement" and "vertical agreement" have such meaning as 
may be prescribed; and
<P>
"prescribed" means prescribed by an order.
<P>
(6) No order is to be made under this section unless a draft has 
been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each 
House.'. [Mr. Nigel Griffiths.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up and read the First time.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> I beg to move, That the 
clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to 
discuss new clause 11 Vertical agreements 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ). (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Chapter I prohibition does 
not apply to a vertical agreement.
<P>
(2) If the Director is satisfied that there is a vertical agreement 
which, but for the exemption in subsection (1) would infringe the 
Chapter I prohibition, he may issue a notice proposing the date on 
which that exemption is to end in relation to that agreement.
<P>
(3) Copies of a notice under subsection (2) must be given to 
<P>
(a) each of the parties to the agreement, and
<P>
(b) the Secretary of State,
<P>
not less than 14 days before the date proposed and the exemption 
shall end on the date proposed unless, before that date, the notice is 
withdrawn by the Director or cancelled by the Secretary of State.
<P>
(4) In this section "vertical agreement" means an agreement 
between two or more undertakings (other than connected 
undertakings) under which one undertaking acts as purchaser and 
another acts as supplier of the goods or services which are the 
subject of that agreement and includes an agency or distribution 
agreement but does not include a price fixing agreement.
<P>
(5) For the purposes of subsection (4) 
<P>
"connected" has such meaning as the Secretary of State may 
by order prescribe
<P>
"price fixing agreement" means an agreement which seeks to 
control the price charged for the goods or services which 
are the subject of that agreement, whether or not by 
purporting 
<P>
(a) to fix a particular price, a minimum price or a price band, or
<P>
(b) to impose a requirement, make a recommendation or offer 
an incentive, other than an agency agreement under which 
the principal establishes the price at which the agent sell the 
goods or services which are the subject of the agreement or 
an agreement which relates exclusively to the price of an 
interest in land.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, to what I 
trust will be the final day of the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
New Clause 13 is obviously important. I intend to set 
out its rationale in some detail. I shall be pleased to deal 
with any serious points raised after I have concluded my 
initial remarks.
<P>
The new clause allows the Government to provide for 
vertical agreements and land agreements. For the benefit 
of the Committee, I shall outline the Government's 
thinking in respect of those types of agreement and how 
we intend to use the powers to be granted under the new 
clause.
<P>
I shall deal first with vertical agreements. We have said 
on several occasions that there is significant merit in 
dealing with vertical agreements as a whole under the 
chapter I prohibition. The power proposed in the new 
clause is important, as it will ensure that we are able to 
provide a regime that is of real practical value to business. 
We have discussed that approach with the Confederation 
of British Industry, which supports the new clause.
<P>
The Bill already includes provisions to make 
exclusions, but as we said on Second Reading, we have 
been considering whether additional flexibility will be 
required.
<P>
The vertical agreements task force has met several 
times during the past few months to consider that 
question. Working with the CBI, the Office of Fair 
Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, 
we concluded that the Bill's existing power to make 
exclusions may not be adequate to provide special 
treatment for vertical agreements treatment that is 
legally sound yet of real practical value to business. The 
new clause will enable appropriate treatment to be given 
specifically to vertical agreements. However, we do not 
propose to give special treatment to price fixing vertical 
agreements.
<P>
I shall explain the background to the need for additional 
flexibility. Vertical agreements cannot easily be compared 
with the other categories of agreement mentioned in 
schedule 3. Vertical agreements are often part of an 
overall network, such as a hamburger chain franchise 
agreement. It could be said that each agreement in an 
arrangement is made in contemplation of the others, as 
each dealer signs up to join the network.
<P>
The problem with vertical agreements is that they may 
be closely linked with horizontal agreements in an overall 
arrangement. We do not want the benefits to be lost 
simply because there is a series of vertical agreements of 
a similar kind in an overall arrangement. Flexibility over 
and above the powers in clause 3 is desirable to spell that 
out, for the certainty of business.
<P>
We have been considering with the task force how that 
power should be used. There will be advantage in 
providing for greater flexibility than is currently available 
under clause 3. It would enable us to prescribe more 
clearly than may be the case for straightforward 
exclusions how the Bill will apply to overall arrangements 
that include both vertical and horizontal agreements. The 
effect of using that power would be to ensure that parties 
to vertical agreements would not be subject to penalties 
for infringement of the prohibition. It would ensure that 
vertical agreements are not at risk of being rendered void 
because they are said to infringe the prohibition. Finally, 
it would ensure that vertical agreements would not be 
subject to third-party action in the courts. I shall deal with 
the question of safeguards against anti-competitive 
vertical agreements a little later.
<P>
Specifying how the Bill is to operate on vertical 
agreements makes it clear that we are not trying to change 
the way in which the prohibition itself should be 
interpreted.
<P>
As members of the Committee may know, the 
European Commission has been conducting a review of 
the treatment of vertical restraints. We have recently 
received a draft paper from the Commission that sets out 
the findings of that review. The paper contains 
descriptions of vertical agreements that could form the 
basis for a definition of vertical agreements that would 
benefit from the special treatment under the chapter I 
prohibition. The paper has not been made officially public 
by the Commission but copies are circulating widely in 
the business and legal community. Indeed, the hon. 
Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) referred to it earlier 
in our proceedings. The Commission is still working on 
those proposals. However, one definition used in the 
papers that we are considering is that of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"agreements between two or more undertakings, each operating on 
a different economic level, in respect of the marketing of goods 
or services".</ul></font>
<P>
We are considering with the task force whether the 
general descriptions of vertical agreements contained in 
those papers could be copied, at least form the basis for 
the description of vertical agreements that would qualify 
for the special treatment under the chapter I prohibition. 
There may be merit in using the same language as that 
proposed by the Commission. Many UK businesses are 
already subject to EC competition law and it might be 
burdensome for them to apply two different tests at the 
EC and UK level when deciding whether they come 
within the scope of the UK and EC prohibitions. That is 
a matter we are actively considering with the task force.
<P>
The general description of vertical agreements proposed by the Commission are wide ranging. The existing EC block exemptions cover only vertical agreements for resale. The proposed EC definitions are far wider, covering service supply arrangements and supply agreements where the purchaser does not resell the products but processes them into another product, such as flour into bread.
We do not read the draft definition proposed by the Commission as covering licences of pure intellectual property rights. We do not believe that there is a need to 
cover such agreements with the special treatment 
proposed. Licensing of intellectual property rights has 
been subject to article 85 in the UK for more than 25 
years. A licence to use intellectual property rights, as 
such, is not restrictive it grants a freedom.
<P>
The European Commission proposal for a new 
wide-ranging block exemption is, however, subject to 
numerous qualifications. For example, the block 
exemption would not be available where the parties' 
market share exceeds a certain percentage and various 
restrictive terms do not qualify for the block exemption. 
That is in recognition of the fact that not all vertical 
agreements are benign; indeed, some can cause serious 
competition concerns.
<P>
We do not intend to copy all the various qualifications 
and conditions that the EC proposes. Nevertheless, we 
recognise that some vertical agreements can cause serious 
competition concerns that might not be readily dealt with 
by reliance on the chapter II prohibition or the complex 
monopoly provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973. Clever 
lawyers may also test the terms of the special treatment 
and squeeze agreements within it which were not intended 
to benefit. In particular, we do not propose to give special 
treatment to price-fixing vertical agreements.
<P>
We believe that it is essential that the director general 
is able to claw back individual agreements, within the 
scope of the chapter I prohibition to examine them. It is 
the quid pro quo for a wide-ranging exclusion. That would 
be on similar terms to the power of clawback that already 
exists for many of the exclusions in the Bill. The test 
would be whether the director general considered the 
agreement to be subject to the prohibition in the absence 
of special treatment and was not likely to grant an 
unconditional exemption. If an agreement has such 
serious effects that it does not merit an exemption, it is 
absolutely right that the director general should be able to 
terminate the special treatment.



<P>
Once the agreement was clawed back the parties would 
be able to argue the case for an exemption before the 
director general. If he ultimately ruled that an exemption 
was not merited, the parties could appeal against the 
decision to the Competition Commission. The power of 
clawback by the director general is provided in subsection 
(3). We would expect the order to deal with such matters 
as the power to obtain information about the agreement 
and the giving of notice.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy (Plymouth, Sutton):</B> I, like other 
members of the Committee have received a letter from 
the National Consumer Council, which broadly welcomes 
the introduction of the new clause which excludes benign 
vertical agreements. The letter asks for clarification 
perhaps my hon. Friend could provide that now. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"when drawing up an Order, it is important that there is openness 
and consultation with a range of bodies about which types would be 
covered. This should happen before it is laid before Parliament."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can my hon. Friend give us come assurances on that 
matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I can give my hon. Friend an assurance 
that there will be consultation on that matter. Indeed, we 
will consult the National Consumer Council on it.
<P>
I come now to land agreements. Similar considerations 
to those that arise in relation to vertical agreements arise 
in relation to land agreements. We do not believe that land 
agreements, so far as they relate to the creation of transfer 
of an interest in land, will be likely to have any 
appreciable effect on competition. There may be more 
concern about some covenants as to how land may be 
used, or which limit the freedom of the tenant in other 
ways, but the Government's view is that land agreements 
are unlikely to raise competition concerns.
<P>
We are, however, aware of concerns about exactly how 
the chapter I prohibition may apply to land agreements, 
and the effect of potential voidness on the property 
market. If we do not treat land agreements differently, we 
fear that uncertainty as to the application of the chapter I 
prohibition will lead to unnecessary notification of 
agreements and uncertainty in the property sector. Under 
article 85, the lack of clarity has been ameliorated by the 
general expectation that restrictions in land agreements 
are unlikely to affect trade between member states and 
hence to fall foul of article 85. That limitation will, of 
course, not apply under the chapter I prohibition.
<P>
We therefore believe that the powers of the new clause 
in relation to land agreements will enhance the clarity of 
the application of the prohibition, reduce the burden on 
business of unnecessary notifications and enable the
better concentration of regulatory resources on areas
of competition concern, without undermining the 
effectiveness of the prohibition regime itself.
<P>
I commend the new clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood (Wokingham):</B> I thank the 
Under-Secretary for his fuller than usual statement on the 
Government's thinking on the subject, and for making 
some progress in trying to tackle the real problem that we, 
and the business world, foresaw with the Bill as drafted 
for the many vertical agreements already in place.
<P>
Before we give the Government's proposal a fair wind, 
we need answers to several important questions. With 
your agreement, Mr. Atkinson, we should spend a little 
time comparing the words of the Government new clause 
with those proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for 
South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) in his rather more 
detailed and precise version, which is an attempt to 
achieve similar things on vertical agreements.
<P>
How will the transitional period operate? Is the 
intention to end up with fewer vertical agreements being 
permitted than at present, or to allow all existing vertical 
agreements that have been found reasonable to continue 
under the new regime, until there is a change of mind 
after a proper inquiry? Business needs to know whether 
the intention for the transitional period is that everything 
that is currently legal will be legal in the first instance 
under the new regime, or whether it is to set the new 
competition authority the massive job of going back 
through all the issues surrounding all current vertical 
agreements, which have often been examined and found 
reasonable, and testing them under the Bill.
<P>
Listening to the Under-Secretary's explanation this 
morning, I began to fear that we face the latter outcome 
that each business or group of businesses involved in a 
vertical agreement will need to persuade the competition 
authorities and the Government that their practices are 
still reasonable, so that an order can be made governing 
their problems under the new clause if it is agreed to by 
the Committee and by the House. I put it to the 
Under-Secretary that that will prove to be a time 
consuming and expensive process and will mean redoing 
much of the work that has already been done in recent 
years by the MMC, examining such problems in a range 
of industries.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let me give some specific examples. It is well known 
that there have been many debates in recent years about 
whether the vertical tie between the typical brewer and 
the typical tied house outlet is reasonable. The previous 
Government had doubts about some features of that 
arrangement, and laid orders before the House to try to 
remedy what were then thought to be the competition 
problems. In the process, they discovered how difficult it 
was to mess around with the arrangements and end up 
with a better answer for customers. We subsequently 
reached a settlement for the brewing industry.
<P>
The brewing industry is not yet governed by a block 
exemption from Brussels, because, as we have discussed, 
many of the big brewers still await the results of the 
Brussels investigation. Some of them have been in debate 
with Brussels for four years and still do not know whether 
they would qualify for such a block exemption. We need 
to know what their position will be under United 
Kingdom law if the Bill, as amended by the new clause, 
is passed. Does the Under-Secretary intend immediately 
to exempt existing brewing arrangements with tied houses 
on the grounds that they were found reasonable, as 
modified by legal changes a few years ago? Or is he 
saying that they are now, or could be, unacceptable, and 
warrant further full investigation before an exemption 
under the new clause is granted?
<P>
The car distribution industry is in a similar position.
A comparatively recent and exhaustive MMC report 
concluded that although car prices in the United Kingdom 
are higher than in, for example, Belgium, there were 
advantages in the current links between large motor 
manufacturers in the United Kingdom and franchise 
distributors, and that such vertical agreements were 
permissible. Is that the Government's view, or do they 
think that we could have a more competitive business and 
cheaper prices for the customer if that vertical tie 
arrangement were broken or modified? Will they want to 
propose an order exempting the current arrangement 
under the new clause, if passed, or will they regard it is 
a suitable target for injecting more competition into the 
motor marketplace?
<P>
There is a similar problem with the agreements to sell 
fragrances through shops. A comparatively recent 
investigation examined whether it was reasonable trading 
practice to restrict the sale of some expensive and 
well-thought-of brands to some types of outlet, or whether 
manufacturers should be forced to distribute the products 
through any store that wants to sell them perhaps at a 
cheaper price. It was decided that there was a public 
interest in maintaining the brand. Is that the Government's 
view? Do they want to continue such exemptions for those 
retailing arrangements of fragrances, or do they see them 
as an opportunity for cheaper perfumes in our time? Do 
they want to exempt such arrangements from the loophole 
in their Bill?
<P>
Oil and petrol retailing is also a difficult case. There 
are extensive vertical agreements and ties between the big 
oil refiners and the garage distribution network selling 
petrol at the pump. Those arrangements, too, have been 
investigated in the past and found to be highly 
competitive. Although that is not the public view, it is 
the view of the competition authorities. Therefore, those 
vertical agreements have been permitted to continue. Is 
that the Government's view, or do they want to use the 
Bill to change or to abolish those vertical ties because 
they now believe that more competitively priced petrol 
could be delivered without such privileged arrangements 
between the oil refining company and the garages that 
distribute petrol.
<P>
I have given four industry cases, and it would bore the 
Committee too much if I were to discuss another dozen 
or more, which I could do this morning. The Government 
need to give more guidance about such cases before we 
can accept their proposed remedies. We need to know 
what we are legislating for and how radical the 
Government want the vertical agreements to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> The examples that 
my right hon. Friend mentioned are cogent and widely 
understood. I do not want to lengthen our proceedings 
unnecessarily, but it would be helpful if he alluded at least 
briefly to a few more examples, so that Labour Members 
can be better informed than they otherwise would be. My 
right hon. Friend has always accepted that he has an 
important role to play in the education of Labour Back 
Benchers, and I hope that he will perform that role this 
morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend has a more generous 
view of my capabilities than I do it is beyond me to 
educate Labour Back Benchers on the business world. 
However, because he pressed me to do so, I shall give 
one more example, which will be topical on Report.
I realise that Labour Members are already worried about 
the number of examples that I am producing, so I shall 
limit myself to just one more.
<P>
There is a complex series of agreements within the 
newspaper industry for newspaper distribution the 
recommended price turns out to be the common or 
standard price, there are restrictions on distribution outlets 
and there is a sale or return agreement with newsagents. 
Newsagents who I know like those features of the 
restrictive agreements. Will the Government let those 
practices continue, or will they use the Bill to break them 
up and give everyone the right to buy newspapers from a 
publisher and to sell them at any price that they see fit, 
on a freer basis than is currently available to the industry?
<P>
My examples show that the vertical agreements are 
not one-offs or small corners of our economy they 
involve great swathes of our economy [Interruption.] 
Does the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West 
(Dr. Starkey) want to intervene?

<P>

<B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey (Milton Keynes, South-West):</B> 
No, I was just moving.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I thought that she wanted to make a 
comment, and I would be happy to give way to her if 
she does.
<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> I would not bother.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The hon. Lady says that she would not 
bother. It is very sad that she would not bother to 
comment on these very important businesses, which can 
be found in her constituency and in mine, and which want 
to know the outcome of our deliberations today.
<P>
I have already welcomed the fact that the Government 
have spent time studying the problem. When they first 
drafted the Bill, one of the first points I made to them, in 
writing and through the press, was that they would find 
that there are many complicated agreements in the 
economy, many of which are benign, and that they would 
cause enormous hassle, strife and trouble and increase 
costs if they did not exempt sensible agreements from day 
one by naming them and reassuring the people concerned 
that they could carry on trading on that basis. The 
Government did not take that advice at the time, but they 
have now had a stab at the matter and produced a proposal 
that could start to relieve them and the competition 
authorities of the burden.
<P>
That is welcome, and I hope that the hon. Member for 
Milton Keynes, South-West also welcomes it. However, I 
am sure that she appreciates that we need to know whether 
the device that the Government are offering will work, 
and for whom, but the Government have not yet made a 
statement about their intentions. Do they intend to use the 
device liberally? Do they wish to exclude everything or 
practically everything that is permitted under the current 
regime? Will they specify the industries in advance before 
we get into a mess during the transitional period? Will 
they start to prepare draft orders soon, so that when the 
Bill comes into effect all the agreements will be protected 
under the necessary orders? Business wants them to do 
that.
<P>
I welcome the fact that the CBI and, I trust, other 
business representatives have been party to the 
discussions at the Department of Trade and Industry. The 
fact that it has taken many months for a working party in 
the DTI to come up with this sparse and spartan new 
clause shows how little thought was put into the proposal 
when the Bill was first drafted.
<P>
The Government said today that they still do not know 
how to define a vertical agreement. Indeed, this delphic 
new clause states that "vertical agreement" has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such meaning as may be prescribed".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why cannot it be prescribed today? The best Government 
and business brains in the country have had six months or 
more on a working party to define such a proposition. 
Why is it a secret? Why cannot it be shared?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> Does 
my right hon. Friend agree that it is obvious that the 
Government do not trust their own judgment but are 
waiting to hear from the European Commission what they 
ought to think about vertical restraints?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That may be right. The only shred of 
defence open to the Under-Secretary is that he does not 
want to produce a definition that is incompatible with the 
definition provided by Brussels. I want our Government 
to be influential. They are a big Government of a big 
country in western Europe. We have a great deal of 
expertise in the private sector, specifically in law and 
accountancy, to deal with such problems.
<P>
Why cannot we produce a definition for the Bill now, 
take it proudly to Brussels, explain it to the competition 
commissioner and get it adopted as the definition for the 
whole of our community? Or, failing that, why cannot 
we take it to Brussels, discover that there are one or two 
problems with it, accept amendments to it in the spirit of 
give and take and return to the Committee with the 
amended proposal? The Government have had a year to 
do that and many months since we first highlighted the 
problem. It is disappointing that there is no agreement 
between the British Government and Brussels on the 
issue. We are no further down the track in defining a 
vertical agreement than when the problem was first posed.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that Brussels is thinking of a 
definition which does not only include the arrangements that I have outlined. I gave the example where two or more organisations are at different stages in the production and sales chain, and the producer sets the conditions for marketing and distribution to the retailer or wholesaler. He said that there could be other circumstances, and he gave the interesting example of flour and read where the goods supplied are transformed by the business further down the chain. That clearly is not the case in petrol or fragrance distribution where the goods are produced by the petrol refiner or fragrance maker and simply marketed and sold through the store or garage.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is trying to come up with a more 
general definition than the one that we homed in on as 
causing most of the problems. He might, therefore, object 
to the more extensive new clause of my hon. Friend the 
Member for South Cambridgeshire. Before the matter is 
put finally to the Committee, I hope that the Government 
will explain why their vague and general new clause is 
preferable to new clause 11, which solves some of the 
problems. I am sure that my hon. Friend will make a 
powerful case in a professional way, but I want to 
highlight the definition of vertical agreement in new 
clause 11. It seems a perfectly good definition and might 
be the solution or the starting point for a solution for the 
Government to give us on Report.



<P>
My first worry about the new clause is its vagueness in 
not defining a vertical agreement. Either by adopting the 
language of new clause 11 or by coming up with their 
own language, after agreeing it with Brussels, the 
Government should be able to define a vertical agreement 
on Report. That would allow people to see whether their 
vertical agreements fall within the definition. Clearly, if 
they do not, those people will need to change their 
arrangements immediately because there would be no 
hope of an exemption. Once we have the definition of a 
vertical agreement, we will need to know how widely the 
order-making power might be used, which returns me to 
my earlier questions: is there a list and can we have a 
statement of intent from the Government about how many 
might benefit?
<P>
It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could tell us 
more about the relationship between the use of the 
order-making power and the EC block exemption 
regimes. He explained that EC block exemptions may 
cover a narrower group of arrangements than the final 
vertical agreement definition produced by Brussels which 
the Government will adopt. Given that he thinks that the 
current EC block exemptions are too narrow, is he entirely 
happy with them, and is he contemplating a system that 
will not only produce a long list of exempted agreements 
in the United Kingdom, but which will add to the number 
of block exemptions in Brussels?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I was surprised by the Under-Secretary's decision to 
omit intellectual property altogether on the grounds that 
an intellectual property agreement was unlikely to be 
anti-competitive. It is quite possible for such an agreement 
to be anti-competitive. Indeed, those who wish to 
challenge in the marketplace would say that such 
agreements are almost always anti-competitive.
<P>
The case for such an agreement is that the public 
interest is served by protecting an individual's intellectual 
property for a period of time. Such protection makes it 
worth that person's while to go the extra mile and apply, 
for example, for patent protection. The law recognises that 
companies and individuals need to conduct a great deal of 
research and to spend considerable sums up front before 
money can be recouped from the market. Through the 
patent, a period of time is therefore given for the exclusive 
exploitation of intellectual property.



<P>
One also finds anti-competitive elements in intellectual 
property agreements between companies. For example, it 
is common practice for a company that has developed a 
particular idea to discover in the marketplace that the 
large customer that it wishes to sign up refuses to be 
supplied exclusively by one producer. The solution is to 
license one rival, not four or five rivals making it harder 
to make a profit in return for the effort put in.
<P>
Why is the Under-Secretary not worried about such 
agreements? No provision exists for tackling the issue in 
the manner in which the Government propose to tackle 
vertical ties on the distribution and pricing of physical 
goods. Might such agreements in any case fall foul of 
other provisions contained in the legislation?
<P>
I was also interested in the Government's comments on 
land agreements. I agree with their view that land 
covenants can be anti-competitive. However, they 
otherwise seem to say that nothing in the land market 
could be anti-competitive, that general exemptions are 
therefore a good idea, and that one need not worry too 
much about the matter.
<P>
Let us think about a type of conduct that, I hasten to 
add, no company to my knowledge currently pursues, but 
which could be pursued and must therefore be anticipated. 
Let us take the hypothetical example of a supermarket 
chain that acquires prime sites in important towns or 
urban locations, and which notices that only three or four 
other sites suitable for the construction of rival 
supermarkets exist in those towns. The chain discovers 
that its margins are above average because the town or 
urban area does not have as much retail space as one 
might expect. Sales and profit per square foot therefore 
prove rather good. The chain then buys up the remaining 
three or four suitable sites and sells them on for an 
alternative use, with a restrictive covenant that prevents 
their use as a supermarket. The chain may even make 
money independently through such transactions. That 
would certainly be likely in a rising land market such as 
prevails today. That would be a good but an 
outrageously anti-competitive commercial strategy.
<P>
Do the Government intend to stop such practices, or do 
the general statements about land not raising competition 
issues show that the Government would not be worried 
about the matter? Such practices could even be pursued 
without a covenant. One could construct a different sort 
of property on the site in question and sell it on. For 
example, no one would be willing to destroy industrial 
property worth millions of pounds in order to construct 
a superstore. Although it might make economic sense to 
construct a superstore in the first place, it would not make 
sense to buy a brand new industrial property, knock it 
down, and put up a superstore. Such a strategy must be 
controlled because it would be limiting and dangerous 
from the customer's viewpoint.



<P>
Although the new clause is a welcome step in the right 
direction, it leaves much to be desired. Before accepting 
it, we need first to see a definition of vertical agreements 
that makes sense. Secondly, proper guidance should be 
given to businesses on whether they are likely to benefit 
by the clause. Thirdly, the Government need to state how 
much cost and trouble will be incurred during the 
transitional period, or whether some of the past work of 
the MMC can be carried forward and regarded as 
sufficient for those businesses tied up in it. Fourthly, a 
reassurance should be given that anti-competitive land 
issues will still be covered.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Like my right hon. Friend the Member 
for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), I am grateful to the 
Under-Secretary for the detail in which he explained 
Government new clause 13. Of course, the Committee 
will be aware that I tabled new clause 11 before the 
Government tabled new clause 13, so my new clause was 
not a response to new clause 13, rather a pre-emption of 
it. Like my right hon. Friend, I was surprised that, rather 
than responding to our previous debate a modest debate, 
because the Government were still considering those 
matters and responding to new clause 11, new clause 13 
took us so little further forward, other than to give 
legislative expression to the Government's desire to 
decide about these matters at some later stage, because 
new clause 13 really represents no more than that.
<P>
My right hon. Friend did an excellent job of explaining 
some of the circumstances in which vertical agreements 
arise, highlighting their importance as a form of economic 
activity and the need for the Government to respond to 
some of those instances. Certainly, for my part, the 
presumption I believe that this is also the presumption 
of the Government, although they do not give expression 
to it in new clause 13 is that most vertical agreements 
are benign and are designed to deliver benefit to 
consumers. It was therefore somewhat odd that, in his 
opening statement, the Under-Secretary was at pains to 
stress that there were exceptions, and that not all vertical 
agreements are benign. Indeed, to state the obvious, that 
not all vertical agreements are benign, does not obviate 
the need for the Government to make the parallel starting 
statement, that the majority of vertical agreements are 
benign and have positive effects. That gives us a guide to 
how we should approach the matter in the legislation and 
illustrates the central point that Government new clause 
13 does not meet the objective.
<P>
If it were the Government's intention to demonstrate 
legislatively that they believe that vertical agreements are 
substantially benign but that there will be exceptions, in 
order to reflect that, the structure of the clause in the Bill 
should be one that exempts or excludes vertical 
agreements in the first instance but provides for 
exceptions, which would be linked to the anti-competitive 
effect of any particular agreement in terms of the chapter 
1 prohibition. Hopefully, therefore, it is fairly obvious 
why I followed the course that I did in constructing new 
clause 11, since it is precisely designed to create that 
structure that vertical agreements should be disapplied 
under new clause 13, but to provide the opportunity for 
the director to use the test of whether such an agreement 
would have infringed the chapter 1 prohibition, in effect 
to claw back.



<P>
The difficulty is that the Government are operating 
my exchange with my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Wokingham made this clear on the basis that they want 
to wait and see what the Commission will say about 
vertical restraints on an EU basis. There are two 
difficulties with that. First, the competition authorities on 
an EU-wide basis do not approach vertical restraints in 
the way that we do in the domestic context not that they 
apply different criteria for what is anti-competitive, but 
they apply an additional criterion that does not apply in 
our domestic context. From the Commission's point of 
view, it is desirable as an objective in itself not to consent 
to agreements that have the effect of dividing up the single 
market, regardless of whether those agreements are 
pro-competitive or may have consumer benefit. So there 
may be a degree of externality to the judgment of the 
competition authorities in an EU context that is not 
relevant in the UK context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that when the 
President of the Board of Trade trumpeted her support for 
vertical agreements and her intention to ensure their 
general exclusion from the scope of the Bill, she was 
unaware of that aspect of Commission thinking? If 
Ministers have only subsequently been apprised of 
Commission thinking of which they should previously 
have been aware that might explain the Government's 
manifest back-tracking on this point and failure to deliver.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is probably right. He 
hints at a wider difficulty, in relation to which the 
President of the Board of Trade, in her early comments 
on the Bill, laboured under many misapprehensions. Her 
intentions suffered from a general lack of specificity. She 
believed that, through the incorporation of articles 85 and 
86, the EU approach to competition policy could apply as 
a whole within UK legislation. Our debates have shown 
again and again that that is not possible. It is not that the 
UK context will give rise to incompatibilities and lead to 
double jeopardy and dual tests for UK companies. In 
contrast, the competition objectives of EU competition 
law can be applied within UK law with a greater degree 
of certainty and a margin of appreciation for the UK 
context. It is transparent to EU companies that engage 
substantially in trade between member states that an 
additional test would be applied in the EU context. That 
is where the question of distorting the single market 
would come into play.



<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> As always, my hon. Friend makes a 
powerful case. Could not double jeopardy be avoided in 
one of two ways? First, it could be avoided if as the 
Government want to do identical provisions are 
successfully introduced. We have shown that the 
Government cannot do that. Secondly, it could be avoided 
by defining the marketplace if the marketplace is on 
such a scale that it extends across state borders, it would 
be within the jurisdiction of Brussels; if not, it would rest 
with the British authorities. Different provisions could 
apply in different circumstances, which would avoid 
double jeopardy big ones would go to Brussels and 
smaller ones would stay here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. 
The question to which we should apply ourselves and to 
which the Government should apply themselves is not 
whether double jeopardy can be eliminated in the long 
term by making agreements between EU and UK 
competition authorities on individual cases, but how to 
minimise the degree of jeopardy for UK industry by 
ensuring that the way in which cases will be handled, who 
will handle them and which law will be applied is 
transparent in the legislation. It is not impossible it 
should be perfectly possible in this instance for the UK 
and EU competition authorities to arrive at agreements on 
vertical restraints and recognise that a distinction may 
exist between the approach of EU competition authorities 
to applying their definitions and our approach.
<P>
As I said earlier, the EU approach poses a second 
difficulty. We do not have the benefit of the document to 
which the Under-Secretary referred but he was kind 
enough to tell the Committee about it. The point that my 
eye lit upon to speak metaphorically was the question 
of different economic level, which in this context presents 
a serious problem. That is for two reasons. First, although 
the Under-Secretary rightly said that vertical agreements 
are often bound together with horizontal arrangements 
between undertakings, that is sometimes for good reasons. 
For instance, a franchise company may not only have a 
distribution and supply arrangement with a franchise 
holder but may exercise direct management to maintain 
the quality and set the brand. That would be a mix of the 
vertical and the horizontal. I do not for a minute regard 
that as generally an anti-competitive or undesirable 
practice from the consumer's point of view. In so far as 
the Commission adopts an approach defining vertical 
restraint by reference to different economic levels, it may 
exclude such agreements from the definition of vertical 
restraint, doing damage in the process.



<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The approach that is being adopted to competition law 
is designed to focus on effects. New clause 11 is designed 
to do the same, in the same terms as the Bill. Yet, in the 
context of the question of economic level, does not the 
Commission propose to introduce a test not of the effect 
of the agreement, but its form: that it exists between 
undertakings at different economic levels? That is not a 
desirable way of approaching vertical agreements. If we 
are to define the characteristics of vertical agreements we 
should do so in relation to specific characteristics likely 
to produce, in general, directly anti-competitive effects, 
not in relation to specific forms.
<P>
That brings me to a point on which I can agree with 
the Minister, but still chastise him for not making the 
matter clear. For instance, the Minister made it perfectly 
clear that the Government intend price fixing in the 
context of a vertical agreement to be excluded from 
exemption. However, there is nothing in new clause 13 
about that, because the Minister is not, for whatever 
reason, ready to tell us what he means by a vertical 
agreement. New clause 11 makes it clear that price fixing 
is ruled out, except in special instances relating to an 
agency agreement, and so on. We can already perceive 
the benefits of certainty, and of expressing the desirable 
characteristics of a vertical agreement in competitive 
terms, through new clause 11 rather than new clause 13.
<P>
I shall summarise the five reasons why new clause 11 
is better than new clause 13. The first is that the structure 
of new clause 11 makes clear the presumption in favour 
of vertical agreements' exemption and sets out the 
exclusions from that. Thus it is structured like the policy, 
and in general legislation should reflect policy, rather than 
being opaque.
<P>
Secondly, new clause 11 makes clear the exclusion of 
price fixing, on which both sides of the Committee agree, 
whereas new clause 13 leaves all that to be expressed 
subsequently in orders.
<P>
Thirdly, new clause 11 operates on the character of the 
agreement and in its effects; that is relevant to the point 
that I made about differences in economic level. Also, 
clearly, under subsection (2) of new clause 11, in so far 
as the director general has a clawback power, it is directly 
related to the same test that would apply to the 
infringement of the chapter I prohibition as a whole.



<P>
The fourth benefit of new clause 11 is that it allows 
franchise agreements; for example, it allows vertical 
agreements with horizontal characteristics, as long as they 
are beneficial and do not infringe the chapter I prohibition 
in the way just described.
<P>
Fifthly, the clawback power in new clause 13 is 
expressed in relation to prescribed circumstances. The 
Government, as is their wont, want an enabling clause. 
Prescribed circumstances are not set out, and I am not 
sure that I heard the Minister give an accurate account of 
what prescribed circumstances might be in the context.
<P>
The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy) 
talked about representations form the National Consumer 
Council. The council made two points, the first of which 
the hon. Lady raised with the Minister and he answered 
properly. The second, relates to the director general's 
clawback power. The National Consumer Council asks 
how the power is to be exercised. It says that the power 
should be subject to scrutiny after it has been used, and 
asks how that will happen. It also asks:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"What might trigger the Director to use the clawback power in 
subsection 3 of the clause?... Can third parties alert the Director to 
particular problems?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The NCC could have asked a range of other questions 
about the circumstances in which the director general 
would use the clawback power.
<P>
When an expert body such as the NCC examines new 
clause 13, it immediately questions whether the director 
general's clawback power will be used for the same 
purpose and in the same way as the director general's 
other powers under the Bill, or whether the prescribed 
circumstances mean that the clawback power is different.
<P>
New clause 11 makes clear the director general's 
clawback power. If, but for the disapplication in 
subsection (1); a vertical agreement would infringe the 
chapter I prohibition, the director general would have a 
clawback power. Therefore, all the circumstances are 
clear, and do not have to be prescribed. The director 
general would be able to use all the powers in the Bill in 
relation to a chapter I prohibition. New clause 11 would 
provide certainty, whereas new clause 13 creates 
uncertainty.



<P>
I have given five good reasons for accepting new clause 
11 rather than new clause 13. I have shown some of the 
difficulties of new clause 13 that the Under-Secretary, for 
all his efforts, has not tackled adequately.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> The initial comments of the right 
hon. Member for Wokingham amply illustrated his 
approach to the Bill. It is the approach of someone who 
has a jigsaw puzzle and tries to force the pieces together 
because they will not quite fit, but is oblivious to the fact 
that the picture that emerges is not the one on the front of 
the box.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman gave some very brave 
examples, especially the beer example, given the criticism 
of the previous Government after the MMC report and 
their actions almost a decade ago. The previous 
Government were also criticised after the 1992 MMC 
report on cars. Another breathtaking example, in view of 
their plight after years of a Conservative regime, was that 
of newsagents.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman plucked bad examples out of 
the air. The Conservative party showed no sympathy for 
ironing out the problems in the past. When the previous 
Government tried to tackle some of the problems, they 
created a shambles in the marketplace.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the powers of 
the new clause and the transitional period. We expect to 
define vertical agreements widely. They will enjoy the 
benefits of the new clause until the director general 
decides otherwise. The director general will do that only 
if he concludes that the agreement would infringe the 
prohibition and not merit an unconditional exemption.
<P>
I shall deal with the serious points made by the hon. 
Member for South Cambridgeshire, the shadow Trade and 
Industry Minister. We have made it clear throughout our 
proceedings that the Government believe that the majority 
of vertical agreements do not raise competition concerns. 
They can provide benefits for consumers, and thus they 
are benign, to use the hon. Gentleman's word. That is the 
reason for introducing the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> We still need to know when the 
order-making power will be used and who will be covered 
by the provision. Why cannot the Minister tell us that?



<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I was coming to that. As I said earlier, 
the right hon. Gentleman tries to force the pieces together.
<P>
The European Commission is undertaking the most 
comprehensive review of this matter for decades. As I 
have explained, it has come up with a draft document, 
from which I have quoted. Of course, we are considering 
the businesses to be covered by the provision with the 
task force that represents those who are interested in the 
Bill and its impact. The task force is considering 
definitions, one of which I have given to Conservative 
Members in any case. Including a definition that was 
unacceptable to the Commission and to the task force that 
has given us such valuable help would, therefore, be 
jumping the gun and would fly in the face of business 
interests. I have no intention of going down that route.
<P>
I was asked how liberally the definition will be 
interpreted. We have said that there is value in following 
the broad approach contemplated by the Commission.
I have given one definition. The hon. Member for South 
Cambridgeshire has at least salvaged the reputation of the 
Opposition with a constructive comment and with his 
criticism of the matter. I am sure that comments on the 
draft wording of one definition will be taken into account 
by members of the task force. That is their job it is not 
the Government's job to second guess them.
<P>
Land agreements were also raised. It may be helpful if 
I go into that matter in more detail, to reassure Committee 
members about the Government's intentions.
<P>
We propose to disapply the sanctions of the Chapter I 
prohibitions in relation to land agreements. The effect of 
that would be to ensure that parties are not subject to 
penalties for infringement of the prohibition. It would also 
ensure that land agreements are not at risk of being 
rendered void for being said to infringe the prohibition 
and that land agreements would not be subject to third 
party action in the courts.
<P>
For that reason we propose to grant special treatment 
under the power in the new clause to the kinds of 
restrictions identified in our February discussion paper on 
the exclusion of land agreements. A copy of that paper 
which I am sure hon. Members have studied is in the 
Library.
<P>
We intend to give the special treatment to agreements 
which create, alter, transfer or surrender an estate or 
interest in land and to restrictions that, for example, limit 
the terms on which trade or activity may be carried out. 
However, we propose to exclude some of those 
restrictions from the special treatment so that the 
prohibition may be applied to them, if that is appropriate. 
For example, we would exclude restrictions that relate to 
an economic activity carried out on premises by a tenant 
in respect of which he has a trading relationship with the 
landlord.
<P>
The approach embodied in the discussion document 
was welcomed by our consultees in the property industry. 
We intend to continue working with the industry when we 
come to draft the secondary legislation under the power 
in the new clause.
<P>
The value of secondary legislation is that it allows for 
full consultation while the European Commission 
conducts its review of the treatment of vertical restraints. 
That will mean that the Bill will be in line with the 
Commission's views. Therefore, businesses will not have 
to apply two different tests at the EC and UK level. For 
that reason, I urge my hon. Friends to support the new 
clause.



<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That was a disappointing response to a 
good debate, in which some extremely good points were 
made by my hon. Friend the Member for South 
Cambridgeshire. I am glad that his contributions were 
thought to be constructive. Indeed, the Opposition's 
approach to this and other issues has been entirely 
constructive. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I 
associate ourselves with the work and remarks of our hon. 
Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire and, having 
listened to the debate, we believe that his wording is much 
better than the Government's wording of the new clause.
<P>
I was told that I am forcing together jigsaw pieces that 
do not fit. A better way to describe the matter would be 
to say that the Government are trying to make a jigsaw 
with half the pieces missing. The Opposition want to 
supply some of the missing pieces so that business will 
see the whole picture and not merely half of it, when this 
inelegant Government jigsaw is attempted.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Under-Secretary said that he cannot second guess 
or pre-empt the task force. That is a curious statement. 
The task force was set up by the Government to solve a 
problem of the Government's making. It has been in 
session for quite a long time, and it is open to Ministers 
at the Department of Trade and Industry to set a timetable 
for the task force to conclude its work. That matter should 
be under ministerial control. It is ministerial legislation; 
Ministers wish to change the law. Although I am happy 
that Ministers are consulting widely with business that 
is a good thing there must be a point at which they stop 
consulting, come to a decision and present it to the 
Committee and the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My right hon. Friend has made an 
eminently sensible point. A task force is charged with 
performing a task and it is not unreasonable to hope that 
it will complete that task. Did my right hon. Friend notice 
that when he made that reasonable observation the 
Under-Secretary shook his head? Should the Committee 
therefore conclude that the Under-Secretary believes that 
the task force should never complete its task, but should 
remain in suspended animation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is one possibility. I, too, was 
surprised when the Under-Secretary shook his head. Task 
forces can be useful, but they should be set achievable 
tasks, with a timetable that matches the Government's 
legislative timetable. If the Government are not yet ready 
to legislate on these matters, the Opposition would be 
happy if they delayed the passage of the Bill. We have 
not tried to delay it, even though it is not ready to go on 
to the statute book. The Government could decide to hold 
consultations for a further three months while they 
organise their task force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shook my head because the right hon. 
Gentleman has grave problems in fitting the facts to his 
comments, although that is not unusual for him. Are the 
Opposition telling us that while the European Commission 
is conducting a review and seeking definitions, we should 
pre-empt that by fixing a deadline for the task force to 
arrive at a definition? Then when the European 
Commission comes up with a different definition, should 
we place on business the burden of complying with both 
definitions? If the right hon. Gentleman cannot see that 
problem, I feel sorry for him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is an interesting point, but it is 
different from the one that I am making. We are 
legislating for British circumstances with British law, 
therefore Ministers can choose their task forces and ensure 
that they report to a timetable that agrees with the 
Government's legislative timetable. However, the 
Under-Secretary is now telling the Committee that the 
problem is the Brussels timetable. There are two possible 
answers to that problem and he should consider them.




<P>
The United Kingdom is an important member and 
paymaster of the Community. Surely it would be possible 
for the Under-Secretary or his boss to go to Brussels and 
point out that the Government need to legislate on this 
matter soon, that the definition is holding them up and 
that they need a definition for the Report stage of their 
Bill. The Government could help to produce an agreed 
definition and could achieve one through strong 
negotiations. That would be the obvious way to do it. 
They could return in triumph on Report and say, "Ah, the 
right hon. Member for Wokingham was too sceptical 
about our ability to deliver these matters. We have been 
successful in Brussels and we have an agreement on a 
definition that we like. Indeed, we were instrumental in 
achieving it." The Opposition would obviously then have 
to consider that carefully as an answer to the problem.
<P>
Alternatively, the Under-Secretary might be right to be 
sceptical about the Government's ability to negotiate these 
things in Brussels. He might say that it will take another 
year to get a definition out of Brussels because they have 
no influence over it all, in which case, he should withdraw 
the legislation until Brussels has made up its mind. He 
could bring out a law closer to the Brussels law once 
Brussels has decided what its own law is. We have the 
absurd position today that a Bill to bring us in line with 
Brussels cannot be written because Brussels does not 
know what its own law is.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Beard (Bexleyheath and Crayford):</B> Is not 
the approach that the right hon. Gentleman advocates in 
keeping with the approach of the previous Government 
towards Brussels where everything was confrontational? 
As a result nothing happened and we reached an impasse 
in Brussels and the Government were ridiculed throughout 
Europe. That position is again being advocated for this 
legislation. It is yet another example of the Opposition 
looking for a stunt that demonstrates their Europhobic 
credentials through a confrontation with Brussels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The hon. Gentleman cannot have been 
listening to the debate. I am arguing the opposite. I am 
saying that as important members of the Community, 
where presumably we have some influence, cannot we get 
Brussels to make a decision which is in our interests and 
its interests. Surely the point of belonging to a community 
is that one can agree things with partners that make sense 
across borders and sometimes within one's own borders. 
If the Government are unable to do that it shows that 
they, not the Opposition, are having problems with their 
relationship with Brussels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Did my right hon. Friend notice that when 
he was responding to the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and 
Crayford (Mr. Beard) the Under-Secretary chuntered from 
a sedentary position that this Government do now have 
influence with the European Commission? Is it not 
therefore rather extraordinary that, while professing that the 
Government have influence, the Under-Secretary is too 
reticent to seek to apply it?


<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is a generous interpretation of 
what is going on. I am not sure that the Government have 
the influence they claim. It is quite wrong to say that the 
previous Government were without influence. I can 
remember with colleagues on behalf of that Government 
negotiating a lot of matters affecting the single market 
where we had considerable influence over the scope of 
the programme and over the details in each directive. 
There were times when we had to be extremely firm with 
our partners because we thought that they had 
misunderstood the business need. There were other times 
when we could be co-operative and friendly. But we were 
effective on those single market issues in a way which 
this Government clearly does not want to be on this 
mighty issue of competition policy. If they were truly 
effective in Brussels, they would have a definition by 
now. They have known for a year that they wish to 
legislate. They have known for almost a year, because we 
told them, that the question whether these vertical 
agreements can be defined and treated in a sensible way, 
exempting all the benign ones and capturing one or two 
rotten ones, is one of the nubs of the argument.
<P>
Yet towards the end of the Committee stage of the Bill 
in the Commons it has already been through the stages 
in the other place the Government still do not know 
what a vertical agreement is. They do not know what 
Brussels wants to achieve and they have no idea what law 
they are trying to bring our law into line with, let alone 
whether they can align the two when we finally discover 
what the Brussels law is.
<P>
New clause 13 does not reach the standards we expect. 
There is no definition. It offers only an order-making 
power. We have not been told how that order-making 
power will be used so a huge number of industries I 
mentioned five in my opening remarks are left totally in 
the dark about whether their existing practices are decent. 
We are therefore very unhappy. On land agreements too, 
there was not much of an answer to the example I gave 
which could be achieved with or without covenants and 
where there could be an anti-competitive practice.
<P>
The Under-Secretary may remember that I said that the 
Government needed to come up with exemptions for 
many land agreements or there could be great difficulties. 
I welcome the fact that they are trying to do so. But again 
at this late stage they should be able to be more precise 
to make sure that that minority of land agreements that 
could be anti-competitive will not be exempted, and to 
give us more guidance on how this general power will 
be used.
<P>
What I propose, with the leave of my hon. Friend the 
Member for South Cambridgeshire, is that we do not press 
either of the new clauses to a vote, but urge the 
Government to reconsider before Report, because we do 
not think that their new clause goes far enough towards 
solving the problem and we hope that they might learn 
from the excellent new clause 11.



<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and Westminster):</B> I welcome the fact that the Government brought new clause 13, whatever its quality, before the 
Committee, for the reasons that we gave earlier when 
indicating our hope of seeing the Government's views on 
vertical agreements written in the Bill and not left entirely 
to subsequent action. I propounded then my own law 
about the Government being paralysed between 
headlights one of which was marked CBI, the other 
being whichever organisation happened to be against the 
CBI at the time, on this occasion the NCC.
<P>
The Minister quoted the CBI's approval of new clause 
13, but I noted that he made no reference whatever to the 
NCC. He was prompted by his hon. Friend the Member 
for Plymouth, Sutton, who is temporarily absent from the 
Committee. The hon. Lady intervened, prefacing a 
question with the observation that the NCC's letter 
broadly welcomed new clause 13. I confess that I did not 
read it quite that way. It was noticeable that the Minister, 
although he answered the question, did not take up the 
prompt that the hon. Lady gave him about the NCC's 
reaction and say that yes, it was a good thing that both 
organisations favoured the new clause.
<P>
The pedigree of the NCC's views is its original 
response to the consultation paper published last summer, 
which was quoted specifically in at least a paragraph in 
the valuable House of Commons Library research paper, 
which was made available to all members of the 
Committee. The research paper stated specifically that the 
NCC held an opinion that was categorically opposed to 
the CBI's by 180 degrees.
<P>
The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton who, 
regretfully, is still not in Committee will also have 
received the NCC's briefing on the Bill on 5 May in 
which these concerns were reiterated. I repeat that I did 
not read from the letter that we received in June that the 
NCC had moved significantly its position on vertical 
agreements, and that it still felt concerns. The hon. 
Member for Plymouth, Sutton did not quote the second 
question, about clawback, which my hon. Friend the 
Member for South Cambridgeshire picked up but, given 
the suggestion that the NCC had broadly welcomed new 
clause 13, perhaps it was as well that she did not, because 
it made it clear that there were considerable misgivings.
I did not detect any specific or precise response from the 
Minister to what my hon. Friend the Member for South 
Cambridgeshire said when quoting from the NCC's letter 
to Members. I am therefore left with the opinion that the 
NCC's headlight to which I referred in Brooke's law is 
still very much on but that the Government have escaped 
it because in the end they will come down in favour of 
the CBI.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend and agree 
with him that it would be better if the Government 
reflected further before Report on some of the issues 
raised in this interesting and useful debate because 
problems still arise.
<P>
I wish to put to the Minister three questions arising 
from my earlier speech to which he gave no reply. He 
should either reply or make it clear that he does not have 
a reply at this stage. That would validate further a 
substantive revision of the clause and a substantive debate 
on Report.



<P>
The Minister spoke about different economic level. Has 
he any idea what is meant by different economic level in 
this context? Would its application mean that 
undertakings at the same economic level as well as at a 
different economic level whatever that means would 
automatically be excluded from the scope of any 
exemption applied to vertical agreements?
<P>
Secondly, following the point made by my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster 
(Mr. Brooke), can the Minister tell us what is meant by 
"prescribed circumstances" in relation to the claw-back 
powers of the director general? To help the Minister out, 
can he tell the Committee that prescribed circumstances 
will mean pursuing the same powers and tests as are 
prescribed elsewhere in relation to the application of a 
chapter I prohibition and the test for its infringement?
<P>
Thirdly, is it the Government's intention that the 
order-making power referred to in the new clause should 
be included in clause 70(4), thereby making it a 
requirement that it be the subject of an affirmative 
resolution of the House?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed (South-East Cornwall):</B> It is 
preferable to have clear and distinct definitions built into 
the Bill so that people reading it can establish whether 
they are caught by any of the provisions and will need to 
make changes to comply with new legislation. The 
Government have clearly had some difficulty in defining 
benign vertical agreements. In view of new clause 11, it 
is clear that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire 
has made an excellent stab far better than I could at 
providing such a helpful definition.
<P>
I recall that when the previous Government attempted 
to create clear and distinct definitions of competition in 
certain sectors particularly in the brewing industry 
their intentions were right but subsequent implementation 
caused considerable concern and upheaval within the 
industry.
<P>
Subsection (6) of new clause 13 provides for scrutiny of 
individual agreements so that the particularities of specific 
industries can be taken into account, but the right hon. 
Member for Wokingham ably demonstrated the enormous 
range of different agreements in different industries, so 
providing one definition however long to cover all 
those particular circumstances may be beyond even the 
best brains in the country.
<P>
I consider new clause 13 to be a reasonable approach 
to the problem, particularly as we may be at an interim 
stage. When we spoke about the Brussels definition, we 
did not fully understand the potential time scale. If it is 
going to be only weeks, the Government could make 
representations to speed up the process so that some sort 
of definition can be made available from Brussels in the 
near future. In those circumstances we have every reason 
to wait for a proper definition. However, if it is likely to 
be way ahead in the future, new clause 13 could be 
regarded as providing a reasonable approach and a way 
forward. Will the Minister tell the Committee what will 
be the likely time scale?

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Let me answer the three points 
raised by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire
and thank the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall
(Mr. Breed) for his constructive contribution.



<P>
In discussing the definition, the hon. Member for South 
Cambridgeshire focused on the words "each operating on 
a different economic level". The interpretation of those 
words is the crux of what the task force must consider. 
The results of that consideration will be made available 
to hon. Members.
<P>
Let me move on to the hon. Gentleman's last point 
I shall deal with his second point thirdly which was 
more helpful and related to the scrutiny provided by the 
new clause. I can confirm, in direct response to his 
question, that any order will be subject to affirmative 
resolution of the House. So hon. Members will have the 
opportunity to consider and vote on the definitions that 
we adopt. I am sure that the Committee will find that 
reassuring.
<P>
In response to the hon. Gentleman's other point of 
substance I am glad that at least one Conservative 
Members is raising points of substance the clawback 
that he mentioned is intended to operate in similar terms 
to other powers of clawback that exist for exclusion of 
mergers and agreements filed under the Restrictive Trade 
Practices Acts but which are found non-significant in 
competition terms. That makes it clear how the clawback 
is intended to operate, and I hope that it satisfies the 
hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

</UL></FONT>



<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> The new clauses are intended to clarify and 
strengthen an important area of trading and marketing of 
products. I think that we would all agree that true 
competition has always featured distinctiveness as a 
proper means of promoting goods in an open and fair 
marketplace. Unfair competition is that which deliberately 
seeks to mislead, to deceive or to blur distinction in order 
to gain an unfair advantage by sleight of hand, rather than 
by excellence of product or price advantage.
<P>
We have heard on a number of occasions in Committee 
that one reason fo the Bill is to provide some 
harmonisation between United Kingdom and European 
Union legislation, as a proper means of operating the 
single market however imperfect we have seen that to 
be. As there is a growing market across national 
boundaries in Europe for all sorts of products, it makes 
perfect sense that UK legislation should be at least as 
strong as that afforded to manufacturers, both large and 
small, across Europe. This is an important area of 
competition, and one that is vital to the public interst, as 
consumers are the target for those seeking to use 
marketing, packaging and other means to create confusion 
in their minds. If we do not tackle the issue now, there 
will be further examples of parasitic activity, which does 
nothing for consumers, or for proper competition.
<P>
It has been argued elsewhere, and will no doubt be 
argued here, that existing regulations are sufficient, but I 
will take a few moments to suggest that they could be 
strengthened. During the passage of the Trade Marks Act 
1994, the Government said that look-alikes tend not to 
copy trademarks, so they are not a trademark issue. It 
can take several years to register a trademark, while a 
look-allied can be launched in a market in a matter of 
months, and may even leave the marketplace before a 
trademark can be issued. The shortcomings of trademark 
legislation become clear form the high profile case 
involving Penguins and Puffins, in which United Biscuits 
failed to bring a case of trademark infringement.
<P>
As for so-called passing off, it is necessary to prove 
consumer confusion. That is difficult to do in the case of 
look-alikes, which tend to be rather low value goods so 
consumers are not inclined to complain and often 
prominently carry a different name from that of the brand. 
While Penguin won its case against Puffin under passing 
off, that was pyrrhic victory. Puffin biscuits are still on 
sale in Asda today albeit in slightly amended packaging.
<P>
We should also remember that the UK has obligations 
under the trade-related aspect of intellectual property 
agreement to provide its nationals with effective 
protection against unfair competition. the prevalence of 
look-alikes in the UK demonstrates that existing 
measures are not truly effective. I am pleased see that 
a voluntary agreement is in place under the auspices of 
the Institute of Grocery Distribution. However, almost 
inevitably, that has limitations. Not all retailers have 
been prepared to sign it. It would not have helped much 
in the Penguin v. Puffin case, as Asda have refused to 
sign it. It is limited to the grocery sector only, and 
provides no means of tackling look-alikes that are 
imported from other countries hence the earlier 
reference to the European dimension.



<P>
The fact that the new clauses would create a wider new 
property right is often presented as a reason not to pursue 
the matter. The new clauses would be more flexible than 
the current arrangements but would not provide wide 
scope in granting new property rights. New clause 8 is 
similar to passing off, but without the need to prove 
damage to reputation or good will, which will assist new 
products and smaller companies such as those represented 
by Anti Copying in Design. That is important, especially 
in the craft area. Some very small businesses 
micro-businesses in my constituency produce nice, 
small craft designs that are attractive, especially to the 
tourist industry. The designs of their products have often 
been copied by larger retailers and sent to far-off lands, 
for example, the far east, to have the design copied. They 
have no protection against that. Small businesses' unique 
designs, which are attractive and provide a decent living, 
are undermined by larger companies taking that design, 
creating a slight difference and heavily marketing it. New 
clause 9 would protect the distinctive character of product 
packaging, thereby assisting competition.
<P>
The fact that the new clauses would make trademark 
registrations redundant is often presented as an argument 
not to proceed. However, that flies in the face of the 
evidence. European countries such as France, Belgium 
and Germany have unfair competition law, but also enjoy 
high and increasing demand for trademark restrictions. 
Furthermore, 59,000 applications had been made for the 
European Community trademark by August 1997, yet 
every country in Europe, with the exception of only the 
United Kingdom and Eire, has unfair competition laws. 
Trademark law will continue to be a vital part of 
intellectual property protection, as the evidence shows.
<P>
It is also often said that the problem is historic, but 
arguably it is a result of how we have progressed in the 
past few years. Look-alike products are now much more 
prevalent in the marketplace, although not all receive such 
a high profile as that featured in the Penguin v. Puffin 
case, or as Sainsbury's cola in the war with Coca-Cola. 
At Christmas, I participated in the presentation of a 
hamper of look-alikes to the Under Secretary, which he 
might recall. The hamper was subsequently distributed to 
charity I want to assure all hon. Members of that before 
they rush off to examine the register. The Consumers 
Association joined us in that presentation, at which we 
examined a huge number of look-alikes. Age Concern was 
also present and pointed out that many of its members, 
especially those with failing sight, had purchased the 
wrong product on several occasions not that they were 
always looking for the cheaper product, but they were 
looking for the right one. Sometimes the right product is 
the cheaper one and sometimes not. Clearly, the 
packaging made an enormous difference, and they often 
arrived home with the wrong product.



<P>
It is often said that the new clauses would damage 
supermarkets' own-label products, and thereby increase 
prices to consumers. The majority of supermarket 
own-label products are already distinctively packaged and 
would be unaffected. If the new clause were accepted, 
an own-label would have to be launched in distinctive 
packaging, but that is no more expensive than look-alike 
packaging. The new clause, therefore, would not have a 
detrimental impact on prices.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I sympathise with the thrust of the hon. 
Gentleman's powerful argument and do not wish to 
detract from it, but does he agree that the Government's 
reluctance to legislate against look-alike products might 
be because they are worried that one of the first vulnerable 
organisations would be new Labour?
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman; I could tell 
where his argument was going.
<P>
I want consumers to be able to distinguish between 
products, which means that distinguishing factors are 
important. It is sometimes said that the measures
I propose are sought by large manufacturers to protect 
their interests. The survey evidence shows convincingly 
that consumers are misled by look-alikes. Consumers are 
sometimes unable to make informed decisions because 
they are misled by similar packaging into thinking that a 
look-alike product comes from the same factory as a 
leading brand product and that it is virtually identical, 
albeit packaged differently. That in turn fosters the 
impression that the extra cost of brand products is due 
only to advertising or other expenses which is not the 
case. The products inside the packaging are distinctly 
different.
<P>
The size of the company involved is irrelevant beside 
the immorality of riding on the back of a competitor's 
investment risk. Brand image and new products require 
considerable investment and attention. Look-alike 
products are nothing more than parasitic trading, allowing 
people to profit from others' investment and effort. 
Consumers are said to be foolish if they are fooled by 
look-alikes. The evidence shows that consumers are 
indeed confused by look-alikes not because they are 
foolish but because of the subtlety of the look-alike 
packaging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. He has not 
yet given us the statistics, although I am sure that he is as 
familiar with them as other members of the Committee. 
Surely it is relevant not only that substantial numbers of 
consumers are confused, but that it is precisely the 
intention of those engaged in the manufacture and sale of 
look-alike products to confuse people that is what is so 
dishonourable about the practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> That is correct; the purpose of the 
packaging is to deceive. Recent research by the 
Consumers Association, which might be of interest, shows 
that 6 per cent. of consumers which they estimate at 
over two million a year recently purchased a look-alike 
by mistake. NOP has put the figure at nearer 17 per cent. 
Even if we take the average of around 10 per cent., that 
is a considerable number of purchases. The matter needs 
to be taken seriously.



<P>
An admirable report by Dr. Shayne Mitchell, 
"Checking out the Supermarkets", states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"So-called `look-alikes', own-brands which mimic the name, 
packaging and design of a leading brand, raise further competition 
questions. Their success depends on encouraging the shopper into 
thinking they are buying the original, or that the product is made by 
the brand manufacturer or shares in its quality. Supermarkets argue 
that they do not intend to mislead shoppers, but this begs the 
question why they use look-alike packaging."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My intention is not to accuse all supermarkets of such 
practice. I welcome, for example, Tesco's announcement 
that it will discontinue look-alike packaging. At least one 
supermarket is taking notice of what should be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> This is an important 
subject, and I have considerable sympathy with the points 
that were made by the hon. Member for South-East 
Cornwall. I suspect that I can read the Under-Secretary's 
mind if not his notes and I appreciate the dilemma that 
he is in.
<P>
There is a general presumption on both sides of the 
Committee that we should encourage competition, that 
there should be as many players as the market can 
reasonably stand, and that they should compete with each 
other vigorously because that is in the interests of the 
consumer and, ultimately, of the better manufacturers and 
distributors. That much should be incontestable.
<P>
The British Brands Group sent us briefing about the 
items to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and one or 
two visual aids which, unfortunately, the rules of order do 
not allow us to make use of in our debate. For the record, 
we were sent a hamper apiece. The question is about the 
extent to which difficulties arise when there is a deliberate 
or explicit intention to create a product that is so close to 
another product that the ordinary consumer the person 
who is in a hurry, who has left his glasses behind or who 
is used to a particular position on the supermarket shelf 
picks up the wrong item by mistake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I understand that my hon. Friend does 
not want to fall foul of the rules of order by displaying 
visual aids, but will he briefly describe some examples so 
that we are aware of the nature and scale of the attempted 
piracy and deception?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a helpful suggestion, and I hope 
that my hon. Friend will not think that the following 
example is directed at him. I draw the Committee's 
attention to the Gillette series deodorant body spray, 
Pacific Light, which is carefully mirrored by the Blueprint 
body spray deodorant, Tradewind. It would be difficult 
for most people to tell the difference between the two.



<P>
A tension is involved. We want to encourage 
competition, but we do not want to encourage the sort of 
competition that the hon. Member for South-East 
Cornwall described, in a slightly misleading way, as 
unfair. I have one small reservation about his comments. 
We should distinguish, in practice, between two cases. 
The first, of which I gave an example earlier, involves 
two products, which are probably produced by different 
manufacturers but which are broadly similar in 
appearance in a way that can be confusing. The second 
involves the fact although this might be denied that 
some manufacturers and retailers offer two products on 
the supermarket shelves, one of which is own-brand and 
one of which is branded, but which come off the same 
production line and are, for all reasonable purposes, the 
same although they have different prices. Unless the 
packaging is confusing which it is hardly likely to be, 
because the supermarket presumably wants the benefit of 
greater value the latter is a sensible example of market 
differentiation. However, it is a subset of the main 
problem, which is about what is and what is not fair trade.
<P>
The briefing that all Committee members received from 
the British Brands Group makes it clear that the present 
legislation does not suggest an easy way to deal with the 
problem. If a problem arose with trademarks the 
Minister will no doubt tell us that new trademarks 
legislation is under way it would involve copying a 
trademark, and no one would support that. Most of the 
cases, including the example that I gave earlier, do not 
involve copying a trademark. Indeed, the example that
I gave involved different trademarks and I said that the 
latter just happened to look like the former.
<P>
If the full panoply of the trademarks legislation which 
has something of the character of the old competition 
legislation, to which Ministers often refer were invoked, 
a long and difficult process would be involved. The Bill's 
two prohibitions are difficult to apply. The typical 
situation is that of a small manufacturer who, in trying to 
find a market niche for his product, thinks that he can ride 
on the coat tails of a successful national branded product 
by producing something that looks similar. It is difficult 
to see that as an abuse of a dominant position under the 
chapter II prohibition. Equally, unless the nature of an 
agreement between for example, a manufacturer and a 
retailer attracts the director general's attention, it is rather 
unlikely to be a chapter I prohibition because it is not 
clear that it is by itself an anti-competitive agreement 
because that kind of an agreement does not exist.



<P>
There is a problem with fitting the new clauses into the 
Bill. If the Under-Secretary says that he cannot accept 
them today, I might have some sympathy, but the new 
clauses are seriously conceived they have the 
respectable provenance of the World Intellectual Property 
Organisation to meet a real problem that is difficult to 
resolve. We need a clear understanding and expression, 
which has not been given here or in another place, that 
there is a problem. The Government should consult their 
lawyers, advisers and representatives of the trade 
including those who made representations in favour of 
competitive products so that we can tease our way 
through the problem.
<P>
I cannot give a final blueprint. I am sceptical whether 
the four new clauses of the hon. Member for South-East 
Cornwall are the final solution, and I have suggested some 
of the problems that they may cause. But the 
Under-Secretary needs to say that something is wrong, 
that he is determined to put it right and that, if he cannot 
do so today or in this Bill, he will find another mechanism 
for doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be brief. I said on Second Reading 
that the British Brands Group is in my constituency.
I have since identified its underlying 20 members.
I should declare an antique interest of which I am proud. 
When I was in the private sector, I worked as a consultant 
for four out of the 20 members. I, too, have received a 
briefing from the British Brands Group and others, which 
was rehearsed by the hon. Member for South-East 
Cornwall and drawn on by my hon. Friend the Member 
for Daventry. I certainly shall not return to all those 
arguments because members of the Committee are aware 
of them and the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall 
made a good job of setting them before the Committee.
<P>
I will, however, remark on one antithesis in the 
submissions. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall 
quoted the Consumers Association as saying that 6 per 
cent. had purchased a look-alike product within a given 
period. However, the British Retail Consortium has said 
that, according to the Consumers Association, that 
mattered in only 3 per cent. of cases.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall mentioned 
the Penguin v. Puffin case. He rightly said that it
related not to books but to biscuits. If I may digress,
Mr. Atkinson, I shall reveal a tiny piece of commercial 
history which has some relevance to what the hon. 
Gentleman said. Sir Allen Lane, after he had put the 
Penguin on the market, was at a bookstall in Paddington 
railway station when he heard someone ask either for a 
pelican or a puffin. He realised instantly that he was going 
to be faced with competition from other people who 
would introduce paperback books with bird names. He 
immediately acquired trademarks for every bird that 
began with the letter "P". That is why we have had 
ptarmigans, pelicans and penguins ever since.



<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall referred to 
the 1997 hamper, which was widely mentioned in the 
briefing documents. I have in my head a scene, which I 
have seen described in writing, of the Under-Secretary 
receiving the hamper. Although he graciously accepted it 
for subsequent distribution to charity, he rejected the 
points underlying it. I cannot find that account, so I am 
looking forward to the Minister's reply. I can imagine 
what the late Paul Jennings would have made of the 
Minister being confronted with a hamper and seeking to 
identify the differences between the products inside. 
Personally, I have in mind a cartoon that might have been 
drawn by H. M. Bateman, "The man who could spot the 
difference".

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Everyone recognises that 
unscrupulous copying and passing off of goods leads to 
unfair competition. However, I will explain why I do not 
believe that the wishes of the hon. Member for South-East 
Cornwall would be fulfilled by accepting new clauses 7, 
8, 9 and 10. In some cases, those new clauses would have 
unforeseen consequences, which I am sure that he would 
not welcome.
<P>
Some time ago, I met representatives from the British 
Brands Group with my hon. Friends, the Members for 
Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), for Burton (Mrs. Dean), for 
North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Taylor), for Carlisle
(Mr. Martlew), for Batley and Spen (Mr. Wood), for 
Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) and for Hayes and 
Harlington (Mr. McDonnell). I have had constructive 
dialogue with the British Brands Group over many years. 
I have also met representatives from Anti Counterfeiting 
in Design or ACID, who share the anxieties of the British 
Brands Group.



<P>
Views are divided on this matter. Consensus must be 
reached on the need for change, on how extensive that 
change should be and on consequences that might follow 
from the Bill or from other orders. Since the British 
Brands Group and ACID have begun to put their case, 
other groups have expressed anxieties about the proposals. 
The British Retail Consortium believes that the proposals 
would damage consumer choice and that they would be a 
barrier to competition. The Consumers Association does 
not support the new clauses.
<P>
New clause 8 would make
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any act or practice which causes, or is likely to cause, confusion 
an act of unfair competition".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In comparison with provisions in common law dealing 
with the passing off of counterfeit goods, new clause 8 
does not expressly require the plaintiff to prove the 
existence of good will or of reputation in what he seeks 
to protect. It also does not require evidence of damage to 
that reputation. That is a deficiency.
<P>
New clause 9 goes well beyond providing protection 
for branded goods from look-alikes. It covers virtually any 
commercial activity that lessens or would be likely to 
lessen the distinctive character, the advertising value, the 
appearance and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the presentation of a produce or service".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would create a new right of action of an extremely 
wide scope.
<P>
Much is made of the confusion that consumers might 
suffer as a result of the practices that the new clauses are 
designed to address. However, the clauses would create 
rights of action, whether or not the act or practice causes 
confusion. I do not believe that the hon. Member for 
South-East Cornwall feels that that is justified.
<P>
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's efforts and those of 
Hon. Members who have shown an interest in this matter. 
I mentioned some of those hon. Members earlier. 
However, I do not think that it is appropriate to accept the 
new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I will say a few words about own-labelling. 
The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about that matter. 
Own-labels, which are used for supermarkets' own 
products, highlight potential problems with supermarket 
control of the supply chain. That is part of the way in 
which supermarkets have come to occupy their own 
special place in the market.
<P>
Over recent years, own-labels in Britain have left 
behind what was perhaps originally a cheap and nasty 
image and have developed a reputation for quality and 
value. They now represent 42 per cent. of grocery sales. 
That figure is far higher than own-brand sales in the rest 
of the EU. Perhaps that provides evidence that such 
growth has not happened in parts of Europe where there 
is stronger competition law. Whether that is good or bad 
is another matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> rose 



<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Much of that growth benefits the 
consumer. However, it is easy to overlook the negative 
and anti-competitive aspects of that trading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooks:</B> The hon. Member for South-East 
Cornwall added a sentence after I had first risen and that 
has to some extent disarmed my question. I had intended 
to ask whether he seriously thought that supermarket 
own-label sales of 42 per cent. were a disadvantage to 
the consumer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I almost anticipated the intervention by 
saying that such own-label sales are obviously a benefit. 
However, the dominance of own-label products and their 
tendency to mimic leading brands has two anti-competitive 
effects. First, there is a decline in secondary brands that 
is, those apart from the brand leader. Secondly, the pressure 
on producers to manufacture supermarket own-label items 
leads to conflicting priorities; there is an erosion of brand 
strength and a more complicated relationship with the 
retailer.
<P>
One food producer explained that there was a catch-22 
predicament. If producers develop a new line or product 
a biscuit, washing powder or whatever it might be they 
want to launch it successfully and they depend on the 
supermarkets to stock it. If the product is successful, it 
will not be long before the supermarkets produce it under 
their own label. They will promote it, give it a prime 
position in their shops and put the branded product on the 
bottom shelf.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I recognise the point that the hon. 
Gentleman is making, but it is important that we have a 
balanced debate. Would he concede that the prevalence of 
own-label products in the supermarkets offers substantial 
price benefits to the customer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Absolutely. I said that earlier. I have nothing 
against own-label products per se; they offer choice and 
lower prices and that benefits the consumer. I want to 
discuss the fact that their less than distinctive packaging can 
reinforce the impression that they are exactly the same as 
the branded product and that they are not recognisably the 
supermarket's own brand. The packaging does not show 
that although the own-label products are in the same 
marketplace, they are none the less separate brands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I do not wish to delay the hon. member for 
South-East Cornwall, but we must be specific about this 
subject. I am happy to concede that the hon. Gentleman 
may be a more discerning and knowledgeable shopper than 
me, but could he give the Committee some examples of the 
non-distinctive packaging? I an a regular shopper at 
Sainsbury in Victoria street, and in fairness to Sainsbury 
and also to Tesco, in my limited experience, neither are 
guilty of using obscure packaging on their own-label 
products to imply that they are the same as some other 
product.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> In the case of some products for example 
breakfast cereals the colour of the packaging, they type 
of wording or the size of the box seem to be designed to 
ensure that the different brands appear to be the same or 
of the same quality.



<P>
Own-labelling has grown as a result both of price 
competitiveness and of the lack of distinctiveness of certain 
products. It is a prime example of the way in which some 
manufacturers have been able to promote their products. 
However, the stress on own-label products has another 
effect on the competitive process by putting supermarkets 
into an ambivalent position in relation to their suppliers, 
who are customers and also competitors. Supermarkets put 
their own-label products on to their shelves in competition 
with those of suppliers who are their customers. That raises 
certain issues of anti-competitiveness because the 
supermarkets have access to confidential information about 
product launches and strategies.
<P>
I accept what the Minister says and I know that the 
subject is a difficult one. I shall not press the matter to a 
vote, but I hope that the Government will appreciate how 
seriously Opposition Members and, I believe, Labour 
Members think it should be tackled. There are clear 
indications of a belief, in other European countries, that 
tougher legislation is necessary. We and Eire appear to be 
the only ones without it. I hope by Report for a clear 
indication, at least, of why the Government consider they 
do not need to fall in line with legislation elsewhere in 
Europe.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.



<H4><center>New Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Dominant position in water supply</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. (1) A water company with a dominant position in any area 
shall allow use of its pipe network by another company on fair terms 
and at a fair price.
<P>
(2) A dispute about the terms for access under this section shall 
be determined by the Director General of Water Services.'. <P>
</UL></FONT>
[Mr. Redwood.]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read 
a Second time.
<P>
In earlier discussions we tried to find out from the 
Government more about the large exclusions for 
revenue-producing monopolies and services of general 
economic interest. We promised that we would test that 
proposition with respect to the water industry. The new 
clause is intended to reveal more of the Government's 
thinking on how to tackle an industry in which companies 
have monopolies or very dominant market positions and 
where competition is clearly restricted by legislation but 
could, if the Government wished it, be increased under 
the Bill.
<P>
The previous Government decided and so have the 
present Government that the way to introduce 
competition into complicated marketplaces such as gas 
and electricity was to use the pipe or wire network as a 
common carrier, allowing new entrants access to those 
pipes or wires, as was done with the main telephone wire 
system. It is difficult for challengers to emerge if they 
must construct their own pipe or wire network from 
scratch. In the early days of the build-up of competition 
it is better to allow them to use the existing pipes or wires, 
and to operate a regulated tariff, allowing fairness both 
to the ones who made the historic commitment to and 
investment in the network, and to the challengers who 
offer a better of different service.
<P>
There would be a lot of sense in a similar proposal for 
the water industry. I do not see how real competition will 
emerge unless we apply the principles learnt from 
experience in telecommunications, gas and electricity to 
the general pipe network of the water industry.
<P>
The industry has presented a couple of arguments 
against early adoption of the proposal. First, it believes 
that water quality or purity might be endangered if 
different operations could route different water from 
different sources down the same pipe network. Under my 
proposal it would, of course, remain an offence possibly 
criminal as well as civil if a person or company supplied 
water that harmed the recipients. It would also be unlikely 
that a business that tried to operate in that way would 
survive long, as it would be exposed very rapidly. There 
have unfortunately been a few such incidents involving 
the monopolies, and the system rightly dealt with those 
quickly.
<P>
Given that the water industry knows that such incidents 
must not happen, I cannot see how anyone would found 
a new water business without having solved the problem, 
by careful testing, before supplying water to a consumer 
who might drink it and find that it was not of the right 
quality. I am not convinced, therefore, by the argument. 
It is surely more difficult to guarantee that competing gas 
suppliers do not make a mess of the gas network, with 
explosive consequences, than to guarantee that competing 
water suppliers do not produce the wrong chemical 
balance in the pipe network.
<P>
The second reason for the industry's unhappiness with 
the proposal is the possibility of the Director General of 
Water Services acting as adjudicator to ensure fair access 
on acceptable terms. My colleagues and I are happy to 
suggest another adjudicator, but we believe that the 
Director General of Water Services is a suitable person 
because he has a detailed knowledge of cost structure and 
the problems of the industry. He is respected as a person 
of independent judgment, and is therefore, the right 
person to adjudicate. If Ministers like that approach, they 
could establish in more detail the terms for guaranteeing 
access. The subject could be debated properly in 
Parliament so that everyone could see that democratic 
duty had ben done and that any problems had been ironed 
out through normal legislative processes before the 
proposal was tried for real. It would also be possible to 
designate trial areas to implement the policy gradually. 
That was done when gas competition was introduced.



<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The advantages of water competition would be twofold. 
Competition almost always results in lower prices and 
better service. Lower prices would certainly be possible. 
Water privatisation is the most disappointing of all the 
privatisations. That is because the combination of British 
and European environmental standards and the price 
regime have ensured a high price that has increased in 
real terms. When proper competition was unleashed on 
telecommunications, it was a great success, and prices fell 
dramatically. That fall was not caused only by the 
introduction of different technology, but by opening up 
the telecommunications market to competitive challenge. 
That has not happened in the water market.
<P>
The previous Government took some steps in the right 
direction through inset agreements and allowing a 
relaxation of the monopoly for big consumers. I should 
have liked them to have gone further. It would be an 
excellent and popular policy for the Government to adopt. 
Far be it from me to worry about their popularity, but 
such a policy would help the water customer.



<P>
It is especially important to improve the quality of 
service. Water is the only product that you cannot buy 
when you most want it. If the hot cross bun industry 
adopted that policy, it would produce far fewer hot cross 
buns at Easter, and announce that it was not public 
spirited of everyone to go to the shops at Easter to buy 
them, but that people could purchase as many as they 
liked in August or September. The water industry says 
that we cannot water our plants in summer, so that if we 
ever have a rain-free period, we must watch them dry up, 
but that if we want to water them in a wet November, 
when they do not normally survive, we can use our 
hosepipes as often as we like.
<P>
I should like the water industry to have the confidence 
and courage to grow its business, encourage people to 
water more plants and, dare I say it, to wash more cars so 
that they do not look so tatty. Some people claim that 
environmental damage will result from that; I do not 
believe it. We collect little rain water in reservoirs, which 
could be routed to people. Water is never destroyed. After 
we have washed our cars, or done other unmentionable 
things with water, it returns to the system and can 
sometimes be extracted, cleaned up and reused.
<P>
There is an environmental advantage to using more 
water. There are several rising water tables under the big 
cities of this country. They sometime threaten cellars and 
foundations. I am told by those who know more than me 
about the subject that using bore holes to tap some of the 
rising water would be good for many reasons, and could 
free some of the water we need.
<P>
After the great efficiency revolution of the 1980s, the 
water industry is the only British industry that loses a fifth 
or a quarter of its product on the way to the market. 
Someone in the frozen chicken industry who lost a quarter 
of his frozen chickens on the way to market would soon 
be driven out of business.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I agree entirely, but on that basis, is anyone 
likely to want to use the pipes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Of course. The prices are such that the 
water industry makes money even when it loses water on 
the way to customer.



<P>
As the water industry improves and as the 
Government's policy on repairing pipes starts to bite it 
is sensible for the Government to ask the water industry 
to repair pipes it will be an even more attractive 
proposition to use those pipes because less water will be 
lost on its way to the customer.
<P>
We do not, therefore, need to build reservoirs all over 
the country to meet increased demand. There are two 
simple ways of addressing the problem mending pipes 
and tapping rising water tables which might otherwise 
lead to worrying developments. That will provide the 
opportunity for entrepreneurs to become involved. People 
are available to do the job and they need a change in 
the law. If the Government are serious about increasing 
competition they will not protect the industry 
unreasonably through the revenue producing monopoly 
clause but adopt a proposal such as mine, which might 
even gain the Government some popularity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Let me tell the Committee why
I am resisting the new clause, albeit with some reluctance 
because the right hon. Member for Wokingham made a 
contribution that brought smiles for the first time to 
Labour Members as well as to Opposition Members. I 
followed his chain of logic in some detail with similar 
amusement.
<P>
The new clause is not an appropriate vehicle for making 
the changes eloquently put forward by the right hon. 
Gentleman. Opportunities to legislate to make the changes 
in the past have not been taken, though that is no reason 
for failing to learn from past experience the Gas Act 
1995 is relevant here.
<P>
Our Green Paper, "A Fair Deal for Consumers", set out 
our commitment to the principle of competition in the 
utility industries. Specific reference to competition is also 
made in "Water Charging in England and Wales: A New 
Approach". The importance of water supply and the 
quality of water, which we all acknowledge, is being 
given careful scrutiny by my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and 
the Regions.
<P>
However, it would be wrong to accept the new clause 
in the current Bill when the issue of competition in that 
specific utility is best dealt with as it has been in other 
utility sectors by specific primary legislation. I urge the 
right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause, though 
I enjoyed hearing this presentation of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is the nicest reply I have received 
from the Under-Secretary throughout these proceedings. 
In that spirit, I am grateful for his generous words. He 
seems to agree that the problem needs further exploration. 
I shall quit while I am ahead and beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
(2) If the end of such period as may be specified in rules made 
under section 51, a person has failed, without reasonable excuse, to 
comply with a requirement imposed under sub-paragraph (1), the 
Director may give a direction.
<P>
(3) The Director may also give a direction if he considers 
<P>
(a) that the agreement would, but for the transitional period or 
a relevant exclusion, infringe the Chapter I prohibition; and
<P>
(b) that he would not be likely to grant the agreement an 
unconditional individual exemption.
<P>
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) an individual exemption

not be less than 28 days after the direction is given).
<P>
(2) Copies of the direction must be given to 
<P>
(a) each of the parties concerned, and
<P>
(b) the Secretary of State,
<P>
not less than 28 days before the date on which the direction is to 
have effect.
<P>
(3) In relation to an agreement to which a direction applies, the 
transitional period (if it has not already ended) ends on the date 
specified in the direction unless, before that date, the direction is 
revoked by the Director or the Secretary of State.
<P>
(4) If a direction is revoked, the Director may give a further 
direction in respect of the same agreement only if he is satisfied that 
there has been a material change of circumstance since the 
revocation.
<P>
(5) If, as a result of paragraph 24(1) or (3), there is a transitional 
period in respect of provisions of an agreement relating to goods 
<P>
(a) which immediately before the starting date are exempt 
under section 14 of the RPA, or
<P>
(b) which, when continuing proceedings are determined, are 
found to be exempt under section 14 of the RPA,
<P>
the period is not affected by paragraph 37 or 38.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Before we finish, it is incumbent 
on me, on behalf of the Committee, to thank you,
Mr. Atkinson, and your colleagues, Mr. Maxton and
Mrs. Roe, for the excellent chairmanship of the 
Committee.
<P>
Competition must be underpinned by an effective legal 
system. Existing competition law is in need of reform. So 
said the then Ian Lang, now Lord Lang, on 8 August 1996. 
We can take some pride in our proceedings in 
consideration of the Bill.
<P>
I should like to thank the Committee Clerk, Hansard, 
the police and officers of the House for making our task 
so much easier. Although I know it is not customary to 
refer to them, I am particularly grateful to the civil 
servants who advised me as a fairly new Minister.
<P>
Without Opposition there would be no democracy and 
so we are grateful for the contributions that Opposition 
Members have made. They have taken us from Quintus 
Fabius Maximus who died in 203 BC, to Judge Jeffries in 
the late 17th century, to fictional characters like Sherlock 
Holmes and then on to P.G. Wodehouse and, today,
H.E. Bates. We have been enlightened by that.
<P>
We have heard redefinitions of company law, which 
is what the Bill is about. We have even had the right 
hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster 
(Mr. Brooke) redefine early days motions as a form of 
constitutional graffiti. I am sure that we can draw that 
to the attention of Madam Speaker. We have been 
exhorted to break the law by an unaccustomed source 
who was accused of agitating by one of his hon. 
Friends. We have heard about aperients for parrots and 
have had a great chance to learn a lot. We have not 
been short of hyperbole. We have even had, to share 
the vogue for football metaphors, a change of team 
opposite. Two hon. Members left us and we were sorry 
to see them go. We welcomed their successors.
<P>
I should like to thank those organisations representing 
businesses and consumer interests who have made our 
deliberations better informed. On a more sober note, as a 
result of our deliberations I would certainly strongly 
support the possibility of conducting such proceedings 
more like Select Committee than Standing Committees so 
as to get more to the heart of the issue. Most of all,
I should like to thank my colleagues who have listened 
patiently, concealing their exasperation at some of the 
more spurious arguments advanced by the Opposition.

<P>
I thank the Minister of State, Department of Trade and 
Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield
(Mr. McCartney) who is unwell today. We wish him a 
speedy recovery. I wish the Bill a swift passage on the 
Floor of the House and I look forward to locking horns 
again there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> On behalf of the Opposition, I, too,
Mr. Atkinson, would like to thank you, Mr. Maxton and 
Mrs. Roe for your excellent chairmanship of these 
proceedings. I thank the officials of the Committee, the 
police, the officers and the Hansard reporters for their 
diligence. They made it all run extremely smoothly and 
we are grateful to them.
<P>
I am delighted that the Under Secretary said that 
opposition is crucial to a democracy, so I pay special 
tribute to my right hon. and hon. Friends who have 
brought serious opposition to the Committee. I trust that 
the Bill will be better as a result. I hope that the 
Government understand that our opposition to the Bill has 
been in the spirit of saying that we want a decent 
competition regime. We want one with teeth against real 
abuses. We also wish to reassure many decent businesses 
out there that the Bill, if enacted, will not threaten them 
unreasonably and will give them reasonable security about 
their existing practices.
<P>
We have benefited greatly from the contributions of my 
hon. Friend the Member for Daventry who has produced 
some important arguments on many of the crucial aspects 
of the Bill. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for 
Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) whose quiet 
efficiency ensured that the Opposition kept up the 
pressure on every clause and every amendment with
the right people in attendance. I thank my hon. Friend the 
Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) who has always 
been perspicacious and clear sighted in his criticisms. He 
has certainly been quite sharp at times. That is an asset in 
elucidating these matters properly.



<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire 
has written a rather better Bill than the one before us. We 
trust that that was not in vain and that some of it might 
re-emerge. Last, but not least, I thank my right hon. Friend 
the Member for Cities of London and Westminster, who 
lightened proceedings but always with a serious purpose 
in mind. We are all indebted to him for some good jokes 
and phrases which even the Under-Secretary was kind 
enough to remember in his concluding remarks.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I, too, wish to thank Labour Members, whose silence 
gave us even more scope for developing our arguments. 
Those who did speak from time to time were helpful in 
resolving some of the problems that faced us. I thank the 
Government, who have put in much hard work on these 
matters. Like the Under-Secretary, I should like to break 
with convention and express my gratitude to officials in 
his Department for the enormous amount of work done in 
response to the many serious points that we raised. We 
are most grateful to them.
<P>
We shall return on Report. The Government are aware 
that we still think that large parts of the Bill need 
substantial improvement to reassure the business 
community and to ensure that the Bill has teeth in areas 
where it needs them. I, too, look forward to proceedings 
on Report while agreeing that on the whole the Committee 
stage has been a job well done.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On behalf of my fellow Chairmen
I thank all members of the Committee for their 
co-operation in allowing us to deal with complex 
legislative proposals in a relatively efficient and civilised 
manner and within order most of the time.
