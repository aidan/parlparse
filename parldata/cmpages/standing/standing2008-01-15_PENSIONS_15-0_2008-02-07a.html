amendment No. 158, in clause 68, page 32, line 4, at end
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) In section 1
(meaning of &#147;stakeholder pension scheme&#148;), omit
subsections (7) and
(8).&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08020770000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me welcome you back to the Chair, Sir Nicholas. We also welcome my hon.
Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East to the Committee. I
would like to put on record all Members&#146; sympathy for the
Minister for Pensions Reform, who is not with us due to a family
bereavement.</div>
					<a name="08020770000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 68
brings in necessary reforms to stakeholder pension schemes, principally
to remove the statutory duty on employers to have a designated
stakeholder pension scheme in the light of the introduction of personal
accounts though the Bill. We support what clause 68 seeks to do because
the pensions landscape will have moved on and stakeholder pension
schemes will not be necessary in the way that they once were.</div>
					<a name="08020770000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Genuine and
understandable concerns have been expressed, however, about what will
happen to existing stakeholder schemes, particularly in 2017. In the
early evidence sessions of the Committee, Tim Jones and the Minister
for Pensions Reform both said they were keen to look at whether the
personal accounts trustee corporation would be able to allow transfers
out of personal accounts, probably in around 2017. We understand the
reason for that. One very good reason is that there could be
hundreds of thousands of very small personal account pots, perhaps
belonging to foreign workers who have been in this country for a matter
of months and have returned to their home country and are never going
to come back. The personal accounts trustee corporation will be forced
to maintain those small accounts for all time if there is not the
option to transfer out.</div>
					<a name="08020770000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern is that these
transfers-out may end up being pushed on to the existing stakeholder
pension schemes because current legislation, which is
not being rescinded, prevents the winding down of these stakeholder
pension schemes, even if the stakeholder provider might not want to
keep them going. Clause 68 would force stakeholder pension schemes to
accept transfers-in of possibly large numbers of very small amounts.
There is concern that this may lead to an increase in the charges
stakeholder pension
schemes.</div>
					<a name="08020770000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such charges
were initially brought in and capped at 1.5 per cent. for an initial
10-year period. I am sure the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>Minister will tell us this when he responds, but my understanding is
that 2017, when we are looking at the potential for
transferring out, will be beyond that 10-year period in most cases.
Therefore, the stakeholder schemes will have the option&#151;and
indeed they might be forced&#151;to increase charges to cope with the
administration of perhaps a very large number of small pension accounts
being forcibly transferred
in.</div>
					<a name="08020770000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">This could have
serious consequences for the existing members of those stakeholder
pension schemes, who might find their returns to be
less than expected because of higher levels of charges being imposed on
them because of these transfers-in, which clause 68 currently
allows.</div>
					<a name="08020770000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08020770000136"></a>
							<b class="B">Miss
Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): My hon. Friend is
clearly very knowledgeable about these matters. Will he help the
Committee by explaining what he thinks is the rationale behind
requiring this move out of personal accounts and into stakeholders? Why
stakeholders; why not some other vehicle? What is the rationale for
doing it this way, because I completely take on board his concerns
about the downside of this particular
move?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000137"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that
intervention. My understanding is that personal account holders will
not be forced to transfer into stakeholder schemes specifically, but
the point is rather that these stakeholder schemes will be unable to
refuse to accept these many small pension pots. Account holders can
choose to take their personal accounts elsewhere, so they will have
that choice.</div>
					<a name="08020770000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I am
arguing for, in amendment No. 158, is giving stakeholder schemes the
freedom to operate that any other pension provider would ordinarily
have. Clause 68 really seems to be dumping obligations on stakeholder
providers quite unfairly, and in a way that could be prejudicial to the
existing members of those stakeholder schemes.</div>
					<a name="08020770000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 158 would remove
the obligation on stakeholder providers to accept transfer values and
give them the discretionary freedom to determine
whether or not it would be viable to accept certain low-value funds.
They might very well decide that they are quite happy to accept these
personal account transfers&#151;they could be very keen to receive
them&#151;but, given that stakeholder pensions were legislated for
and brought into being by this Government, we are concerned that the
providers of these schemes should be treated fairly going forward. I
know that we are talking about events that are some way off, but it is
important to raise this issue now, and I look forward to hearing what
the Minister will say about these
issues.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000138"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> Good morning to you, Sir
Nicholas. It is a pleasure to be serving under your chairmanship again.
May I express my thanks to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
and my sympathy for the Minister for Pensions Reform, who is obviously
unable to be with us today for sad reasons? May I also welcome the hon.
Member for Rochford and Southend, East? It is nice to know that our
Committee&#146;s deliberations are attracting new members because of
the reputation that our proceedings are earning.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>
					<a name="08020770000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to the amendment that
the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has moved. I understand why
he is raising the issue, but I think that there is a danger that he is
over-anticipating&#151;and potentially inflating&#151;the problem
that he sees. I will explain why a moment. I fear also that, by seeking
to head off the problem that he anticipates, he is possibly
inadvertently suggesting something that would be harmful to the
existing rules for stakeholder pensions. By potentially inflating the
scale of the problem, he could be causing a problem somewhere else. Let
me go into that in more detail and try to explain why I have
that view and why I hope that he will not press the amendment to a
Division.</div>
					<a name="08020770000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment would remove two important
conditions that define a stakeholder scheme: flexibility and
portability. It would mean that stakeholder pension scheme members
would no longer be able to pay money into their pension when it suited
them, subject to the &#163;20 minimum contribution limit provided for
in existing regulations. That possibility is important because it
enables people who have irregular or intermittent employment patterns
to save when they are able to do so. The amendment would also remove
people&#146;s entitlement to transfer other pension rights into their
stakeholder scheme, thus consolidating small pension savings that they
might have
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="08020770000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the
flexibility to make payments and the ability to transfer pension funds
would instead fall to the discretion of the pension provider, who could
therefore make substantial changes to the current position. That would
affect all those people who had bought the products on the
understanding that their stakeholder pensions would continue to provide
a flexible and portable pension vehicle. That would be a significant
number of people, given that 3.9 million stakeholder contracts have
been taken out since April 2001 and there are just under 2 million
active members. The potential knock-on effect to
existing holders of stakeholder pensions would therefore not be
insignificant.</div>
					<a name="08020770000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000139"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> The case that I was making was slightly different
to the one that the Minister is rebutting. I am purely arguing for
stakeholder providers to have some flexibility. We know that by law
they cannot close the schemes down; I am not seeking to change that.
For anyone who wants to stay in a stakeholder and pay money into it,
that will be absolutely secure. I am just saying that the providers of
the stakeholder schemes, who have done a useful, necessary job and have
obligations going forward, should not be forced to accept business that
might be uneconomical, and which might have a much better home
somewhere
else.</div>
					<a name="08020770000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000140"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> But the problem is that the hon. Gentleman would
do that by removing some of the current conditions of the stakeholder
scheme, which could have other consequences. That is why I urge him not
to press the amendment to a Division. I also urge that he does not do
so for a second reason. In 2017, we will undertake a review of the
prohibition on transfers into and out of the personal accounts pension
scheme. It is obviously not possible at this stage to anticipate what
will come out of that review, but I think that he understands the
reasons why it is there.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>
					<a name="08020770000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the concerns that have been raised about the possible knock-on effect
on stakeholder pensions should that review recommend lifting the ban on
transfers out of personal accounts. Clearly any recommendations that
come out of the 2017 review will be carefully considered by the
Government at the time, including any potential consequences for other
forms of pension
provision.</div>
					<a name="08020770000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will expand on the problems that the hon. Gentleman cited. There is the
question of whether everyone with small pots will want to make
transfers. A lot of people might conclude that they are happy to leave
them where they are because they might come back to them to make
further contributions in the future. They will therefore not see the
necessity of relocating those pots. They might also have other vehicles
that are not necessarily stakeholder schemes to which they can relocate
the pots. They would be able to consider or make a transfer into a
stakeholder pension only if they already had a stakeholder
pension.</div>
					<a name="08020770000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
possibilities are widened, the scale of the potential problems that the
hon. Gentleman anticipates are reduced. It makes more sense to wait
until the 2017 review, when the scale and nature of the issue will be
more apparent. That review will take into account, in considering
whether to lift the option on transfers out, the potential impact on
other funds to which those pots might be
transferred.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000141"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> Perhaps if I had let the Minister carry on, he
would have answered the point that I was going to make. Can he reassure
the Committee that, following the 2017 review, if there were serious
negative consequences for existing stakeholder schemes&#151;we all
want them to be successful&#151;they would be dealt with by
regulation or some other means to ensure that whatever was proposed was
not too injurious to the
stakeholders?</div>
					<a name="08020770000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000142"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means, but
the issue will clearly have to be considered. If there were a serious
consideration in 2017 that the restriction on
transfers out would be removed, questions would have to be asked about
the consequences, not just on the stakeholder schemes, but across the
whole pension provision market. It will not be possible to begin to
make any sort of judgment about either the scale or the nature of that
until we have got to 2017 and those funds have been in place for five
years.</div>
					<a name="08020770000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000143"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:
						</b> Is the Minister saying that those people could
be in the stakeholder scheme already, but that they will be in a
company that then takes out a personal account and therefore that they
will have two schemes that they might want to consolidate into one? I
am trying to work this out. Are existing stakeholders involved, or
people who do not have a stakeholder pension and want to buy one,
because they want to transfer it to a personal account? I am just a bit
confused about who those people
are.</div>
					<a name="08020770000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000144"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> It is not quite as complicated as the hon. Lady
thinks. First, we have to remember the criteria about qualifying
schemes. It may well be the case that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>perhaps all the existing stakeholder schemes will
qualify under the Bill as qualifying schemes. There is sometimes
misapprehension about whether auto-enrolment applies only to the new
brand of personal schemes that the trustee board will bring into
existence. A range of schemes could qualify. So I do not think that
people will be forced into a couple of schemes, which is what the hon.
Lady was suggesting. I hope that she is reassured by
that.</div>
					<a name="08020770000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am arguing
that it is not desirable to promote the changes that the amendment
seeks, because they have other consequences that we do not want. I also
think the amendment is driven by over-concern about the scale of the
challenge that might be presented. This is all very conditional on what
happens in 2017. Mindful of these real issues, the sensible thing to do
is to wait for the 2017 review and see what decisions are made at that
point in respect of whether the opt-out and the restriction on taking
funds out of such schemes are lifted. With those reassurances,
I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08020770000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000145"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I note what the Minister has said about other
possible consequences of amendment No. 158. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Eastbourne said&#151;and as he often says to the
Committee&#151;we do not have all the clever people that the Minister
has working behind the scenes, so he may well be right that there are
perhaps other consequences. In the light of that and the commitment
that he has given to the Committee to consider what he described as the
real issues that relate to stakeholders in 2017, and the fact that he
said that he would be mindful of those issues in any proposed solution,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

clause 68, page 32, line 24, leave

less than one
year&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08020770000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
a probing amendment: I want to find out exactly what is meant by the
phrase &#147;regular intervals&#148;, which is used twice in
subsection (4). It just struck me that it might be possible for
unscrupulous employers to try to keep their employees in a stakeholder
scheme by saying: &#147;Don&#146;t worry, contributions are being
made at regular intervals&#148;, when that interval is every decade
or every fifteen years. A regular interval might not be often, but it
could be as regular as every week, every month or every year. It is
probably unlikely that anyone would seek to do that, but there are
employers of all different types and characteristics and
&#147;regular&#148; is a vague word, so I would like a decision to
be taken on it and look forward to what the Minister has to
say.</div>

Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): It is a pleasure to be here in Committee again today; I
apologise for being slightly late. I would like to pass on my good
wishes to the Minister for Pensions Reform and welcome the hon. Member
for Rochford and Southend, East to the Committee. He has been here for
only a short period, but I am none the less grateful that the
Committee&#146;s deliberations are attracting new interest even as we
reach the latter stages of the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>
					<a name="08020770000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
very simple probing amendment, but it makes an important point, because
the phrase &#147;regular intervals&#148; is obviously open to
interpretation. It is clearly right to ask the Minister to clarify the
position to ensure that employees cannot reschedule payments to very
long intervals to avoid the obligation to make auto-enrolled
contributions or for employers to ask them to do so. The one-year
interval suggested in the amendment seems a sensible limit&#151;it
would certainly be hard to describe making a contribution less than
once a year as regular&#151;so I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s clarification.</div>
					<a name="08020770000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000148"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful to hon. Gentlemen for speaking to
the amendment, because it gives me the opportunity to provide the
clarification that they seek, and it is important that I do so. But
there is a very good reason why that word is used, and I will try to
explain it. Clause 68 will amend section 3 of the
Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 to end the current stakeholder
pension employer designation requirements when the new personal account
provisions take effect. All the existing employer designation
requirements will cease, except one transitional provision that relates
to the payroll deduction
facility.</div>
					<a name="08020770000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employees
have bought their stakeholder pensions on the understanding that they
can benefit from that payroll deduction facility. Employees who are
paying into their stakeholder pensions via the their employers&#146;
payroll when these reforms take place will continue to be able to
benefit from that arrangement. It is right that they should continue to
be able to make such payments for as long as they are employed by their
employers or until they stop making contributions via the
payroll.</div>
					<a name="08020770000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would change the criterion that sets out when an employee is no longer
able to benefit from the transitional provision. Instead of the
provision ending when the employee stopped making regular
contributions, it would happen when the employee stopped making
contributions at intervals of less than one year. The explanatory note

						</b> I see the point that the hon. Gentleman is
making, but I am quoting his explanatory note, which states:</div>
					<a name="08020770000111"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to prevent employers from
rescheduling payments to very long intervals to avoid the requirement
to make auto enrolled personal account contributions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020770000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just for clarity, he is talking about the
potential for an unscrupulous employer to go for very long payment
intervals. I entirely understand; I have not
misunderstood
him.</div>
					<a name="08020770000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should be
no easy way out for employers who do not wish to fulfil their duties
under this legislation, and I want to make clear that stakeholder
pensions are not one of those routes. An employer who
wishes to continue to run a stakeholder scheme must ensure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>it is a qualifying scheme that meets the policy
requirements set out in the Bill, which may require an increase in
their contributions to the scheme. If the scheme does not qualify, the
employer must provide an alternative arrangement that does and enrol
the eligible job holder into that scheme.</div>
					<a name="08020770000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a job
holder does not wish to participate in pension savings, they do not
have to. That is as true for personal accounts as it is for
stakeholders. Once enrolled, the job holder can opt out of the scheme
and will receive a refund if any payroll deductions have been made
during the opted-out period. So the only way that a job holder could
avoid being automatically enrolled is if they were already a member of
a qualifying scheme. If the job holder were a member of a stakeholder
scheme that met the quality requirements, he or she would not
be automatically enrolled. If the job holder then wanted to reschedule
their payments, their employer might permit that as long as the total
employer and job holder contributions made were equivalent to 8 per
cent. of the job holder&#146;s qualifying earnings over the pay
reference
period.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000151"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I understand what the Minister is
saying. The 3 per cent. figure applies whatever the
period of time, so if an employer has to pay their 3 per cent. for a
whole year at once, that is the same as paying 12 monthly payments
throughout the year. However, what he says raises a further concern in
that another option could be open to unscrupulous employers, of whom we
know there are very few, but there is a risk none the less. If an
employee opts out of being automatically enrolled, they might have a
stakeholder scheme into which the employer, if he chooses, could make a
lesser contribution on a voluntary
basis.</div>
					<a name="08020770000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000152"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The test still applies in respect of any
scheme&#151;it must meet the qualifying criteria
for auto-enrolment&#151;so I am not sure that that problem
exists. I want to reassure the hon. Gentleman about the
unscrupulous employer. The interaction between the 8 per cent. total
requirement and the pay reference period will prevent anyone from going
through the loophole that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
had in mind when moving the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08020770000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
short, rescheduling payments in stakeholder schemes could not help a
job holder to avoid being automatically enrolled or help employers
evade their duties. The provisions in the Bill mean that employers will
ensure eligible job holders are in a qualifying scheme receiving
minimum contributions and that job holders remain in that scheme paying
contributions unless they decide to opt out. So there is a
belt-and-braces provision within the legislation, but I appreciate his
raising the issue, because it gives me a chance to clarify that and to
reassure him sufficiently, I hope, to enable him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Selous:
						</b> Clause 69 is a veritable dictionary of definitions
of different terms, which is very helpful. Words need to have precise
meanings that we all understand when we are passing legislation, so it
is certainly a helpful clause from that point of view. This is purely a
probing amendment; note the word &#147;probe&#148; rather than
&#147;prove&#148;, which may have been there originally, that
comment is just to help the Minister in case he is working from an old
brief. It is just to tease out exactly what an oral contract of
employment might be, particularly one that is implied. In my naivety, I
had thought that all contracts of employment would be in writing,
express and quite clear, but that is clearly not the case; I have
obviously led a more sheltered life than I had realised. It seems to
conjure up all sorts of possibilities, so can the Minister paint in
some of the detail on what types of contract of employment we are
talking about being expressed or implied, particularly
oral?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000157"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> The amendment raises an important point. I
appreciate the hon. Gentleman making the point that this is a probing
amendment and it will be interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s
response. The reference to oral contracts in the Bill is important to
retain. Particularly among the target group, who are working for low
incomes perhaps in several different jobs who we have rightly worked on
at various stages of the Bill, there are circumstances where some will
be left out of the scheme because their are earnings are below the
qualifying limit, which is a point that I made earlier in the Bill.
They may not have what hon. Members on the Committee would regard as a
written contract, which we would have with our staff&#151;well, many
Members would&#151;or whatever, none the less, an oral contract would
be regarded as a contract of employment. Certainly in Scots law there
is strong protection for oral contracts and I know that that is what
the Bill seeks to do. There are precedents for written contracts being
required; the Employment Rights Act 1996 requires that the case of
money being deducted from a salary must be in written contract. I can
see the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point in relation to central costs, but
none the less it is important from the point of view of giving the
maximum possibility for people in the target group to benefit from
personal accounts that the provision that the amendment seeks in a
probing nature to delete is retained in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08020770000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000158"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I was interested to hear the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire declare how possibly sheltered his life had
been. It is a fact of the matter, as the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey pointed out, that there are a great many
oral contracts in existence, certainly non-written formal employment
contracts. As Members of Parliament we do not have formal written
contracts, which is a point that we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>come to later in the Bill and I am sure that we are
all looking forward to that. As the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire says, clause 69 provides an array of definitions. I will
take the opportunity now to respond to his specific points about oral
contracts, while fully appreciating that the amendment is of a probing
nature. A contract exists when it is written down or when an individual
is told by someone offering work to start work on a given date for a
set rate of pay, which in itself constitutes an oral contract. In an
ideal world, of course, a contract would be written so that both
parties were fully aware of the terms and conditions of employment, and
the majority are.</div>
					<a name="08020770000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we know that there are
people without written contracts and we do not want to exclude them
from the reforms. I know the hon. Gentleman does not want to do that
either. The fact that someone may not have a piece of paper does not
mean that he or she is not entitled to employment rights, and those
extend beyond pension issues into other employment issues. The
amendments would simply enable employers to avoid the duties
established in the Bill by using an oral contract in place of a written
contract. Obviously, that would not be right, because these reforms are
about extending workplace pension saving with a
minimum employer contribution to as many individuals as possible. The
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is right to
say that there are likely to be many in the target group with oral
contracts.</div>

Selous:
						</b> It genuinely is a probing amendment, and that
clarification is useful. I was interested in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s definition of an oral contract as one
where somebody was told to do some work at a
particular point. Could the employer get out of having a contract by
saying, &#147;I would like my house cleaned, but I will leave the
time up to you, as long as it gets done,&#148; without giving a
particular start date? Would that avoid an oral contract, by the
Minister&#146;s
definition?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020770000160"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am no expert on oral contracts, but I suspect
not. As I understand it, once an engagement has taken place between
employer and employee, a function has started, and payments are being
made in respect of that activity, an oral contract
has commenced. If that is incorrect, I will let the hon. Gentleman
know, but that is my understanding at this
point.</div>

people in my constituency who work in the tourism

interviews for the job, agrees to start the job on Monday, working four
days a week at x rate of pay, and does so. Custom and practice means
that what one has is therefore a contract of employment. Although it is
not written down, that is a legally binding arrangement, to which all
employment laws should

not in Crown employment, and that of bonuses to Crown employees, in
which form considerable sums are paid from time to time, which we know

it. I looked through the impact assessment quite

Exchequer as far as Crown employees are concerned. I appreciate that it
is a few years off. I am not looking for detailed figures down to the
last pounds and pence, but it would be useful to know that some of the
clever people in the Treasury or elsewhere, to whom my hon. Friend the

Gentleman. He may wish to intervene on me again. There are two issues
he may be getting at, and while I listened carefully to what he said,
it was not quite clear which of those two issues it was. One would be
the potential implication if he sees the clause resulting somehow in
additional auto-enrolment into schemes. I am not sure if he does mean
that, because all of the existing public sector schemes will satisfy
the qualifying criteria, or whether he means the cost to the exchequer
of revisions to public sector pension as a result of the reforms that
have taken place. If he wants to intervene I might be able to be more
assistance to him.</div>

						</b> It was kind of the Minister to seek further
clarification. He has in part answered my query. If he has just said
that all Crown employees are already fully covered, I
think that does go some way to answering my question. There is the
question of bonuses. One reads quite regularly of high flying members
of the public service being given large bonuses. The Child Support
Agency senior staff were given bonuses quite recently, just to quote
one
example.</div>
					<a name="08020770000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
an earlier provision we put into law that bonuses commissions will be
part of the contribution that makes up personal accounts. It may be
that this is already covered because public sector pensions for Crown
employees are so wonderful anyway that it does not apply. I thought it
would be remiss to go through clause 71 without at least probing the
Minister and asking for some clarification.</div>

Plaskitt:
						</b> I am a little clearer as to the direction he is
seeking to take. I think he will be aware that there is a great deal of
public sector pension reform taking place. He will know that there are
new schemes for teachers that have been in operation since January of
last year, and a new scheme for civil servants, which he referred to,
which was introduced in July of last year. From April this year a new
scheme for the NHS comes into effect and in due course there will be a
new scheme for local government workers as well. He
will know that the thrust of all these reforms is to ensure
affordability to the public purse of all of these schemes. He will have
seen the long-term public finance report that the Government published
in December 2006, which confirms that expenditure on public service
pension provision across the board remains sustainable over the next
50-year period. That includes and anticipates the impact of bonus
payments, for example.</div>
					<a name="08020770000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s

have looked at the terms of all of the existing ones in which most
people are enrolled and they satisfy the criteria. Now he has come back

that the implied employer contribution for High Court judges is 31 per

levelling-down already. As the hon. Member knows, there are clear
criteria that the Government seeks to apply to the public sector
pension provision, one of which, most importantly, is
affordability.</div>

changes that are to be made to employer or employee contributions
within the schemes will be made in the light of those criteria. For
example, the cost-sharing and capping arrangements that have been
introduced may in future have an effect on the employer or employee
contributions. The governing criteria are the long-term sustainability
of the schemes and the fact that they give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>decent value to the taxpayer. The effect of the proposal will not be a
significant driver of any of those changes, although such changes may
take place, but I think it will be for other

Alexander:
						</b> The Minister is right to make the point about
affordability. Presumably, he is unworried by the recent conclusion of
an independent body&#151;the Institute for Fiscal Studies&#151;that
unfunded liabilities in the public sector pension arrangements at
present amount to about &#163;700
billion.</div>

Plaskitt:
						</b> As I suspect the hon. Gentleman knows, that
assessment depends on the basis on which it is calculated&#151;a
variety of numbers can be used. Indeed, I have seen some figures that
suggest that the unfunded liability is even larger than the figure he
cited. He must carefully consider the assumptions that have been made
in calculating the figures, from which he will see that the higher
numbers, including the figure he gave, are not assessed simply on the
basis of pension payable to known individuals who will receive
them.</div>
					<a name="08020770000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The larger
figures take into account all those who are currently in employment who
are potentially building pension pots and assume that they will always
be in employment and in the public sector, therefore all their pot will
be in the public sector. But one cannot make such an assumption,
because employees may not stay in the public sector. The kind of
assessment to which the hon. Gentleman refers on future unfunded
liability could have been made at any stage at any time in the past in
respect of public sector pension liability. It would always have
produced a large number if it had been calculated on the criteria that
he cited and always have looked scary but we have never hit a point
when it has become unfundable, unsustainable or overly
burdensome.</div>
					<a name="08020770000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I caution the
hon. Gentleman on waving the big numbers around. He should first check
on the assumptions that lie behind them and bear in mind that
historically it has always been possible to carry out such an exercise.
It does not mean as much as some of those who wave the numbers around
imply. The key test is whether the schemes are sustainable over the
long-term period of 50 years or so. The hon. Gentleman has the
Government&#146;s published information on that, and it has actuarial
support behind it. I hope he will therefore support clause stand

Selous:
						</b> Amendment No. 184 also relates to clause 73, so I
hope you will not rule me out of order, Sir Nicholas, if I touch on the
provisions of that clause. For the record, the
explanatory note should say &#147;probe&#148; rather than
&#147;prove&#148;. I entirely blame my handwriting for that
mistake. The fault is all mine, not the excellent staff who assist
Opposition Members in tabling amendments.</div>
					<a name="08020770000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer to both clauses; I
understand the distinction between people who work for the House
authorities&#151;some are in this room&#151;and staff who are
employed by Members of Parliament, but I want to know the position of
Members&#146; staff. We are all small employers in our own right as
Members of Parliament. There are some good aspects to that, in that we
are not isolated from some of the matters that hundreds of thousands of
small employers have to deal with up and down the country.</div>
					<a name="08020770000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not arguing that we should
be isolated from that or financially insulated from the provisions of
this Bill. I am interested to know what the effect would be on staff
employed by Members of the House of Lords and Members
of the House of Commons. My amendment by implication does come to
finance as well. If we are going to have take it on the chin, it will
have financial implications for salary levels. I am not sure whether
the Treasury would be minded to increase the grant to the House of
Commons Commission so that the employer contribution could be
paid.</div>
					<a name="08020770000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
expecting the Minister to have a full answer at his fingertips but it
would be useful if he could say
something.</div>

Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I appreciate that these are probing amendments but they
are probing at a point that all Members of the Committee and those who
work for us would regard as interesting and significant so I am
grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire for introducing
the argument.</div>
					<a name="08020770000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Members
know, staff of MPs as opposed to staff of the House have the
opportunity to take part in the Portcullis pension plan. I assume,
though I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification,
that the auto-enrolment provisions in the Bill would apply equally to
that scheme, or relevant improvements would be made to ensure that it
qualified. It is important to ensure that the benefits of automatic
enrolment do apply to the two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>groups of people highlighted by these amendments. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s agreement with that
point.</div>

							<a name="08020770000178"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> The House of Lords and
the House of Commons employ permanent fixed-term
casual and freelance workers who are all employed under a
worker&#146;s contract. Clause 72 confirms that those people who work
under a contract for the corporate officer of the House of Lords are
workers for the purposes of these reforms. Similarly, clause 73
confirms that those people who are appointed by the House of Commons
Commission or members of the Speaker&#146;s personal staff are
workers for the purposes of these reforms.</div>
					<a name="08020770000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The corporate
office of the House of Lords and the House of Commons Commission
respectively are bound by the employer duty automatically to enrol
these job-holders into a qualifying workplace pension scheme. We must
not confuse these workers with those who are directly employed by peers
of Members of Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08020770000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point
is that the provisions of this Bill already cover those people already
employed by peers and Members of Parliament. Anyone directly employed
by a peer or Member of Parliament that has job-holder
status&#151;that is, a worker between the age of 16 and 75 with
qualifying earnings&#151;would be entitled to participate in
workplace pension saving with the minimum contribution from their
employer.</div>
					<a name="08020770000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">A peer or
Member of Parliament with such a job-holder would need to engage with a
suitable scheme into which to enrol job-holders. A peer or Member of
Parliament who employs a job-holder between the narrower band of age 22
to state pension age would have automatically to enrol that
job-holder.</div>
					<a name="08020770000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that provides clarification and that the hon. Member will feel able to
withdraw his
amendment.</div>
