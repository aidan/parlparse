was just remarking, before this sitting began, on the fact that 9
o’clock in the House always seems much earlier than it actually
is. I do not understand why, when most of us regard it as the normal
time to be working and are used to it. It is good to see you in the
Chair, Mr Streeter, You are our fourth Chair in as many
sittings. I do not know what that says about the Committee’s
deliberations, but we are pleased that you are with us this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000019">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will not detain the Committee long. I am just interested in the
Minister’s comments on amendment 115. Police staff are currently
employed by police authorities, but for day-to-day management are
placed under the direction and control of chief constables. That means
that dismissals of police staff take place by authority of the chief
constable. However, the employer status of police authorities has meant
that police staff subject to dismissal have retained a right of appeal
to the authority. Under the Bill, that is set to change, because not
only does it abolish police authorities, but it makes the chief
constable the lawful employer of police staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to preserve the right of appeal against dismissal to an
independent arbiter. People have that right of appeal in most
circumstances and, with the abolition of police authorities, the police
and crime commissioner should be the new arbiter. However, it is not
clear from the way in which the Bill is worded whether that will be the
case. Will the right hon. Gentleman clarify the
position?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000021">&#160;</a>

                           </strong>
Good morning, Mr Streeter. I, too, welcome you as our fourth Chair. We
have had nearly as many Chairs as we have had shadow Home Secretaries
over the past few months. The turnover is highly
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
can reassure the hon. Gentleman. The Government have made it clear that
there needs to be separation between the chief officer and the police
and crime commissioner, and that there should be clearly defined roles
for each. In fact, it is common throughout that that is desirable.
Chief officers must have control over their own force, but then be held
strictly to account for their decisions by the police and crime
commissioner. If we allowed a route of appeal, it would undermine the
separation because the whole point of the proposal is that the chief
constable must have control and direction of the force and be
responsible for those who work for her or
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
staff will be protected from unfair dismissal under the normal
employment law protections as they are in all other employment
scenarios. Police and crime commissioners will hold the chief officer
to account for all functions, and will have a duty to keep abreast of
complaints or misconduct issues in the force. They will always be in a
position to hold the chief to account for abuse of power. We do not
want to define the concept of operational independence under the Bill.
We have discussed that before, and no doubt will do so
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would have the effect of taking away the chief
officer’s independence, as the corporation sole and employer of
staff. That would be wrong. If we are to trust the chief officer to
direct and control a public service, we should be able to extend that
trust to their ability to be a responsible employer according to the
law, which is a function that is performed by large numbers of senior
office holders throughout the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand why the hon. Member for Gedling raised the issue, but there
is no need for concern. The provision takes the logical step of
separating the roles of chief constable and the police and crime
commissioner, and on that basis I hope that he will be reassured and
feel able to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000026">&#160;</a>

because it gives effect to many of the things under clause 1. As I said
on Tuesday, we oppose police and crime commissioners in principle and
we have proposed an alternative. In so doing, it was interesting to
note that the Minister lost his cool—not in terms of getting
angry—but became dead excited about cost. He then went on a bit
of a ramble about things, which miraculously appeared in Twitterland. I
have no idea how that happened.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000030">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Schedule 1
gives significant powers to the police and crime commissioners, which
we have discussed. The chief constables and the witnesses asked for
clarity in respect of what such powers mean. The Minister will correct
me if I am wrong, but his response was that we do not need clarity in
the Bill because the transparency at local level will mean that no one
will do anything extraordinary and incur exorbitant costs or allowances
as everything will be published. A league table of police and crime
commissioners will set out who are the cheapest and who are the most
expensive. If they claim exorbitant sums for four years and have had
extravagant costs, the local electorate will throw them out. That seems
to be the Minister’s argument for not having greater clarity in
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
schedule 1, the police and crime commissioner is to be paid a salary.
No doubt, the Secretary of State determines that salary but, having set
the hare running at £120,000, the Government are now beating a
hasty retreat and referring to the Senior Salaries Review Body for
advice on what the position should be. Different salaries can be paid
to different commissioners in different areas. I have no idea what that
means. I suppose the idea is that commissioners covering a big area
receive more money. Will the salaries be worked out by population or
size of area, or on whether the force is urban or rural? It would be
helpful for the Committee if the Minister explained the proposal. Will
salaries be decided according to the urban or rural nature of the area
represented, or according to its size? We would all be interested to
know whether the police and crime commissioner in Greater Manchester
would receive more than a police and crime commissioner in Derbyshire,
Staffordshire or Cambridgeshire—I picked those counties at
random.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000032">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
PCCs can also be paid authorised allowances. Will the Minister make
matters clear? If police and crime commissioners are to be paid
different amounts, does that mean the authorised allowances will vary
in different areas? I assume that they will be paid different amounts,
because some are expected not to have the same level of responsibility
as others. Will the Minister
explain—<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000033">&#160;</a>

police and crime commissioner earning £60,000, I will be paid
lower allowances, probably because my area is regarded as less busy
than the area of someone earning £120,000, otherwise there is no
logic to it. How can a league table include the commissioner earning
£60,000, with lower allowances because he has a smaller area,
and the one on £120,000, with higher allowances? Will we have
two league tables for big and small forces—league 1 and league

                           </strong> Of course, but my point is that salaries are not
put in those league tables; the results are put in them. People have
criticised league tables because they do not compare like with like,
because the results are entered in raw form. The Minister says that
allowances, salaries and costs will be put in a league table, but not
the performance of a commissioner, a matter which might make a
difference on the effectiveness of reducing crime. A perfectly good
argument might be made, and many criteria are used, including for the
ranking of police forces into good, bad, improving and so on. The
Minister, however, has talked about league tables for costs and
allowances. People will be paid different amounts, but if they are paid
different salaries, and therefore allowances, how will that be put in a
league table to compare like with
like?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000039">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is exactly the point that I was going to
make. All the authorised payments for the police and crime commissioner
are set out in schedule 1, under which the commissioner may also
appoint a chief executive and a chief finance officer, and set their
salaries, and paragraph 6(2)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
be fair to the Minister, some people say that chapter 3, on the
functions of the police and crime commissioners, is over-prescriptive,
because it has lots of “must”s. He is in favour of
localism, but that chapter says many times “must do this”
and “must do that”, and “must have this”
and “must have that.” A huge number of functions, which
are not at the discretion of the police and crime commissioner, are
prescribed by this localising and decentralising Minister. I have not
counted all the “must”s in chapter 3, because I forgot,
but I will. There is a huge number, however. How will all those
“must”s be put into effect if the police and crime
commissioner is worried about appointing staff? How will we control
costs in such circumstances?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Indeed,
there will be a chief financial officer for the PCC, and the chief
constable will appoint one, too. I know that the
Minister thinks that all police authorities are turkeys who will not
vote for Christmas and it is therefore not worth
listening to their views. Lancashire police authority, however, talks
about the confusion that will arise between the staff and functions of
the PCC and the staff and functions of the chief constable.
It says:<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
practice this means that there is a potential for duplication. An
example of this is that Treasury management activity in Lancashire is a
shared function between the constabulary and authority and both use,

function.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Will
the Minister tell us whether that can still be the case? In schedule 1
to the Bill, the PCC is required to have a chief financial officer; in
schedule 2, which we shall debate shortly, the chief constable is
required to have one. Although primary legislation requires each of
them to have a financial officer, can they share one, or do they have
to have two, which would be a duplication? As far as I can see, it does
not say, “If they choose to have one”; it says that they
must appoint one. I know that the Minister is worried about costs and
says that his model is cheap and, apart from the elections, will not
cost any more than the current one. I will be interested to hear the
Minister’s comments, however, on having a chief financial
officer in two areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Schedule 1
gives effect to all sorts of measures, one of which is very important
but difficult to understand. Paragraph 9 deals with the PCC’s
incidental powers. It is difficult to comment on those powers without
also considering paragraph 7 to schedule 2, which covers the incidental
powers of the chief constable. In many respects, those paragraphs
relate to each other. Indeed, paragraph 7 refers to
particular powers that the chief constable cannot use without the
permission of the PCC.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000046">&#160;</a>

he agree with that, or is it unnecessary because those provisions are

Minister, with absolute clarity, lays out who owns what, who is

he is clear about the situation now, and what it will become when the

am interested to know from the Minister why that is. From the
representations of many chief constables, police authorities and
others, what the new arrangements will be, and will mean, remain
unclear to people out there who are looking at and thinking about them.
What do the two paragraphs of the two schedules mean? What do they mean
for the division of responsibility between the police and crime
commissioner and the chief
constable?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Lancashire police authority, I think—certainly one of the police
authorities—was concerned that the chief constable might be able
to enter into all sorts of contracts, including private finance
initiatives and so on, without any reference to the police and crime
commissioner. As far as I can find, schedule 1 includes no reference to
that power of the chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
a less hypothetical level, what does that mean for police stations? Can
the police and crime commissioner dispose of police stations, police
training facilities and so on without reference to the chief constable?
I know that the Minister says that we expect the PCC to relate to the
chief constable, but does the provision mean that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 235<a class="bkMark" name="Column235">&#160;</a>
                           </div>all such property and assets could be sold off by
the police and crime commissioner without reference to the chief
constable? The Minister might say, “No, it’ll never
happen”, but, if that is the case, should something not be
enshrined in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
apologise to the Minister, because my questions are technical. However,
the control of assets and property—who owns what, who
can do what and under what circumstances—and which contracts can
be signed, are important, if somewhat technical, aspects of the Bill.
As we have heard from chief constables and so on, people out there have
demanded clarity on all aspects of the Bill, certainly with respect to
the incidental powers under schedule 1, which have a lack of certainty.

schedule provides, last time, and the Opposition know the
Government’s position. The salary of the PCC should be set by
the Secretary of State on the advice of the SSRB. We have commissioned
that advice from the board, which is the right approach. We have
certainly not either indicated or set a salary of £120,000 a
year. We had to put in a figure for the purpose of costing the overall
proposals. It is for the SSRB to advise. Some of these are going to be
pretty big jobs, with the size of forces that will be held to account

cost, including tax and national insurance; it was not to be the gross
salary. We had to put in an estimate of what might be recommended by
the SSRB, for the purposes of costing. That was not an unreasonable
thing to do. I repeat that the salary is not set; it is for the board
to decide. I merely make the point that these will be significant
positions. People will be holding to account very big organisations
such as the West Midlands police, which employs 13,000 people and has a
budget of over £0.5 billion a

there will certainly be scrutiny at local level and of costs between
different PCCs. There will be attention to that and people will ask
why, adjusting for the size of the force, one force should cost more
than another. It will be much easier to do so with the transparency
that we offer than it is now with police

table? As the Minister just said, in forces such as the West Midlands

small force. If they are in the same league table, how can they
meaningfully be compared? What is the purpose of the league table in
that sense?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000073">&#160;</a>

will not be hard for them to make an adjustment of the cost per head of
the electorate served by that police force. They will, therefore, be
able to work out the cost of the overhead per elector. They will be
able to work out the cost of administration and the PCC per head. That
will then turn into a ranking that, I have no doubt, interest groups
and newspapers will publish. That will reveal that one PCC in one area
spends more per head of the population than another. That will be a
perfectly reasonable thing to do and will provide a check on how much
money that individual is spending. I really do not think that this is a

I am amused that the hon. Gentleman has not realised that, in
publishing the comparative costs of police and crime commissioners, it
will be obvious to anyone that there will have to be an adjustment for
the size of the force. There is a great variation in force sizes, and
it would not make sense to compare the administrative overhead for
Warwickshire, the smallest force in the country with some 400,000
electors, with London, which has millions of electors. So, clearly, an
adjustment would have to be made for that. That is not a

commissioners should cost no more than that. The hon.
Gentleman’s preferred model of directly elected police chairs
would also have an administrative cost. I made the point last time that
the cost of that would be greater, because the members of the authority
would still claim their allowances and the salary of the chair would
also still be paid. So the hon. Gentleman is not in a good place on

Under the legislation we are setting up two separate entities,
two separate corporation soles, in the office of
the chief constable and the office of the police and crime
commissioner. That separation is an important development,
and it adds clarity and transparency to the functions—we will
come to the ability of the chief constable to employ staff—they
need to be a corporation sole to do that. In view of that separation,
they will need the two finance officers, and to account for the
resources
separately.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000081">&#160;</a>

particularly important point—indeed it was one of the decisive
points—is that the office is of a police and crime commissioner.
That means that the PCC will hold a budget that will not be for the
police force. There will be a devolved budget from the Home Office for
other crime prevention activity, which the police and crime
commissioner will distribute. For that reason, it is important that
there is a separation between the two bodies, with separate audits and

                           </strong> To be fair, what the Minister said is very
clear—the functions will have to be separated, but there are
consequences. I have an example—no doubt there are others across
the country—of police authorities and chief constables sharing
financial and other functions to minimise bureaucracy and cost. If I
have understood correctly, it will no longer be possible for
Lancashire, for example, to share treasury functions. It will have to
split those functions and, as the Minister has said, there will be
separate audits and account trails and so on. We have talked about
costs—I know that the Minister enjoys poking fun at the
alternatives—but that separation will generate additional costs
over and above what the police authorities currently
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000083">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that forces often have individuals in
charge of the finance who are separate from those working in the police
authority. The question is whether they will have responsibility under
the Act. But there is an important principle, which is whether that
joint appointment enables proper scrutiny of spending and enables the
force to be held properly to account. The overlap in role between the
authority and the police force is not a desirable thing,
because it is one of the things that prevent the effective holding to
account of the
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is merit in having a clear separation between the police and crime
commissioner and the force, with the separate audit and the
transparency to assist the process of holding the force to account. If
the office is combined, the ability to hold to account properly will be
blurred, and that is exactly why the whole premise of the legislation
is to ensure clarity between the two roles. So I do not accept what the
hon. Gentleman says, because part of the purpose of this reform is to
drive greater value for money. One of my concerns is the ability of
police authorities—I suspect that the hon.
Gentleman, as an experienced former police Minister, shares my
concern—to drive the kind of savings that we need to see in
policing. Stronger authority in the form of the police and crime
commissioner to drive those savings, and greater clarity about the
allocation of resources, are good things.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000085">&#160;</a>

are better than others in terms of value for money, management of their
functions and relationships with chief constables on treasury
management. I will simply say one thing and leave it at that. It is
interesting that the Minister is torn between centralism and localism.
Why be so prescriptive—it is such a straitjacket—when it
could be demonstrated at a local level that there was a much better way
without compromising the transparency or the accountability that the
Minister wants? The Minister may wish to reflect on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000086">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will always reflect on what the hon. Gentleman
says when he is making what I think are genuine and constructive points
about the legislation, and I will certainly guard against being
over-prescriptive. As we go through the Bill, there is always a balance
to be struck. However, in the basic architecture of the roles and
responsibilities, it is absolutely right that it is set by Parliament
and that there is clarity. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman has asked for
clarity about the nature of the roles. I do not think that we could
allow any confusion. In particular, I do not think that we should allow
the two offices to be merged, because that would wholly undermine the
purpose of a police and crime commissioner, who will hold the force to
account and who will not seek to run it. There is not to be a blurring
between the roles, so it is right to separate them. If the hon.
Gentleman reflects on that, he will probably agree.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman has asked why decisions about the disposal of property would
be made by the police and crime commissioner. We believe that it is
right for chief constables, who control and direct their forces, to be
the employer of those forces; to clarify, that is not the case at the
moment. Many in the police service made a strong argument that they
wanted to control property as well, but we decided on balance that it
was right for property to be owned by the PCC—or the corporation
sole that embodies the office—so that the PCC had control of
assets and had the final decision about whether assets such as police
stations could be disposed of. Had that property been handed over
wholesale to the police, that would have given them more than control
and direction of the force; it would have given them the ability,
potentially, to dispose of assets without the PCC’s agreement.
It would have undermined the PCC’s ability to hold the force to
account. I believe, therefore, that we have achieved the right balance
in respect of property.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000089">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is helpful in clarifying the point about
property. What does the Minister mean by property? He has referred to
police stations and land, but does he also mean police vehicles and
items such as uniforms? Are they property as defined in the Bill? Such
definitions are important. For example, problems could arise if police
cars are defined as property and the PCC decides that a particular type
of police car is not right for the force, but the chief constable says
that it is. It is not a trivial point, and I am interested in exactly
what we mean by assets in the broadest
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000090">&#160;</a>

central Government will take an interest, because as I have set out
this week—no doubt the hon. Gentleman has seen that—great
savings can be made by the 43 forces procuring property
together. The previous Government held the same view, and it is an area
where we want to see greater
collaboration.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000091">&#160;</a>

Debate on the matter will continue, because some important points have
been raised. I agree with the Minister about greater collaboration in
the procurement of uniform, cars and similar items. We need to look
again, however, at whether some of the definitions in the Bill are
tight enough, including the question whether agreements are legally
binding and some of the other points that I have made. I am not a
lawyer, but I know that our debate will have been scrutinised and
perhaps the Government will consider whether certain points in the Bill
require greater clarity. I do not intend to vote against the schedule,

do not want a demarcation of operational scope? With operational
demarcation, operational independence is not susceptible to exact

                           </strong> I said at the beginning that it was a probing
amendment and I had laid out certain things in it. I am not going to
press it to a Division. I appreciate the difficulty
in defining, in any reasonable or sensible way, “direction and
control” in primary legislation. However, when the Home Affairs
Committee talked about direction and control, it said that there needs
to be a memorandum of understanding or a code of practice, which sets
out some parameters and principles, according to which the decisions
can be made, and the Minister accepted that. With the amendment, I am
trying to suggest that these things need to be discussed, thought about
and determined in such a memorandum of understanding or code of
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
mentions decisions on the deployment of officers, balancing competing
operational priorities, decisions that fall within the ordinary
professional discretion of an officer—budgetary allocation and
so on. They all seem perfectly sensible and reasonable, so we could
say, “Of course those things should be a matter for the chief
constable, because that is the direction and control of the
force.” We have had examples, and the Minister used one. A
reasonable example would be someone who stands for election saying,
“Police officers should go on buses,” or, “Police
officers shouldn’t patrol in pairs.” The PCC might have
that mandate, but under the clause, the direction and control of
officers is a matter for the chief constable. It keeps coming back to
that, but it is the core principle, which is why the memorandum of
understanding is so important. The chief constable says,
“These people are under my control, so you may have been elected
on that mandate, but they are not patrolling in twos, they are
patrolling in ones,” or, “They are not patrolling in
ones, they are patrolling in
twos.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
about deployment? Chapter 3 is about policing and crime plans, which we
will discuss later. The policing and crime plan lays out all sorts of
responsibilities for the PCC, including delivering policing in the
area. How does that relate to the chief constable’s powers under
clause 2? The amendment is a way to get a sense of what the Minister
means, and in particular, to push him on the whole business of the
memorandum of understanding or code of practice—we need a draft
of it. I have a request for the Minister through you, Mr Streeter.
Report is a few weeks away, and it would be extremely helpful for the
Committee to have sight of some sort of draft. We could then have some
clarity about direction and control in respect of chief constables two
or three days before the debate, so we could look at it and, if
necessary, table an
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000111">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Just before my hon. Friend finishes—he
moves far too quickly for me—I wanted to go back to control of
staff. Obviously, the Minister’s premise is that, as well as
improving performance and accountability, this is about containing
costs. I do not know if this would be in the memorandum of
understanding, but I find it astonishing that we could have an
apparatus for the commissioner—typists, tea-makers, chauffeurs
and photocopiers—all of which might be available in the chief
constable’s office, but if the chief constable decides not to
allow them to serve the commissioner, then the commissioner will have
to employ separate administrative back-up. Is that what my hon. Friend
has in mind? Is that what we want the Minister to clarify? That would
not contain costs; it would explode them.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000112">&#160;</a>

a probing amendment, and these are the questions that need to be asked.

me add one other point, on direction and control. When the Minister
responds to this, I wonder whether he will say a little more on the
tension between local and national policing priorities. I am interested
in his views on how the balance will be struck between the
two.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is having to
work so hard this morning—unsalaried too. The Committee is very
grateful. We discussed these issues extensively in the previous
sitting. They go to the important question of operational independence.
In brief, I will repeat the things I said before. The police service
has asked us not to define operational independence in this
legislation, because a plethora of case law already exists. It would
therefore be unwise to do so. These probing amendments would seek to do
that, so they would not be helpful to this Committee or to the police
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are not
changing anything on the existing legal provision that the chief
constable has direction and control of the force. That same principle
will apply. The same debate will apply, in what is—I think we
all agree—a grey area. That is where the hon. Gentleman will run
into difficulty, because he is seeking to define operational
independence, which everyone accepts is a grey area. Police authorities
and chief constables regularly have a difference of view about exactly
which issues should be matters of operational independence and which
should not. As I have said, such differences tend to be settled by
discussion between the two parties. At the worst they go to a court to
be discussed, but I simply do not think that those debates are capable
of being settled by statutory prescription.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need to be
very careful not to upset the proper balance between the body that
holds the police to account locally and the police themselves. The
police will retain operational independence. The hon. Gentleman
discussed the importance of the office of constable on Tuesday, which
gives every single officer the obligation under the law to exercise his
functions without fear or favour. We cannot pretend that these debates
will not remain, because they will continue going forward. I say again,
nothing has changed so far as the legal provision is concerned. We have
said that we think that the Home Affairs Committee’s proposal
for a memorandum of understanding is helpful. It is worth pointing out,
however, that 11 years after the Patten commission in Northern Ireland
suggested that the definition should be operational responsibility,
rather than operational independence, there is still no agreement on
the memorandum of understanding that should govern
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000117">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
should, therefore, be careful not to believe that a memorandum of
understanding would seek to define operational independence in a close
manner. If it did, it would immediately become bogged down and would
cut across what the police service are asking, which is that we should
not try to define it. There is force in

                           </div>having clarity about the roles in the tripartite, and it is a question
of not only the roles of the chief constable and
the police and crime commissioner but the role of
the Home Office, too. It will be helpful to set that out in a
memorandum of understanding. I discussed that with the
police service in the first transition board meeting, at which the
Association of Chief Police Officers was also represented, and work on
that will certainly go
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman is probing the
issues, because they are important, but we debated them extensively in
the previous sitting, and I do not have much more to add. On the basis
that his amendments would prescribe direction and control too closely
and rather unhelpfully, I hope that he will withdraw
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000119">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister said that nothing had changed and then moved on to say that
nothing had changed legally. That is the important issue. I accept
that, legally, there is no change, but the Bill significantly changes
the accountability arrangements for policing in this country. It is
within that context that it becomes much more important to test whether
the current legal framework contains the correct parameters within
which the new accountability arrangements should work, hence the
importance that the Committee attaches to getting that
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept the Minister’s point about the Home Office,
police authorities, chief constables and so on working towards a code
of practice or memorandum of understanding. It is interesting that the
Minister said, if I understood him correctly, that work had started.
I understand that the Patten commission was 11 years ago,
but we are not in the same situation, and it will hopefully not take 11
years to come up with a definition. I know that that is not the point
that he is making, but it is extremely important that the Minister
undertakes to make some sort of draft of the document available, to
Parliament and to the Committee, in good time for us to consider it
before Report, because it is of such fundamental importance to the
Bill. I have conceded to the Minister, and I accept what he is saying,
but he understands the crucial nature of the document. I ask the
Minister again to consider whether it is possible—I think it is
essential—to make a draft of the document available before
Report.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall keep returning to that point, because it is fundamental. Indeed,
in his evidence to the Committee, the chief constable of the West
Midlands said that it would be extremely helpful to have that draft
available for discussion during the deliberations of the Bill. The
Minister will have heard what I said and will no doubt consider it
again, but I cannot stress too highly how important that is. Looking
around the Committee, hon. Members, whether they agree with the
amendments or not, agree with my point that the document, which we have
agreed is necessary, is of fundamental importance to our scrutiny of
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000123">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall resist the temptation to send the hon.
Gentleman an invoice. The issue of reasonableness has been explored
countless times in the courts. He may have heard the phrase “the
man on the Clapham omnibus”. What is
reasonable or not reasonable is a matter of fact and degree and has
been explored countless times. If the issue of reasonableness ever got
that far, it would be left to a jury, would it not?
It is impossible to define such terms within the confines of any
statute, criminal or otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000138">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Up to a point, I accept what the hon. Gentleman
says, but the purpose of legislation is to try to prevent situations in
which the courts have to intervene to sort it out.
To be fair to the legal profession, its members are often called in to
clarify laws that were 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>badly drafted or ill thought through. The courts
sometimes helpfully pass judgments or judicially review a
Minister’s decision in order to ascertain whether a Minister has
acted according to the law. A test for a Minister is often whether he
or she acted reasonably in the circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We should try
to avoid that situation. A number of representations in various
documents referred to this matter as a serious point about the
relationship between PCCs and chief constables. Perhaps the Minister
can clarify: the proposal refers not only to civilian staff but to
police officers. Does the clause as drafted require the chief constable
to co-operate with the PCC, with respect not only to civilian staff but
to police officers, in order for the PCC to deliver all the functions
conferred by clauses 1 and
2?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000140">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have here a copy of an invoice that Birmingham
city council paid for the leader of the council to attend the Tory
party conference. If the PCC thought, like the leader of Birmingham
city council, that it might useful in the exercise of his functions to
attend a party political conference, accompanied by staff, with the use
of a suite and the addition of a drinks bill—the sort of thing
that Councillor Whitby relies on—but the chief
constable did not think it reasonable, would that be an area of
conflict? Would the chief constable be in danger of breaching
subsection (5) of this clause? Is that the sort of thing that could be
tested in
law?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000141">&#160;</a>

                           <strong>Vernon
Coaker:</strong> My hon. Friend has a good point. That could be the case, in
the way that the clause is drafted. The Minister needs to reflect on
the representations made to the Committee about the possible tension
between subsections (5) and (3) of clause 2. Perhaps the Minister can
help on that.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
importance of this debate cannot be brushed aside. Chapter 3 contains a
huge number of functions that the PCC is required to fulfil, with many
of them “must”s. If the chief constable is required to
co-operate with the PCC—to make his police officers, civilian
staff and so on available to the PCC, in a way that is reasonable to
assist the PCC in his functions—we need greater clarity. I will
leave that matter there, because I am interested to hear what the
Minister has to say. It is a serious point, the same one we had
earlier, where we got into trouble over “in particular”.
The Minister should reflect on those two parts of the Bill, to see
whether there should be greater certainty in the drafting,
in order to overcome some of the problems I have
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000143">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have a great deal of sympathy for the hon.
Gentleman. I remember what it was like in opposition, when I had to
draft amendments, trying desperately to keep up with the ones I had
drafted and to find things in the Bill to amend.
That is the job of the Opposition and I sympathise with him. However, I
do not think he has a strong point. Of course, all of us who exercise
public functions are under a general duty to act reasonably.
I must act reasonably as a Minister. If I did not do so in
taking a decision or exercising a function, my actions could be
judicially reviewed and I could be arraigned by people such as the hon.

House.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is sensible that we ensure that operational independence is protected
by preserving the existing arrangement that the force is under the
direction and control of the chief constable. However, we cannot allow
chief constables under that shield to get into a position in which they
might find themselves being unco-operative where a commissioner is
exercising statutory functions. The hon. Member for Gedling, as a
former police Minister, will know as well as I do that there have been
situations in which authorities have found it difficult to obtain
information, for instance. It is important that we ensure that, while
operational independence is protected, the commissioner is able to do
their
job.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
2(5) merely says that the chief constable must exercise his
powers<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000146">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>First,
those must be the functions of the police and crime commissioner, so
that would not apply where there was any interference in operational
independence. Secondly, we have the test that it must be reasonable.
That is an objective test. If anyone has concern about that, let us put
it the other way. Would we think it proper to allow a chief constable
to behave unreasonably when a police and crime commissioner was seeking
to exercise his functions? No, we would
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not think that there is a problem, because we are ensuring that the
force remains under the direction and control of the chief constable.
We are, however, ensuring that chief constables are in no doubt that,
although there is that separation of powers, they must ensure that they
act in a way that enables the police and crime commissioner to do their
job. That is the right starting
premise.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000148">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand why the hon. Gentleman wants to explore the provision, but I
do not think that he particularly set out any examples of where it
might be abused, and I do not think that it would be wise to remove the
“reasonable” test from the provision and insert another
provision, because it is the proper test to apply in respect of the
exercise of the
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000149">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The only part that I want to understand is who
regards it as reasonable. We heard from the hon. Member for Northampton
North that the matter could be tested in the courts and that is a
well-tried route, but if the commissioner decides that the
chief constable is acting unreasonably and, as a consequence, making it
difficult for the commissioner to do his job, is that
grounds for the commissioner to start a suspension or sacking process,
or would that have to be tested in the
courts?<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000150">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, it is an objective test. It is not what they
subjectively think may be reasonable; it is the objective test of what
a reasonable person would expect. Of course, what we hope, as now under
the existing arrangements, is that these matters do not get to the
courts but are settled through sensible discussion. In the past,
matters have gone to the courts. That may happen in the future, but we
cannot prescribe things so closely as to prevent the possibility of the
courts determining these matters in the future. What we can do is try
to insert, as we have done, sensible provisions that delineate the
powers clearly but ask people to co-operate. That is

                           </strong> The Minister’s faith is to be admired. The
potential for problems in such areas is considerable. I shall not press
the amendment to a Division, but the elected individual with a mandate
to do certain things is a totally different kettle of fish from a
police authority discussing something with the chief constable. It
might be the objective test of reasonableness, but I still say that
there will be problems between PCCs and chief constables in their
saying that they have a mandate to do certain things and the chief
constable is not acting in a reasonable way to help them fulfil their
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000152">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman’s response is that such things do not
happen because people are reasonable with each other or the objective
test of reasonableness will apply. It is a statement of faith rather
than legislative certainty. In those circumstances, to legislate on the
basis of faith, in the sense of believing it will happen or that it
probably what will happen, is not good. In that sense, the
Minister’s response was inadequate. With that, I beg to ask

do not intend to detain the Committee long, as we have already touched
on this matter. The probing amendment seeks clarification on the role
of the corporation sole office for the chief constable. It is an issue
that has been raised in the submissions from several police
authorities, and I hope that it is something that the Minister is
already looking at.<a class="bkMark" name="11012764000178">&#160;</a>
