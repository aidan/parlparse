many realise, and we will want to consider the

for permission to continue derivative
claim</div><a name="06071424000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000738"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 489, in
clause 244, page 111, line 2, leave
out subsection (1) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) A member of a
company who wishes to bring a derivative claim under this Chapter must
receive permission (in Northern Ireland, leave) from the court before
proceedings are
issued.&#146;.</div><a name="06071424000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly,
this is a further amendment that has been brought to us by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants, which we propose on a friendly
basis. It notes that in Scotland leave is needed to commence
proceedings. It would seem sensible that permissions from the court be
required elsewhere before proceedings are even issued. That would be an
effective mechanism to deter members of the company from making
frivolous or vexatious claims.</div>
<a name="06071424000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000739"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> These provisions reflect the
implementation of Lord Woolf&#146;s wider civil procedure reforms.
Currently, a derivative claim brought in England and Wales is commenced
by the issue of a claim form under part 7 of the civil procedure rules,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column672" />Column number: 673</div>which must generally be served within four months after it has been
issued. There is no requirement to obtain leave before such a claim may
be issued. Civil procedure rule 19.9(3) provides that after the claim
form has been issued the claimant must apply to the court for
permission to continue the claim and that the application must be
supported by written evidence. No further steps may be taken in the
proceedings until permission has been obtained. The relevant documents
must also be served on the defendant at least 14 days before the court
is to deal with the application.</div>
<a name="06071424000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of part 19.9 of the
civil procedure rules is to require the claimant&#146;s entitlement
to bring the derivative action to be determined at the preliminary
issue at the earliest possible time after commencement of the
proceedings. Notwithstanding the Woolf reforms, we have been clear from
the beginning that we want claims that are motivated by reasons other
than the commercial success of the company to be dismissed by the court
at the earliest possible opportunity and without involving the
companies. That needs to be underlined. That is why we tabled a package
of reforms in another place which, by introducing a two-stage procedure
for permission to continue with a derivative claim, ensure that the
courts can dismiss unmeritorious claims at the earliest possible stage.
That is essentially what this is all about.</div>
<a name="06071424000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that, as I believe the
hon. Gentleman and I will broadly agree that that should be the
position, he will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="06071424000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000740"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am happy with that clarification. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06071424000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000741"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The drafting of the various criteria that the
court should consider in determining whether to allow derivative action
leaves an extremely wide discretion for the court. There is a wide
basis on which the member can choose to take an action and a great deal
of uncertainty as to whether a claim will be allowed. For example,
subsection (2) states that a member may continue a claim as a
derivative claim where, in paragraph (b),</div>
<a name="06071424000625"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the company has failed to
prosecute the claim diligently&#148;,</div>
<a name="06071424000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">or, in paragraph (c),
where</div><a name="06071424000626"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is appropriate
for the member to continue the claim as a derivative
claim&#148;.</div> <a name="06071424000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain the meaning of those two
provisions?</div><a name="06071424000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000742"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The clause addresses the possibility
that, where a company has brought a claim and a course of action on
which the claim is based, it could be pursued by a member as a
derivative claim. The manner in which the company commenced or
continued the claim may amount to an abuse of process. For example, if
the company brought the claim with a view to preventing a member from
bringing a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column673" />Column number: 674</div>derivative claim, the company may fail to prosecute the claim diligently
and it may be appropriate for a member to continue the claim as a
derivative claim. The clause provides that in those circumstances, if
that member is seeking to continue the claim, a member can apply to the
court to continue the claim as a derivative action. The court has the
same powers to hear such applications as it has to hearing those under
clause 244. A member of a company may continue a derivative claim on
the grounds that the manner in which the company commenced or continued
the claim amounted to an abuse of the process of the court, or if the
company failed to prosecute the claim diligently. Abuse of the court
would be, for example, if a company brought a claim to prevent a member
from bringing one and to frustrate that
member.</div><a name="06071424000114"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000743"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My question was what prosecuting a claim
diligently would involve. I believe that that is new
law.</div><a name="06071424000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000744"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Essentially, a company would have to
pursue the claim in a reasonable way. If somebody were merely to issue
a writ and then take no further action to lay subsequent pleadings, or
were to delay unduly the serving of pleadings with a view to
frustrating someone else&#146;s capacity to bring a claim, there
would clearly have been a lack of due diligence. A member would then be
able to seek consent, but would have to show that there had been such a
lack of due diligence. If he failed to do that, the court would take
the view that the member could not take action.</div>
<a name="06071424000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is broad latitude
available to companies in how they pursue claims. We know that some
claims before the courts can take a long time because all the evidence
has to be got together, pleadings have to be gone through and various
issues resolved. The issue is whether a reasonable amount of diligence
is used and whether the company is willing to take action. If a company
acts in a way that enables someone to say, &#147;You are not being
diligent. You are not being reasonable about this. You are deliberately
taking the view that you will not pursue this claim&#148;, that
person will be able to seek a derivative claim instead. I hope that
that provides some element of
reassurance.</div><a name="06071424000117"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000748"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendments No. 490 and 491 were brought to us by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and we have tabled them on a
probing basis. It has been pointed out to us that the current wording
of the clause prevents a derivative claim by a member if the act or
omission in question was either authorised or ratified by the company.
If that means authorisation by the board of directors and those
directors have authorised the fraud in question, a shareholder&#146;s
right to bring an action for fraud against the minority might be
threatened.</div><a name="06071424000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 492 and 493 probe an alternative approach to the matter,
recommended by two partners from Allen and Overy in a letter to the
<i class="I">Financial Times</i> of 3 February. They
wrote:</div><a name="06071424000627"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
new provision in effect requires a court to make a judgment as to what
is, or is not, the course of conduct most likely to promote the success
of the company. Surely only the directors, rather than courts, are
properly equipped to make such a
judgment.</div><a name="06071424000628"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
difficulty created by this new provision could be solved relatively
easily by amending the text so as to ensure that the court could only
overrule a decision of the board not to pursue to such a claim where it
was clear that this decision was one no reasonable board could have
reached.&#148;</div><a name="06071424000668"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="06071424000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">If amendment
No. 492 were accepted, the clause would state that permission must be
refused</div> <a name="06071424000629"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if the court is
satisfied where the course of action arises from an act or omission
that has already occurred, that the act or omission&#148;</div>
<a name="06071424000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">was authorised by the company</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column675" />Column number: 676</div><a name="06071424000630"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;save in circumstances where it is
clear that such decision was one that no reasonable board could have
reached in which event such authority shall require to be approved in
general
meeting.&#148;</div><a name="06071424000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 486 is aimed at resolving some of other problems that we have
highlighted. The Law Society helped to draft the amendment, which was
first tabled by Lord Hodgson in the other place. It would insert into
clause 246 three new provisions obliging the court to refuse permission
to continue a claim: first, where the directors have decided not to
pursue the claim; secondly, where the shareholders have decided not to
pursue the claim; and thirdly, where the court concludes that pursuing
a claim is not in the company&#146;s best interest.</div>
<a name="06071424000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first provision is where
the decision not to pursue the claim has been taken by the directors of
the company, unless the court considers them to have been in breach of
their duties in taking that decision. The purpose of that is so that
the court does not second-guess the directors&#146; commercial
judgment unless it considers that by deciding not to proceed they are
in breach of their duties. The second provision, where the decision not
to proceed can be taken by the shareholders, is for when the court
believes that the majority of the shareholders, excluding those with a
personal interest in the decision, would not have wished to proceed
with a claim. The third provision is, I hope, self-explanatory and
common sense. The purpose of the amendment is to introduce a threshold
test that does not involve expense.</div>
<a name="06071424000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have added new
reasons why the court can reject a derivative claim, but are the tests
strong enough? We think that they are not. There is a concern that only
after years of jurisprudence will it be possible for firm advice to be
given on the court&#146;s approach to the exercise of its unfettered
discretion in relation to this matter. Uncertainties will be damaging
to business confidence. Amendment No. 500, tabled on a probing basis,
would reintroduce the fraud on the minority and wrongdoer control tests
contained in Foss <i class="I">v.</i> Harbottle. I spoke at some length on an
earlier clause about how that radical departure from the common law has
worried a number of stakeholders. Will the Solicitor-General explain
how the Government intend to deal with those concerns?</div>
<a name="06071424000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have consulted widely on the
provisions and the Government must realise that there are major
concerns about how things will work in practice. I end with the
comments that we received in June from Herbert Smith:</div>
<a name="06071424000631"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In our view the current
form of Part 11 CLRB does not address concerns as to the court having
an unlimited discretion in deciding whether to allow derivative actions
to proceed. The court will still be required to consider the evidence
and merits at the earlier stage and there is a danger that this part of
the CLRB will simply create a more complex procedure without any
corresponding reduction in the potential administrative burden for
companies.&#148;</div>
<a name="06071424000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071424000749"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): There are some serious issues
about the meaning of the clause, which I hope that the
Solicitor-General will be able to clear up. It is certainly true that
one of the most complex problems in the law relating to Foss <i class="I">v.
</i>Harbottle and shareholders&#146; actions was who could authorise
the actions that were being challenged: was it the board or the
shareholders? The clause is not absolutely clear on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column676" />Column number: 677</div>that. I think I know what the intention is, but it would be helpful if
the Solicitor-General could explain the
approach.</div><a name="06071424000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see some
merit in amendment No. 486. Subsection (3)(e)
reads:</div><a name="06071424000632"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether the
company has decided not to pursue the
claim&#148;.</div><a name="06071424000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not clear
whether that is a good thing or a bad thing. Lawyers will know, given
the background case law, but it is not clear to anyone simply reading
the Bill what that means. There is some merit in being clearer about
the various possibilities, although perhaps not in the exact way that
the amendment
proposes.</div><a name="06071424000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad
that the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) said that
amendment No. 500 was tabled on a probing basis. The phrase
&#147;fraud on a minority&#148;, which the amendment would put back
into the statute, is an old favourite of lawyers and extraordinarily
vague and difficult to define. Professor Sealy, in the seventh edition
of his casebook on company law, says:</div>
<a name="06071424000633"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The scope of the
concept is not clearly settled&#148;,</div>
<a name="06071424000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">and he refers to</div>
<a name="06071424000634"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the confused state of the
law.&#148;</div> <a name="06071424000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the case
after 100 years of case law, going back to Atwool <i class="I">v.</i>
Merryweather and Menier <i class="I">v.</i> Hooper&#146;s Telegraph. The idea
of putting that contested phrase back into the law in these terms would
not add to the clarity of the law in the way that the hon. Gentleman
thinks it would.</div> <a name="06071424000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concept of fraud in this context goes much wider than the concept of
fraud as addressed in the Fraud Bill. We are not talking just about
dishonest actions which cause loss or gain. In certain circumstances,
we are talking about negligence, at least where it leads to a benefit.
The most important confusion that the phrase causes is the idea that
the fraud is on the minority. It is clear from all case law that the
fraud is not on the minority, but on the company. As a phrase it does
not express what the underlying law is, and I regret any attempt to
insert it into
statute.</div><a name="06071424000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000750"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Clause 246 sets out the criteria that
must be taken into account by the court in considering whether to give
permission to continue a derivative claim. Subsection (2) provides that
the court must refuse leave to continue a derivative claim if it is
satisfied that a person acting in accordance with the duty to promote
the success of the company would not seek to continue the claim; or,
where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that has not
yet occurred, that the act or omission has been authorised by the
company; or, where the cause of action arises from an act or omission
that has already occurred, that the act or omission has been either
authorised or ratified by the company.</div>
<a name="06071424000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the amendments would amend
the grounds which, if established to the court&#146;s satisfaction,
would constitute a bar to the continuation of a derivative claim.
Amendments Nos. 490 and 491 would require the authorisation and
ratification by the company to be in general meeting. They therefore
fail to reflect two important reforms introduced by the Bill, under
which, first, private companies are not required to hold general
meetings, and, secondly, the duty to avoid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column677" />Column number: 678</div>conflicts of interest is not breached if, subject to the
company&#146;s constitution, authorisation has been given by
directors who are genuinely independent. That is quite an important
point which I hope Opposition Members will take into account. Clause
161, on the duty to avoid conflicts of interests, permits authorisation
by independent directors, subject to the articles, and it would not
make sense to permit authorisation while at the same time providing
that such authorisation is not a bar to the bringing of the derivative
claim. Authorisation should mean just
that.</div><a name="06071424000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just as
importantly, the amendments seek to introduce a
&#147;reasonableness&#148; test. We do not think that that is the
right way forward or that it would benefit directors. Under the duty to
promote the success of the company, the weight to be given to any
factor is a matter for the good faith judgment of the director.
Importantly, his decision is not subject to a reasonableness test, and,
as now, the courts will not be able to apply a reasonableness test to
directors&#146; business decisions. This is in sharp contrast to the
position in respect of public law decisions, where the courts can apply
a reasonableness test. We feel very strongly that it would be a
retrograde step to introduce a reasonableness test in relation to the
bringing of a derivative claim.</div>
<a name="06071424000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Cambridge
asked whether we will consider the points he raised on amendments Nos.
486 and 500, and whether the clause is clear enough. I am happy to have
a look at that. The amendments would add to the list of factors those
things that, if established to the satisfaction of the court, would
constitute a bar to the continuation of a derivative claim. The
Bill&#146;s approach follows the recommendation of the Law Commission
that, whereas ratification of a breach should constitute a bar to the
bringing of a derivative action, the fact that a breach of duty is
ratifiable should not constitute a bar, but should feature as one of a
list of factors to which the court should have regard in considering
whether to grant permission for the claim to continue.</div>
<a name="06071424000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 486 would add
three further grounds which, if established to the court&#146;s
satisfaction, would constitute a bar to the continuation of a
derivative claim. I will consider each briefly. The first new bar to
the bringing of a derivative claim would be a decision by the directors
not to pursue the claim, unless the court considers that there is a
substantial risk that in reaching their decision they acted in breach
of their duties to the company. That is, of course, a factor which
already appears on the list of matters which the court must take into
account in considering whether to give permission.</div>
<a name="06071424000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">In subsection (3)(e), the court
must take into account whether the company has decided to pursue the
claim, which would include a decision taken by the directors not to
pursue the claim. We consider that, while such a decision should
constitute a relevant factor for the court, it should not constitute a
bar to the bringing of such a claim. It is all too likely that this
factor would pertain in most, if not every, case brought before the
courts. Although we acknowledge that the drafting attempts to carve out
the case in which the court considers that there was a substantial risk
that the directors acted in breach of their duties to the company, we
consider that the amendment might still 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column678" />Column number: 679</div>prevent meritorious claims from being granted permission for leave. On
that basis, we ask that the amendment is not pushed to a
vote.</div><a name="06071424000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second new
factor would be a claim</div>
<a name="06071424000635"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which the company in general
meeting could validly decide not to pursue unless the court considers
that there is a substantial risk that a decision not to pursue the
claim would only be taken as a result of votes cast by members with a
personal interest, direct or indirect, in the
decision.&#148;</div> <a name="06071424000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
clear whether the amendment refers to a claim relating to a breach of
duty, which the company might ratify in general meeting and from which
legal consequences flow, or to something short of that&#151;a
decision not to sue, for example. In either case, we do not consider
that it is something that should bar a derivative claim.</div>
<a name="06071424000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause already provides
that where a breach of duty has been ratified, then that will
constitute a bar and the claim can go no further, but the possibility
of ratification or a decision not to sue is something which should not,
in our view, be determinative of the matter. The clause provides the
courts with the power to adjourn the proceedings and it is envisaged
that this power may be used in precisely those circumstances where the
company has not yet considered the issue in general meeting in order to
ascertain their decision.</div>
<a name="06071424000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the third factor that
the amendment would insert is that pursuing the claim would not be in
the interests of the company. In our view, that overlaps in an
unhelpful way with the existing factor in paragraph (a), namely that a
person acting in accordance with section 158&#151;the duty to promote
the success of the company&#151;would not seek to continue the claim.
It is surely important that clause 158 and part 11 use consistent
wording. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will
feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071424000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 500 would add two further grounds which are variants on those
proposed by amendment No. 486. Once again, we are not persuaded that,
even with the suggested safeguards, these factors should constitute a
bar to the continuation of a derivative claim. We believe that the
Bill&#146;s provisions, which are rooted in the Law
Commission&#146;s recommendations, strike the right balance between
factors which constitute a bar to the continuation of a derivative
claim and those which the court must take into account. In particular,
we believe that the provisions as drafted will protect both the ability
of directors to take business decisions in good faith and the rights of
minority shareholders.</div>
<a name="06071424000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a reference to fraud
on minority. That relates to amendment No. 500. As the hon. Member for
Cambridge said, the terms are somewhat unclear. I can do no better than
to quote from page 74 of the Law Commission report. It
states:</div><a name="06071424000636"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;But we
considered that the rule was complicated and unwieldy. It could only be
found in case law, much of it decided many years ago; the meaning of
terms such as &#145;wrongdoer control&#146; were not clear; and
there were situations which appeared to fall outside the fraud on the
minority exception when it might be desirable for a member to be able
to bring an
action.&#148;</div><a name="06071424000669"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000752"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me examine that. Our aim will be to
ensure that we get the provision correct, and it is important that this
area is clarified. It will not remain as it is, in the sense that, at
the moment, we and the Law Commission are saying, as the hon. Member
for Cambridge suggested, that there is a certain lack of clarity. We
are seeking to make this somewhat clearer and the objective of the
exercise is to move towards that position. I want to ensure that we

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000753"></a>Mr.

Solicitor-General on the difficulty of tying down the language
persuasive. Having said that, we need clarity on what the legal
position on fraud on minority will be following implementation of the
legislation. I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for agreeing to
have another look at that, and it would be helpful if he sent a note on
it to members of the

intended as such, but, as I said, were are concerned that the
provisions require additional clarity.</div>
<a name="06071424000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for amendment No. 486, the
hon. Member for Cambridge identified the advantage of clarity and
definition in terms of the court refusing permission to continue a

Solicitor-General&#146;s response on that, I would say that this is
very different from saying that it constitutes a bar. I hold some
sympathy with his drafting point on subsection (3), but it is just
that, not a point of principle. On the basis of what I have heard, I
would like to press amendment No. 486 to a Division, but first, I beg

Nos. 433 and 434 concern the ability of a company or group to qualify
as small and thus benefit from all the provisions and exemptions
available, including exemption from audit. The Companies Act 1985 sets
thresholds within which companies and groups must fall to qualify as
small. It allows a company or group that has previously qualified as
small to fall out of those thresholds temporarily, for one year only,
but still qualify as small. That gives a company a year&#146;s grace
before it fails to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column681" />Column number: 682</div>qualify as small and avoids a company yo-yoing between the different
size classifications.</div>

company or group that has qualified as small for many years, and which
will qualify again after one year out, will in certain circumstances
fall out of the small company regime. Amendments Nos. 433 and 434 will
restore the current position. The same point applies to the definitions

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000781"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> This is another group of
amendments that responds to concerns raised with us by one of the large
accountancy firms. The need for the amendments arises because there are
differences regarding which undertakings are consolidated in group
accounts, depending on whether a parent company is preparing those
group accounts using international accounting standards or UK law and
standards, which is UK GAAP&#151;generally accepted accounting
principles. These result in some circumstances where the populations of
the group differ depending on whether IAS or UK GAAP is
used.</div><a name="06071424000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case of group accounts prepared under UK GAAP, the population of
the group will be the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings as
defined in part 32, but excluding subsidiary undertakings that meet any
exclusion in clause 387. Those definitions derive from the seventh
European Community company law directive on consolidated accounts. The
definition of &#147;subsidiary&#148; under IAS 27 is slightly
different, which could lead to different entities populating a group
for the purpose of consolidated
accounts.</div><a name="06071424000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will ensure that the legal provisions in part 15 concerning
group accounts relate to the populations of entities that are included
in the relevant group accounts, whether prepared under IAS or UK GAAP.
There is additional wording in the amendment to clause 375 to reflect
the requirement of clause 386(2) that the true and fair view of a group
must be looked at from the point of view of the members of the holding
company, not from that of shareholders in the subsidiary
companies.</div><a name="06071424000206"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000785"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> These probing amendments seek clarification of
the concept of &#147;true and fair&#148;. One thing the Bill does
is move the auditing profession increasingly to a tick-box approach to
auditing whereby, if accounting and auditing standards are fulfilled,
the accounts and the business of the audit, as well as the accountants,
are, by definition, deemed to be successful. I understand that,
nevertheless, the concept of &#147;true and fair&#148; still
underpins financial statements.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column683" />Column number: 684</div><a name="06071424000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under clause 375, directors now
have an express duty to ensure that annual accounts give a true and
fair view. Clause 375 requires auditors to take account of that duty on
directors when they themselves are forming and giving their audit
opinion. Clause 485 similarly requires the auditor to give an opinion
on whether the accounts give a true and fair view. Therefore, there
seem to be a number of indications that &#147;true and fair&#148;
remains the underpinning principle.</div>
<a name="06071424000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are moving increasingly to
an IAS basis for international companies, and IAS 1 includes the
concept of fair presentation, which is not exactly the same,
potentially, as &#147;true and fair&#148;. I understand that when
this has been debated at European Union level, &#147;true and
fair&#148; has predominated over even &#147;fair
presentation&#148;. Again, it would be helpful to get clarification
from the Minister that, irrespective of the fact that all accounting
and auditing standards might have been followed, the accounts that
emerge from that process must give a true and fair view of the
financial position of the company at the date of those accounts. That
must predominate, and I would be grateful if she gave the Committee
that
assurance.</div><a name="06071424000670"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

up with it.</div> <a name="06071424000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady is right to say that clause 375 makes it an express duty on
directors, who we have included, to give a &#147;true and
fair&#148; view of a company&#146;s financial position. I am aware
of the &#147;fair presentation&#148; language that comes into the
IAS requirements, and I assure her that there is no practical
difference and that the &#147;true and fair&#148; principles will
still be the key thing that directors and auditors have to consider

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000790"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> We have a number of amendments to get through
this afternoon, and I am conscious of the
time.</div><a name="06071424000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The background
to the clause is the business review, which was heavily debated in the
Lords and on Second Reading in the Commons. In the interests of the
Committee&#146;s pressing timetable, I shall not spend a great of the
precious time remaining reprising those
arguments.</div><a name="06071424000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suffice it
to say that the ham-fisted way in which the Government finally got
around to introducing the business review was not their finest hour and
has cost many companies an awful lot of money on the preparations they
had under way for operating the financial review. That could have been
avoided if the Government had given more thought at the beginning to
the regulatory aspect of not imposing too many burdens on business.
However, it seems that we have arrived at roughly the same
destination.</div><a name="06071424000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservative
Members broadly support the business review as we now see it in the
clause. It more or less strikes the right balance, which is difficult
to find, between establishing for the first time a formal narrative of
a company&#146;s development risks and uncertainties and the broader
impact of its behaviour and its relationship with its employees and the
local community and
environment.</div><a name="06071424000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think
it is right to strike a balance between that and the regulatory burden.
Companies, by definition, will not always be successful and are often
close to break-even, so we must be careful about placing additional
regulation on them without adding an awful lot extra to what people
seek from the business
review.</div><a name="06071424000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
further issues with the clause. The amendments would strengthen the
Bill so that the business review worked in practice as the Government
intend it to work under the
clause.</div><a name="06071424000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendment No. 282, which raises a fundamental issue. Clause 399(2)
says:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column688" />Column number: 689</div><a name="06071424000643"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The purpose of the
business review is to inform members of the company and help them
assess how the directors have performed their duty under section 158
(duty to promote the success of the
company).&#148;</div><a name="06071424000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are broadly
happy with the content of the business review as set out in the
remainder of the clause, but subsection (2) is arguably in danger of
scuppering it by setting out a purpose for it&#151;to demonstrate
what directors&#146; duties are and whether they have been fulfilled.
That does not exactly dovetail with the rest of the
clause.</div><a name="06071424000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
would clarify the purpose of the business review, which is to ensure
that the members have an understanding of the business as opposed to
the directors&#146; duties. I believe that Viscount Bledisloe
correctly highlighted in the other place the difference between the
two. The directors do not equate to the company. There is clearly a
direct relationship, but they are not one and the same. A host of
factors can affect the performance of a company, as well as that of its
directors, ranging from the capabilities of managers to general
economic and market
trends.</div><a name="06071424000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
knowledge of this matter, having sat on the Work and Pensions Committee
when it was involved in considering the draft Corporate Manslaughter
Bill. A main reason for the original Bill being unable to work
effectively was the impossibility of being able to tie down what was
the directing mind of a company, so there was a mismatch between having
to consider the directors&#146; behaviour and the corporate
manslaughter. That was such a fundamental weakness that that Bill has
not worked as it was intended to, and we are trying to establish how we
can get corporate manslaughter legislation that will
work.</div><a name="06071424000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned
that this measure has the same potential weakness. The business review
is intended to achieve one thing, but that is not necessarily to do
with the performance of directors in relation to their duties under
clause 158. It is important to take a clear look at that. The business
review does not include any assessment of whether directors have
fulfilled their duty under clause 158(1)(f) to act fairly between
members of the company. Technically, therefore, the business review has
a hole there, in enabling the members of the company to assess whether
the directors have been successful in discharging that
duty.</div><a name="06071424000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
clause 399 arguably does not directly enable the reader to assess
whether directors have fulfilled their duty under clause 158(1)(c) to
foster the company&#146;s business relationships with suppliers,
customers and others. Neither does it specifically mandate the company
to provide any real narrative on the quality of its decision-making
process, which might well be necessary if the member is to assess to
what extent the directors had regard to the likely consequences of
decisions in the long term, as set out in clause 158(1)(a).</div>
<a name="06071424000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The business review, as set out
in clause 399, does not fully equate to delivering the purpose that
subsection (2) says it should. As we are essentially happy with the
business review as laid out in clause 399, my amendment would ensure
that subsection (2) reflected the purposes of the review, which are, to
my mind, to help the members of the company to assess the
company&#146;s performance and prospects.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column689" />Column number: 690</div><a name="06071424000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no doubt in my mind
that the business review requires narrative from directors on how well
the company is positioned for the future. The business review is
forward looking, whereas the stated purpose of assessing how directors
have performed their duties under clause 158 is, by its nature,
essentially a retrospective
assessment.</div><a name="06071424000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the business review, as set out in subsection (2), does not
exactly mirror the requirements in clause 158, which could end up being
a fundamental weakness. It poses a risk that the Government could end
up with a legal conflict between company members saying, &#147;This
business review does not enable me to assess whether the directors have
fulfilled and discharged their duties successfully,&#148; and
directors saying, &#147;We have included everything set out in clause
399.&#148;</div><a name="06071424000671"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="06071424000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Which view will
predominate, that of subsection (2) or that of the remainder of the
clause? The amendment urges the Government to close any gap between
them. I hope that the Minister will consider
it.</div><a name="06071424000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 283
is a probing amendment to find out what the Government mean by the word
&#147;fair&#148;, which is included in subsection
(3)(a):</div><a name="06071424000644"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
business review must
contain&#151;</div><a name="06071424000645"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) a
fair review of the company&#146;s
business&#148;.</div><a name="06071424000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be
presumed that the review should be balanced, with an assessment of both
positive and negative issues relating to the business&#146;s
performance and its position. It could also be presumed that
&#147;fair&#148; means the relative extent to which issues are
covered in detail. For example, the narrative could spend more time on
a highly important aspect of the company than on another, less
important aspect of its performance and prospects. Is that what we mean
by fair?</div> <a name="06071424000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
slight additional confusion. Subsection (4) uses the phrase
&#147;balanced and comprehensive&#148;, which could be taken to
mean more or less the same as &#147;fair&#148;, but the question
is: who knows? I hope that the answer will be, &#147;The
Minister.&#148; I should like clarification on what
&#147;fair&#148; means in the Government&#146;s eyes. It would be
useful to have that on record. It would also be helpful to know how we
will contrast the concept of &#147;fair&#148; with &#147;balanced
and comprehensive&#148;. Will she give us some guidance and a bit
more detail about precisely what those terms mean? That would be
useful.</div><a name="06071424000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 284 and 291 are related and tie in with subsection (2), which says
that the review will</div>
<a name="06071424000646"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;inform members of the company and
help them assess&#148;</div><a name="06071424000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
directors&#146; performance. As I said during debate on a previous
amendment, it should be the company&#146;s performance that is
assessed, but clearly the business review&#146;s customer is
primarily the company member. The amendments would clarify that in
other subsections. For example, subsection (5) will provide a
benchmark. The business review will have to give</div>
<a name="06071424000647"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
understanding&#148;,</div>
<a name="06071424000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">presumably to the member reading
it,</div> <a name="06071424000648"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of the development,
performance or position of the company&#146;s
business&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column690" />Column number: 691</div><a name="06071424000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The subsection goes on to say exactly what
that should include, but our amendments are clear cut about the fact
that the understanding will be required by the
member.</div><a name="06071424000280"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000791"></a>David
Howarth:</b> May I ask the hon. Lady a question about the
purpose of the amendments? They seem to expand the range of the
business review from allowing members to decide whether to vote to
re-electthe company directors&#151;that is, simply assessing
the directors&#146; performance as directors&#151;to assessing the
company in general. Does that not imply that she wants the business
review to allow shareholders to decide whether to sell their shares,
for example? Are investment or disinvestment decisions part of what she
has in
mind?</div><a name="06071424000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000792"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> It will be up to members to decide how they want
to use the information. At the heart of their relationship with the
company is an investment decision, so that will be central to the way
in which they use the information. They may have an interest in simply
developing their understanding of the sector in which the business
operates. Shares might have been given to them, of which they might
have a limited understanding. The hon. Gentleman is right that, at the
heart of it, there may be an investment decision.</div>
<a name="06071424000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the rest of the
clause, however, there is the aspect of corporate social
responsibility, and investors may value things other than the pure,
immediate financial returns that the company make. They may value
reputation, for example, because the fund is ethical. The business
review tries to find the balance between the investment and reputation
aspects of the company and its relationship with the
community.</div> <a name="06071424000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
no doubt that others will also be lookingat the business
review, and there is potential forconflict, because the
company includes not onlydirect stakeholders&#151;the
members&#151;but indirect stakeholders. The latter may have an
entirely different and&#151;dare I say it&#151;lower level of
understanding of the company. Additional burdens might be placed on
directors to obtain the understanding of someone who has only a tenuous
link with the company&#151;for example, someone who is perhaps just
interested in the product and not even a customer.</div>
<a name="06071424000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would clear up any lack of
clarity in the two clauses, it would be safer and it would achieve
certainty if we were to adopt the amendment. However, even as a
stand-alone provision, the understanding required is the understanding
of the company member above all. The purpose of amendments Nos. 284 and
291 is to close down any potential for
confusion.</div><a name="06071424000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 285 and 292 are related. I am trying to do the Government a favour
and ensure that there are no loopholes that directors for whatever
reason might use to try to reduce the amount of information in their
business review. Companies are often involved in multiple
businesses&#151;Virgin, for example, has franchises in a range of
business areas&#151;and they change over time. Sometimes companies
acquire new businesses in an acquisition spree; at other times, for
various reasons, they sell and focus on core activities. The term
&#147;company&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column691" />Column number: 692</div>business&#148;, which appears several times in the clause, arguably
roots the business review in the company&#146;s activities today.
There is a risk of directors saying, &#147;I&#146;ve written the
business review about my company&#146;s business and I can omit the
fact that we have made a commitment to buy a brand new business in a
different area with different risks.&#148; The review might end up as
a statement of fact about the company&#146;s business today, rather
than the businesses that it might select going forward.</div>
<a name="06071424000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The review might need a
narrative about the risks and uncertainties of the businesses in which
the company will be involved but is not involved at the time of
writing. The company might be about to open branches in a new
territory, with its own economic and political risks, but has not done
so at the time of writing. It is a probing amendment, but it raises a
serious point. We must ensure that the review is about the company, and
we must exclude from the clause any syntax that might close down the
concept of directors talking about the company as a whole.</div>
<a name="06071424000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example might be a company
involved in high street retail that is about to branch into selling
insurance or even buying property. It might be about to commence
investment in an overseas branch. Those types of business decision mean
that the company will face new risks and uncertainties that it might
not face when it is writing a business review about today&#146;s
business. The amendments would remove any uncertainty by making it
clear that the review is about the company as a whole and is not
restricted to the businesses that it happens to have participated in to
date.</div><a name="06071424000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
290 is largely a probing amendment designed to find out exactly what
the Minister understands by the term &#147;effectiveness&#148;
specifically as it relates to clause 399. That is crucial because when
it gets to the corporate social responsibility section of the business
review, it refers
to</div><a name="06071424000649"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;policies of the
company in relation to those matters and the effectiveness of those
policies.&#148;</div><a name="06071424000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pick that
out merely because subsection (2) talks about
the</div><a name="06071424000650"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;duty to promote the
success of the
company&#148;</div><a name="06071424000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that seemed
to be the language that was used to gauge whether things had a positive
or negative impact. I am trying to find out whether there is additional
significance in using the word &#147;effectiveness&#148; rather
than &#147;success&#148;, which presumably could have been used
instead and would at least have meant that the language in subsection
(5) was aligned with that in subsection (2). If the Minister could
clear up the question whether there is any reason for using
&#147;effectiveness&#148;, that would be
helpful.</div><a name="06071424000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
293 is, to some extent, a probing amendment, but in many respects one
born out of many years&#151;in my case&#151;of experience in
business. The Government need to be careful because you can often lead
a horse to water but you cannot necessarily make it drink. The
amendment would take out the word &#147;using&#148; in the context
of the company using key performance indicators. It proposes that more
aggressive language should be used and that the review must incorporate
key performance indicators. A business review could, for example, have
a table of key 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column692" />Column number: 693</div>performance indicators as part of it. It could have a sentence saying,
&#147;See key performance indicators in table 1&#148;, but not
really tie it in any further than that to the narrative in the
remainder of the
review.</div><a name="06071424000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether it would be wise to have more explicit terminology in the Bill
to the effect that the company should fully incorporate
KPIs&#151;that they are a fundamental part of the business review.
Perhaps the language should be strengthened to reflect that more fully.
As I said, the amendment is intended to be a probing amendment and the
Minister may well be able to give assurances today that the Government
expect KPIs to be fully integrated into the business review, not merely
plonked at the end to be taken or left by the
reader.</div><a name="06071424000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
296 was slightly entertaining to have to think about, because it seeks
clarification of the term &#147;future&#148;. I am sure that there
are many scientists in the world who could give me an incredibly
interesting time-bound definition of &#147;future&#148;. Clause
399(5)(a) refers to</div><a name="06071424000651"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
main trends and factors likely to affect the future
development...of the company&#146;s
business&#148;.</div><a name="06071424000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seemed to
me that it might be sensible to define &#147;future&#148; might
mean. We all know that business can change rapidly and that different
businesses have different time scales over which change takes place, so
we need to be careful to ensure that directors are not forced to talk
about time scales that are so far in advance that the concept of future
that they are having to use undermines the integrity of the business
review. If they are forced to make predictions over such a long time
scale that their comments become speculative rather than forward
looking, the quality of the review could be
undermined.</div><a name="06071424000672"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="06071424000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Instead, we
need clarity to underpin the need to include the main trends and
factors that influence the future development of the company. We need a
reasonableness test on what it is possible to expect directors to see
with a level of certainty, so that the narrative included in the
business review is far more useful than mere
speculation.</div><a name="06071424000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies
change over time in ways that could never have been predicted. In the
1980s it might never have been possible to envisage the rise of
Microsoft when considering IBM. Somebody looking at a business review
could say, &#147;Well, you didn&#146;t predict that.&#148; Would
it have been reasonable to expect the directors of IBM in the early
1980s to understand that the contract that they signed with Microsoft
would be so fundamental in the development of the software and hardware
IT industry in the 1980s and 1990s? Most people would say that it would
not.</div><a name="06071424000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition of
&#147;future&#148; could become a bone of contention when members
believe, for instance, that directors have not covered a long enough
time scale. They may say, &#147;What about ten years&#146;
time?&#148;, whereas a business review may cover only five years.
Similarly, some members may feel the opposite&#151;that directors are
looking too far into the future, undermining the business review. They
might prefer it to concentrate on the near future. It would be useful
to clarify the matter so that there is no need for conflict to arise.
The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column693" />Column number: 694</div>amendment would give that clarification, setting the term
&#147;future&#148; in the context of what is fair and reasonable
for directors to be able to comment
on.</div><a name="06071424000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be that, in
using the term &#147;fair and reasonable&#148;, I have not chosen
the best phrase. I accept that, but the amendment captures the essence
of my point that the Bill should carry a more careful definition of the
concept of &#147;future&#148; to avoid any conflict in what
directors feel they need to do to discharge their duties and to give
members a better understanding of what they can expect when they pick
up a business review to read
it.</div><a name="06071424000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to
the Minister&#146;s comments. I have raised a number of issues on the
business review, of which we are broadly supportive. It will be helpful
if the Minister responds to
them.</div><a name="06071424000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071424000793"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): I want to make a few brief comments,
as I now know how much I do not know about company law. In the past
four years, my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I have been waiting
excitedly for this moment, because it represents what we feel to be one
of the most important parts of the
Bill.</div><a name="06071424000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to speak
to new clause 21. The hon. Lady seems happy with the majority of the
Bill, but we are not. Last autumn, the operating and financial review
was kicked into touch by the Chancellor, who appeared to be seeking to
ingratiate himself with the City by dropping that requirement. That was
done to the anger of many companies that had gone a long way towards
producing their reviews for the consumption of their customers and
investors. We now have the proposed business review, which is very much
better than nothing at all. However, some might argue that it is not a
great deal better. Our key concern is that there is no requirement to
audit the reviews. The new clause would remedy
that.</div><a name="06071424000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reports like the
Tesco corporate social responsibility report are being produced. If you
will pardon the pun, Mr. Illsley, one would think that
butter would not melt in Tesco&#146;s mouth from the way that it
describes its activities. However, only this week much concern was
expressed about fruit picking in South Africa and many other activities
in which Tesco, Shell and other large companies
engage.</div><a name="06071424000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071424000794"></a><b class="B">Keith
Vaz</b> (Leicester, East) (Lab): It is not just what the
companies are known to be doing abroad; it is what companies like Tesco
do in this country. In my constituency, few people know what Tesco is
up to. They know that it wants more and more planning permissions to
build bigger and bigger stores, but they are unaware of what the
company is actually doing. Better reporting is one way of enabling
people to find out exactly what is
happening.</div><a name="06071424000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000795"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes an excellent and
eloquent point. That is exactly the sort of thing that I am trying,
falteringly, to express. Unless we measure what companies say about
themselves, they can basically say what they like. The
Government&#146;s assessment of the cost of producing the reviews in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column694" />Column number: 695</div>terms of the audit is &#163;33 million, which when one considers the
potential benefits to these companies, is a relatively small
amount.</div> <a name="06071424000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Customers and
investors often want the full information about the activities of the
companies they are buying from and investing in. A proportion of people
would describe themselves as ethical investors and ethical customers.
That number is growing exponentially, year by year. In our household we
have switched to green energy. The energy supplier professes to be a
green energy supplier, but unless the information that it gives us is
audited, how can we tell how green it is?</div>
<a name="06071424000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister takes
new clause 21 seriously. The right hon. Member for Leicester, East
(Keith Vaz) has also tabled an excellent amendment. I hope that we can
find a way to satisfy the needs and requirements of customers and
investors in companies who want their company to grow and achieve
profits in an ethical and socially responsible
way.</div><a name="06071424000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000796"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> New clause 33 in a sense it complements the points
that the hon. Lady has raised. It requires the Government to publish
clear, mandatory standards on how companies should report on
non-financial issues in the business review. I am quite convinced that
this is a Government who believe in transparency.</div>
<a name="06071424000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say what a pleasure it is
to serve on a Committee that is led by the my right hon. Friend the
Minister for Industry and the Regions? It is little known fact that I
was one of her employees when she was leader of Islington council. When
she led that great council in those days, when Labour had a large
majority&#151;no doubt because of her leadership&#151;she was famed
for transparency. I can remember as a very junior solicitor attending
committees that she chaired. The mantra of all the committee chairs
concerned the need for openness and transparency, so that as much
information was provided to the people of Islington as
possible.</div> <a name="06071424000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
33 seeks to provide information about companies, many of which, I am
afraid, operate in secret. The business review and the need for
mandatory standards will allow many people to understand what such
companies get up to. It is not just a matter for the Liberal Democrats;
it is a matter for all of us who believe that it is important that
these organisations are held to account. The shareholders and the
public may not do very much with the information; they may only read
the reports, but they need the information in order to make informed
judgments.</div><a name="06071424000310"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071424000797"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): The right

go on adding indefinitely to the regulatory and compliance burden on

new demand and a new cost burden.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000798"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, but he
has a touching faith in the energy of Government. I have been dealing
with the DTI for the last decade and a half on the subject of the
closure of BCCI, which was 15 years ago. Departments do not move very
quickly. Even if we retain the clause that allows them to do what is
proposed, Secretaries of State and Ministers&#151;even those as
distinguished as my right hon. Friend&#151;will not issue directives
on a weekly basis or in response to a campaign run by the <i class="I">Daily
Mail</i> or <i class="I">The Guardian.</i> However, the power should be in the
Bill to enable them to do so if the need arises.</div>
<a name="06071424000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 33 is drafted to
allow reasonable latitude in framing the reporting standard, which I
hope will address concerns that too strict a reporting standard would
place too heavy a burden on business, which I think deals with the
point made by the hon. Gentleman. I know that business feels that there
are too many regulations, but new clause 33 will not place more
regulations on business. Instead, it will give it a capacity to show
that it is prepared to release information to enable people to make an
informed judgment.</div><a name="06071424000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister&#146;s pragmatism and ability get things
moving. I have greatly admired my right hon. Friend for almost 30
years. I was in awe of her when I worked for her many years ago because
she was the person who would get things done, but not to the extent
that she would ask her fine officials at the Department of Trade and
Industry to rush off and issue directives on a weekly basis, which
would upset the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr.
Davies).</div> <a name="06071424000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister takes our points on board. I come here as a
friend&#151;she may not regard the Liberal Democrats as
friends&#151;trying to make the Bill better. Governments believe that
when they produce a measure that has been considered for the past seven
years, it must be perfect, even though Government amendments seem to be
tabled on a daily basis; I wonder what they have been doing for seven
years.</div> <a name="06071424000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend and other Ministers have worked hard on this Bill, but this is a
win-win situation. It is the kind of new clause that new Labour would
be proud of because it allows citizens to make an informed judgment so
that the consultation process will result in a statutory framework that
will give people the information to make those decisions themselves.
The new clause is more new Labour than new
Labour.</div>
<a name="06071424000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000799"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Despite the hon. Gentleman&#146;s closing
comments, I think that he has tabled a good new clause and a good
amendment. However, I shall speak mainly to amendment No.
181&#151;Nos. 180 and 177 are consequential to No. 181&#151;and
briefly mention amendments Nos. 178 and
179.</div><a name="06071424000673"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="06071424000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I do
that, could I add to what has already been said about my new clause?
Its main object is to return to the situation that I believe was
originally intended by the Government, in which information contained
in the narrative reports that companies will be obliged to produce will
be audited and can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column696" />Column number: 697</div>checked by auditors in the standard way. As a consequence of the
original Government proposal, the Accounting Standards Board produced
detailed guidance that would have been used for that purpose. It laid
out in appropriate detail what it would mean for companies to report on
environmental, social and community aspects of their
work.</div><a name="06071424000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) said, the
Government&#146;s assessment of the financial burden on companies
seems to be only&#163;33 million. Given the number of
companies that are involved, that regulatory burden is quite small,
compared with the benefits that would be produced for the public and
the economy as a whole were such information to become more
credible.</div><a name="06071424000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me to our amendment No. 181. Its purpose is to expand the scope and
purpose of the business review. It became clear in the speech of the
hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) that at present the purpose
of the business review is very much focused on the company itself and
on relationships between existing members of the company and the board
of directors. Amendment No. 181 seeks to expand the audience&#151;the
recipients of the review&#151;to include future investors in the
company and the company&#146;s customers. The reason for proposing an
expansion is simple: we believe that the Government have a legitimate
role in helping to create a market for ethical investment and
consumption.</div><a name="06071424000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
already a growing market for ethical investment and consumption.
Estimates vary, but the minimum estimate is that 5 per cent. of
consumers consider themselves to be ethical. However, there is a
problem with the degree to which potential investors in companies and
potential buyers of companies&#146; goods and services can rely on
the information that they are given by companies about their
activities, so the best thing that the Government can do to help
establish a growing market for ethical investment and consumption is to
guarantee to underpin the information. That seems to be a legitimate
role for them. To back that up, amendment No. 181 specifically expands
the scope and purpose of the business review to include the interests
of future investors and
consumers.</div><a name="06071424000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000800"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The amendment refers to potential customers. For
some companies, anybody could be a potential customer&#151;their
stakeholder group would be incredibly wide. In fact, one could argue
that for an international company it is the entire world. Is that what
the hon. Gentleman had in
mind?</div><a name="06071424000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000801"></a>David
Howarth:</b> In the context of our amendments and new clause,
yes. The Accounting Standards Board will create its standards for the
business review. The operating and financial review&#151;the previous
round of this saga&#151;produced a certain set of standards which the
ASB turned into just recommendations when the Government repealed the
original OFR. That means that when we get the business review through,
the ASB will have to put forward a new set of accounting standards that
take into account what is in the business review as opposed to what was
in the OFR. We are saying that when it designs those new standards it
should have in mind not only the interests of existing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column697" />Column number: 698</div>members of the company, but the interests of potential customers and
investors. To that extent, my answer is yes.</div>
<a name="06071424000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the hon. Lady will
forgive me for saying that she might be asking whether we envisage the
amendment creating an actionable obligation on companies that can be
enforced by anyone in the world in a law suit. The answer to that is
no, we are not intending that; we are intending it to settle the
purpose of the business review for the exercise of creating those
accounting standards.</div>
<a name="06071424000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000802"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the ASB has
already reflected on the fact that the OFR has now morphed into the
business review and has issued a new reporting statement, which is
obviously a non-mandatory guideline? There is already some assurance of
exactly what good practice companies will be expected to follow when
they are doing the business review.</div>
<a name="06071424000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000803"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Yes, indeed, and I have the document with me. The
new reporting standard is close to the original draft, just with a
different title. If our amendment were to be agreed to, there would
need to be further amendments to the text that would reflect the new
purpose: to help to create an investment market and a consumer market
based on ethical principles. We recognise that further amendments would
be necessary.</div>
<a name="06071424000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000804"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the fact that
that reporting statement exists gives potential customers and investors
something clear cut that allows them to ask companies whether they are
following it as part of their business review? As an example of that we
have only to look at page 44 of the reporting statement, which gives
the clear example on CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions. Does he need to proceed
with the amendments given that incredibly powerful albeit not mandatory
document?</div>
<a name="06071424000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000805"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I agree that the document is very good, but it
could be expanded in scope were the purpose of the review to be
expanded in the way that we suggest. While we are on the point, to be
fair to the Government, I should say that the scope of the business
review in the Bill is much wider than many people might have feared
when the OFR was removed. There is already broad scope in the business
review for going in the direction that we want to go. It is simply that
we think that we could go much further and we could be clear about the
purpose of the review.</div>
<a name="06071424000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 178 and 179
also relate to the question of what the business review is for. They
are more in the way of probing amendments, which aim simply to find out
what the Government believe the words in the Bill mean. We suggest that
the words</div> <a name="06071424000653"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to the extent
necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or
position of the company&#146;s
business&#148;</div><a name="06071424000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">in subsection
(5) should be removed, because it is not clear what they are intended
to achieve. If they are intended to restrict the scope of the business
review, the use of the word &#147;necessary&#148;, for example, is
slightly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column698" />Column number: 699</div>dangerous. If that is the intention, what is the reason for it? However,
if that is not the intention, why are those words in the Bill at all?
The clause would make perfect sense if it said simply that the business
review should include the other matters in the subsections. Some people
have read the provisions as restrictive; they could also be read as not
very
restrictive.</div><a name="06071424000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000806"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, in this day and
age, people want such information? There is much anecdotal evidence
that when they find out that, for example, Sainsbury buys its bananas
from a country that deals in Fair Trade, they then buy its bananas. The
more information that we can give to consumers, the better. No one is
harmed by
it.</div><a name="06071424000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000807"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Absolutely; people use the information for their
own purposes. It will improve their ability to make such decisions. In
the end, it comes down to whether people can trust the information that
is being offered to them by companies. That is the fundamental point
that we are trying to get across. When people want to take part in
consumer boycotts, for example, can they trace a company&#146;s
products? Sometimes people ask others if they are taking part in a
particular boycott, such as that against Nestl(c). It is difficult
for people to know whether they are taking part in a boycott, because
it is difficult to know exactly which products companies
produce.</div><a name="06071424000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Solihull said, if people want to make a choice in
favour of green energy or buying green electricity, it matters a lot
whether the claims of a particular company can be believed. Friends of
the Earth used to have a website that showed whether the firms that
claimed to be providing green electricity were doing so. As a research
project, and given the information available to Friends of the Earth,
it found that it was becoming far more expensive and too burdensome to
continue. In fact, when it closed the website, it suggested that the
Government take on the task. I suspect that their response was that, if
it was too burdensome for Friends of Earth, it would probably be too
burdensome for the
Government.</div><a name="06071424000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
approach would not impose the burden on the Government. It does not
propose that voluntary organisations take on a research burden that is
plainly beyond them in the present circumstances. We simply propose
that the information be made available to consumers in general, and
that they could use it to further their ethical and political
campaigns.</div><a name="06071424000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000808"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> This has been a good debate, although I must say to
the hon. Member for Cambridge that, if he does not know which products
are made by Nestl(c), he should go shopping a bit more. Its name
is on the bottom of its
products.</div><a name="06071424000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000809"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Because of the subsidiary structure of
Nestl(c), that is often not the case. We would be surprised to
find that certain products were produced by Nestl(c). I shall not
go into detail, because I might be
advertising.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 700</div><a name="06071424000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000810"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman intrigues me. Before the Company
Law Reform Bill, I was the shopper in the house and I am sure that I
could identify the
products.</div><a name="06071424000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East said, we are committed to
improving company reporting and transparency. I was particularly
grateful for his kind words. I shall have to show a report of them to
my husband so that he believes that the midnight oil that I am burning
on the Bill is in a good
cause.</div><a name="06071424000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the most
important ways in which directors will be accountable is through
improved corporate reporting, which is the purpose behind clause 399.
That is why we streamlined the arrangements for narrative reporting and
introduced the changes relating to the business review in the House of
Lords. A broad range of amendments has been tabled to the clause. Some
were tabled on behalf of environmental and corporate social
responsibility groups seeking to strengthen the reporting requirements
of the business review and to introduce further elements of the
operating and financial review; others may have been tabled on behalf
of the corporate lobby, which seeks to weaken the scope of the
requirements and provide more protection for
directors.</div>
<a name="06071424000674"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="06071424000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Seeing those
two ways reinforces my belief, as has been the case a number of times
during our consideration, that we might have got the third way just
about right and that the package that we have introduced on narrative
reporting represents a consistent and balanced policy in light of the
consultations. It always has been our aim&#151;I stress that it
continues to be&#151;to encourage the provision of meaningful,
strategic and forward-looking information to assist shareholder
engagement while avoiding disproportionate burdens on business. That is
consistent with Government regulations.</div>
<a name="06071424000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall quickly answer the
points raised by the amendments, starting with amendments Nos. 282,
177, 180 and 181. The Government have included subsection (2) on the
business review for two reasons. First, it specifies for whom the
business review is intended: it is an important part of the package
concerning liability, specifying that the review is to inform members
of the company. It is also intended to make it clear that the business
review is designed for the benefit of members as a whole, so that they
may more effectively hold the directors to account. It is not designed
to help individuals to make investment decisions, nor it is targeted on
the wider public in the sense that they should be entitled to rely on
it.</div><a name="06071424000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of the
provision, taken in conjunction with clause 447, is to limit
directors&#146; liability to the company only, ensuring that neither
individual investors nor anyone else is entitled to sue. That is an
important point.</div>
<a name="06071424000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we want to make an
express link between the business review and the directors&#146;
duties under clause 158. As I said in our debates on that clause, that
is part of a package of proposals embedding the concept of enlightened
shareholder value in the Bill. Directors have to have regard to the
factors set out in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 701</div>clause 158, and will demonstrate that in the review linking the two.
That gives legal expression to the view that, in looking at the
long-term success of a company for the benefit of its members,
directors should have regard to the factors set out in clauses 158 and
399.</div> <a name="06071424000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 399(2) is
a response to the view of stakeholders during our consultation on
narrative reporting earlier this year. Business and investor groups
alike called on the Government to clarify the position on liability. As
I said, specifying the purpose of the business review is one element of
the package that makes clear the extent of directors&#146;
liability.</div><a name="06071424000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The direct
link to directors&#146; duties was pressed for by a significant
number of interest groups. They echo the company law review in seeking
a clear and important link between enlightened shareholder value and
narrative reporting. In removing or expanding subsection (2),
amendments Nos. 282, 177, 180 and 181 would risk running counter to
what stakeholders have, on balance, been
saying.</div><a name="06071424000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Putney asked whether there is conflict between clauses 158
and 399. The answer is no. The directors&#146; job is to run the
company&#146;s business. As the hon. Lady said, the company is the
members collectively. The company&#146;s business may be subject to
external factors, and clause 399 provides that the business review has
to cover the company&#146;s business. The purpose of doing so,
however, is to enable the shareholders to hold the directors to
account, not to inform the public more generally. In other words, the
directors have to concentrate on what the shareholders need to know to
hold the directors to account.</div>
<a name="06071424000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill encapsulates what the
directors have to do to promote the success of the company as a whole,
as the hon. Lady said. There is therefore no conflict in referring to
that. The purpose of the review is to enable the shareholders to know
that the directors are performing in the shareholders&#146;
interests.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000811"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Does the Minister believe, therefore, that all
the duties in clause 158 will be reflected in the business review so
that members of the company can assess whether those duties have been
discharged properly? That is the question I
raised.</div><a name="06071424000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000812"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The answer is that we have left it to the
discretion of the directors to decide whether they incorporate all
those factors. It will be a matter for their judgment whether all the
factors need to be incorporated to fulfil the requirements in
subsections (3)(a) and (b) and (4)(a). So, that will be for the
directors to judge and their requirement will be to fulfil those
provisions&#151;it is at the directors&#146;
discretion.</div><a name="06071424000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady asked for a definition of &#147;fair and reasonable&#148;. I
am told that the concept of the directors&#146; report giving a fair
review is well known. It was introduced to company law by the Companies
Act 1981 and implementation of article 46 of the fourth European Union
company law directive. Its meaning is well known to companies and the
accountants who advise them, and we think that little would be gained
from changing it. There is no specific definition, and we think it
right not to define the meaning because companies and auditors are
calling for principles, not rules on financial reporting.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column701" />Column number: 702</div><a name="06071424000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend the Member
for Leicester, East tabled amendment No. 458, which would replace
subsections (5) to (7). In our view, the amendment would impose a
requirement to report on all specified matters, regardless of whether
such information was necessary for an understanding of the
company&#146;s business. In a sense, that goes back to the comments
that I just made to the hon. Member for Putney&#151;it will take away
a director&#146;s ability to judge whether such information is
relevant. In our view, it could turn the whole thing into a box-ticking
exercise, rather than a serious review of the company&#146;s
business. I am sure that my right hon. Friend would not want
that.</div><a name="06071424000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
subsection (4A) of my right hon. Friend&#146;s amendment would impose
also those requirements on unquoted companies. The original regulatory
impact assessment undertaken for the operating and financial review
estimated that if requirements were extended from the approximately
1,300 quoted companies to large private companies, the reporting burden
would be imposed on an extra 5,000 companies and increase the cost per
year by &#163;35 million. That is not a small amount, as the hon.
Member for Cambridge suggested, but quite a considerable
burden.</div> <a name="06071424000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
difficult to impose those further cost burdens on Britain&#146;s
medium-sized enterprises. I say to my right hon. Friend that that was
one of the issues raised with me by a number of people that I am
keeping under review. I appreciate the fact that he has raised it. We
have focused on quoted companies because they trade shares on the open
market, so additional reporting and scrutiny are
justified.</div><a name="06071424000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must be
careful not to impose undue cost burdens on non-quoted companies. It is
always difficult to draw the correct line when determining which
classes of company should be subject to obligations. That is why we
will keep the matter under
review.</div><a name="06071424000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000813"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Minister is making the point that the clause
imposes burdens on publicly quoted companies because of the public
trading of their shares. Does she not accept that that implies that the
purpose of the business review should be wider than simply the ability
of members to hold the company to account? By saying that, is she not
accepting, at least partly, our case for widening the purpose to
include potential investors in the
company?</div><a name="06071424000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000814"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No. The hon. Gentleman is conflating two arguments,
and I do not accept
his.</div><a name="06071424000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
subsection (4A) also specifies an additional factor that companies
would be required to include in their business
review&#151;information about contractual or other relationships to
suppliers essential to the business of the company. That issue was
raised by the hon. Member for Putney.</div>
<a name="06071424000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, this is a difficult
judgment issue as to whether we should make the business review more
onerous, but I am keeping it under review. Reporting on contractual or
other arrangements essential to the business was regarded as important
to some respondents to the Government&#146;s consultation. We have
been trying to weigh that up with those pressing to ensure that no
undue reporting burdens are imposed on
business.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column702" />Column number: 703</div><a name="06071424000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000815"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> That is highly relevant in the proposed review being
conducting by the Office of Fair Trading on the retail industry because
there is concern about the pressure being put on suppliers by companies
such as Tesco to ensure that they supply at the lowest possible price.
I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s words. It seems that, although
the door is not completely open, she is peeking through it with a view
to walking through it at some future
stage.</div><a name="06071424000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000816"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> My right hon. Friend is clearly trying to move me
slightly forward; I hope that he reads <i class="I">Hansard </i>carefully. What I
would say to him, which I think will give him additional comfort, is
that where contractual and other relationships are essential to the
business, such information will be required by subsection (4) to be
included for a balanced and comprehensive analysis consistent with the
size and complexity of the
company.</div><a name="06071424000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
subsection (4A) would increase the reporting burdens in relation to key
performance indicators requiring to be used. The amendment would remove
the exemption allowed under subsection (7) for medium-sized companies
not to have to report non-financial performance indicators. The
exemption is an option that the EU directive allows member states in
implementing the business through the new requirement, and on that we
see no justification for granting the exemption in the
UK.</div><a name="06071424000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would require all companies producing a business review to include,
where appropriate, KPIs&#151;not just on environmental and employee
matters, but on supply matters and social community issues. That goes
well beyond the requirements of the EU directive, so we find it
difficult to see a
justification.</div><a name="06071424000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say
again to my right hon. Friend that if the directors consider that
analysis using KPIs on suppliers&#146; matters and social community
issues is necessary for an understanding of the development and
performance or the position of the company&#146;s business, they
could of course include
it.</div><a name="06071424000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">The probing
amendments Nos. 178 and 179 would have the same effect as amendment No.
458 in the removal of words. They would lead to a box-ticking exercise
and impose unnecessary burdens on many quoted and unquoted companies.
Subsection (6) uses the words</div>
<a name="06071424000654"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to the extent necessary for an
understanding of the development, performance or position of the
company&#146;s
business&#148;</div><a name="06071424000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">because we want
to provide flexibility in the disclosures that need to be made in the
business review and enable directors to use their judgment.</div>
<a name="06071424000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the information is not
necessary for an understanding of the company&#146;s business, the
director should not report on the matter specified. That might apply,
for example, to smaller quoted companies. We think it right that it
should be for the directors to judge whether to include certain
information, and if not to state so, and for the shareholders to hold
the directors to
account.</div><a name="06071424000675"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="06071424000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
amendments Nos. 284 and 291 would be to repeat that the specific
information required of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column703" />Column number: 704</div>quoted companies under subsection (5) and of all companies under
subsection (6) is for the members of the company to have an
understanding of the company&#146;s business. We think that it is
unnecessary to repeat that in subsection (5). Subsection (2) is
sufficiently clear and, in response to the question that I think the
hon. Member for Putney was asking, the business review is for members
to hold directors to account, and not for any other
purpose.</div><a name="06071424000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 285 and 292 would confuse directors of a quoted company about what
they should report. When we refer to the company we mean, in company
law terms, the members. That has always been the case. The directors
are appointed by the members to steward the business of a company, and
the business review essentially requires the directors to report their
stewardship of the business of the
company.</div><a name="06071424000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
also asked whether the provisions would cover new branches, new
territories or new areas of the business. The argument is that it would
probably have to do so, because such development may well be crucial to
the company&#146;s future. Again, subsection (4)(a) would cover
whether that would have to be included. Subsection (3)(b) would also
cover it. The hon. Lady&#146;s concern that that might not be covered
is unfounded.</div><a name="06071424000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
effectiveness and success, apparently we think that the word
&#147;effectiveness&#148; is better in relation to the particular
policies and whether they achieve the effect that they set out to
achieve. This is lawyers&#146; paradise. &#147;Success&#148; is a
wider concept, implying that the policy itself must be judged rather
than whether it worked. Let us all think about that. That is the answer
to that one.
<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i></div><a name="06071424000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 293 would insert &#147;incorporating&#148; in place of
&#147;using&#148;. The effect could be that directors might present
their analysis in a variety of formats and the performance indicators
might be less discernible. That would make it more difficult for
members to assess the information and for directors to have clarity on
the information that should be included. That seems contrary to the
purpose of the review, and it is contrary to the requirements of the EU
directive. I hope that that explains the
matter.</div><a name="06071424000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cheekier
amendment No. 295&#151;I cannot remember the expression that the hon.
Lady used, but she said that it was a probing amendment&#151;has two
limbs. It seeks to limit the liability of the directors in relation to
the business review. It limits the directors' liability to the company
only and specifies that the directors will be liable only for untrue or
misleading statements or omissions&#151;that is in clause
447&#151;made in bad faith or recklessly or when there is a
deliberate and dishonest concealment. We shall debate clause 447 more
comprehensively when we come to part 15, but I note that the hon. Lady
has obviously been having second thoughts because she has tabled a
rather different amendment to clause
447.</div><a name="06071424000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
subsection (13) in amendment No. 295 expressly states that there is no
obligation to update any statement in the business review. We think
that that is unnecessary because there is no requirement under clause
399 to update any information disclosed in the business review. More
importantly, we are concerned that such a provision could cast doubt on

<div class="Column"><a name="Column704" />Column number: 705</div>whether there was a requirement to update other reporting obligations
under part 15. That is very different from, for example, the continuing
disclosure obligations under the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 and the market abuse regime under which issuers must ensure that
price-sensitive information is disclosed as soon
possible.</div><a name="06071424000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 296 refers to &#147;future development&#148;. Under clause 447,
a director will be liable only if he deliberately or recklessly makes
&#147;untrue or misleading&#148; statements in the report or
dishonestly omits information. Similarly, knowledge or recklessness is
the test for criminal liability under clause 401. A director has to
meet that standard in making statements about the future in the
business review. Nobody is asking a director to do the impossible; I am
happy to put that on the
record.</div><a name="06071424000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">With new
clause 21, the hon. Member for Cambridge and other hon. Members are
attempting to reintroduce the OFR, which we will not do. We do not want
the new clause. Statutory standards are not required, because they
would create too much of a burden on business. We have discussed the
matter and the ASB has made its statement, which will give good
guidance to those responsible for putting together the business review.
It also draws attention to issues that are inconsistent with the
information in the review, which are burdensome, expensive and one
reason why we withdrew the OFR to create a real
saving.</div><a name="06071424000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the new
clause tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East,
we believe that the non-statutory guidance is appropriate. Everybody
thinks that the guidance document is good, and we would like to work in
that way rather than introduce statutory requirements for
companies.</div><a name="06071424000379"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071424000817"></a><b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): I am trying to follow my right hon.
Friend as best I can from the far corner of the room, because I want to
be clear about something. When we discussed clause 158 on Tuesday, she
confirmed that non-mandatory guidance would be prepared with regard to
director&#146;s duties. Has she just said that, in respect of new
clause 33, she does not accept the need for mandatory or statutory
guidance? Does she accept the same principle in respect of clause 399
that she accepted in respect of clause 158&#151;that guidance will be
produced&#151;because the logic of one applies to the
other?</div><a name="06071424000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000818"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I understand that, in its report, the ASB has
produced what we call best practice guidance, which will have to be
updated regularly and will be available for companies to ensure that
they fulfil the requirements of clause 399 which will enable them to
fulfil the requirements under clause
158.</div><a name="06071424000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have dealt with the amendments, but I am afraid that we can accept none
of
them.</div><a name="06071424000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000819"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am disappointed with the Minister&#146;s
response to our new clause, although not surprised. We will need to
return to this important matter. I shall consider carefully what she
said about the issues that we raised in amendments Nos. 178 and
179.</div><a name="06071424000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had an
interesting discussion on amendment No. 181, which suggests
that there is some sympathy on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column705" />Column number: 706</div>all sides of the argument with the point of view that we are advancing.
The hon. Member for Putney regarded the interests of investors as a
legitimate aspect of the business review. In her response to amendment
No. 181, the Minister seemed to say that her main reason for being
against it was that it was not suggested by stakeholders. It is true
that people outside this place do not always come up with the answers
that we on the inside would prefer, but that is not a knock-down
argument against going in that direction. If the opportunity arises,
Mr. Illsley, I would like to press that amendment to a vote.
If, by any mischance, it were to be passed, I would then have to press
consequential amendments Nos. 180 and 177 to a vote, to make the clause
make
sense.</div><a name="06071424000384"></a>

Greening:</b> We have had an interesting and wide-ranging
debate. The key to the success of clause 399 is striking the right
balance between the need for companies to be more transparent than ever
regarding their corporate social responsibilities, and not imposing
burdens on them that do not really enhance the evidence or narrative
that they give to their members.</div>
<a name="06071424000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully appreciate the concerns
expressed by the right hon. Member for Leicester, East and the Lib-Dem
spokesman, the hon. Member for Cambridge. There was a touch of irony to
the Lib-Dem position, because they fully supported the business review
in the Lords. Indeed, Lord Sharman, who is named on the Lib-Dem website
as their spokesman on trade and industry in the Lords,
said:</div><a name="06071424000655"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My

Conservatives feel that the business review is about right. The
Accounting Standards Board reporting statement on the business review,
which was previously the OFR, is extremely helpful, because companies
that are concerned about having good reputations and high standards of
corporate and social responsibility will follow that reporting
statement. There is no doubt that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column706" />Column number: 707</div>business review will be used. It is a matter of information, so of
course people will read it, and when they do so it will be clear to
members and wider stakeholders which companies have not taken the time
to follow the ASB&#146;s reporting standard and spent resources on
that.</div> <a name="06071424000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">One could argue
that we should not try to save companies from themselves, and that we

clearly stand out from those that take it
seriously.</div><a name="06071424000394"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000825"></a>Lorely

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000826"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The hon. Lady made that point, but clause 447
clearly covers misleading statements. One of the Government Members is
a financial journalist. The media play a role in uncovering
companies&#146; bad behaviour and in many respects that has been far
more effective than cumbersome regulation in highlighting the companies
that do not take corporate social responsibility seriously. Other
clauses will clamp down on directors who make misleading statements, so
although I appreciate the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns, I think that the
Bill will address
them.</div><a name="06071424000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000827"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend is making a very persuasive
speech. We are tending to look at the downside and at what companies do
not do. There is also an upside, and the approach that is being taken
will encourage companies to do more than the minimum rather than just
meet the minimum
requirements.</div><a name="06071424000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000828"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I have not
doubt that once the Bill is enacted many companies will take the view,
as do many hon. Members, that corporate social responsibility is now a
fundamental part of how companies run their affairs. It is important
for two reasons&#151;its innate importance and the value that
customers and stakeholders attach to
it.</div><a name="06071424000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000829"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her patience and for
allowing me another shot. I recently spoke to a very large company
which said to me that it uses its CSR as a selling point. Its concern
about everyone being treated the same is that it would lose that
selling point. It sells itself to its customers and puts itself above
competitors through its good CSR record, which is a unique selling
point.</div><a name="06071424000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000830"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Absolutely. Many companies are realising that
they can develop their reputation by genuinely taking seriously high
ethical business
standards.</div><a name="06071424000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Minister for taking the time to go through the amendments. I shall not
press them to a Division, but I still have concerns on a few matters. I
am still concerned about the matter covered by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column707" />Column number: 708</div>amendment No. 281. There is a gap between what clause 158 says about
directors&#146; duties and what is to be in the business review.
Similarly, I was not entirely persuaded by the argument on
&#147;effectiveness&#148; and &#147;success&#148; in amendment
No. 290. I am sure that after <i class="I">Hansard </i>is made available tomorrow
we shall all take time over the weekend to try to understand the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000857"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The intention behind amendment No. 448 is to
reverse amendments made in another place. That is not something that
the Government undertake lightly, but the amendments that were made to
the clause would have a seriously detrimental effect on the operations
of the Financial Reporting Review
Panel.</div><a name="06071424000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FRRP
performs the vital role of investigating apparent breaches of Companies
Act 1985 requirements on the annual accounts and reports of public and
large private companies. It will continue to perform that role after
the Bill is enacted. The amendments would have affected the onward
disclosure of information obtained by the FRRP in the exercise of its
compulsory powers under clause 443. The Bill as it now stands imposes
additional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column709" />Column number: 710</div>requirements on the FRRP that we think are unworkable. Were the FRRP to
pass on information to other bodies within the prescribed limits of
clause 445, and should those bodies need to disclose that information
onward to other bodies, the Bill as currently amended requires that the
FRRP first authorises onward disclosure and secondly satisfies itself
that onward disclosure is in the public
interest.</div><a name="06071424000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that the requirements introduced in another place were based on the
requirements that currently apply to the Revenue and Customs, but they
do not work in this context. The Revenue provisions only apply to
disclosures that the Revenue makes itself, but in the context of the
Bill, the restrictions would apply to further disclosures by bodies to
whom the FRRP had made disclosures. However, the FRRP would not
necessarily be in a position to made judgments about the merits of the
onward disclosures, and it has expressed considerable anxiety about the
new requirements.</div><a name="06071424000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance, is the FRRP the correct body to judge whether information
that is quite properly passed to the Secretary of State should be
further disclosed by the Secretary of State? It will be for the
Secretary of State to judge whether that information can and should be
further disclosed&#151;indeed, the Secretary of State might be
constrained from disclosing to the FRRP the reasons why onward
disclosure is necessary. In those circumstances, how could the FRRP
authorise disclosure and satisfy itself that disclosure was in the
public interest? So far as disclosures by the FRRP are concerned, they
must of course act properly and responsibly in ensuring that any
disclosure is permitted, and they face criminal sanctions under clause
444 if they do
not.</div><a name="06071424000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are particular concerns about how the amendments would have affected
the system of financial regulation. Responsibility for the enforcement
of financial information is shared between the FSA&#151;the
securities regulator&#151;and the FRRP. A key outcome of the
considerations of the Government committee on audit and accountancy
reports was the way in which the FSA and the FRRP work together to
present a seamless approach to financial regulation in the UK.
Provisions in the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community
Enterprise) Act 2004, including those on disclosure of information
obtained by the FRRP, were included to reflect that approach. Clause
14(2) of that Act obliges the FRRP to monitor certain financial
information, and to inform the FSA of its findings. That was considered
essential in view of recent developments in the EU. Two standards
regarding financial information have since been issued by the Committee
of European Securities Regulator with which it is desirable that UK
regulators comply.</div>
<a name="06071424000677"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="06071424000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The C(AICE) Act
sets out the key responsibilities of the FSA and FRRP, which have been
further developed through a public memorandum of understanding. The
memorandum includes details of how the two bodies co-ordinate their
work, and sets out the points at which the FRRP may refer specific
company matters to the FSA. It must be asked whether the Bill as
amended would require the FRRP to conduct a public interest test in
respect of every piece 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column710" />Column number: 711</div>of information that it contemplates disclosing to the FSA. If so, such a
requirement would damage the co-ordinated and informed approach to
financial regulation that we have developed in the
UK.</div><a name="06071424000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the UK could
not demonstrate a high level of co-ordination and co-operation in its
regulatory map, the alternative would be a more expensive and
rules-driven approach which we do not consider suited to the UK culture
of compliance. I do not believe that that was what was intended, and I
therefore trust that hon. Members will support the proposal to revert
to the position as it was when the Bill was originally introduced in
another
place.</div><a name="06071424000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
449, likewise, concerns clause 445. It honours an undertaking given by
Lord Sainsbury in the House of Lords. As Baroness Noakes observed, the
Bill contains inconsistencies between provisions concerning the FRRP so
far as references to the Data Protection Act 1998 are concerned. Clause
648 in part 24 of the Bill provides expressly that nothing in that
clause authorises the making of a disclosure in contravention of the
Data Protection Act. That is in similar terms to section 449(11) of the
Companies Act 1985. Amendment No. 449 would bring the provisions into
line as we promised, and provides explicitly that nothing in the FRRP
gateway provisions on disclosure of information that is obtained under
its compulsory powers authorises the making of a disclosure in
contravention of the Data Protection
Act.</div><a name="06071424000452"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000862"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 356, in
clause 453, page 216, line 19, after
&#145;up&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;and it must be
made clear that this is the case and that the company has not accounted
in euros.&#146;.</div><a name="06071424000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment is not a new substantive provision, but a request and
potential requirement for a further explanation so that there should be
no confusion in the minds of people reading companies&#146; accounts.
I think that we would all agree that in principle that is an important
purpose. I am in favour of the clause, which provides that companies
&#147;may&#148; translate their accounts into euros. It is not in
any way an onerous provision because anyone with a pocket computer and
an exchange rate can make the requisite calculations in an hour or two.
Some companies who either have or hope to have shareholders in the euro
area, or do a lot of business there, may want to take advantage of
that.</div> <a name="06071424000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tabled
the amendment because I see a slight danger of confusion in subsection
(3), which states
that:</div><a name="06071424000659"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In both
cases...the amounts must have been translated at the exchange
prevailing on the date to which the balanced sheet is made
up&#148;.</div><a name="06071424000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
potential mischief is that it is very easy to translate a balance
sheet, which is a simple snapshot from a particular day of the net
worth of the company, as the liabilities and assets would normally be
translated to the exchange rate on that day with no problem at all, but
it is a different matter to try to convert to another currency a profit
and loss account or a cash-flow statement, which are a summation of
transactions extended over a whole year. It can make an enormous
difference as to whether one is accounting in the currency concerned or
translating into it at the end of the year. There would be wild
discrepancies in the two figures if one was dealing in a currency, say,
from some Latin American country that was subject to high inflation or
depreciation rates. However, here we are talking about sterling and
euro. Even between those two currencies, the differences could still be
significant for fairly obvious reasons. If a typical British company
that accounts and transacts in sterling translates its profit and loss
account, as stated in the annual report of accounts, into euros at the
end of the year, that would yield a very different result than if it
were accounting in euros throughout the
year.</div>
<a name="06071424000680"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="06071424000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">If during that
year, for example, the average exchange rate for the euro had been
higher against sterling than it was at the end of the year&#151;at
the balance sheet make-up date&#151;the profits would have been less
than those produced by the mechanism proposed in the Bill, for the
simple reason that the sterling profits, when recognised, would have
bought fewer euros at that time than they would at the end of the year.
The reverse would be true if during that year the average exchange rate
had been lower than the one prevailing at the balance sheet make-up
day. On the other hand, if a company transacts in euros and accounts in
sterling&#151;the reverse position&#151;the profits, if the value
of the euro had been higher on average 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column713" />Column number: 714</div>during the previous year than at balance sheet make-up day, would be
shown to be higher if the accounts were calculated in euros rather than
sterling. It makes a considerable difference. It is not clear to me, on
the basis of the provisions in the Bill as drafted, that people reading
the balance sheet and accounts, particularly the profit and loss
account and cash-flow statement, would be alive to the difference
between the two things.</div>
<a name="06071424000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">The differences do not stop
where I have suggested because all types of contingent results would
flow from a decision to account in a different currency. If one decides
to account in a different currency, one&#146;s foreign exchange
exposures will be different because they relate to a different
currency. One might have engaged in hedging one&#146;s foreign
exchange exposures by borrowing in a different currency so that your
interest charge would be different because the interest rate applied to
that borrowing would be different and so on. I do not need to go into
all the complications.</div>
<a name="06071424000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suffice it to say that if we
leave matters as they are, people may get a false impression of what is
going on. It needs to be drawn to people&#146;s attention that the
information they are being given is of limited use&#151;although I am
all in favour of information being given to people and I do not want to
vote against clause stand part. The information has to be treated with
a sufficient degree of scepticism, because the position might be
different if the company concerned were accounting in a different
currency as opposed to translating its accounts into that currency at
the end of the
year.</div><a name="06071424000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, it
is impossible for people to know the extent to which there might be a
difference. One would have to know not merely the exchange rate on
every day of the year&#151;that might be impossible&#151;but the
weighting of all the sales and purchases throughout the year. No one
could derive that from the information available to any normal reader
of the accounts. It would be impossible to know the extent to which the
two figures might vary. It might even be possible in certain
circumstances to know in which direction they might
vary.</div><a name="06071424000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is needed
is a warning sign, a kind of yellow light to make them hesitate when
they look at the corresponding euro figure. It is the intention of my
amendment that there should be that warning light included in the
statement of
accounts.</div><a name="06071424000480"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000863"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The clause was inserted as a result of the European
directive. Its purpose is to provide additional information, not the
base information that is required. Therefore we had to balance the
provision of the additional information that could be of use with an
over-regulatory regime to take up all those matters that the hon.
Gentleman quite rightly raised.</div>
<a name="06071424000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have taken a
pragmatic approach. I offer the hon. Gentleman the comfort that
although the clause does not specifically require that the method of
translation be given, it requires that the exchange rates be disclosed
in the notes to the accounts. It is difficult to see how one could
disclose them without putting them into context. For example, the
company might say, &#147;The exchange rate used to translate these
particular figures, as included in the statutory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column714" />Column number: 715</div>accounts, into euros was XYZ.&#148; It would then be easy for any
reasonable user of the accounts to work out the base on which the
directors made that calculation. I hope that after that short
explanation, the hon. Gentleman will be happy to withdraw his probing
amendment.</div><a name="06071424000482"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000864"></a>Mr.

would not make any sense to do
so.</div><a name="06071424000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trap that I
have just outlined may well be clear to the wary. My amendment was
intended to point out the matter to those who are perhaps less wary
about such matters. I hope that in practice, companies will ensure that
there is no trap in the accounts and that people are not likely to fall
into any misunderstanding, and will err on the side of being explicit.
I hope that well managed companies will adopt something like the
wording that I proposed, even if the Government do not include it in
statute. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000871"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The amendments are technical amendments, in
response to which I hope the Minister can give us some clarification.
The clause deals with who needs to sign the auditor&#146;s report and
in what circumstances; it states that if the auditor is an individual,
the report must be signed by that individual, but if the auditor is a
firm, it has to be signed by the senior statutory auditor in his name
and on behalf of the firm.</div>
<a name="06071424000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">That raises questions regarding
the position of a sole practitioner, especially one who trades under
another name. A situation could easily arise in which a sole
practitioner had bought the practice of a previous sole practitioner
for perfectly good commercial reasons and chosen to keep the original
name. The Bill defines a firm as an entity, whether or not a legal
person, which is not an individual. The question then arises: what does
an individual who is using another name as a sole practice name do?
Does he sign the report himself or does he sign it in the name of the
sole practice company name? The sole practitioner does not fit well
into the clause, and in fact clause 495 would also need to be amended
if the Government accepted the need for
clarification.</div>
<a name="06071424000501"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000872"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> There is no change, as I understand it, from
section 236 of the 1985 Act. We are not aware of any problem, either
for an individual auditor or a reader of audit reports. If someone
wanted to check on an auditor&#146;s credentials or take legal action
against Fred Smith trading as Bloggs and Co., the way in which Fred
Smith had signed the audit report would not be a problem. To be frank,
we cannot see what the amendment is all about and we resist
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000878"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The three amendments relate to the same subject.
The clause was debated at length in the other place and also on Second
Reading in the Chamber. I still have grave concerns about it, and I
have a number of questions on how it will work in practice. Some of my
queries result from the comments of Lord Sainsbury, who said:</div>
<a name="06071424000660"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That is wrong, not
because prosecutors would have to prove dishonesty&#151;they would
not.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 10 May
2006; Vol. 682, c. 1032.]</div><a name="06071424000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
subtly changes the well understood definition of what reckless means,
which is that there would generally be some underlying dishonesty. It
was suggested in the other place that that might not need to be the
case. Concerns were naturally expressed that still need to be cleared
up, and I hope that the Minister can do so.</div>
<a name="06071424000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">Audits are essentially
risk-based work, and they allow the auditor and the audit company to
sign off, or otherwise, company accounts. Audits involve considering
random and non-random samples of transactions that the company has
engaged in, so that it can get a feel for the overall materiality of
the figure on a balance sheet and ensure that it is correct. All that
involves making judgments. I am concerned that simply exercising
judgment badly could lead to a potential offence.</div>
<a name="06071424000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other aspect is that
existing fraud law and the duty of care and negligence could arguably
give a legal remedy for anyone who suffers a loss as a result of an
auditor&#146;s negligence. The clause may be about catching auditors
who turn a blind eye when carrying out an audit, but Baroness Noakes
said:</div> <a name="06071424000661"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government have produced no evidence that there is a problem with
auditors who are not fraudulent or dishonest, but who turn a blind eye
to problems. I do not believe that it is appropriate to create a
criminal offence on the basis of an unproven
hypothesis.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 10
May 2006; Vol. 682, c. 1026.]</div> <a name="06071424000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have to say that I agree. If the clause remains unamended, it may lead
to an unforeseen negative impact on companies. I shall endeavour to
demonstrate some of my concerns.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column717" />Column number: 718</div><a name="06071424000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no doubt that if the
clause remains unamended, there is a danger that auditors will need to
do more work to be more assured that the financial statements that they
are signing off are indeed true and fair. For example, when deciding
whether to write off bad debts that are provisional on the balance
sheet, auditors are likely to take a far more risk-averse approach to
financial reporting. That will not necessarily be of help to British
companies.</div> <a name="06071424000517"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
may lead to more qualified audit reports, as auditors will be unwilling
to take the level of risk that they might do now. By definition, if
they sign audit reports but do not flag up worries about whether a
company is a going concern, they themselves might create real problems
for companies. Audits would be at risk of becoming more burdensome as
more work is required to deliver a full, clean audit&#151;that could
damage audit quality. There is the risk of changing fundamentally the
relationships in the audit teams&#151;several people are necessary to
conduct audit tests and to deal with the multiple layers of review and
risk assessment&#151;that undertake audits. There is a danger that
the provisions will not even work as intended in the courts.</div>
<a name="06071424000518"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return again to the corporate
manslaughter Bill. It is very difficult to place a duty of care on any
one individual successfully and to demonstrate that they had taken the
action that led to the breach of the corporate manslaughter
regulations. In reality, if auditors were being pursued for
recklessness, it would be difficult to say which one had committed the
offence. Was it the audit junior who had not carried out the right test
or followed up an invoice containing a suspicious item? Perhaps it had
not been recorded properly in the ledgers or accounting records. Or was
it the audit senior who did not tell their junior to go back and follow
it up with the client? Or was it the audit manager who reviewed the
audit file and noticed the item, but in the context of the overall
audit felt that it was probably an isolated case, that it could be
discounted and that it did not necessarily lead to a negative audit
opinion? Or was it the partner who reviewed the work of the audit
manager and reached a similar conclusion? Which one of those auditors
would have committed the offence of recklessness? It would be difficult
to point a finger at a particular
individual.</div><a name="06071424000519"></a><div class="hs_Para">That could
lead to a culture in which auditors did not race towards risks when
they saw them and looked at them in detail to understand whether they
might damage their ability to sign off an audit report as &#147;true
and fair&#148;, but instead had an incentive not to look at risks in
detail in case they uncovered problems leading to the perception that
they failed to follow up sufficiently on those risks. That would be a
very bad thing.</div> <a name="06071424000520"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall offer an example: an audit manager is carrying out an audit and
receives an anonymous e-mail saying, &#147;You ought to check out
whether the level of stock is at the level on the balance
sheet&#148;. They check it out and find that everything is fine. They
then receive another e-mail saying that another aspect of the
debtor&#146;s activities is inaccurate. So, again, the auditor checks
it out but, again, everything is fine. They receive another nine or 10
e-mails and finally think, &#147;This is ridiculous. I have had so
many of these and they have all been wrong so I am going to ignore it
and get on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column718" />Column number: 719</div>with the audit work&#148;. What happens if it is subsequently proved
that that final e-mail, which they did not follow up, was correct and
material? Would the auditor be viewed as having acted
recklessly?</div><a name="06071424000521"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
demonstrates that, in reality, during an audit, an auditor must make
fine judgments often in the light of many years of experience. At the
moment, the system works very well and we need to be careful not put
that at risk unwittingly with this new offence. It might be that we
need some clarification of Lord Sainsbury&#146;s comments. I hope
that we will get
that.</div><a name="06071424000522"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendments
propose to replace &#147;knowingly or recklessly&#148; with
&#147;dishonestly or fraudulently&#148;. We think that that would
capture better the offence that the Government want to hone in on. I
hope very much that the Minister will respond sensibly to Lord
Sainsbury&#146;s comments in the Lords and provide some
clarification. If we do not receive clarification, there is a grave
risk that auditors will not be willing to put themselves at personal
risk of committing the offence in question. We may therefore lose some
of our best and brightest people and people will be less willing to
enter the audit profession. Companies will find that their audits take
significantly longer and are far more detailed than has ever been
necessary in the past, and are therefore also more costly. The irony is
that at the end of the process, the audit might be less robust than in
past. That is a risk. I hope that the Government will consider the
amendments in detail and respond to my
points.</div><a name="06071424000523"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000879"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> My hon. Friend has made an extremely good speech
that was well thought through. She made some powerful arguments, which
I hope the Committee will weigh up carefully. I agree that we do not,
in principle, want to increase the cost to companies if we can avoid
doing so, nor discourage people from going into the auditing side of
the accounting profession. I know that my hon. Friend is herself an
accountant, although I do not know whether she is an auditor. My
experience has been that bright young accountants are increasingly not
drawn to the audit side of the profession, because they can make more
money in tax or management consultancy and perhaps because those areas
do not have the same risks as
auditing.</div><a name="06071424000524"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole
integrity of our financial system&#151;it is not too much to say the
whole viability of capitalism&#151;depends not merely on the honesty
of accountants, which we must take for granted except in exceptional
circumstances, but on their thoroughness and professional competence.
My hon. Friend argues that it would not be right to create criminal
liability for auditors when there is no criminal intent. I believe that
that was the essence of her very reasonable argument. The word
&#147;recklessly&#148; does not involve criminal intent,
dishonesty, corruption or a deliberate decision to deceive.</div>
<a name="06071424000525"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take a balanced view of the
issue, because I am conscious that we do not want to increase the cost
to companies of compliance with the Bill. We have rightly said so in
many contexts. We do not want to drive bright, young, ambitious
accountants away from the essential job of auditing to other aspects of
the profession. I am also conscious of the potential unfairness of
giving someone a criminal conviction in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column719" />Column number: 720</div>case in which there was no criminal intent. That raises issues of legal
philosophy that we should all
consider.</div><a name="06071424000526"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, the idea of recklessness in an accountant is terrifying. It is
like recklessness in a doctor, surgeon or airline pilot. There are
certain professions in which it has horrific consequences, and we
should send a message from the Committee that we regard recklessness
among auditors as terrifying. We do not want an Enron or a WorldCom in
this country. Such scandals and disasters do enormous damage not only
to their immediate victims, but to the credibility of the financial
system, and ultimately to the cost of capital and therefore the wealth
of everybody.</div><a name="06071424000527"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are strong arguments on both sides, and I shall tell you why I stood to
speak, Mr. Illsley. The right way to resolve the matter is
for the Government&#151;I do not often ask for their attention, but I
would be grateful for it for the next 20 seconds&#151;to explain in
Committee that recklessness will have a very high threshold. It will be
when an accountant does something that he knows from his professional
training he ought not to do or, more likely, when he does not do
something that he knows from his professional training that he ought to
do. An example would be if he does not ask essential questions and
pursue anomalies and discrepancies. If he sees that liabilities do not
make much sense when compared with a declared charge, he must ask
questions and need to be persuaded as to why the discrepancy
exists.</div><a name="06071424000528"></a><div class="hs_Para">There needs to
be an explicitly high threshold so that honest people doing an honest
job do not have to lose sleep and have the nightmare that they could
open themselves to prosecution by making an inadvertent mistake that
any of us could make, let alone by themselves being victims of fraud or
conspiracy to defraud on the part of directors, managers or others who
lie to them and produce false invoices and bank statements. There have
been examples of that on both sides of the Atlantic recently. Which of
us can say that we will be able to tell whether an invoice is forged?
When we get a bank statement from Bank of America, which was a famous
case, and it looks perfectly all right, we cannot ring the chairman of
Bank of
America.</div><a name="06071424000682"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000880"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I was saying that auditors are vulnerable to the
mistakes of others, and indeed sometimes to the fraud of others. It
would unreasonable if, every time an auditor looked at a letter from a
bank stating that a facility had been granted or whatever, they had to
ring up the bank to check that the letter was genuine. It would be
impossible for them to do so, and such a requirement would be
impracticable.</div><a name="06071424000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
give another striking example. A few years ago, Shell greatly
overstated its oil reserves. If an auditor is told by the directors of
a reputable oil company such as Shell and by its geological
head&#151;I am not sure what he calls himself, but he is a man who
appears to have had many years&#146; experience of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column720" />Column number: 721</div>evaluating oil reserves&#151;that the oil reserves are X, the auditor
is entitled to believe that. If it turns out that they are Y, it would
be totally unreasonable for anyone to have a go at the
auditor.</div><a name="06071424000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I have
in mind is that auditors should set themselves the highest professional
standards. They should always probe any clear discrepancy, as well as
anything that is slightly odd, anomalous, out of line or inconsistent,
and they should not be fobbed off. They should ask questions that need
to be asked and pursue matters. That is what we require.</div>
<a name="06071424000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recklessness should apply only
to the most egregious examples of non-criminal behaviour. There is
already provision in respect of criminal behaviour in the clause, and
we all agree that it should be sanctioned. Recklessness, while not
requiring any criminal intent to be proven, should be egregiously
greater than ordinary negligence or ordinary mistakes. If the Minister
can put some assurance of that kind on the record, she might well solve
the problem.</div><a name="06071424000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
general opinion that the response of the Minister&#146;s colleague in
the other place, Lord Sainsbury, on this subject, to which my attention
was drawn a moment ago in the interval that we just had, was not
adequate, did not do the necessary job or provide for that sufficiently
high threshold. I hope that the high threshold will now be set out in
clear and unambiguous language by the
Minister.</div>
<a name="06071424000536"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000881"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I rise to echo, to some degree, the point made by
the hon. Gentleman. In the House of Lords, Lord Sainsbury mentioned
that it is possible to commit an offence knowingly or recklessly
without being dishonest. People were confused by that and were trying
to imagine how accounts could be put out knowingly or recklessly, but
not dishonestly. In which circumstances could such an event take
place?</div><a name="06071424000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us draw a
comparison with the Fraud Bill. An important element of fraud is the
intention to make a gain or cause a loss, but under clause 497 it does
not appear that one has to act in that way. We are trying to ascertain
what Lord Sainsbury meant. Perhaps the Minister will
explain.</div><a name="06071424000538"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000882"></a>David
Howarth:</b> My hon. Friend is making an important point. It
seems possible that what Lord Sainsbury meant is precisely that the
offence under clause 497 is different from that of fraud under the
Fraud Bill. Fraud under that Bill requires the specific intention to
cause a loss or to make a gain. If that is what he meant by it being
possible to commit the offence without dishonesty, what he said was
perfectly harmless, because the offence we are talking about would be
slightly stricter than true fraud, but not go as far as the hon. Member
for Grantham and Stamford feared it
might.</div><a name="06071424000539"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000883"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
elucidation. We are seeking to ascertain whether the Government intend
to create a crime that can be committed negligently or inadvertently.
If so, we cannot support the provision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column721" />Column number: 722</div><a name="06071424000540"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000884"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I shall answer the hon. Lady in the negative
straight away and then turn to issues raised by
others.</div><a name="06071424000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Grantham and Stamford is concerned about the absence of
criminal intent. I know what he means&#151;the absence of deliberate
criminal intent&#151;but recklessness is of course an element of the
state of mind in many, many crimes, so it is in that sense a criminal
state of mind across the board in criminal offences, as long as they
are not ones of specific intent. Therefore, there is nothing
particularly unique or scary about this
provision.</div><a name="06071424000542"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recklessness
is certainly a high threshold, which I shall set out for the hon.
Gentleman in a moment, and it is certainly not what the hon. Member for
Putney suggested. She referred to the possibility of someone making an
error of judgment after years of being in practice and getting
something slightly wrong. That is really the same question as the hon.
Member for Solihull asked, so I shall set out what recklessness is and
how dishonesty does or does not come into it. I think the hon. Lady
also mentioned that there are penalties already and asked why we need
an offence. I shall try to deal with all
that.</div><a name="06071424000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
to make it clear what &#147;recklessly&#148; means. It has been
suggested that the provision is so broad that it is criminalising
negligence. That is not the case. It has also been asked whether making
misleading, false or deceptive statements recklessly must involve
dishonesty, so let me elaborate on what Lord Sainsbury said and talk
about the difference between recklessness and
negligence.</div><a name="06071424000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Recklessly&#148;
does not mean &#147;carelessly&#148; or
&#147;negligently&#148;. It does not involve not thinking of
something or not noticing it. Negligence is not thinking of something.
Negligent auditors are ones who do not do their job to the required
standard through inattention and incompetence. It may be simply a
momentary absence of mind with serious consequences. The hon. Member
for Putney said that that is a disciplinary offence, but it is not
recklessness. A person who is merely negligent will not be guilty of
this offence, even if the negligence is
gross.</div><a name="06071424000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that
that almost touches on the issue of corporate manslaughter. When I
define recklessness, the hon. Lady will appreciate the state of mind
that has to be found in an individual before the crime can be
committed, so there is no question in this case of any kind of
attributable responsibility to a firm. This is not like corporate
manslaughter at all; it is about an
individual.</div><a name="06071424000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady asked who in the whole sequence of events will be responsible or
criminally liable. It will be any person who is found to have the state
of mind that I shall set out. Any such person will be criminally liable
and anyone who does not have that state of mind will
not.</div><a name="06071424000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test of
recklessness will catch only auditors who consciously do not care about
doing a good job. To prove that an auditor has behaved recklessly, it
is necessary to show that the auditor was aware that an action
or&#151;as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, this is
far more frequent&#151;a failure to act carried risks and that,
having known that those risks were present and not reasonable ones to
take, he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column722" />Column number: 723</div>none the less consciously decided to go ahead. Therefore, someone cannot
be reckless inadvertently; they have to have directed their mind toward
it, become aware of the risks and gone on regardless. It cannot be done
by inadvertence or
carelessness.</div><a name="06071424000548"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000885"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Does the Minister have any indication that what
we are discussing is a serious problem in the audit profession at the
moment, that it has been in the past or that it will be in future? Does
she have any indication that swathes of auditors consciously do not
care about doing a good job? My experience is that we do not have any
such indication, but I want to understand what the problem is in the
auditing profession that the Government believe they might be solving
with this
measure.</div><a name="06071424000549"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000886"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The hon. Lady has already made that point and I
shall come to it in due course, but I hope that, at the moment, I have
accomplished my task of setting out what recklessness is and
establishing that it is a high
threshold.</div><a name="06071424000550"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000887"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am no auditor or expert on auditing, but when
auditors do their job they might find a number of possible leads. They
will not know whether a lead that they find will necessarily produce a
problem, and I suppose that at some point they will have such a number
that they have to find a ratio or level at which they start asking
questions. There are only so many questions that they can ask. Given
what the Minister said, my concern is that it might be argued that an
auditor who does not follow every single lead is
reckless.</div><a name="06071424000551"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000888"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I do not think
so.</div><a name="06071424000552"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000889"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> You do not think
so?</div><a name="06071424000553"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000890"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I was just being courteous. The answer is no. Let
me repeat what I said; that is not difficult, as I have been reading my
brief, although I do understand the
issue.</div><a name="06071424000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">To prove that
an auditor had behaved recklessly, it would be necessary to show that
he had been aware that an action or failure to act&#151;much more
likely, a failure to act&#151;carried risks and that he had known
that the risks were not reasonable. That relates to the matrix of small
risks that was mentioned and the question whether an auditor would have
to follow up every lead. Clearly, it would not be reasonable to suggest
that he would.</div> <a name="06071424000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
failure would have to be fairly gross, involving a risk that a
reasonable person would think ought to be followed up. The auditor,
having apprised himself of the risk, would have to have gone ahead
without following it up. If he had made a conscious decision to go
ahead despite having turned his mind to the risk&#151;seen it and
acknowledged that it was not reasonable&#151;he would be guilty of
recklessness.</div><a name="06071424000556"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000891"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Minister answered my point in her final
words. It is important that the definition that she is using should
include the idea that the unreasonableness of the risk must be
subjectively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column723" />Column number: 724</div>known by the defendant. If that is the case, I do not think that there
will be the problems that people fear will arise from the
clause.</div><a name="06071424000557"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000892"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> If the risk was not required to be objective but
was subjectively linked to what was going on in the auditor&#146;s
mind, we would be reducing this to negligence because it would fall
short of a reasonable standard&#151;that is pretty well the
definition of negligence, which is not what we are talking about,
though we are considering the state of mind of the individual in
question, so we must consider how it appeared to him, as it were. That
is what juries frequently have to do. I hope that that is
satisfactory.</div>
<a name="06071424000558"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000893"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I fully appreciate what the Minister has said
and her clarification is helpful, but audits regularly come across a
particular invoice that has not been properly accounted for, purely
because there is always an element of human
error.</div><a name="06071424000559"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difficulty
for an auditor is how he would be expected to make a judgment between
what was almost certainly a human error, for which a reasonableness
test could apply, and something that could be not just an isolated
case, but symptomatic of an underlying problem. That is the reality of
how audits take
place.</div><a name="06071424000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the Minister&#146;s explanation that there will be this
reasonableness test, but in reality it is sometimes difficult to say,
hand on heart, &#147;That is definitely an isolated example of a
problem with an invoice, and I am certain of that.&#148; Often, that
is very likely to be true, but one can never be absolutely certain. An
audit can never test every single invoice; it can check only a
sample.</div><a name="06071424000561"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000894"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> If in the ordinary course of events such human
errors occur frequently, it does not sound as if they would be likely
to indicate an unreasonable risk that the auditor had acknowledged and
decided not to act on. If he was in any doubt, the safest thing would
be to check things through, and he would be in danger of being
negligent if he did not. The hon. Lady&#146;s scenario falls a long
way short of the offence.</div>
<a name="06071424000562"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot realistically deal
with every conceivable factual position. If, from the evidence, it was
realistic to suppose that an auditor was more than 50 per cent. likely
to be convicted of being reckless according to the test, that would be
a matter for a court to deal with. Otherwise, no action would be taken.
I cannot envisage every scenario, but the one suggested by the hon.
Lady does not sound as if it would fit the test. That is just my
view.</div><a name="06071424000563"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test is
fairly clear. The auditor would have to know that a failure to act
carried unreasonable risks and consciously decide to go ahead despite
that. The real point is that that is a long way above negligence. One
cannot be reckless inadvertently; a degree of consciousness has to be
proven. In criminal law, although not in the Bill, the phrasing is
usually that a person has to have &#147;directed their mind&#148;
to the risk&#151;become aware of it and its unreasonableness and
carried on
regardless.</div><a name="06071424000564"></a><div class="hs_Para">In another
place, it seems to me that the Government went further. My noble Friend
Lord Sainsbury said that the guidance to be issued under the clauses
would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column724" />Column number: 725</div>say that for a prosecution to be brought, there should be specific
evidence of recklessness, and that no one should seek to prosecute in
reliance on an inference of recklessness from hindsight, even when such
hindsight showed a judgment to be so wrong that it was not credible
that the auditor did not know the
risk.</div><a name="06071424000684"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.1

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000895"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Because of the obviously serious interest in how
recklessness is defined, I went to the Library and looked at
&#147;Archbold Criminal Pleadings&#148;, which is the criminal
lawyer&#146;s bible. I can confirm that the latest authority, the
Crown <i class="I">v.</i> G [2004] 1 appeal cases, deals with the point raised
about the subjectivity or objectivity of reasonableness. It was held in
that case</div><a name="06071424000662"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that a person
acts recklessly with respect to (i) a circumstance when he is aware of
a risk that it exists or will exist, and (ii) a result when he is aware
of a risk that it will
occur&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071424000568"></a><div class="hs_Para">this is
the important
point&#151;</div><a name="06071424000663"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and it is
in the circumstances known to him, unreasonable to take the
risk.&#148;</div><a name="06071424000569"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that that
is a subjective test is clear and conclusive. I will give a copy of
that ruling to anyone who wants it. I hope that I have dealt with the
meaning of recklessness. There is a sharp distinction between that and
negligence, and the levels of conduct that were being canvassed as
possibly getting unwitting auditors into
trouble.</div><a name="06071424000570"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider recklessness and dishonesty. In every day colloquial speech,
we would expect that someone who makes a false assertion without
knowing whether it was true or false was not being honest. In that
sense, we would describe as dishonest most actions that would be caught
by the new offence based on inter alia recklessness. In law, however,
dishonesty has a more developed meaning. It means acting for personal
gain to which one knows one is not entitled, and that is not an element
of recklessness.</div><a name="06071424000571"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
auditor who is reckless is most unlikely to be acting honestly, but we
do not believe that it should be necessary to show that the person was
motivated by the prospect of unfair personal advantage that would be
the effect if dishonesty had to be proven. That is recklessness as
opposed to dishonesty. I hope that I have put people&#146;s minds at
rest. Good auditors who behave honestly have nothing to fear from the
offence. If they genuinely believe what they are saying is true, that
they had made reasonable, honest judgments about risks and had
undertaken the appropriate level of work to assess them, they will not
have behaved recklessly and need not worry&#151;nor need they do any
more than comply with the standards of their
profession.</div><a name="06071424000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Knowingly
or recklessly&#148; is a well established phrase. It is referred to
many times in the Bill. It is used under the 1985 Act and it has not
had the chilling effect that the hon. Members for Grantham and Stamford
and for Putney suggested would be the consequences for the audit
profession. It has been in place since 1985, so such a suggestion does
not seem well founded. I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column725" />Column number: 726</div>already said that there are existing disciplinary procedures. Negligence
is a different case entirely from recklessness and anything under the
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Putney that was dishonest or
fraudulent would be caught by existing offences, so in that sense the
amendment is
redundant.</div><a name="06071424000573"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s other question was whether there was any need for such a
provision. It was a reaction not to a particular scandal but to major
worries that had been expressed about the integrity of auditors and the
need for effective sanctions to underpin matters. There are 700,000
audits carried out annually. Auditors are keen to do a good job and to
report what they find in a straightforward manner. However, there can
be pressures from directors, for example, to bend the truth in order to
conceal or minimise problems. If even a small percentage of such people
were tempted to give into pressure, there could be a significant number
of inaccurate audit reports. If the offence persuades even a small
number of auditors to resist temptation, it would have contributed to
improving standards of financial
reporting.</div><a name="06071424000574"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady did not refer to the question of misleading, which is the
substance of amendment No. 363, but she indicated to me privately that
she regards it as part and parcel of her argument. For the sake of
completeness, if the word &#147;misleading&#148; were removed, the
clause would not apply to material in the audit report that was
misleading and only to material that was false or inaccurate. The
auditor&#146;s report should not contain misleading
material&#151;material which may itself be true but which misleads
the reader because other material is left out. It is like the earlier
comment of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford about not doing
something&#151;not showing the full picture.</div>
<a name="06071424000575"></a><div class="hs_Para">If &#147;misleading&#148;
were deleted, the offence would no longer catch auditors who manage to
give the impression that there is no problem with the
accounts&#151;that there is nothing seriously wrong&#151;without
saying anything that is untrue. I am sure that the hon. Lady believes
as we do that it is important that shareholders and other readers of
the audit report should not be misled. If an auditor is concerned that
the audit report might be misleading, the remedy is to redraft it so
that it is clear. That would be an altogether positive change in
behaviour. There is no justification for departing from the normal
phrase, which includes &#147;misleading&#148;. It is used elsewhere
in the Bill and in the 1985
Act.</div><a name="06071424000576"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have dealt with everyone&#146;s concerns. If I have not, I am sure
that they will tell me, but I respectfully suggest that the amendments
are not necessary and that the Bill includes the high threshold that
the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford
sought.</div><a name="06071424000577"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000896"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> It has been useful to get further clarification
from the Minister on what the offence will mean in practice. There was
a great deal of uncertainty when the clause was debated in the other
place, so it has been helpful to discuss a little more practically how
the concepts will work in reality. The debate has given me some
confidence that there has been some genuine thought about the
practicalities of the offence in relation to conducting
audits.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000902"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The amendments would ensure that future changes
in regulations are subject to the affirmative rather than the negative
procedure. They affect two clauses. First, clause 525 provides for the
terms of a liability limitation agreement and specifically for the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers going forward. It says:</div>
<a name="06071424000664"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State
may by
regulations&#151;</div><a name="06071424000665"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
require liability limitation agreements to contain specified provisions
or provisions of a specified
description;</div><a name="06071424000666"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
prohibit liability limitation agreements from containing specified
provisions or provisions of a specified
description.&#148;</div><a name="06071424000596"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the legislation is new, we should ensure that as it beds in, the House
has ample opportunity to debate any changes. It remains to be seen
exactly how the liability limitation agreements will work in practice,
and to give new regulations and powers to the Secretary of State via
the negative procedure is not that helpful.</div>
<a name="06071424000597"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would give the House much
more comfort if we knew that we could fully debate any changes to that
aspect of the law. There has been some debate outside the House about
the new concept of a limited liability agreement, and it would reassure
the business community if we could debate any contentious changes
within the House.</div>
<a name="06071424000598"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, clause 528 is
concerned with a company&#146;s disclosure that it has entered into a
limited liability agreement. It relates to amendment No. 372, and any
change should also be subject to the affirmative resolution. The
provision is important and welcome, but we must be careful to ensure
that it is fully debated, because it is fundamental to the relationship
between company directors and the auditors that they employ to help
audit their
accounts.</div><a name="06071424000686"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
<a name="06071424000599"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000903"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The power in clause 525 that the hon. Lady has
described was introduced on Report in another place as part of a series
of amendments to meet concerns expressed about the original wording.
The Opposition warmly welcomed the amendments, and included special
mention of the new power, but no one proposed that it should be subject
to the affirmative procedure. Clause 525 was disclosed to the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, and it, too, did not suggest
the affirmative
procedure.</div><a name="06071424000600"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
528 is altogether simpler. It provides that a company with a liability
limitation agreement with its auditor must disclose it in a way
specified by regulations. The regulations will specify exactly what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column728" />Column number: 729</div>information must be disclosed and whether it should appear in the
accounts, in the directors&#146; report or
elsewhere.</div><a name="06071424000601"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chapter
sets out clearly all the important features of the change in the law on
auditors&#146; liability, and the two powers are available only for
filling in certain details. Again, the power in clause 521, which was
included in the Bill on its introduction, was included in the
memorandum to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in
another place. The Committee saw no problem with the negative
procedure, and I should think not, bearing in mind the scale of the
matter and the need to apply parliamentary time to rather more major
things. I invite the hon. Lady to consider that there is no need for
the
amendment.</div><a name="06071424000602"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000904"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> That is a helpful clarification. I take on board
the Minister&#146;s comments, but just because other people have not
raised the issue does not indicate that it is not an issue. However, I

assurance in other places. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

642</h4><a name="06071424000033"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">The
Panel</div><a name="06071424000606"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the

<a name="06071424000607"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000905"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to part 24, which deals with
takeovers. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Putney on her
first foray on the Front Bench. I think that we will hear a lot more of
her from the Front Bench in due course; she was remarkably competent
and polished.</div><a name="06071424000608"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 24
was the subject of significant debate in the other place. In Lords
Grand Committee, Lord Goldsmith spent some time explaining the reasons
for the statutory codification of the takeover panel&#146;s
rule-making power. Lord Hodgson and Lady Noakes gave the provisions no
little attention, and many amendments were considered.</div>
<a name="06071424000609"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I do not propose a
total rerun of the Lords debates, although I recognise at the outset
that City lawyers and many others still have concerns that the act of
codification will lead to more court cases and precedents and that
aspects of the European directives still remain unclear. We wish to
cover some areas, albeit in a more directed and limited way than in the
other place.</div><a name="06071424000610"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes confirm that the Bill will not affect the
availability of judicial review by the courts. In the 1987 Datafin
case, the Court of Appeal concluded that the courts could limit
themselves only to reviewing the panel&#146;s decision-making process
after the bid has been concluded. Does the Minister consider that the
Bill&#146;s provisions will lead to further restriction of the
grounds for judicial review?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column729" />Column number: 730</div><a name="06071424000611"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, there was a discrepancy
between the timing of the Bill and the need for the provisions, which
resulted in the provisions being introduced by statutory instrument.
Can the Minister confirm that no implementation problems that we should
consider have arisen since the
order?</div><a name="06071424000612"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that the
substantial acquisitions rules have now been abolished by the panel.
That seems to have been generally well received. Will the Minister
confirm that that is
so?</div><a name="06071424000613"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071424000906"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Clause 642 confers regulatory functions laid down
in the remainder of part 24, deals with the Panel on Takeovers and
Mergers, and is a key part of the proposed package to implement the
European directive on takeover bids that requires the Government, among
other things, to designate a body competent to supervise
takeovers.</div><a name="06071424000614"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since 1968,
takeover regulation in the UK has been overseen by the panel
administering the rules contained in the non-statutory City code on
takeovers and mergers. The Bill will place the regulatory activity
panel within a statutory framework for the first time. The Government
recognise the considerable strengths of the existing system of takeover
regulations which is overseen by the panel, including its flexibility,
speed and certainty in decision making, the independence of the
regulatory autonomy of the panel, and the professional expertise of
business and City participants that the panel is able to harness in
undertaking its regulatory
functions.</div><a name="06071424000615"></a><div class="hs_Para">A key
objective of the Government in implementing the takeover directive has
been to preserve those strengths. The City has welcomed that. The
regulatory functions conferred on the panel under part 24 are designed
to cover broadly those matters for which the panel has historically had
regulatory responsibility, including takeovers of companies whose
shares are traded on a regulated market, as required by the takeovers
directive. It goes wider, too, and includes takeovers of other public
and former public companies and certain other types of corporate
restructuring transactions, such as mergers. That approach will
preserve the single regime for non-directive-related takeovers that
receive support from the
City.</div><a name="06071424000616"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consistent with
the implementation objective maintaining the regulatory independence of
the panel, the clause does not deal in substance with the
panel&#146;s constitution and internal arrangements. The panel will
be able, as it does now, to delegate functions to committees, members
of staff and so forth. The panel will remain an unincorporated body as
constituted from time to time and, as such, will have rights and
obligations under common law that are supplemented by specific
provisions in the
Bill.</div><a name="06071424000617"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not aware
of any problems arising since the implementation of the interim regime
in May 2006. Will there be more judicial reviews? The Bill is not
supposed to change, limit or alter the position regarding judicial
reviews, and substantial acquisition rules have been
abolished.</div><a name="06071424000618"></a>
