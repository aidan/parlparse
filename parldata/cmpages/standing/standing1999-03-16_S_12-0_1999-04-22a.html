<H5>4.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B>  On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. I should explain to the Committee that I will respond to an Adjournment debate in the House later this evening. I should like to deal with certain amendments that have been tabled but I may not be in a position to respond to some Members' arguments and it may seem as if I am being discourteous to them. I thought that I should make that clear, and I hope that no one objects if I begin by dealing with certain amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton, may I say how much we will miss the Minister when he leaves? We have very much enjoyed his contributions. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not sure whether that is a point of order, but I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): On a point of order, Mr. Maxton, the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department, the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) is most courteous. I will not make political capital out of his point of order. However, the fact that he may doze off is a different matter. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a different point of order. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Yes, it is a different point of order. 
<P>
I am a bit rusty on procedural matters, Mr. Maxton, and need your direction. Going through the matters that we discussed yesterday and today, it is clear that there is potential for new clauses to be tabled. Those clauses would deal with some of the measures that we have already discussed. 
<P>
Is it in order to table clauses on subjects that we have already touched on and can they be debated? I cannot remember the procedures, Mr. Maxton. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It makes no difference. The right hon. Gentleman is entitled to table a new clause. Provided that such a clause is in order and relates to the Bill, it may be selected, although I obviously cannot make any promises about that. However, the right hon. Gentleman may wish to bear in mind the tabling of new clauses in Committee and on Report. 
<H4><center>Clause 21 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Procedure </center></H4>
<P>
 Question proposed [this day]: That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
Question again proposed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): Refreshed by lunch, I shall keep my remarks brief. I wish to raise a new point relating to the interaction of civil and criminal proceedings. 
<P>
One of my early constituency cases involved a young man who was arrested and was told that if he pleaded guilty, he would be released on bail. He therefore agreed that he was guilty. However, he came to see me and, when I asked whether he was guilty, he replied: "Not at all." I therefore said that he should change his plea. 
<P>
That young man pleaded guilty to avoid custody. So there is a risk that if a vehicle is impounded on a criminal charge, the carrier may plead guilty to get his vehicle released. In relation to penalties, a carrier can go to the courts to challenge an order for impounding or detaining a vehicle. 
<P>
I am worried by the interaction with criminal proceedings. Someone may find it easier to plead guilty to a small criminal charge as the penalty is likely to be lower than the £2,000 penalty for bringing in a clandestine entrant by avoiding the immigration service. 
<P>
I do not expect the Minister to give a detailed response to that matter, as I did not give him notice of it. However, civil and criminal procedures--and their possible ramifications--need to be considered. I will not give other illustrations of my point, but I should be grateful if the Minister would pay attention to it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> This morning, the Minister gave one of his best replies ever to our debates. In the clause stand part debate, he resorted to his innate nice-guyness behind his nice--guy image and the debate was the best that we have had. I do not wish to be out of order, but I sincerely wish to thank the Minister for responding genuinely to the points that I raised. 
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> Tributes are starting to flow, so the end of my career is obviously nigh. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) asked whether penalty notices would be cancelled or not proceeded with. If there is no liability, they can be cancelled when a person puts in a proper defence. If, for some reason, discretion is exercised not to enforce them, they may not be proceeded with. A letter to that effect will be sent. If the clandestine is not in a vehicle, that point will be dealt with in a court case or as a result of the representations being made. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that someone might plead guilty to a criminal charge rather accept a civil penalty. Given that the criminal penalties for facilitation are extremely serious and involve imprisonment, I suspect that most people would not be disposed to take that course of action. They might fear that a £2,000 fine would seriously affect their business, but they would probably be more afraid of the prospect of spending  961 962 seven years in prison. I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's point, and I shall write to let him know whether I think that there are any serious grounds for his fears. I suspect that there are not. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 21, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. Clause 22 Power to detain vehicles etc. in connection with penalties under section 18 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 199 in page 16, line 6, leave out "a significant" and insert "an obvious and substantial". 
<P>
We have moved on to the next clause, which deals with an important new feature of the same subject. Before lunch, I described the clause as the sting in the tail. It contains the power to detain vehicles after the issuing of a penalty notice. 
<P>
In its written evidence, the road haulage industry told us that it was concerned by the proposals and, interestingly, those concerns coincide with those of human rights organisations. Justice says that it is not impressed by the fact that detention can subsequently be challenged in court 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"given the serious prejudice that will have already occurred... and the fact that the court cannot provide any remedy for any losses sustained as a result of the transporter's seizure."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 16 March 1999; c. 64.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We therefore need to consider carefully the circumstances under which detention--or as Justice describes it "seizure"--can take place. The amendment deals with those circumstances, so, in that context, it would be helpful to know whether the Minister thinks that penalty notices will normally be given soon after an alleged illegal entry comes to light. 
<P>
Once the penalty notice has been given, under clause 22(1) 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a senior officer may detain any relevant-- 
<P>
(a) vehicle 
<P>
(b) small ship, or 
<P>
(c) or aircraft, 
<P>
until all penalties . . . have been paid."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 That would be a serious step to take. 
<P>
Subsection (2) relates to the conditions that must be fulfilled before the power can be exercised. According to paragraph (a), it can be exercised 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if, in the opinion of the senior officer concerned, there is a significant risk that the penalty . . . will not be paid before the end of the prescribed period if the transporter is not detained".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection 2(b) states that the power 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may not be exercised if alternative security which the Secretary of State considers is satisfactory, has been given."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The subsection concerns me. Smaller operators are more likely to come within its provisions because a larger operator is more likely to be able to provide alternative security if he wants to get his vehicle back after it has been served with a penalty notice and detained. In that case, he has a let-out under subsection (2)(b): if he can provide alternative security he can get his vehicle back. It is mainly the small operators who will be concerned about the proposal because they may not be able to give alternative security. 
<P>
The power in paragraph (a) can be exercised 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if, in the opinion of the senior officer . . . there is a significant risk".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would replace the word "significant" with the phrase "obvious and substantial". We tabled the amendment to discover how high, or significant, a risk of the penalty not being paid the Minister thinks there should be before a senior officer detains the vehicle. The issue should be debated because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), said, it is a serious step. For many operators, large and small, the fact that their vehicle has been detained will concentrate their minds; they will be worried only about getting the vehicle back so that they can continue to earn their living. 
<P>
I described the power to detain as a sting in the tail if it was not operated fairly. We debated at length the procedures and the steps to be taken to dispute them, but if someone's lorry is detained, or seized, as Justice put it, in practice it will short-circuit much of what we described. 
<P>
This is an important subject and we look forward to the Minister of State's reply. He will want to emulate the eloquence and helpfulness of his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If I say that the amendment is significant I do not want the Committee to think that we attach as low a threshold to its importance as the Government may attach to "significant" in line 6, page 16. 
<P>
The use of the word "significant" imposes too low a potential threshold on the judgment of the senior immigration officer in determining whether to exercise the power, which can be exercised if in the opinion of the senior officer there is a significant risk. How will that senior officer determine what constitutes a significant risk that the penalty will not be paid? What evidence must he have before he comes to that conclusion? Will it be that he does not like the look of the operator, or thinks that he is a fly-by-night or not within the British jurisdiction--I think that that is the term we must use, rather than saying that he might be a foreigner who may abscond or not pay? Will the officer take into account criteria that may be dependent on the size of the firm or of the vehicle? If the vehicle is part of a big fleet he may conclude that there is no problem because it belongs to a company of substance or a man of means and thus there is little risk. 
<P>
What does the Minister think should be at the back of the senior immigration officer's mind when he exercises his opinion and concludes that there is a significant risk? Given the serious harm that could be inflicted on 963 964 businesses by detaining a vehicle, a senior officer must be able to substantiate his belief and show that his decision is not prejudiced or arbitrary. 
<P>
The Minister will say that immigration officers would not take an arbitrary or prejudiced decision, but should not the same rules apply to those officers as apply to police officers operating stop and search under the various codes of practice whereby officers are not allowed to stop a person simply because he dresses in a certain way or looks like others whom they have stopped. They should not stop people because they are young, wear an earring or are of a certain colour, creed or nationality on the prejudiced assumption that they may be criminals just because that was the case with others of similar appearance whom they stopped. How are we to ensure that immigration officers, who have the best of intentions and are not bigoted, biased, racist or prejudiced but have stopped young guys in trucks or in a certain type of vehicle that they think is the sort usually, habitually or traditionally used for the trade in clandestines, will not automatically assume that a person of a certain disposition, type or character driving such a vehicle who in his view looks a bit dodgy is the sort who is not going to pay his fine? 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
If immigration officers think that there is a significant risk of a fine not being paid, it is inevitable that those about whom they form that opinion will be from a small company which may not have the means to pay or which they regard as a fly-by-night firm. I fear that many genuine innocent companies which happen to be small beer will get caught under this catch-all on the premise that a small company is likely to abscond and not pay. I have not checked with my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere yet but I do not think that Opposition Members are asking to see a code of practice at this stage. However, I hope that the Minister will be able to assure me that there will be some internal guidance--a sort of mini-equivalent of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act codes of practice for immigration officers--to point out that immigration officers should not let the Eddie Stobarts of this world through automatically because they are big guys who are bound not to pay and who have a lot of lawyers to "sort you out if you try and impound Ellie May" or any other of Eddie Stobart's trucks, while seeing the small guys, who perhaps do not have legal means behind them, as fair game for stopping. I assume that the immigration service would want to operate in that way in any event--indeed, I would be appalled and surprised if immigration officers came to any other conclusion--but I would like reassurance that some internal guidelines or code will be available. 
<P>
The exercise of discretion by a senior officer may amount to confiscation of the property of a third party; a driver may not, of course, be the owner of the vehicle. Some of my hon. Friends may wish to refer to the point made by the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association in their briefings so, for the sake of brevity, I will not rehearse the argument. However, a serious problem remains. It is all very well for an immigration officer to conclude that he does not like the look of a driver--by that I mean all aspects such as his financial means, his arguments and so on, but if he judges that the driver may not be a man of means, or may not pay, and he decides to detain the vehicle, he may be detaining a vehicle belonging to someone else, and that could be very unfair and arbitrary, and perhaps seriously damaging to a business. 
<P>
Where a driver is the owner of a detained vehicle, his livelihood could be lost immediately. The Minister will say that, in theory, he could apply to the courts but, in practice, a driver might not be able to afford to contest the penalty. This point was made in an early evidence sittings by, I believe, the lady from Justice. Also, a driver may suffer because of the cost of a court case. I should like an assurance that there could be either a speedy application to the courts or, preferably, that in reaching the opinion that there is a serious risk, the immigration service will also take account of the damage that might be done to the business and of the fact that companies could be put out of business if an officer comes to a wrong conclusion. 
<P>
The RHA and the FTA support a fast and effective appeal procedure. I back that view entirely. It is essential that disruption to business should be minimal. What we heard this morning about the £2,000 penalty did not reassure me that the procedure will be as fast as we should like. In later debates on the clauses relating to detention and the threat of detention, we should like assurances that the appeal procedure can be very rapid indeed, because jobs depend on it. 
<P>
Although I need not make any political points at this stage, I do say that if, in taking these powers to detain vehicles, the Government end up destroying small businesses and jobs it will be a black day for the economy. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend is coming to an  important point. He is being more than fair to the  Government, because he assumes that the code of  practice will define an effective system in every case.  However, the Government have not yet said that.  Perhaps, in some cases, the code of practice will not  describe an effective system. Therefore, lorry drivers  will have to rely on litigation, because they will have no  other defence.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend is right in relation to  our mitigation amendment. Although we did not vote on  it, there seemed to be widespread agreement with our  proposal. In the early hours of the morning I saw many  heads, including that of the Minister of State, Lord  Chancellor's Department, nodding, so I assumed that the  Committee agreed with our view that the code of practice  could not cover all the possible circumstances involving  road transport.  923 924  
<P>
With the agreement of air operators, it would be  possible to draw up a code a practice that would probably  cover every eventuality in air and freight transport. It  may be possible for shipping, too. However, tens of  thousands of vehicles might be caught, and they include  not only standard HGV lorries, but 32-tonners,  38-tonners and refrigerated vehicles: there will be  hundreds of thousands of permutations of different sorts  of transport. There was an understanding, or at least an  acceptance by the Committee, that the code of practice  would not cover all the eventualities. The Minister's  officials, rightly and properly as good officials of the  state, will have to make subjective judgments about  whether an offence has been committed and about the  nature of that offence. Under clause 21, they must state  their reasons for deciding that Mr. P is liable to the  penalty, or penalties. They will have to invent reasons.  The Minister may say, "We will make it like a health and  safety at work check or a Health and Safety Executive  check of offices, shops, railway premises or factories,  with offences being listed and boxes being ticked for  relevant offences." Nevertheless, officials will make a  subjective judgment.  
<P>
<H5>9.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I put it to the Committee that if these officials are  capable of judging whether people have committed an  offence and if the same officials, who will be judge and  jury, can decide that a person is indeed guilty of the  offence, they will also be able to judge that there were  mitigating circumstances that would merit some  reduction in the penalty.  
<P>
We have not included in the amendment details of how  a sliding scale could operate. They may form one of the  new clauses that I am currently drafting. I feel sure that  we can devise a system that would make it simple in  practice. It does not have to be a sliding scale of 1,999  increments between £1 and £2,000. It may not be  perfectly fair, so I prefer to leave it to the unfettered  discretion of the immigration officials operating our  amendment No. 197, especially (8D), to fix any level of  penalties between £1 and £2,000 in each case, or between  £1 and £200,000, depending on the number of  clandestines caught. But I am sure that we can reach an  arrangement for perhaps a scale of charges of £500,  £1,000 and £1,500. I admit that magistrates courts will  not have unfettered discretion. However, there is also a  scale of penalties related to the seriousness of the crimes.  We merely suggest that there should be a scale of  penalties, and that part of a penalty might be mitigated  depending on the culpability of the person who has been  charged with the offence.  
<P>
I cannot imagine how the Minister could reject that  principle. He may of course reply that the Opposition  have not worked out the detail. In nine years as a Minister  sitting over there--  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Too long.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I hear the Minister say "Too long." I  remember listening then Opposition Members say "It's  not our job to work out the details. This is a probing  amendment to test the principle and to hear what the Government have to say." We are now doing the same.  This is a probing amendment to test the principle of  allowing a plea in mitigation.  
<P>
I mentioned health and safety as an example but there  will be others. In our debates on the defences, we quoted  numerous examples of where a lorry driver in particular  may be forced into carrying clandestines against his will.  My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere explained  that the legal concept is tightly confined. There will  therefore be numerous examples of operators saying to  officials, "I was acting under duress. They threatened  me" and officials saying, "Ah, but the threats were not  potent enough to qualify as duress, so your defence has  failed." It has to be a serious lifethreatening threat to  count as duress. We have covered that ground. However,  if the defence fails there was not sufficient duress to  satisfy the legal requirements of clause 20(2), the lorry  driver will not be entitled to make any plea in mitigation.  
<P>
In those circumstances, the Minister's officials  representing the Secretary of State will say to operators,  "Yes, you thought your life was threatened. Yes, you  were acting under some duress, but unfortunately,  chummy, the duress was not enough to satisfy the strict  legal requirements of the law. You thought you were  going to be blown up by these people, but that was not  enough of a threat; so I am sorry but you have no defence.  And by the way, because your defence failed, you are  now liable for the full maximum penalty--no mitigation,  no reduction.  
<P>
That is what the Minister is telling use. That is the  situation that will obtain if he rejects amendment No.  197--or another version, which could be cleaned up and  polished by the Minister if he put his mind to it. No  matter how the operator acted--out of humanity, for  reasons of the health and safety of the people that he  discovered, or under duress--that is not enough to  satisfy the strict legal requirements. If his defence has not  worked under clause 20, because it is not technically  good enough to satisfy the Minister or the non-existent  code of practice, as it is at the moment, nothing will be  allowed in mitigation.  
<P>
I wish to conclude my remarks by asking Government  Members to reflect on that. They may say that an  Opposition politician is talking so why should they  care--Opposition politicians are bound to say that.  However, unless the Minister tells me that I have the  situation totally wrong, I would ask Government  Members to reflect carefully on what they are putting  into the Bill.  
<P>
Of course, in any Bill that passes through the House,  politics are always involved, but if Government  Members reject amendment No. 197, they will be telling  people who have been caught carrying  clandestines--even though they may have reported it to  the authorities out of the best motives of humanity in that  they thought that their lives were at risk--that they have  no defence on grounds of health and safety and so they  will be subject to the full maximum penalty of the law   925 926  [Mr. Maclean]  
<P>
without a single £1 off. That is their reward for acting in  the best interest of the Government by reporting the  circumstances and trying to save lives. That is precisely  what Government Members will be voting for unless  they support the principle of amendment No. 197.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> You looked at me, Mrs. Roe, as if  I ought to reply. However, in all the nine years in which  the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border was a  Minister, I doubt whether he heard a speech from a Back  Bencher that made so many points that had been  raised--and dealt with by the Minister before. There is  no need for me to reply to that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Once again, it is a pleasure to see you  in the Chair this morning, Mrs. Roe.  
<P>
In all the excitement, it may have escaped the  Minister's attention that he owes the Committee a reply  not just to my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith  and The Border but to others who spoke before him, so  let me remind the Minister of the important points to  which the road haulage industry wants answers.  
<P>
I am not going to press the Minister on amendment  No. 195, which relates to the period of notice. However,  amendment No. 197 raises many important issues and  the Minister owes the Committee a better reply than the  one that he has just given. We need to know whether the  imposition of a penalty will take into account the  circumstances of the offence. I have already raised that  matter, as has the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam  (Mr. Allan).  
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that the provisions give no  scope for relieving the penalty for someone who  commits the offence on strong humanitarian or other  grounds which would usually be recognised by the courts  as mitigating circumstances in other types of case? The  Minister owes the Committee a reply on that matter, so  that lorry drivers know where they stand when they are  faced with invidious situations in which they may feel a  moral call to take humanitarian action, but in which they  know that there is no way out in relation to the penalty.  
<P>
I have only three or four more Questions. In light of the  Minister's intervention on my right hon. Friend the  Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), I  will ask about carriers' liability. The Minister's gist was  that, as the existing carriers, liability regime does not  make provision for mitigating circumstances, the new  regime should not have to make provision for such  circumstances.  
<P>
The Minister was wise to heed my warning that I  would remind him of what the Labour party said in  opposition when carriers' liability was introduced, if he  said that since the Conservatives introduced carriers'  liability we should not criticise it now. I will not go over  that ground again.  
<P>
However, we need reassurance that the Minister has  taken into account the fact that the Bill makes provision  for a different form of carriers' liability and that a  different type of people will be subject to that liability.  We are not talking about scheduled airlines--such as  British Airways or Virgin--or P and O ferries, but a wide  range of lorry firms and others covered by the measure's  wide net. Some lorry firms covered by the measure are  big, such as Eddie Stobart, but smaller firms and even  driver-owners travelling to and from the continent are  also covered by it.  
<P>
Although hard to believe, it is possible for large  numbers of clandestine entrants to stow away in a single  lorry. We have heard about various cases in which that  has happened: for example, 103 illegal entrants were  found in one lorry.  
<P>
Such an incident would not occur on a scheduled  airline service. Does the Minister seriously believe that  over 100 undocumented passengers would get away with  such action? Would that number of people all be  queueing to get on an airplane, all of them with the same  mistake in their documents, or the same lack of  documentation? That would be a pretty extreme  situation.  
<P>
The case of lorry firms is quite different. In an extreme  case, a penalty of £20,000 or £30,000 imposed on an  owner-driver firm could make a massive difference to  that firm. will provision be made to take account of the  impact of the measure on different types of people  affected by it?  
<P>
Before the Committee adjourned for lunch on  Tuesday, the Minister told us that mitigation is not  needed in the measure because defence is provided for in  clause 20. The Minister knows that that runs counter to  what normally applies in the criminal courts. As we have  already heard, lorry drivers are being subjected to a far  more stringent regime than that which applies in criminal  law. They are being treated worse and have fewer  safeguards than defendants in criminal trials. That is  invidious.  
<P>
Furthermore, unlike those defending people in  criminal cases, lorry drivers' lawyers will not be able  argue for grounds of mitigation, however big the effect  on the lorry firm.  
<P>
I do not want to go back over old ground on the code of  practice. However, what happens in cases not covered by  such a code? Some might say that that constitutes  mitigating circumstances which could be put before a  tribunal. Will every vehicle in which clandestine entrants  might enter the country be covered by a code of practice,  which will specify an effective system? The Minister  looks weary, but he was not present when we debated the  code of practice earlier, and we were thus unable to hear  his explanation. The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's  Department provided a good explanation. However,  perhaps the Minister will impart to us any fresh thoughts  on the code of practice, for which he is responsible. He  conducted all the negotiations on it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): What has that got to  do with the amendments?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My comments are relevant to the  amendments. The Minister claimed that the amendments  were unnecessary because the clause provided for a  defence. Will that defence be available in every case? If  not, the Bill should provide for mitigating factors. Lorry  drivers want to know about that.  927 928

<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): Has my hon. Friend considered circumstances in which  someone receives a penalty notice, faces further prosecution, is cleared by the court, but,  despite that, has to pay the amount specified in the penalty notice, which requires less proof?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, which the Minister may want to  tackle.  
<P>
I shall give a brief example to show that my comments are relevant to the amendments. Let  us consider the position of a lorry driver who finds an alleged clandestine entrant in his  vehicle. What if no code of practice specifies an effective system that covers his vehicle? He  cannot avail himself of proposed new section 21(8C) because he will not be able to rely on the  code of practice. The Government rejected the amendments that would have introduced  flexibility. They have only themselves to blame for their predicament. 
<P>
Lorry drivers have to have regard to the code of practice. But what if the code of practice  does not cover a lorry driver's circumstances and does not specify an effective system for his  vehicle? What will he do? He must show that he has used an effective system, but the code of  practice does not specify such a system for his lorry. It appears that he will be deprived of any  defence and that he will not be able to show mitigating circumstances by specifying any  measures that he took because they are not mentioned in the code of practice. The Minister  will say, "Sorry, chum, they're not mentioned in the code of practice so you have no defence  and we can't take account of any mitigating circumstances. You're liable to a £2,000 fine."  Lorry drivers want to know what to do. Like us, they have been kept in the dark about the  contents of the code of practice.  
<P>
Will the code of practice cover all systems for all lorries? We heard about the curtain-sided  tilt truck, but what about other lorries and vehicles to which the penalty applies? I do not  know whether the Minister was present early on Wednesday morning when the Minister of  State, Lord Chancellor's Department said that a vehicle was defined according to ordinary  common sense. What about vehicle owners apart from lorry drivers? The Minister owes lorry  drivers and the Committee a better explanation. Lorry drivers will ask us why we did not ask  questions, and we will have to say that we asked them, but the Minister did not answer.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The concept of mitigation does not need to be imported into the  provision. We are considering a civil penalty for bringing in clandestines. It is not a  maximum penalty. There is no logic or justice in officials making judgments about  mitigation. A lorry driver who acts humanely does not need to bring in anyone clandestinely  and the penalty will not apply. There will always be a discretion not to pursue a penalty in  exceptional circumstances. Opposition Members are raising the issue in an attempt to  undermine our tough policy on clandestines. That is not acceptable. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the 103 clandestines and calculated that the potential fine  would be £200,000. It seems that £6,000 has slipped off the potential fine, as it would be  £206,000. The taxpayer might have been faced with a much greater burden, but the  Opposition expressed no concern about the pressure and the cost to the taxpayer, or about the  fact that racketeers are involved in an utterly unacceptable trade in people. The strategy is to  impose a tough penalty to deter those who are tempted to co-operate with racketeers. The  amendment would undermine that strategy.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked me whether persons could use the defence if the  system envisaged in the code were not in place. It would be for them to prove the defence that  there was an effective procedure in place.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): I shall be careful to keep in order. Can I ask the  Minister if he is talking about drivers who knew they had a clandestine entrant? It is possible  that the penalty might be imposed in a case where the driver did not know? The officer  involved or the Secretary of State might believe that the driver could have known but we  should not assume that in all these cases the driver knew.  
<P>
The Minister raised the matter of racketeering, saying that if there were clear evidence of  racketeering, there would probably be a criminal action; if there were no criminal action, he  would not ask for the maximum penalty--the only penalty--to be imposed. The Minister can  envisage cases in which, although someone might possibly be liable, no charge is laid, and  cases in which a charge should properly be laid. Is he seriously suggesting that there is  nothing in between? In other parts of the Bill we have considered ways of allowing a penalty  between the maximum and the minimum. The minimum is nothing, the maximum is a charge  and the real question is whether there are any circumstances in which the penalty should be  less than the maximum, but more than the minimum. If there are no such circumstances, and  in some cases there is no charge, and there is nothing in between, there will be less of a  deterrent, and deterrence is what the clause is about.  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked me about circumstances in which a lorry driver  knew, and those in which he did not know. If a lorry driver knows, he can inform the  immigration service using a special telephone number. We do not intend a lorry driver to be  able to evade a penalty for knowingly carrying a clandestine; we may consider issues raised  in earlier debates.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the lorry driver who has humanitarian concerns. If he  does not know about a clandestine, it is difficult to argue for mitigation on humanitarian  grounds. In respect of the amendment, therefore, the issue does not arise.  
<P>
We propose a clear, civil penalty; mitigation and intention do not need to be incorporated  into such a straightforward system. The amendment would complicate it and make it more  difficult for the lorry driver. We want a clear, firm, tough message to go out to anyone  considering carrying a clandestine, or thinking of not checking his load for clandestines that if  he is caught he is likely to pay a civil penalty.  929 930  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister may now be regretting  not having accepted our amendment on the code of  practice. Under clause 20(4) to determine whether a  system is effective,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"regard is to be had"
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
to the code of practice. We suggested that "may" would  be better than "is" but our amendment was rejected.  What about the case where no effective system for that  type of vehicle is mentioned in the code of practice?  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The code of practice is not the only  factor that will be considered in assessing the merits of  the proposed defence. It will have to be taken into  account when assessing a defence, but other factors  raised by the driver or owner can also be taken into  account in determining whether there is an effective  system. It is as simple as that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate the Minister giving way  repeatedly as this is an important point. He is now  re-writing clause 20 (3)--[Interruption.] I do not know  whether there is a contribution coming from the other  side. I shall try to finish although I am getting shouted  down from some quarters but I think that lorry drivers  will want to hear the answer.  
<P>
Clause 20(3)(b) says that there has to be  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an effective system for preventing the carriage of clandestine  entrants".
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Under subsection 4 in determining whether a particular  system is effective  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"regard is to be had to any code of practice".
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
What if the code of practice does not mention that type of  system? Only one conclusion can be drawn.  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has clearly not  listened to the point I made which is very simple. The  legislation amply covers these circumstances. Regard  will be had to the code of practice but other factors may  also be taken into account and therefore it is quite  possible for a defence to be brought forward under the  terms of that clause. Each of the limbs of clause 20(3) can  be used as a defence by the lorry driver. If regard is to be  had to the code in determining the effectiveness of the  system and if he can show that there is an effective  system those factors will no doubt be taken into account  by any court that has to adjudicate on this or by any  official who has to examine it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In the light of that response the  Minister may be regretting that he did not listen more  closely to the careful arguments we put forward about the  code of practice in the early hours of Wednesday  morning that it was better if it was said that regard "may  be had" to a code of practice rather than "is to be had".  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have  no regrets. Our position is clear. We have drafted the  clause in a way that amply expresses our view about how  this will operate. If the hon. Gentleman simply reads the  clause and the fact that subsection (4) says that  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"regard is to be had",
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
it simply means that that is a factor that will be taken into  account. We do not need to change it. It is clear to anyone  who reads it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> We can always tell if the Minister is on  weak ground when he goes into the political rhetoric that  if the Opposition persist with the amendment it will  permit racketeering and widespread flouting of  immigration laws. The Minister knows that that is  absolute nonsense and that the entire Committee is  totally opposed to racketeering and the trade in human  lives in which some people are engaged.  
<P>
If he believes that the provisions here and the £2,000  penalty are the only mechanisms he needs to deal with  racketeering, I look forward to seeing other new clauses  which we will happily support which will impose more  draconian penalties on those who are proved to be guilty  of a regular or one-off trade in racketeering and moving  people around Europe or bringing clandestines into this  country. In those circumstances we are quite happy to see  much stiffer penalties than £2,000 such as imprisonment  and the confiscation of vehicles.  
<P>
The Minister would have the Opposition's full support  for a proper clause dealing with deliberate racketeering  or however it may be described. However, he refused our  request to allow a plea of mitigating circumstances  when, for health and safety reasons, a lorry driver makes  a decision to save the life of someone he discovers in his  vehicle. Even when he has carried out some of the  systems in clause 20 or believed he was acting under  duress, or was under duress but not sufficiently tough  duress to satisfy the law in those circumstances he will  get a £2,000 fine and no mitigation.  
<P>
<H5>9.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister has rejected our amendment this  morning and refused to justify why he will not accept it. I  find that quite unacceptable. I shall not repeat the  arguments again, but if the Minister behaves with this  arrogance this evening and refuses to answer a legitimate  point, the arguments will be repeated by my hon.  Friends, albeit not to the point where we upset you by  being too tedious and repetitious, Mrs. Roe. It is not good  enough for the Minister to say that he gave an answer  yesterday and that he will not deal with the points today.  
<P>
Serious issues are involved. This started off as an  innocuous little amendment making a point in  mitigation. I expected the Minister at least to reflect on it  and acknowledge that it makes a good point or produce  good arguments as to why it could not be done, but his  reply that it was a civil penalty and that he did not want to  corrupt the concept of a straightforward civil penalty of a  flat £2,000, whether or not good defences were produced  and that no matter what the circumstances no pleas in  mitigation will be allowed as it could complicate the  simplicity of the system, was outrageous.  
<P>
The Minister seems to suggest that civil penalties are  harmless little things, but they are worse than penalties  imposed by a magistrates court because there is no judge  or jury. It is simply an official of the state acting as judge  and jury. That is why in the case of civil penalties, despite  those lovely innocuous words, proper defences need to   931 932  
<P>
be built in. If we pass the stage of the defences, we need  to allow pleas in mitigation. I hope that my hon. Friend  will not let the Minister off with the inadequacy of his  answer this morning.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Is not the point also  emphasised by the use of the word "allegation"?  Normally if an agency of the state makes a claim against  someone, it says that it is making an allegation against  him. That word does not appear here although it appears  in subsection (6) where someone who wants to make a  response to the claim for penalty has to put it as an  allegation.  
<P>
The fact that a person's claim that what the Secretary  of State or his officer was trying to do was wrong has to  be called an allegation, when what the Secretary of State  alleges against him does not, makes it rather one-sided.  The whole attitude of the Government seems to be that  whatever they say, people must do, and if people have  half a chance of making any kind of claim it will be called  an allegation but not their's.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is  just another of those many parts of the Bill where all  concepts of justice have been reversed. The burden of  proof has been reversed. Everything is stacked against an  innocent person who is trying to prove that he is  innocent. Individually these things might be tolerable or  acceptable in a magistrates court or a Crown court, but  taken collectively and dealt with in an administrative  system by officials of the state they are not.  
<P>
Let me again say for the record, as the Minister would  use it against me if I did not, I have no criticism whatever  of Home Office or immigration officials legitimately  trying to do a difficult job in difficult circumstances. My  criticism is of the law which the Minister is trying to  create and the system under which they will have to work  and the judgments that they will have to make.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Mr.  Bottomley) is right. Normally when someone is charged  with an offence an allegation is laid against him. Here the  person mounting the defence has to allege that just  possibly he might be innocent. That is an extraordinary  state of affairs. If the burden of proof were in his favour  in a court of law, that would be all right, but not now.  
<P>
The Minister has not treated the Committee fairly this  morning. Okay, he has a massive majority. As we found  during the night, his colleagues can sleep on the benches  outside the Room and return only to allow the  Government to win a vote. If the amendment is pushed to  a vote, no doubt the Government will win again. They  will reject the concept of mitigation by using the votes of  colleagues who slept during the night, but who are awake  enough to shout no this morning. Their proposal should  not become law because it is contrary to every principle  of natural justice.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend has made some  important points. I listened carefully to the Minister and,  although I do not want to make party political points, I  think that he will agree that he has painted with rather a  broad brush.  
<P>
People standing trial would think that the Government  had introduced a novel interpretation of mitigation. The  Minister argued that an accused person should not be  allowed to plead mitigation as that might create too many  difficulties. However, in the dim and distance past, I  seem to recall a plea of mitigation being advanced by the  Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department.  However, I shall not digress.  
<P>
The Government's position on the code of practice is a  matter of concern. The Minister said something about it  this morning, but the Minister of State, Lord  Chancellor's Department replied to the debate early  yesterday morning. He did his best to explain the code  even though he is not the Minister responsible for it.  However, I find it hard to remember exactly what was  said yesterday morning and the Hansard report of the  debate on the code of practice is not yet available. We are  now in a difficult position because we have no way of  comparing what the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's  Department said about the code of practice and the  Minister's current interpretation.  
<P>
The Minister cannot assist us because he was not here.  However, if he had been, he might have remembered the  debate because he has been dealing with the matter. He  has met lorry drivers and discussed the code of practice  with relevant trade organisations. Unfortunately, he was  unable to be here yesterday morning to debate the code  with the Committee, and that presents us with a problem.  
<P>
I do not want to discuss the sleeping arrangements of  Ministers or whatever else they were doing. Perhaps,  they were called away on urgent business, so I may have  been unfair in suggesting that Ministers were sleeping  when they should have been answering debates.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall:</B> Get on with it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the Minister had got on with it in  the early hours, that would have--[Interruption.]  Perhaps, I should have said that he should have been here  to get on with it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Is there a precedent for a  Minister to be savaged by his own Whip? Cannot we  protect him in some way?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to take up time, but we  may have to return to this point later. I am not satisfied  with the Minister's answer.  
<P>
I shall not press amendment No. 195 to a vote, but I  shall press amendment No. 197, because the proposal is  one more insult to lorry drivers. We are every bit as  concerned as the Government are to keep out clandestine  entrants, but we know what they said when we  introduced the carriers liability legislation. However,  this proposal tilts too far against lorry drivers and we are  not happy with the way in which the Government have  dealt with it.  
<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe.  Can we be reminded which amendment the Government  have just voted against?  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I put the question on amendment No.  43, which is a Government amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs.  Roe. Would it be possible for you to put the Question  again so that the Government can support their  amendment rather than oppose it?  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It should also be noted that it appeared  that the Opposition were anxious to support our  amendment.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall put the question again.  
<P>
Amendment agreed to.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. The  House rules have the flexibility that the Government are  denying in the amendments that they will now oppose. In  effect, they have been able to achieve what they wanted  by having a second go at it.  
<P>
Amendment made: No. 44 in page 15, line 32, leave  out "the objections" and insert "it".--[Mr. O'Brien.] 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 196, in  page 15, line 33, at end insert--  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(8A) Where the Secretary of State determines that a penalty is  payable by a person such a person may appeal to a magistrates' court  against the determination".
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. Will we have an  opportunity to vote on amendment No. 197 later?  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that that  amendment will come later and I shall call it formally.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is an important amendment  because it seeks to allow a right of appeal to a magistrates  court. That is the only way in which somebody who is  subject to this regime can have his case looked at, other  than by the Secretary of State. Everything else is in the  Secretary of State's hands. He brings the proceedings  and determines any issues that need to be determined.  There is no right of appeal against any determination that  he makes. Sadly there will be no right of appeal against  the penalty, as that will be fixed so as to take into account  mitigating circumstances.  
<P>
It has emerged during our proceedings that there could  be a great deal at stake with a £2,000 fine, multiplied by  however many additional clandestine entrants there may  be. It is also important from the point of view of human  rights. I shall not take detailed arguments at this stage,  but I ask the Minister to listen carefully and explain how  the clause is compliant with article 6 of the European  convention on human rights, which requires individuals  to have recourse to a court where there is a dispute as to  civil obligations.  
<P>
We have debated the character of the  offence--whether it is a civil or criminal matter. To  avoid further arguments on that point, let us take it for the  purposes of the amendment that it is a civil matter, as the  Minister has maintained throughout. If it is, surely article  6 of the convention requires a person subject to that civil  liability to have recourse to a court. How can that be  compliant with the European convention?  
<P>
Will the Minister also address the more general  question of how the clause will look to somebody who is  subject to this regime, given that everything in it is  decided by the Secretary of State? It is an important point  and we look forward to the Minister's response.  
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's  Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> Clause 21 sets out  the procedures to be followed when a civil penalty notice  is served. Subsection (8) provides that, where a notice of  objection is given, the Secretary of State must consider  those objections. Amendment No. 196 seeks to insert a  further requirement that there be a route of appeal to a  magistrates court where the Secretary of State, after  having considered any objections, decides that a civil  penalty is payable.  
<P>
The civil penalty is, as its name implies, intended to be  a civil matter, not a criminal offence. Someone who  disputes his or her liability to the penalty, may refuse to  pay and wait for proceedings perhaps to be taken by the  Secretary of State. It is possible that in the meantime, in  appropriate cases, the transporter carried may have been  detained as security, but we have provided, in clause 23,  for recourse to a court in connection with that.  
<P>
It is unnecessary to create an avenue of appeal against  a decision by the Secretary of State to sue a person unless  what he considers due is paid. Where the civil penalty  remains unpaid, it would be recovered through an action  for debt in the civil courts. It would, therefore, be  inappropriate to insert, as the amendment seeks to do, a  provision for referral of the matter to a magistrates court. 
<P>
As regards the European convention, I have made it  clear, by reference to the certification at the beginning of  the Bill, that the Government maintain that all the Bill's  provisions comply with our obligations under the  convention.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I am not a lawyer. The Minister  referred in one sentence to the civil and magistrates  courts as though they were different in some way.  Whether or not the Minister wishes to do it, would there  be a conceptual difficulty in allowing a magistrates court  to consider the civil matter of an appeal against a civil  charge?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> There is not, in that the magistrates court  exercises a civil jurisdiction.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister's remark may have  been useful information that conveyed what was in his  mind, but it does not necessarily argue against the  amendment. It appears that, in practice, a case can end up  in the civil court, a magistrates court or another court  where the Secretary of State wishes to ensure that the  penalty is paid by the person against whom it was levied,  or where a person has had his vehicle impounded and  wants to appeal against that until the penalty issue has  been determined. Will the Minister answer the question  from my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere about  why the person given the penalty cannot go to a magistrates court in the first place? If the only reason is  that the Minister does not want him to be able to do that, it  is not much of an argument, but simply a declaration of  intent. What is the argument against the person going to  the magistrates court?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> If the hon. Gentleman looks at the  structure in clause 21, he will realise that the issue does  not arise, because the way in which a person wanting to  challenge a decision would get to the magistrates  court--or, in an appropriate case, the Crown court--is  simply to refuse to pay. In that way he would effectively  challenge the Secretary of State to decide whether to take  proceedings. That is why I used the word "perhaps". The  Secretary of State might look at the case at that point and  decide that he did not want to enforce payment in the  circumstances and accept the arguments put to him. That  would be the way in which a person who was unhappy  about the imposition of the civil penalty would get his  case before a court.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister says that that is the way to  get a case before a court. Can there then be a full  rehearing of the reasons for the immigration officer's  judgment? Or is it a matter on which all the Secretary of  State will have to say to the civil court enforcing payment  is, "Here is the notice that we issued a month ago, and  here are our reasons. There is a debt, and the person  accused may be allowed to produce evidence only to  argue that he did not receive notice that it was a debt, not  to argue against the reason for the debt."  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> No. This is consistent with my explanation  to the hon. Member for Worthing, West. The Secretary  of State would have to justify the imposition of the civil  penalty before the magistrates court. So it would be for  the Secretary of State to say to the court, "This is  payable." It is always dangerous to use analogies, but it is  rather like the procedure that applies to some speeding  tickets where, if a person wishes to challenge the  imposition of the penalty, he can go back to the court to  say, "I should not have been ordered to pay this ticket."  The opportunity for the challenge is there along the lines  described by the right hon. Gentleman, but it will not  necessarily be taken up.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister will have far more  experience than I have of this branch of the law. He is  effectively saying that it should be left to the person to  challenge the debt, as it were, and that when it came to  the Secretary of State enforcing the debt, that would be  the point at which--  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> No.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister says no. Can he explain  by which other means the case would come before a  magistrates court?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The use of the word "debt" is misleading  because the debt arises only when a court has decided  that the civil penalty is payable. If someone wants to  challenge the Secretary of State's decision on whether  the civil penalty should arise, he simply refuses to pay  and it is then for the Secretary of State to justify the  penalty before the court. If the court decides that the  penalty is payable and makes an order to that effect, a  debt is created at that point. It would then be enforceable  through the appropriate court and the appropriate  enforcement mechanisms.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> In the case of a parking fine, the choice is  to pay the fixed penalty or go to court. In the  circumstances that we are debating there is no choice: the  fine has to be paid, and though one can appeal, there is no  choice to go to court.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman could  not have been listening very carefully. I have explained  that if someone wants to put the matter before the court,  he does not pay the penalty. That disposes of the hon.  Gentleman's argument.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister has been helpful to the  Committee.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Patient, even.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I stand corrected. He has been patient  and helpful and we now understand what he means. The  arguments for the amendment stand. The Minister is  right that some of the issues go wider of the amendment  so I shall save my remarks for the clause stand part  debate.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Has the Minister considered--I do  not want to test his patience too far--the evidence given  by Justice and its legal advisers, Ben Emmerson and  Jessica Simor? They did not believe that the provisions  of article 6 were fulfilled.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Those have been considered.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister cannot blame us for  wanting to test whether the provision is compliant with  the European convention on human rights. We have been  given legal advice in submissions of evidence to this  Special Standing Committee to the effect that it is not. It  is the purpose of this Committee to reflect on the  evidence provided by various groups of experts.

Question accordingly negatived.  
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended,  stand part of the Bill.  
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In order to make progress, I shall not  oppose the clause. It would not be appropriate anyway,  as the Minister gave an undertaking to look carefully at  our arguments on the fairness of the procedure being  adopted.  
<P>
The clause relates to the procedure to be followed  when it is said that a person is responsible for a penalty.  We raised doubts in earlier debates about the fairness of  the Government's proposals, because they tilt the  balance against the responsible person--the lorry driver  or someone else--at every point in the proceedings. We  are unhappy about much of the procedure.  
<P>
The Minister said that he would consider our point  about fairness; we argued that individuals should receive  notice of their liability for the penalty and thus be able to  challenge it. It is a fundamental principle of fairness that  someone who is liable for a penalty should know about it  and that was our purpose in raising the matter. As the  Minister agreed that our proposals were worthy of  further consideration, our debates have been most  worthwhile and I shall not, therefore, press the clause to a  Division. However, I put on record that it contains  elements that are as unfair as any in the Bill, including, I  suspect, the provisions in clause 22 regarding detention  of vehicles, which, in many ways, will be the sting in the  tail of the measure.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I shall not  detain the Committee. A key matter that emerged from  the Minister's contribution was ministerial discretion to  issue a notice under the clause. In earlier debates we  referred to specific circumstances in which ship owners  in mediterranean countries had tipped  clandestines--mostly Albanians and north  Africans--overboard because of the fear of incurring  penalties. I believe that the Minister said that he would  have a discretion not to issue a notice if, for example,  someone arriving on these shores said, "The clandestines  were discovered after reasonable checks on board,  although they may not conform to the defence. I did not  want to throw them overboard. I am on a boat; I have no  alternative but to land them on shore because they are in very poor condition." I am concerned about such  circumstances for humanitarian reasons.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Let me be clear what I am being  asked. Most ships have a radio--I believe that ships over  a certain size have a legal obligation to carry one. They  could inform the immigration authorities on the line  available to do so that they have discovered clandestines.  At that point, the entrants will cease to be clandestines, as  they are known about. A ship's captain can seek advice  from the immigration authorities on how to proceed and  how to deal with the people discovered on board, who  used to be called stowaways.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was a useful clarification. I wanted to  establish that no ship owner need fear contacting the  authorities in such circumstances; he can seek a  humanitarian solution rather than take drastic measures  as others have done, perhaps because of the ship's  captain's or owner's lack of understanding. I am glad  that the Minister put on record that the ship owner would  be expected to contact the immigration authorities before  arriving on these shores and to find a humanitarian  solution rather than acting from fear of the provision.  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The provisions deal with clandestines.  If the immigration authorities are informed that people  are about to come in, they cease to be clandestine.  However, other criminal provisions may be applied if  someone is facilitating entry. Obviously, if a ship's  captain acted openly and honestly in informing the  authorities, the criminal provisions would not apply. The  captain has that option.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> As I said earlier, in addition to these  proposals, traffickers in human beings should continue  to be pursued under section 25(1) of the Immigration Act  1971, which relates to criminal pursuits. I am grateful for  the Minister's clarification of the proposal. I was anxious  about the circumstances that I described, with reason,  given what has occurred in other countries.  
<P>
<H5>10.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> That last intervention was  helpful, as the Minister reminded the Committee that  clause 21 relates to clause 18.  
<P>
When the Bill is enacted, those outside Parliament will  want to know what clandestine entrant means. Is the  person a clandestine entrant when he or she is openly in  front of immigration officials in this country or if he has  managed to get past that stage? The first definition is  more likely. An operator may have checked his vehicle  either outside the country or in the zone--also outside  the country--where our immigration procedures are  applied. It would be useful for the Minister to put on  record what clandestine entrant means; it may have  different meanings in different parts of the Bill.  
<P>
I shall not repeat my earlier arguments about the word  "allegation". The Minister would be wise to consider  whether that is the appropriate word in subsection (6);  "defence" or "response" might be equally acceptable.  The Minister may say that "allegation" is the term used in  other legislation and that it is in the clause for that reason.  However, the word seems to have been used casually in   939 940  subsection (6) and the Minister should reconsider its  inclusion because it does not look very good. For  someone to say, "I want to make an allegation that this  penalty is improperly imposed on me," is  psychologically rather damaging.  
<P>
In practice, most people who are served with a penalty  notice will not appeal because they will think that it has  been properly applied. They may not like it but they will  say that because there are no mitigating circumstances  their action falls within the terms of the Act, therefore the  penalty should apply. There is a danger that some people  will consider the penalty as a payment for doing what  they did. If they brought in eight people but were caught  with only one, the penalty becomes a charge for entry, as  long as the action was not so blatant as to incur criminal  proceedings. However, I shall not go into the matter of  civil liability in this debate.  
<P>
We should refresh our memory on what the clause will  do. Clause 18 relates to the penalty for bringing in  clandestine entrants and clause 21 outlines the procedure  for doing so. It shows the procedure that must be  followed in cases in which the Secretary of State decides  that the person is liable for one or more penalties under  clause 18. We should remind ourselves, in passing, that  the person liable may not be the person responsible in  anything other than a legal sense. The Minister of State,  Lord Chancellor's Department, rightly said that there are  dangers in analogies, but in some respects, the position is  analogous to that of someone who had a lease on a shop  and sold it to someone else. That person sold the lease to  a third person, who sold it to a fourth person. Eventually,  when the rent is not paid, there is a vicarious liability  which goes back to the person who signed the original  lease. Under the proposal, someone may be liable in law  even though he was not involved in or reckless about  allowing a vehicle to be used in bringing in clandestine  entrants. That is the general liability in the clause.  
<P>
As the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's  Department explained earlier, in a case relating to the  enforcement of the penalty the court could decide only  whether the Secretary of State or his officers followed  the correct procedure. It could not examine the merits of  the case. The Secretary of State and his officers will be  the only people who can decide its merits under the  clause, as amended.  
<P>
They can decide not to put a penalty on someone, even  though--according to some interpretations of the  measure--that person is liable. There is no requirement  that the penalty should be mandatory. If I have  misinterpreted that, I hope that the Minister will correct  me, as I am sure that there will be a degree of discretion.  
<P>
The Ministers said that the only discretion that they  want will be of the "No, we won't impose a penalty" or  "Yes, we will" variety. The Minister may have been  demonstrating his knowledge of mathematics in  accusing my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr.  Clappison) of letting a carrier off with a £6,000 penalty.  However, let us consider the case of five clandestine  entrants in a vehicle. Circumstances may not necessarily  be the same for all of them. Two may be sitting beside the  driver, while, unbeknown to him, another three are  hidden in back of the vehicle.   
<P>
Does the Secretary of State or his officers have  discretion to charge for an offence relating to the two  people sitting next to the driver, but not for the three in  the back of the vehicle? Discretion would come into play  because the driver is not liable for what is in the back of  his lorry, as he is following the code of practice in  relation to that part of his vehicle.  
<P>
That may be a slightly ludicrous example. However, it  illustrates the question whether there is discretion on  penalties for multiple entry. I am not arguing that, in  practice, penalties should be imposed for bringing in  some people and not others. That would be another  version of the old blue-eyed policy. However, will the  Minister reassure us that provision will be made for  discretionary powers?  
<P>
Clause 21(1) deals with how the Secretary of State  notifies someone who is liable for a penalty. It is  acceptable to us. I do not have the expertise or the interest  in whether there should be a period for objecting, what  reasonable steps may be taken by the Secretary of State  in cases in which people are jointly and severally liable,  and of how much effort goes into notifying people of a  penalty.  
<P>
Clause 21(2)(a) deals with the Secretary of State's  reasons for issuing a penalty notice. The explanatory  notes to the Bill state:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Subsection (2) states that a penalty notice must contain the  Secretary of State's reasons for deciding that the individual concerned  is liable for a penalty".
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I assume that that will be slightly more than a tick in a  box for a parking offence. I will develop that analogy. If  an individual is alleged to have double-parked and a  similar Bill applied to him, would he be declared to have  double-parked?  
<P>
On the other hand, will the Secretary of State be  required to explain why he decided to impose a penalty  on the available evidence? Will he have to explain why  the evidence is not being overlooked, or why a criminal  prosecution is not being pursued?  
<P>
That brings me to a matter which it would have been  wrong to raise earlier. Criminal proceedings may take  place against someone who is alleged to have helped a  clandestine entrant to enter this country, but who is  declared not guilty. However, in civil law, that person  may not be innocent of having failed to carry out his or  her duty under the Bill. That person may have faced  significant legal expenses in relation to the criminal  charge. It is likely that the penalty notice will be imposed  before the criminal proceedings take place--I imagine  that penalty notices will come out relatively soon after a  clandestine entrant has been discovered or has declared  himself or herself. Criminal proceedings normally take  up to a year or more.  
<P>
Therefore, will someone be required to pay a penalty  notice, even though criminal proceedings against him or  her are still pending? The criminal court may say to such  a person: "Have you paid your civil penalty?" If so, will  that be taken as an indication of guilt, even though the  person is pleading not guilty to the criminal offence with  which he or she is charged.  941 942 [Mr. Peter Bottomley]  
<P>

<P>
Will such a person be able to say: "I am facing criminal proceedings, so will you  discontinue the civil claim for a penalty? Otherwise, the criminal hearing of that alleged  offence may be prejudiced."  
<P>
The Minister may claim that I am trying to protect racketeers, but I am not. I am trying to  use the clause stand part debate properly to explore some practical matters that may arise. The  Minister may know the law that applies to my questions, or he may want to write to me later.  
<P>
Subsection (2) refers to the steps that the Secretary of State may take to recover any unpaid  penalty. The Secretary of State could, for example, detain and sell a vehicle if payment was  not forthcoming. Perhaps it would be better to leave more detailed consideration of that to our  discussions of a later clause, which covers that matter.  
<P>
The Minister may claim that I make allegations, but I call them assertions. If a vehicle is  impounded, and the case goes to court, will the court be able to consider the merits of the case,  or only whether the Secretary of State had followed the procedure and given a reason for  saying that someone was liable to penalties? If the Secretary of State's only duty is to provide  a reason for making a person liable to a penalty, and the court cannot consider whether he had  reasonable grounds for his decision, the provision allows Secretaries of State to do what they  like as long as they put a tick in the right box. Can the merits of the case be considered at a later  stage, perhaps in a magistrates court? That question underlying amendment No. 196, tabled  by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. The Government rejected it, at least for the  time being.  
<P>
I mentioned subsections (3) and (4) earlier, and I shall not pursue subsection (5), which  requires the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to serve the notice on others  responsible for a clandestine entrant. The Secretary of State must ensure that a penalty notice  is served on one person, and try to ensure that the notice is served on the others involved. That  goes beyond my area of expertise.  
<P>
Others can consider subsection (6). Subsection (7) deals with the set time in which a notice  must be served and provides for regulations to prescribe that period. We could argue about  whether the period should be a month, but the Government are likely to make a reasonable  decision about that after consultation. I am willing to trust them on that.  
<P>
Subsection (9) deals with the recovery of a penalty that is owed in an action for debt. I want  to make a general point. In the past, such a penalty was levied on those who were in the  business of transporting people. The provision extends the penalty to those who carry goods.  Lorry drivers do not usually travel with a group. When I worked on a cargo ship while  returning from Australia, we knew that 72 people were supposed to be on the vessel. We saw  those people and were able to count them. Aeroplanes, even those that carry cargo, usually  have a reasonable sized crew. Therefore, people on them are used to having others around.  However, the provision covers not only the operators of ocean-going or coastal vessels, or  international aeroplanes, but small operators.  
<P>
Large operators have departments that can deal with the Home Office and others, and set  up codes, procedures and checkable systems. As my hon. Friends rightly said, many  operators who start small, remain small. Some find it difficult to keep up with the regulations  that affect their business. If one of their employees is accused of being involved in  transporting a clandestine entrant, they may find themselves in difficulty through the ensuing  dispute because it is a distraction from their business.  
<P>
At election time, every party claims to have done the most to relieve the burdens on small  businesses. I shall not get involved in that. The only current elections are local elections,  which do not affect the Bill. However, the Minister should explain how subsection (9) will  affect small businesses.  
<P>
The key point that I want to leave in the Ministers' minds is the use of the word  "allegation", because it seems to lie behind their attitude to many of our reasonable  arguments. The Ministers have kindly said that they will accept one or two amendments and  think about one or two others, but the word "allegation" makes me think that they want a  system where what they say goes, without challenge. That is not the English system or the  Scottish system; I do not think that it is a happy system. If the Ministers could say that they  will look at the word "allegation" in terms of what the defence or the response would be, I  should be content.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I want to return briefly to what the Minister said earlier about stowaways,  because one of the great benefits of Committees is that hon. Members have time to revisit  things. I revisited clause 18, which would apply when it has to be decided whether a penalty  can be issued under clause 21. When someone has been discovered in a ship or aircraft,  having embarked in a concealed manner intending to claim asylum on reaching the United  Kingdom, they would still be categorised as a clandestine. If there were any suggestion that  they intended to claim asylum, even though they could no longer obey immigration controls,  they would still fall within the category of clandestines.  
<P>
I assume that the liability would be there and I want to establish whether the clause gives  ministerial discretion not to issue the notice, even though it has been decided that the person is  technically liable. The only way out of that would be to use discretionary powers, as the hon.  Member for Worthing, West suggested, in trying to establish whether the issue of the notice  was mandatory once strict liability had been established.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): The hon. Member for Hallam has just made the  point that I was about to make. In the debate on this clause and the earlier clauses to which it  relates, Conservative Members often alleged that the clauses would prevent people from  taking humanitarian action to bring those oppressed in another country out of that country  and into the UK. In his earlier intervention on the hon. Member for Hallam   943 944  my hon. Friend the Minister gave an important  clarification: whereas one might have to sneak  somebody out of another country in a clandestine way,  one would not have to bring them into this country in a  clandestine way. So long as when one reached the port of  entry and declared that one had carried out that  humanitarian act and had in the back of the lorry a  refugee whom one had just saved from a Serbian prison  camp, one would not be liable to the penalties in the  clause. I just wanted to give the Minister an opportunity  to say that I have understood that correctly. If so, I  wonder what we spent four hours in the middle of the  night discussing.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> If one is called Mike Nicholson and  one brings in a child from an area of conflict, one may be  able to get away with it, but we are talking about an  anonymous lorry driver, which would be quite different.  If one is not a well-known broadcaster and cannot tell  one's story in various newspapers, even if one has got a  refugee out of Bosnia into another central European  country, one will not be able to bring him here. One is  then stuck. What does one do with a child or somebody  else whom one has brought out of danger but is not  allowed to bring into this country, because one has to  apply for entry clearance?  
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but  no individual can be judge and jury as to who is suitable  to be treated as a refugee. Therefore, it is perfectly  reasonable that, if someone is brought into this country,  the situation must be explained to the Secretary of State,  who will decide whether the action was right and, if not,  impose a penalty.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I think that the point is that the Secretary of  State is being judge and jury, which is why we are  spending hours carefully tiptoing through the Bill to try  to improve it. Although much of it is very worthy, it can  do with improvement and scrutiny.  
<P>
I am glad that we have had this debate, because it has  shone some light on areas about which I had some  concerns. I was glad to hear the Minister's assurance that  he would consider further whether the penalty notice  should include ways in which the person on whom it was  served could follow the process through and appeal. I  was also glad that the Minister said that if a driver  coming through customs says that he has somebody on  board, and puts his hand up to that, the notice would not  be served and no penalty would be imposed.  
<P>
However, there is also the situation where somebody  has gone through immigration--this is where the clause  kicks in--pulls up at a transport cafe and hears tapping  on the side or sees blood running out of the back of the  vehicle. If the driver in that instance picks up the phone  and calls the police or the authorities immediately, or  perhaps even takes the immigrant to hospital before  making the call, I hope that, when a code of practice is  drawn up, he will be seen to have acted in a responsible  and sensible manner. The fact that he had passed through  all the checks and that the immigration authorities had  not found out would not automatically lead to a penalty  ticket.  
<P>
I was concerned to hear in debates on earlier  amendments that the penalty would be almost   immediate. The incident would occur on the dockside,  interviews would take place and the offender would face  the penalty. The paperwork would be limited at that  point. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West  referred to  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Secretary of State's reasons for deciding"
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
under clause 21(2)(a). Administrative processes should  be quick and the relevant boxes should be ready to tick,  but will there be a commentary on the penalty notice that  sets out the circumstances as understood by the  immigration authorities? When the road haulier or driver  responds, will it be to a ticked box or a commentary?  
<P>
Will the Minister provide us with an example of a draft  penalty notice before Report to give us an idea of what  the lorry driver will be given? The Home Office was  helpful in providing draft ballot papers for the  Committee considering the European Parliamentary  Elections Bill. Once we can see the detail of what lorry  drivers will face, we will gain a better idea of how they  should respond.  
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister and gained the  impression that the deterrent value of the penalty is the  most important aspect for him. He does not want people  entering the country in dangerous circumstances and he  hopes that few penalties will be applied because fewer  and fewer people will be arriving in the backs of  vehicles.  
<P>
That begs the question of how the penalties will be  publicised. Will the Government list monthly in road  haulage trade journals the individuals or companies who  have had penalties served against them? Will the  industry be able to see how many--perhaps 15 road  hauliers in Dover, six in Poole, seven in  Harwich--notices have been issued?  
<P>
We are not talking about a magistrates courtroom  system with reporters at the back. A notice might be  served in Dover at 3 o'clock in the morning and it has to  be publicised for deterrence to work. People need to  know what is happening. The deterrent effect will work  largely through the driver reading his Transport  Engineer magazine on a Sunday evening and  discovering, "God, Harry got done for £6,000 so I am  going to check my vehicle."  
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Without sounding as if I am  joking, it is likely that the information would go on the  internet to help would-be entrants. If they know that a  particular company or driver has been done three or four  times, entrants might think that they are in the business.  The publicity argument is a good one, but the Minister  would probably say that in practice it is not just the  penalties but the whole set of procedures in the new  system that acts as the deterrent. It is not just a question of  a £2,000 penalty: some might pay £2,500 and start saying  that they will hand over the money only if they get into  the country without a penalty notice.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. It has to be  publicised, but he is right that some people may take the  wrong message. The internet is a powerful medium. I am  not computer-literate, but there may well be items on the  internet at this very moment on how to enter various  countries illegally.     945 946  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am trying to become  computer-literate and I am sure that there is much  interesting information about the Bill on the internet. I  am running off my next set of notes from the internet, but  that is beside the point.  
<P>
A more dangerous issue emerges from clause 21. It  will not be a case of reading "Harry's been done for  £6,000" in the trade press, but of reading in the company  pages of newspapers: "Syms transport is in debt. It is  being sued by the Government and the company is  appearing in court." That can damage companies.  
<P>
I cannot imagine that it would help negotiations with,  for example, United Airlines if reports in the trade press  suggested that British Airways was being sued for bad  debt because it had refused to pay the Minister's fine.  The only way in which it will be able to appeal is by  refusing to pay and by ending up in the bad debtor's  court. It will then receive a full hearing, but the City will  not understand that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend. People in  industry read Dun and Bradstreet and other journals to  see which companies have had judgments made against  them. That becomes a factor when one does business. A  fine is not the only deterrent. If a company is caught and  that becomes public knowledge, it is bound to have an  impact on its reputation as a reputable trader. Therefore,  there will be arguments between companies and the  Secretary of State about whether the fine should be  automatic. If a firm is caught on three or four occasions,  other reputable businesses may not think that it is honest.  Therefore, they may decide that it should no longer carry  their goods.  
<P>
Other problems could be caused if loads are stopped  coming through customs. If goods, such as produce, have  to reach their destination by a certain time, the  companies giving the carrier business will not be happy  if their loads are delayed. They might not give it further  business if their loads are stopped.  
<P>
When illegals are discovered on a vehicle coming  through a port, they and the driver will be interviewed.  Photographic or video evidence may be taken of the  vehicle and a decision will be taken not only on whether  to impose a penalty, but on what to do with the vehicle. If  its cargo is perishable, it may need shifting and its  owners informed. Such decisions are taken if drugs or  other things are found at a port.  
<P>
Let us consider the case of Fred, a lorry driver who  lives in south London. The immigration authorities  might raid his home and he might put up his hand to using  his vehicle to bring in 60 illegal immigrants over three  months. The raid could take place some time after the  offences were committed, but, apart from charging him,  the immigration authorities will issue 60 times £2,000  worth of penalties. Fred might be a rotten individual, but  he might work for a reputable company. A penalty of 60  times £2,000 could mean that it has to go out of business.  
<P>
In that example, the penalty is not imposed  immediately on the discovery of three people in the back  of a vehicle in Dover at 3 o'clock in the morning. The  raid could take place months or years after the people  were brought to this country. A complicated case might   have led to a racket being smashed. That is a good thing,  because a rotten apple will have admitted to bringing in  several illegal immigrants. However, on the basis of the  evidence gained from interviewing the driver and from  detaining some of the illegal immigrants, will the  immigration authorities be able to slap multiple-penalty  notices on a haulier with the consequence that he goes  out of business?  
<P>
Sometimes, life is unfair. When I was a member of a  local authority, I remember that Customs and Excise  carried out an exercise on a school to find out whether it  was paying all its value added tax. Customs and Excise  can multiply the figure it believes that a school owes by  the number of schools in a county and tell the authority  that it owes £300,000. There is then an argument, but that  is not very fair.  
<P>
However, if one person brings in many illegal  immigrants, a very large penalty could be imposed.  Therefore, a reputable company employing a rotten  driver, for whom it is responsible, could go out of  business and other people would lose their jobs. We must  consider what happens after the event. Immigration  officials will be given extra powers and will be able to  impose a fine that could have a detrimental effect.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is  straying into arguments already covered on clause 18.  Please will he confine his remarks to the clause now  being debated.?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend the Member  for Worthing, West.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> It seems to me that the question  comes down to this: is there a provision in clause 21, or  does the Minister have power under the clause, to set a  time limit on when the penalty notice can be issued? If  the Minister says that he has unlimited discretion and that  it could be six years or 16 years afterwards, an issue  arises. My hon. Friend also might wish to ask the  Minister, "What happens if a bad driver for a good firm is  convicted for bringing in 60 people over a period?" If the  person admits it, that could be evidence for a civil notice.  If the person denies it, and is convicted, would the  conviction by itself be sufficient for the Minister to use as  evidence for a civil penalty?  
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I take note of your ruling, Mrs. Roe.  
<P>
My hon. Friend makes a very good point. This is not  quite the statute of limitations but time limits for the  penalty are important. There can be a mature effect. A  business could be trading, solvent and prosperous but,  because of something that happened two years  before--and the driver in question might not work for  that business any more; he may have worked there for 12  months and shifted to another business--and his  admission of liability, a company for which he no longer  works could be put out of business. The company might  have got rid of him because it decided that he was not of  the standard that they wanted there, yet his arrest and  conviction could lead to the business going down. I do  not wish to labour the point, but it is important.  947 948  
<P>
We need to know what a penalty notice will be, and  whether it is a tick box or a commentary of what went  wrong. We also need an indication of how retrospective  penalty notices will be, if only because we might be  giving great power to immigration authorities to take  some transportation firms out of business simply because  multiple penalty notices are some time in arrears.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I want to make a few small points about  areas that we have not previously covered.  
<P>
I want to pursue the excellent suggestion from my hon.  Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) that it would  help the Committee if it could see a rough draft of the  penalty notice that the Minister envisages. My comments  on that would have been substantially the same as my  hon. Friend's. Clause 21(2)(a) states that a penalty notice  must  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"state the Secretary of State's reasons for deciding that P is liable to the  penalty".
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
It is important to know whether the reasons will be  written like an indictment, whether different reasons are  written in each case according to the best English of the  immigration office, or whether there will be a pre-set list  of reasons, possibly simply matching clause 20, with a  tick box stating "You are guilty of the penalty because  you failed to show duress",--as in clause 20(2)--or  "You failed to produce a defence that you knew, or had  reasonable grounds, or didn't operate your code of  practice and you are in contravention of clause 20(2)(a),  (b) and (c)" and the immigration officer will tick the  boxes, so satisfying the requirements of clause 21(2)(a)  to give reasons.  
<P>
We need to know whether the Minister envisages a  form similar to those that the Health and Safety  Executive issues for health and safety at work matters. I  am little rusty on the latter, but I believe that all forms  show standardised reasons why someone is guilty and  that, the relevant boxes having been ticked to show that  someone has failed to comply with certain aspects of  health and safety law, the person is given his penalty, or  21 days to appeal. Is that what the hon. Gentleman has in  mind, or will the forms be written individually or  dictated and written in editorial form, as my hon. Friend  the Member for Poole suggested? If it is to be a standard  form, a rough draft for the Committee to look at would be  handy.  
<P>
I should like know, purely for the benefit of my own  ignorance, what rank or grade of immigration officers  will operate this and the previous clauses. I have asked  that point on numerous occasions and it has not been  answered. I am not trying to trap the Minister but I have  no ministerial experience of the immigration service and  I do not know the grades. Clause 22 refers to "a senior  officer". The interpretation clause defines that as an  officer not below the rank of chief immigration officer.  
<P>
So it is clear in clause 22 but this clause, which  operates the procedures for the previous clauses, talks  about the Secretary of State. Many may think that on  these occasions a file will be prepared by immigration  officers and will go up through the system. It will reach  the Home Office and the seventh floor and will be  prepared by the Secretary of State's private office and  submitted to him in a similar manner to files relating to   warrants and security matters that only he can deal with.  The Home Secretary makes a decision and the  paperwork comes back down through the line and the  lorry drivers and carriers are dealt with, but that is not  what is envisaged here.  
<P>
The Committee will pardon my ignorance, but I do not  think that that is how it will operate. Although the clause  refers to the Secretary of State deciding that P is liable, I  take it that officials will decide. What will be the rank and  grade of the officials making decisions relating to  previous clauses and most importantly, acting on behalf  of the Secretary of State under clause 21? Does the  Minister ever envisage cases where the procedures will  go up through the line to a Minister, either to the  Under-Secretary or the Minister of State responsible for  the immigration service, or in any circumstances, to the  Home Secretary himself to make that decision?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> If a vehicle in which people may have been  concealed is detained on a dockside and immigration  officials are photographing or videoing it, can that  information be copied to the firm or the individual or  should the driver also have the right to video and  photograph what is going on as it might be material to his  defence that he did all the checks?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is a very good point. It should be  dealt with in the code of practice. The Government  should take that on board. Once the burdens which the  code of practice will impose are clear to transport  companies, the most efficient and most switched on will  start preparing their defences and videoing their  procedures in the same way as the police and other  organisations video their procedures, not to catch out  criminals but to have a defence if they are taken to court  by people who allege that they did not act properly. Lorry  firms may do the same but I do not want to go down that  route at this stage.  
<P>
I should be very grateful if the Minister could tell what  ranks will operate clause 21. If a big airline or shipping  company is involved or if it is a big case such as the 100  people in the back of a lorry my hon. Friend the Member  for Hertsmere described, does it go up the line? Is there a  cut off point where a senior official will deal with it? In  what circumstances will it come on to a ministerial desk,  not for information, but for a decision?  
<P>
I turn now to the times for payment. Clause 21(2)(c)  states  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"specify the date before which, and the manner in which, the penalty  (or penalties) must be paid."
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I am not interested in the manner in which it will be paid.  Presumably that will be a crossed cheque or money in a  brown envelope to Queen Anne's gate or Lunar house. I  am not interested in that so much as in the time limit. Has  the Minister any indication of what the time limit will be?  Will it be three weeks or one month? Will it be flexible?  If the Minister is planning to operate different time  limits, we need to know why. Will the standard  procedure be to say in every case "Here's a notice. We  think you're guilty. You have three weeks or 28 days." If  the Minister envisages that there will be different time   949 950  [Mr. Maclean]  
<P>
limits for different types of operation--airlines, shipping  companies or hauliers--different sizes of company or  subjective assessments of a person's willingness to pay  or ability to abscond, we need to know. Again that would  be a subjective judgment by officials, and the Minister  says that we cannot allow them to make subjective  judgments, because he has not accepted our arguments  on mitigation, which I shall not repeat.  
<P>
One of my hon. Friends asked how retrospective the  clause would be. I shall not go over that ground, but the  Minister must answer the point. Can the Secretary of  State, using his powers under the clause, impose a  retrospective penalty on a haulage firm because  clandestines were brought in two, three or four years  earlier? Our discussions have been based on the  assumption that it is a live event: a lorry comes in, the  clandestines are caught on the spot, within minutes or  hours the penalty notice is imposed, within weeks or  months the fines must be paid, and the Secretary of State  does his business under the clause. We have worked on  that assumption; we may be wrong.  
<P>
If, years after clandestines have arrived in the country,  the authorities think they have good evidence that they  arrived in Syms Transport, which did not operate the  code of practice properly or was sloppy in checking the  lorries, can the Secretary of State impose a penalty? One  expects him to be able to go back a few weeks or perhaps  months. Can he go back a few years and use his powers  under the clause?  
<P>
The next point is the one on which I wish to conclude  my remarks.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): Hooray!  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Or it may not be. I am happy to give  way to the Government Whip.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wasting time. He  should get on with it.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the right hon. Gentleman  kindly bring his remarks to a conclusion as quickly as  possible?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am happy to do so, Mrs. Roe. I am  happy to obey your instructions. If you find that I am out  of order, naturally I shall comply. I prefer to take  instructions on what I say in Committee from the Chair  rather than from Government Members.  
<P>
One of my points in conclusion relates to the excellent  paper prepared for Justice by Ben Emmerson and Jessica  Simor. I accept that the Government believe that the civil  penalty in the clause is not contrary to article 6 of the  European convention on human rights. If that is their  judgment, the Committee must accept it. However, I  found the Justice argument compelling. It is possible that  the way in which this civil penalty is proposed to be  implemented and the procedures in the clause could be  contrary to the procedure requirements of article 6(2) and  (3) of the convention.  
<P>
I found many of the two lawyers' points instructive.  The only argument that I wish to present in the overall  context of the clause is that it cannot be right that one's  only appeal mechanism is to wait until one gets into the  bad debt court. The Minister is saying, "Don't worry.  There is an appeal mechanism. It is not a direct appeal  mechanism, but if your defences haven't worked, your  appeal mechanism is to refuse to pay. Her Majesty's  immigration service or the Home Secretary will serve a  notice on you saying that you are guilty of the offences.  Here are the reasons." No doubt there will be something  on the back that says, "If you don't like this and you  disagree, you can refuse to pay." The powers are in the  Bill. What happens then? "We, the Government, will  take you to court." The Home Secretary or IND will take  to court the person who objects to the notice in order to  recover the debt--not to re-examine the issues. The  person will go to court and say, "I am not paying this  penalty because I do not believe that I am guilty"--the  same as any other debtor.  
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
There is something slightly smelly about that. I am not  an expert in any area of law, which is why I was allowed  to be a Minister for so long. I am worried that the appeal  mechanism will give people a bad reputation.  
<P>
Hon. Members will be familiar with from a case a few  years ago, which was regarded as funny at the time. It  involved the Attorney General of Canada, whose wife  found that she could not purchase any furniture on credit  because he had such an appalling reputation for bad debt.  He had been to court and lost many cases. It transpired  that some of the firms that ran bad debt operations  assumed that because he had lost so many cases in court  he must be a bad debtor, and the computer was badly  programmed. We all know of constituency cases in  which companies appear on a bad debt charge, and when  they do, they are dead. They are put out of business.  
<P>
The only mechanism that a person has with which to  protest and appeal against the notice, under clause 21(1),  is to appear in court because they have not paid a debt.  What will be the consequences? Theoretically, if they  win, their names should not appear on a blacklist.  However, there will not be many appeals. Even if it has a  cast-iron case, the legal advice to companies such as  British Airways will be, "Are you, British Airways,  seriously going to protest against this £2,000 fine and go  to court to recover a debt?" That would not make sense in  PR terms. Can we imagine the owner of west coast  mainline using that in his publicity: "Use the west coast  mainline, fly Virgin and don't appear in bad debt courts".  Companies will cop out and decide that it is not worth  appealing. They will not regard it as a proper appeal but  as having to appear in court with other bad debtors,  which is not worth their reputation.  
<P>
At the other end of the scale, uninformed  companies--the small operators, the guys who do not  understand what is going on--are likely to say, "I am not  paying this. I am going to appeal against it and go to  court." They will read in the press next day that they are  being done for bad debt. Either their businesses will  collapse because of it or they will be on a blacklist.  
<P>
That is a serious problem. Something is seriously  wrong with the clause. I sometimes wish that I had  continued as a lawyer--I got out before I was totally  corrupted--if only for the benefit of being an Opposition    951 952  Member. I would have been able to find the correct legal  terminology to explain much more coherently why the  proposal stinks to high heaven. It offends natural justice  when the only way in which people can appeal against  what they believe to be wrong is to refuse to pay the  penalty and end up in court with other bad debtors.  
<P>
That is our concern with some of the procedures--I  will not touch on all of them--in clause 21. I have  already touched on subsections (4), (5) and (6) and will  not do so again unless I am provoked. I want to conclude  there because my last point is the key problem with the  clause.  
<P>
The Minister seems to be making a habit of refusing to  answer my questions, which is a great shame because I  had always regarded him as fundamentally a nice bloke. I  am sure that he has right hon. Friends in other places who  are looking on him and saying, "He's a great guy; he's  one of us."  
<P>
Even if the Minister refuses to reply to any other  questions, I hope that he will deal with the slightly fishy  mechanism whereby the only way to clear one's name is  to go to a bad debt court. However, if someone is  successful there, how on earth can he clear his name  when it appears on all the computer registers and ghastly  blacklists that contain the names of all those who have  appeared in court because of a bad debt?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Worthing,  West raised several interesting points, and I shall deal  with them briefly.  
<P>
The definition of "clandestine" is set out clearly in the  clause, and it would be wrong for me to seek to put a legal  gloss on it--it is for the courts to interpret. They should  not be required to look at the statute and then read what I  have said about our intentions. The definition is as  straightforward as we can make it, and it is up to the  courts to use their normal procedures to interpret it.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the word  "allegation" in subsection (6), and I shall consider his  remarks. Although I can give no undertakings, I shall  write to him. The word is used in a particular way and I  shall consider his point about whether it has been used in  a pejorative sense.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the extent of  discretion. Liability may be clear, although it can be  challenged and defences can be raised. However,  whether liability is enforced is another matter, and a  Minister may decide whether enforcement should take  place. Although liability might not be subject to the  discretion that the hon. Gentleman seeks, there will be  discretion on enforcement. That is important for the  people involved, because such discretion will determine  whether they have to pay. The receipt of a penalty ticket  or notice may not be the issue, but whether people have to  pay may be. A notice might be issued, but, after he has  heard representations, a Secretary of State might take the  view that the penalty should not be paid for quite proper  reasons.  
<P>
I was asked about the effect of criminal proceedings  on liability. To some extent, that depends on who is  involved. For reasons of double jeopardy, the normal  practice is not to pursue a civil liability when there is also   a criminal liability. It is usual to allow the criminal courts  to determine that, and that has been the practice of  Governments for many years.  
<P>
Under these provisions, however, there could be a  civil liability in respect of one person and a criminal  liability in respect of another. Therefore, I do not want to  give the hon. Gentleman any tighter undertakings other  than to say that we do not intend to change the normal  practice when the same person is affected. However, if  two different people are implicated and only one of them  is the subject of criminal action, we might want to pursue  a civil penalty in respect of that. I repeat the point,  however, that when we consider cases, we shall decide  whether to pursue and to enforce a penalty.  
<P>
I was asked about a driver who believes that he is able  to use a defence and that the law does not apply in his  case.  
<P>
For example, he might claim that he did not carry a  clandestine. If he believes that he is not the subject of the  penalty clauses because he was not guilty of carrying a  clandestine, he can raise it with the Secretary of State and  make representations. If the Secretary of State does not  accept them he may defend a civil action.  
<P>
At that point the driver has a choice. Either he uses the  defence that although he carried someone he can justify  his actions or at least prevent himself from being liable to  the penalty, or he uses an absolute defence that he was  not carrying a clandestine and so the penalty clauses do  not apply. It is then a matter for the Secretary of State to  show that on the balance of probability the clandestine  was carried by the driver and that the driver is part of the  process.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam raised an interesting  point leading on from my earlier comments. I have  looked again at clause 18(1)(c). I would like to have the  opportunity to consider that at a slightly slower pace; I  realise we are going at a fairly slow pace anyway and I  might have the chance to consider a lot of things before  we finish. If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me I shall  write to him about this. He has raised an interesting issue  and I do not want to compromise the terms of each of the  limbs of clause 18(1).  
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole raised a number of issues.  First, he asked whether we can provide a draft of the  penalty notice. We do not have one at this point. The  right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border suggested  that it might just be a rough draft. We intend to discuss  with the hauliers how we might draft this so that it is clear  on the face of the penalty notice exactly what the reasons  are for its being applicable, how people can respond to it  and what representations they can make.  
<P>
Rather than providing a rough draft I would point out  that the Bill makes clear what needs to be there. We will  in due course wish to discuss with the hauliers the precise  way in which the penalty notice will be drafted. No doubt  we will make a rough draft and put it out to consultation  so that it can be fully discussed. The issue of code will  come back and hon. Members may wish to see a rough  draft, a consultative draft or perhaps even the final draft if  it is ready then.  953 954  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Worthing, West are right to say that the  penalty and the procedure are deterrents. We want to get that message across so that no one  carries clandestines, and therefore no one is frightened.  
<P>
<H5>11.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked hypothetical questions about what would happen if  someone carried clandestines in the back of his lorry, but it came to light some time after the  event. That would happen if, hypothetically, a racketeer suddenly decided to confess all.  
<P>
I am not sure that that often happens. However, in difficult cases, liability could, in theory,  last for a considerable period. We will state on the notice for how long the liability lasted and  the period for which any liability is enforceable.  
<P>
That brings me to the point about the matter relating not only to whether a person would  theoretically become liable, but also to whether the Secretary of State intends to enforce that  liability. We would obviously have to take a policy decision on that. However, the theoretical  period of liability is six years. In practice, the decision on liability and enforcement will be  made in due course under our declared policy and, no doubt, will be set out in regulations or in  the immigration rules. Twelve months would not be an unreasonable period, but, at this stage,  I do not want to be tied to a definite period. However, I understand that we would not want a  liability to hang over someone for a long period.  
<P>
I will consider the hon. Gentleman's point further; it is not appropriate to deal with it in the  Bill, or we would have to do the same with every Bill and the normal rules may not apply.  
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) raised a number of  matters. He asked about the rank of immigration officers dealing with decisions. Initial  decisions about whether liability has arisen will be taken by a chief immigration officer.  However, an immigration officer may well serve notice of the penalty. The chief immigration  officer's decisions will be monitored by an inspector, and decisions about whether to detain  vehicles will be made by a chief immigration officer, but will be subject to review by an  assistant director of the immigration service. In exceptional cases involving major public  interest issues, the Minister will be informed of a decision to detain vehicles and will be able  to exercise his discretion. So there is a series of levels at which the decision will be graduated  in terms of importance.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the most helpful explanation that he has  given me this morning. It was an excellent answer.  
<P>
I look forward to getting as many concessions as we did in the small hours from the  Minister of State, the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon). The Minister said that cases  involving key public interest--I will not ask what those are--may be referred to the Minister,  who may exercise his discretion. Does that mean that the Minister decides to cancel the  penalty and whether to pursue proceedings? Will the Minister substitute his decision?  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Minister will be involved in matters in which a vehicle is detained and  which involve the public interest. However, the Secretary of State will decide whether to  enforce a penalty, although a decision may be made at ministerial level. Liability may arise  and a penalty notice may be served, but the Secretary of State has to decide whether to enforce  the penalty. That decision will be made in the same way as, for example, decisions under  carriers' liability legislation. Ministers will get involved at that stage if necessary, and if their  involvement is in the public interest.  
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border asked about the European convention.  Lawyers can argue about that at length for years to come, and hold many different views on its  interpretation. I refer the right hon. Gentleman to the statement on the front of the Bill.  Ministers are satisfied that the Bill complies with the convention. 
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): We debated that point during the passage of the  Human Rights Bill. It was implied that the reasons for the decisions would be explained to us.  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Ministers receive advice about the convention. We are satisfied that the Bill  complies with the conventions. The Secretary of State has certified it on the face of the Bill,  and there is no merit in exploring issues that lawyers will enjoy considering in detail day after  day in our courts.  
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border also asked about appeals. I have tackled  the question to some extent. A person who receives a penalty notice can give notice of his  objections under subsections (6) and (8). The Secretary of State must then consider them. If  the person is still not satisfied, the case can be referred to the courts. The Secretary of State  must show that all the requirements of the civil penalty are satisfied. A defence   955 956  can be made under the Bill, or by showing that the person  did not transport a clandestine. If the case is defended,  the debt is not registered with the registry trust. If the  claim for the debt is successful, but the defendant fails to  pay it, and the claimant enforces it through the courts, the  debtor will be placed on the registry trust records. A  series of steps must be taken before that happens.  
<P>
Let us consider the case of a lorry driver who  transports a clandestine and lawfully becomes the  subject of liability, which the Secretary of State decides  to enforce. The lorry driver's defence does not succeed,  and he fails to pay his debt, which is subsequently  enforced. In such a case, taxpayers should receive the  money that they are due. I do not apologise for that, and I  am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would not expect  me to do so.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I agree entirely. There is no problem if  the proper procedures are followed, but that does not take  account of the press. They look at the bad debts list for a  court and do not understand the Minister's explanation.  Damage can be done. When the papers state that a  company has been in court for bad debt, they do not make  it clear that that is the only technical means of appealing.  I am not worried that the courts will not carry out the  procedures properly, but that the press will blame an  appellant for being a bad debtor.  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is right in a free country that when a  Secretary of State alleges that someone is liable to a  specific penalty against which the person tries to defend  himself, the press should be able to report the allegation  and the defence. That is part of the price that we pay for  democracy. It is not right to restrict publicity on such  matters because it might damage an organisation's  reputation. British Airways has from time to time found  its name in the newspapers. British Airways has from  time to time found its name in the newspapers with  regard to debts under the Immigration (Carriers'  Liability) Act 1987. That does not appear to have  damaged their reputation too much, which still stands  high in the public eye.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I thank the Minister for the  way in which he has responded to a number of points,  which shows the value of this debate.  
<P>
The Minister referred to the pace at which the  Committee is moving. I suspect that it is moving faster  than it would if the parties were reversed, although the  issues that are raised might be different.  
<P>
I refer the Minister to his point about the definition of a  clandestine entrant. His explanation is fair: we would not  want cases to be determined by what the Minister has  said in this Committee. It is what is in the Bill that will  matter when cases are tested in court. However, a  possible ambiguity that the Minister may want to  consider with his advisers later in the Bill is whether  someone will need to have been a clandestine entrant at  all stages. We know that at some stage a person starts  being clandestine, but can he start being clandestine  while in France, within the zone, or is he clandestine  while in passage? I am not asking the Minister to go  further than that, because he has answered the debate  well.   
<P>
I want to be certain that the definition should not be  adapted to show that the person was a clandestine entrant  at some stage during the process rather than at one  particular moment, and that at another moment he was  not a clandestine. It must be established, first, that he is  an entrant; secondly, that he is clandestine; and, thirdly,  that the clandestine element applied at all relevant  moments. If there is only one moment, that is fine. I am  not asking the Minister to respond again, unless he wants  to.  
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Perhaps I may write to the hon.  Gentleman on that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Then I come to the Minister's answer  on liability, which made sense, but it missed out the point  that I was trying to make. I was asserting that, if anybody  within the Secretary of State's authority thinks that at any  stage there is a possibility that a person is liable, there is  no obligation to set the penalty notice process in train: a  discretion exists. I assume that that is correct. It must be  correct, but I want to say it openly. The Minister went on  to say what happens after the penalty notice has been  written.  
<P>
It is plain to the Committee that at some stage people  use their discretion not to enforce the penalty notice or  not to pursue it, or to cancel it. I am not sure whether all  the technical terms are there, because in the BA example  the £4 million reduced down to £2 million, so clearly not  all penalty notices are proceeded with. The Minister may  wish at some stage to make it plain whether a penalty  notice that is not proceeded with is cancelled or simply  not proceeded with. It is a simple matter of fact.  
<P>
The Minister said that there was a ministerial  declaration with regard to the European convention on  human rights. We know that, but it could be seen as a  "tick box" example. However, if Ministers have made a  declaration that they believe the Bill is consistent with  the European convention, that is testable in the courts on  its merits. What we understand by this penalty notice is  that no merits can be considered in court; all that can  happen is that Ministers have got the ticks in the wrong  place, subject to the defence in clause 20.  
<P>
My last point is slightly linked to clause 20 and to  clause 22, which relates to impounding, but it is more  relevant here than to clause 22. Under clause 20 it is a  defence to show that a person did not know that he had a  clandestine entrant on board. My reading of that clause,  which is relevant to this one, is that if a carrier did not  know that he had someone on board and did not have  someone on board--his defence is that the person was  not somebody that he had brought in--that is not a  specified listed defence. It is presumably an implicit  defence. However, the defence in clause 20(3), of which  (a), (b) and (c) are parts, does not explicitly include the  defence where somebody declares, "There wasn't  anybody on my vehicle, vessel or aeroplane".  
<P>
I do not know how somebody can prove that. If a  driver has come in twice a week for the last year, how can  he demonstrate that there was nobody on his vehicle 100  times? The obligation must be the other way round--to  demonstrate that the person was on that vehicle. I do not  want to rehearse all the arguments that we have had over   957 958  
<P>
<B>[Mr. Bottomley]  </B><P>
<P>
the last day or two, but that is again an issue that the  Minister may want to consider with his advisers. He does  not need to write to me if I am raising a point which, for  some reason, is philosophically invalid. However, I  wonder about the defence that the person was not there.  
<P>
If, for example, four vehicles come into a port, a  clandestine entrant declares himself, three vehicle
