<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 35, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Post Office company shall during each of the first five years following the appointed day send to the Secretary of State a report identifying disposals of property for an amount in excess of £1 million and disposals of property for an amount less than £1 million where the total of the amounts of disposals of property for an amount less than £1 million for any financial year exceeds £1 million as soon as practicable after the end of the financial year in which the disposals were made'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 1—Restrictions on use of sums from the disposal of property—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—The Post Office company shall not use sums from the disposal of property transferred under section 51(1) for the purpose of subscription for, or acquisition of, securities of an incorporated company or other body corporate, promotion of the formation of an incorporated company or participation in the promotion of such a company or acquisition of an undertaking or part of an undertaking.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I should like to clarify for the convenience of the Committee, and those who are recording our proceedings, that the verb ``to scrag'', which was used in this morning's session, appears in the dictionary. The definition is ``handle roughly; beat up''. I am sure that the word is now in the lexicon of the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle).
<P>
<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): I think that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) should state whether he was the recipient or the aggressor.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that the Committee wants to hear that in connection with the Bill. That information can be provided privately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I assure the Committee that, in the playground in which I learned my politics, no kneecaps were safe.
<P>
The amendments relate to the desire for a transparent regime for disposal of property by the Post Office. One of the clear characteristics of a previously nationalised concern that is transferred, if not into the private sector then at least towards it, is little debt and a large tranche of assets built up during decades or centuries of activities. Such concerns are asset-rich and low on debt. A massive temptation exists, during restructuring, to dispose of some of the assets—especially property or to use them as the basis for securing new debt, new loans or new financial arrangements.
<P>
I do not want to restrain the Post Office in terms of activities in which a proper corporate concern that was planning for the long term would engage. However, given the great concern about the post office network and its assets—I accept that the vast majority of community post offices are privately owned—I want to ensure that the use, and disposal, of such assets is transparent, sensible and designed for the long term. It would be undesirable if assets built up during many decades were squandered, turned into cash or debt or leased with abandon.
<P>
The corporation, or whatever one might call it, should be open in the way in which it handles such assets, and the processes relating to property disposals should be transparent. So-called windfalls from the sale of properties should not be subject to strange decisions. The amendment is not onerous; reporting would be at the end of the financial year, and would be limited to the disposal of significant property.
<P>
The amendment would limit the reporting requirement to the first five years of the Post Office company's life, as past experience has shown that bodies tend to dispose of significant surplus property relatively soon after a change in corporate structure.
<P>
The situation is similar to that in Germany, where Deutsche Post financed the acquisition of shares in DHL Worldwide Express by the sale of real estate, which was the capital endowment for Deutsche Post when it was made into a company. The Post Office will have assets, and we would appreciate hearing from the Minister a description of what he thinks will be the limit on the Post Office sticking long-term brick-and-mortar assets into cash for short-term gain, either by selling a lease or by disposing of a property. We do not want a fire sale of the bricks and mortar behind the Post Office asset structure to go ahead in a way that none of us would understand.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> It is up to Government Members to ask Opposition Members not to place regulatory burdens on a commercially free Post Office. We have heard a great deal recently from the Opposition about regulatory burdens, and the amendment would add an unnecessary regulatory burden on the Post Office. I understand some of the sentiments behind the amendments, but they would unnecessarily restrict the Post Office plc's freedom to take decisions in the best interests of the business, its customers and users.
<P>
To ensure that there is a level playing field that there is no illegal state aid for the Post Office company to enter new markets and that the Post Office company does not abuse its dominant position or otherwise act in an anti-competitive manner, we are establishing, through the Bill, a regulator and licensing regime. 
<P>
As the Committee will know from previous debates, it is expected that the Post Office company will be granted a licence that will take effect from the first day of the new licensing regime. The licence, to be agreed between the Post Office company and the Postal Services Commission, should include provisions that satisfy the detailed requirements under the European Union postal services directive. We have distributed a draft outline of that licence which illustrates the kind of terms and conditions that the Government expect to see in the Post Office plc's licence. One such condition, which is seen at paragraph 9 on page 4 of the outline licence, is for the Post Office company to keep separate accounts in its internal accounting system for each of the activities carried out within the reserved area on the one hand and outside the reserved area on the other. Furthermore, accounts for the non-reserved area must distinguish between activities that are part of the universal service and those that are not. That will enable the commission to ensure there is no undue cross-subsidy from monopoly to competitive markets.
<P>
It is also intended that it will be a condition of the Post Office company's licence that it competes within the law and does not abuse its dominant position, enter into anti-competitive agreements or use anti-competitive means to enter new markets or consolidate its position in its existing markets. The Post Office company will also, like any other postal operator, licensed or not, be subject to general competition rules.
<P>
The amendments are therefore unnecessary. They also, rather than ensure a level playing field, tip it to the disadvantage of the Post Office company and the advantage of its competitors. Opposition members claim that they want to give the Post Office greater commercial freedom and want to see a level playing field, but they propose through the amendments to restrict the Post Office's commercial freedom to an unprecedented level and thereby limit competition. Instead of allowing greater commercial freedom, they would restrict it to less than that available to the existing public corporation, because they repeat what is in the Post Office Act 1969. It cannot be right to ask the Post Office to take a step backwards.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton referred to the case being pursued by the European Commission against Deutsche Post in Germany. He should be aware that the United Kingdom Post Office has funded acquisitions not through the sale of property, as Deutsche Post did, but through borrowing.
<P>
The Post Office is ceasing to use buildings that are no longer appropriate to its need either by moving into new buildings or by developing other business to accommodate the relevant activity. Against that background, in this financial year the Post Office is on target to achieve £75 million in capital receipts from property disposal, the largest elements of which are from the sale of properties in Edinburgh, Plymouth and Swindon. However, this will be the final year of disposals in big city-centre sites. The Post Office estimates that receipts from property sales will fall by two thirds to £25 million in the next financial year.
<P>
The problem has probably been highlighted to Opposition Members by the couriers, who are very interested in what is happening in Germany. They briefed the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton on the amendment, but, if it is carried, we shall tilt the playing field away from the Post Office and in favour of its competitors.
<P>
I ask Opposition Members to seek to withdraw the amendment, if only for the simple reason that we cannot say to the Post Office: ``Here is a brave new world of greater commercial freedom. We shall restrict you more than the 1969 Act did.'' [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley says from a sedentary position that the Conservatives are a party of regulation and regulatory burdens. That may be true, but let us not allow them to impose that regulation on the Committee through the amendments. I ask the Committee to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): I had not intended to make any remarks on the clause, but I find it a bit rich for the Minister to come to the Committee and speak about Conservative Members introducing regulation and burdens when 1999 was the record year for burdens being placed on British industry and business by the Government. We are living in a world of spin and no substance when a Minister can make such an inaccurate statement with an absolutely straight face, backed up by his ``alocytes'' in the back row, who would not know what the Minister is talking about.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Or stalagmites.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Stalagmites, yes.
<P>
The Minister is slightly schizophrenic on this issue, because one minute the Post Office will be free in the commercial world and the next minute we are looking at clauses 51, 52 and 53, which throw back to the Secretary of State the strings that operate it. Serving for many years on the Public Accounts Committee, I have seen privatisations that could have accrued more money for the state if there had been a better process for disposing of property and better control. That is the reason for my hon. Friend's amendment. He wishes to ensure that it will be a level playing field—that terrible phrase that we have all used—and that resources are applied fairly, without this form of cross-subsidy. It is a bit rich when the hon. Member for Chorley accuses us of being the party of burdens.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that there is a brake on any headlong rush in the frenzy of the Post Office's acquiring plc status to dilute assets and create an illusion of cash benefit. They would simply ensure that the Post Office did not get carried away and go down a short-term path that might have long-term disadvantages. However, on the basis of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 35, line 24, after `of' insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Part VII of'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a simple, technical amendment. In response to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton in the previous debate, from my association with the Post Office over the past 30-odd years I would not say that the words ``Post Office'' and ``frenzy'' go together. Also, I am sure that my ``alocytes'' sitting behind me, whatever they may be, will agree with the amendment.
<P>
We are pressed for time, but I should deal with the wording of clause 64(4). It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this section `annual accounts' means annual accounts (within the meaning of the Companies Act 1985).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment simply points out that that meaning is contained in part VII of the 1985 Act. The amendment will add the appropriate wording, and it is my great honour and privilege to move it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<b>Mr. Duncan:</b> The clause will require the Post Office to provide information such as capital expenditure forecasts and profit forecasts. Clearly, the flow of such information is crucial to the important relationship that will continue, for better or worse, between the Post Office and the Treasury. We welcome the provision, inasmuch as it is necessary to the chosen form of ownership.

<H4><center>Excercise of functions through nominees</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 36, line 6, leave out `or 53' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, 53 or [Further provisions relating to the capital structure of the Post Office company] (3) and (4)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 140 to 144 and 147 and Government new clause 3—Further provisions relating to the capital structure of the Post Office company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> This is really about new clause 3: the amendments with which it is grouped are consequential. As was noted this morning, the new clause will give the Secretary of State further powers to restructure by April 2002 the Post Office company's balance sheet by injecting debt to create a commercial level of gearing, and removing from it value that represents reserves accumulated because the company could not, as a statutory corporation, pay the Government a dividend. It will enable the Secretary of State to make directions in respect of debts owed by the Post Office company, including debentures and bonds. Those powers are to be exercised only after consultation with the Post Office company. They are not limited to the period in which the company is owned wholly by the Crown, as the timing of restructuring in relation to any commercial partnering of the Post Office cannot be predicted and flexibility is required. However, the Secretary of State may repeal the section by order, and the intention is to do so once the Post Office company's balance sheet has been restructured and the section's purpose is spent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> All that I would wish to say is that the provision will pave the way for the future form of the Post Office. As the wheel turns and the Post Office wants to act freely in the international commercial world in which it will compete, this commercial arrangement will prove valuable. In other words, the provision will help with privatisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> For the record, the provision will not aid the privatisation of the Post Office; it is about giving it greater commercial freedom and restructuring its balance sheet accordingly. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) should move away from his obsession with privatisation. Everything that he said until that point was sweet reason.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It would help me if hon. Members would rise when they are seeking to catch my eye.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I do not mind what happens, as long as we can debate something. It seems pointless to knock off after 20 minutes. I always thought that Governments had a duty to try to get their business through the House as expeditiously as possible. We are willing to go on to clause 85, but Labour Members are knocking off after 20 minutes. What has happened to the work ethic?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order. It is entirely a matter for the Committee to choose how much time it allocates to various sections of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Betts:</B> I beg to move, That the Bill be further considered on Thursday next at half-past One o'clock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We have no argument with the politeness and cordial conduct shown by the Government in their management of the Committee. However, it must be placed on record that the reason for this adjournment is that they have introduced a piece of legislation that is not yet ready for scrutiny and debate. It was made clear by the Secretary of State on Second Reading that the Government intended to table a raft of amendments—he knew the number, but was not prepared to tell the House. It is now clear that that raft of amendments is not ready for the Committee to scrutinise.
<P>
Conservative Members have attempted to adopt a constructive approach to the Bill. We have not delayed; we have not been awkward. The clauses that needed to be scrutinised have been scrutinised; those that did not, have not. However, there is now to be a gap in our proceedings because, as the Government would have it, the parliamentary draftsmen do not have their details in place. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to tell us what is planned, as he knows the details, so that we can properly order our thoughts and our work in order to scrutinise the Bill, without having last-minute amendments and too little time in which to assess them properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I appreciate that Conservative Members have carefully scrutinised the Bill.
<P>
It is not unusual for successive Governments—whatever political party is in power—to amend Bills as they go through Committee. This Bill is no different. As I explained during our debate on the sittings motion, we are dealing with a company that has been publicly owned since 1631 and that has references to it littered all over United Kingdom legislation. We are, therefore, faced with a difficult task. It is noteworthy that the Bill has been so elegantly and beautifully formed that we have managed to proceed more quickly than usual, thus allowing us to catch up with the drafting of amendments. I make that point in defence of the people who work very hard to draft them.
<P>
I was asked, during the debate on the sittings motion, to ensure that a host of amendments would not be tabled on Report, as that would prevent the Committee from scrutinising them. We acknowledged that request, and we want as many amendments as possible to be debated by the Committee. Furthermore, we intend to allow plenty of time for Opposition Members to debate those amendments. That will not cause us to spend even less time with our families than usual. We shall do our best to clear the clauses on Thursday. There are new clauses to be drafted and we can debate some on Thursday and some next Tuesday. We may then need one further sitting. We are not trying to delay the Committee unduly; we are trying to ensure that new clauses and amendments are tabled in Committee whenever possible and that those new clauses and amendments are as well drafted as the provisions already in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Normally, one tries to ensure that amendments keep pace with the Bill. We could have had an interesting discussion this morning on the meaning of ``irritancy'' and ``reverters'', but we were cheated and I never received a reply on South Newington post office. I understand the Minister's difficulties, but would it be fair and reasonable to request that the amendments are tabled by Thursday afternoon so that we all know where we stand?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am sorry, I did not hear the question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> If stumps are being drawn now until Thursday afternoon, would it be possible for the vast majority of the new amendments to be tabled by Thursday so that we all know where we stand?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I certainly hope that the majority of the amendments will be tabled by Thursday. There will be 15 or 20 new clauses and we hope to have 10 of them tabled before Thursday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am extremely surprised to hear that there will be so many new clauses. I sympathise with my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), who expressed disappointment that we could not continue. If I had known that we would run into this brick wall, I would have wanted to speak for longer on some of the previous clauses. I know that it would be distinctly out of order if I raised all my concerns again on clause 57.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Distinctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Yes. That is why I shall not do that. Clause 57 gives the Secretary of State immense control over the operation of the post office.
<P>
We have here the American football equivalent of a time out while the Government try to get their team back together with the wounds dressed and the bandages in place so that they can come out and play again. So far today, we have had a demonstration of the Government's schizophrenic approach. At one moment they suggest an open, fair, full and free Post Office and then suddenly, wham, we see all the clauses referring to the Secretary of State. I am exceedingly disappointed.
<P>
I was about to prepare my peroration for the end of the Committee stage, and to congratulate the Minister on not making the sort of mess of it that is being made of the Utilities Bill, on which hundreds of amendments have been tabled and clauses withdrawn. Now we hear that all these new clauses must be tabled and that the Government need a few hours to get their act together on Thursday morning. I hope that the Minister—I am looking him straight in the eye—can table the amendments by close of play today so that they can be properly prepared and we can respond to them in full as necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> There is a serious matter here. We all have a duty to scrutinise legislation properly. The antiphony of argument in the Committee is our chosen way of doing that. I do not know at the moment how substantive the new clauses will be.
<P>
We knew that some amendments would be tabled, and that they might have a significant effect on a Bill, but new clauses usually have greater significance.
<P>
The Committee stage requires the Minister and his support team to do a lot of work and Opposition Members, with rather less support, also have to do a lot of work. Other people with an interest in the Bill must also find time to assess the meaning of the new clauses and to lobby the Minister and the Opposition so that their arguments can be made on their behalf in the Committee. The new clauses that the Minister intends to table may be immediately understood and the issues may be clear without the benefit of briefing from interested parties. It may be easy to reach a point of view, but there is a risk that that may not be so. Will the Minister assure the Committee that if any of the new clauses require further outside consultation time will be made available or they will be left until Report? To ensure that the Bill is as effective as possible, will the Minister give an undertaking that nothing will be bounced on the Committee to the exclusion of interested parties who, properly, have a role to play in the passage of the Bill? We are not playing games, but we do not want anyone to be unfairly treated by seeing a new clause slipped in under the wire at the last minute without proper opportunity to study it in detail.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the Committee is aware that unless clauses are tabled by close of business tonight, they cannot be debated on Thursday. They would be starred amendments if they were tabled tomorrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I did not expect to be scragged on this issue. We want to carry forward an atmosphere of genuine debate, scrutiny and hard work in the Committee. We concentrated on getting the main aspects of the Bill ready and we have done that. It is a matter of judgment and I hesitate to go too far, but Conservative Members need not fear that the new clauses are world-shattering. For the most part, they are technical clauses and when Opposition Members see them, they will understand the problems involved in drafting technical clauses.
<P>
I can give the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton the assurance that he seeks. We want to give plenty of notice and if I see any contentious issues with fireworks exploding, I shall ensure that Opposition Members, and the hon. Gentleman in particular, are informed as soon as possible. We certainly want plenty of notice to be given so that the issues can be properly debated.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
