to the conclusion of my remarks before the Committee adjourned. What
will happen next is that the Ministry of Justice, which has
responsibility for the issue of representative actions and matters
across the entire civil justice sector, will respond to the Civil
Justice Council. We have done a piece of work that has fed into its
deliberations and we would wish to consult, before the recess, on
whether representative actions should come into play in tribunals. If
we could accomplish that, we would expect it to report and for us to
respond early in the autumn, so any legislative provision would be
unlikely to catch this Bill before it goes to the Lords. However, we
would seek to introduce such a provision when the Bill, which is the
obvious legislative vehicle for such a measure, is in the
Lords.</div><a name="09062575000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062575000119"></a><b class="B">Emily

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000128"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I rise to speak to amendment 16. Before I do so,
I should say that I am conscious that the entire Committee wants to
make progress this afternoon, and that amendments 17 and 18 are on
topics which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have given a
thorough airing under clause 73. Therefore, rather than go over the
same ground, I am not planning to speak to those two amendments, and I
give notice of my intention not to press them.</div>
<a name="09062575000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
16, there is more of a substantive issue about which we want to probe
the Minister. It is to do with what an appropriate recommendation from
a tribunal might involve. There is a definition of an appropriate
recommendation in clause 118(3). It
is</div><a name="09062575000091"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
recommendation that within a specified period the respondent takes
specified steps for the purpose of obviating or reducing the adverse
effect of any
matter&#148;.</div><a name="09062575000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to know the Government&#146;s thinking. Over what period might
that take place? What is the scope of the recommendation? What is the
force of a recommendation as opposed to an
instruction?</div><a name="09062575000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that all members of the Committee would agree that it may be
necessary, when a finding has been made that an organisation has been
behaving in an illegal fashion, for that organisation to clean up its
act and to change what it is doing, potentially substantially.
Obviously, how it is asked to do that could have a profound impact on
what it actually does. First, therefore, will the provision have
binding effect? I presume so, but the word is
&#147;recommendation&#148;. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the
degree of compulsion that is inherent in the Government&#146;s
intentions.</div>
<a name="09062575000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
Conservative party is concerned to provide enough leeway that
organisations which are instructed to achieve a particular
outcome&#151;a desirable outcome that would reduce
discrimination&#151;may be able to come up with new and different
ways of achieving that outcome which may not entirely be those which
were originally envisioned by the tribunal under its recommendation. We
wonder whether the Government were envisaging that tribunals will
mandate process&#151;steps to be carried out regardless of the
outcome&#151;or whether they will say, &#147;You must achieve this
or that and you have a degree of flexibility about
how.&#148;</div>
<a name="09062575000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
that that is important is, first, that organisations will often come up
with creative solutions that are not necessarily envisaged by lawyers
and their representatives in the tribunals. Secondly, things change
over time. It says in the clause that a recommendation must be
&#147;within a specified period&#148; but if that specified period
lasts a good long time&#151;it could, in theory, be five or ten
years&#151;and the world moves on, the organisation merges or splits,
or the sector in which it is working alters in a profound way, it might
be that, if it were mandated to take process steps to change what it
was doing internally, those steps would cease to be effective. I am
sure that no one here would want that. Therefore, any recommendations
need to be future-proof. We must ensure that, if the world changes,
such organisations are still bound to achieve the mandated outcomes and
make sure they are not behaving in a discriminatory, or otherwise
disadvantaging fashion.</div>
<a name="09062575000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
to probe the Government on how they intend to deal with those issues,
and what they believe the scope and powers will allow them to
do&#151;either 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>here, in secondary legislation or in guidance&#151;to ensure that they
do not fall into any of the various pitfalls that I have
described.</div><a name="09062575000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000129"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I shall speak briefly. I had not intended to speak
at all, but I am afraid that the Solicitor-General provoked me this
morning in the Chamber, at women and equality questions, when she
implied that we did not think that we should do anything about the
gender pay gap. We said at length when we debated an earlier clause
that we acknowledged that there was a problem. We simply disagreed
about the solutions. Amendment 17, as best we could draft
it, would put our policy into the Bill. That is why we tabled it. My
hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare said that we did not want
to spend a long time discussing the amendment because the issue had a
thorough airing when we debated the earlier clause. I think that all
members of the Committee would agree with that. However, given what the
Solicitor-General said in the Chamber, I want to remind the Committee
that we think that this is a problem that needs solving; we simply
disagree with the Government about the nature of the solution. We
discussed that issue thoroughly and I am sure that we shall return to
it at later stages and in the other place. I think that that is all
that needs to be said.</div>
<a name="09062575000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000130"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> If I have understood correctly, it is
amendment 17 that will not be pressed. Is it also amendment 18? That
amendment would remove the power of tribunals to award compensation if
a respondent fails to comply with a recommendation. That relates to the
question from the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare about the measure
of compulsion. That is the default availability. The tribunal could
award or increase compensation if a recommendation is not
accepted.</div>
<a name="09062575000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 16
would remove the current power to make recommendations. I do not
suppose that is what the hon. Gentleman intended, either&#151;it is
probably just the way it is drafted. He just wants me to say what reach
into business these proposals would offer.</div>
<a name="09062575000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000131"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Amendment 18 would leave out subsection
(7). I think I am right that the order that the tribunal can make to
increase compensation applies only under subsection (2)(b)&#151;only
where the order is to pay compensation specifically to the complainant.
It is not in relation to the recommendation of a more general nature
that the tribunal might make to the business. I think that I am right
in saying
that.</div><a name="09062575000052"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000132"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is right, I am told. It is about
the reach. The key is that any recommendations made to benefit the
broader work force and indeed the business would have to be
proportionate to the case that is brought, otherwise it would be
unlawful. That is a general principle that has found greater emphasis
since we brought the European convention into our law. To answer the
specific point about time, it would have to be a reasonable period.
There might be more creative ways of doing something that a tribunal
recommends. The sensible thing would be for the parties to get together
first, discuss it and suggest it to the tribunal, which could then
recommend it. If parties thought there were a better way forward, that
approach would give the tribunal the opportunity to avoid recommending
something that was perhaps less suitable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div><a name="09062575000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000133"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the Minister for her explanation, which I
think she is part way through&#151;it is clear so far. On that last
point, in her experience, do tribunals tend to mandate outcomes or
process? Is that a matter on which the Government have guidance and
which they are able to influence, given that tribunals will want to be
independent in many
respects?</div><a name="09062575000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000134"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Some typical recommendations that might
help include taking steps to implement a harassment policy more
effectively; providing equal opportunities training for staff involved
in promotion procedures; and introducing more transparent selection
criteria in recruitment transfer or promotion processes. Those seem to
be fairly process-based. Those are the examples that I have, so I
assume that they are typical and that that is the nature of likely
recommendations.</div><a name="09062575000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is that if a problem that goes beyond the individual claimant has
been found, it must be in everyone&#146;s interest for the tribunal
to recommend that it be put right so that the next complainant does not
have to come and, as it were, clog up the
works.</div><a name="09062575000094"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09062575000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000135"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point; I see what
she is driving at. My concern is that if, for example, equal
opportunities training was mandated, people might go through training
and come out the other side having ticked all the right boxes, but not
necessarily adhere to it afterwards. I am trying to make a point about
the difference between mandating an outcome to be achieved by whatever
means, which still leaves a duty and a burden on the organisation to
achieve it, and mandating a process whereby, when it is complete, the
organisation can say, &#147;We did it, whether or not the outcome was
as desired originally by the
tribunal.&#148;</div><a name="09062575000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000136"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I suppose it is difficult to be able to
say to a business, &#147;Employ 10 more black and minority ethnic
staff.&#148; If the problem is in that territory, the limitation is
probably to say, &#147;Have better recruitment processes. Train your
middle management with the intention of getting rid of that
problem.&#148; I do not think that there is anything to be concerned
about. It is a pretty simple, logical follow-on to a finding in a
tribunal that there is a problem and a recommendation on how best to
put it
right.</div><a name="09062575000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000137"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> May I pick up one more point? When we discussed
clause 107 on class actions, or representative actions, the Minister
said that proportionality would be important. I do not know whether it
was in the consultation paper, but if there is to be a representative
action, which by definition covers a lot of people, it follows that the
appropriate recommendation might be more significant because it affects
more people. Is that explicitly in the consultation document? It would
be worth bringing that out so that it was clear to people, because it
follows logically from what she

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000138"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that
it follows logically. There is a need for a proportion. If one is
bringing an action on behalf of 2,000 people, one can reach a lot
further and be more wholesale than if it involves just one individual,
although if one is pinpointing the same problem for the 2,000 that the
individual pinpointed, there might not be a need for anything bigger.
Obviously, we ought to make that point in any consultation document so
that people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div>understand that a possible consequence of representative actions is that
recommendations reach further or go wider. I hope the hon. Gentleman is
satisfied.</div><a name="09062575000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the problem of recommending an outcome is that it might not be within
the business&#146;s power to guarantee achieving it, so that would be
unfair. Another point is that by the time an employee gets to a
tribunal with an employer, quite often the relationship has broken down
and the employee has gone, so a recommendation confined to that
employee has no effect at all. That is why it is better to have
available the power to make
recommendations.</div><a name="09062575000061"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000140"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Again, I hope to be brief. My question is simple.
The clause makes it clear that if someone wishes to bring a claim for
breach of an equality clause or rule, they must normally do so within
six months of the end of their employment contract. Members of the
armed forces have an additional three months in which to bring a claim,
as they must first make a complaint under service complaints
procedures. Is there any scope for that time limit to be changed if the
service complaints procedure takes more than three months? The next
clause, which is supplementary to this, allows that to happen for cases
defined as
non-standard.</div><a name="09062575000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that in the example of the armed forces, the delay would not be
deliberate, but if the service complaints procedure took a long
time&#151;if, for example, witnesses or other people needed to
participate in the process were on active duty on the front
line&#151;that might disadvantage the complainant. Will the tribunal
or somebody else have the power either to extend the time limit or to
decide that the case is non-standard under clause 124, so that the
individual will not be disadvantaged and an unreasonable burden to
accelerate the process will not be placed on the armed forces? That
might not be possible or might affect the operational effectiveness of
the armed
forces.</div><a name="09062575000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000141"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I will check whether that mechanism is
available, but I suspect that one would put the application in to the
tribunal anyway and agree not to action it to protect the time limit
while the complaints process was under way. That often happens anyway
in court cases where a time limit must be met: one does not take any
further steps, but just fulfils the time limit. However, I will see in
a moment whether I can get a better answer to the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062575000143"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I want to raise an issue about the clause, Lady
Winterton, so I hope you will let me do so now. Then, I suspect, we
will not need to debate clause stand part. The clause sets it out that,
under current legislation, in most cases the burden of proof is
reversed once the claimant has established a case to an initial level.
However, the explanatory notes say
that</div><a name="09062575000092"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
burden of proof is currently not reversed in race discrimination claims
brought on grounds of colour and nationality; claims of victimisation
which relate to race discrimination; non-work disability discrimination
claims; and sex discrimination claims which relate to the exercise of
public functions. In these areas the burden of proof will now be
reversed once the claimant establishes his or her case to an initial
level.&#148;</div><a name="09062575000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect the Minister&#146;s answer will be brief, but why is it that
under the current law the burden of proof was not reversed in those
cases, and why have the Government decided to change that? It may be
self-evidently right to reverse it, and perhaps there were some very
good reasons why that did not happen in the past. I am curious and it
would help the Committee to know about the
principles.</div>
