we are. Of course, members of the Committee may do so, but only if the
devices are in silent mode and used with discretion and without
disturbing the Committee in any shape, size or form. My preference for
dress code in Committee remains the same as it is in the main Chamber,
so hon. Gentlemen should keep their coats on. I hope that that is

                  </span> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Gray, particularly as I am new to the
process of private Member’s Bills. I understand from colleagues
with far longer service than I have that this is quite a rare occasion
and your experience will be gratefully
received.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
begin by expressing my gratitude to right hon. and hon. Members and
friends for giving me their most valuable resource this
morning—their time. I am grateful to the Minister for his
support so far and to the shadow Minister for the Labour party’s
support for the Bill’s principles. I want to express special
appreciation to the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles for her
words of advice and encouragement during the Bill’s early
development. Finally, I thank Social Enterprise UK for its assistance
throughout that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Over
the past 11 months since the Bill was discussed on Second Reading, I
have been surprised and warmed by the support that the Bill has
received throughout civil society. Voluntary organisations, community
groups and social enterprises have written to me or contacted my office
to express their support for the Bill, which they believe could,
through their organisations, make a real difference in
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although the
Government have tabled some amendments today, I am pleased that the
Bill’s core principle will remain intact and that its main
thrust, which will level the playing field for civil society, will not
be affected. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                  </div>The amendments will remove the social enterprise strategies from the
Bill. That is a condition of the Government’s support. Although
I hope that the message sent out by the Bill will be that local
authorities should be fully open when consulting social enterprises and
keep them in mind when looking at their local economies and public
services, I must accept that the strategies might have placed too much
of a burden on local authorities when we are asking them to cut costs
and focus on front-line
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000024">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> May I make a little more
progress?<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
many believe that the strategies would force local authorities and the
national Government to consider social enterprise more thoroughly when
planning for the future, the duty to consider consultation—also
under the Bill—will give public bodies the incentive to go out
and talk to the sector, our charities and voluntary organisations and
to work with them on how we can create better procurement systems that
benefit our
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also important to remember that, although the strategies have their
place—nothing prevents the Government or local authorities from
voluntarily creating their own strategies for social
enterprises—the best way in which we can help social enterprise
in the public sector is to reform our procurement process. The Bill
will achieve a big step forward in that respect. Moreover, I agree that
the focus should be on the pre-procurement stage. I believe that that
will make the Bill’s impact stronger, by building in social
value from the outset of the procurement process, so that we imbed
social value throughout the contract process and ensure that, when
criteria relating to social value reach the final stage of the
procurement process, they are relevant and focus the social impact on
those parts of our communities that need it
most.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
of the amendments would strengthen the Bill further. For example,
amendment 5 will insert proposed subsections (2A) and (2B) into clause
3 to ensure that, when reviewing “the relevant area” that
is to be considered for social value, account is taken of the whole
area for which a local authority carries out procurement. Therefore,
social value will be given as wide as possible a scope within a
commissioning authority, and there will be more opportunities for
taking into account during that phase of the procurement process the
excellent work that social enterprises, voluntary organisations and
community groups perform across our
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
reflect the amendments, the title will be changed to the Public
Services (Social Value) Bill. I appreciate that change, which not only
reflects the essential importance of social value—hon. Members
on both sides of the Committee agree that that is the most important
part of the Bill—but provides the snappiness that titles of
private Members’ Bills sometimes
lack.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
putting any Bill on the statute book is a long process, I have been
most pleased by the consensus built around the Bill. In working with
colleagues from all political parties and with organisations from
across civil society, I have been impressed by how everyone has gone
about the business. What matters most is that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                  </div>social value is instilled across public sector procurement to achieve
smarter, more socially aware commissioning. The backing of groups such
as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the
Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, the
National Association for Voluntary and Community Action, Social
Enterprise UK and many others shows how much support the Bill
has.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that, together, we will see the Bill become law, which will be an
important win for social enterprises, charities and voluntary
organisations throughout the country and for smarter public sector
commissioning, which will benefit all our communities. I therefore ask
the Committee to support the Government’s amendments, to move
the Bill another step forward, and I again thank right hon. and hon.
Members for their time. The Bill will change how we do things for the
better, across the country, by opening up public services to those
organisations with the knowledge, skill and dedication to help our
communities, which is what it set out to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000032">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
relation to clauses 1 and 2, on Second Reading, I referred to the Bill
as relatively small but with a big idea and as having the potential to
transform procurement in this country—I think that I called it
small and perfectly formed. I am genuinely disappointed that the Bill,
which was small, is now much smaller in both intent and in
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000034">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
welcome discussion with the Minister and with the hon. Member for
Warwick and Leamington, because I thought the title was important, not
so much in relation to strategies as to the definition of social
enterprise in the Bill. Clauses 1 and 2 give a good definition of
social enterprise. Clause 1(5)(b) provides that a social enterprise has
to be a business that
is<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have pressed several Ministers, whether the Health Secretary or other
Secretaries of State, for a definition of what they mean by social
enterprise. We have heard a lot of rhetoric about mutualisation, about
transforming social enterprise and about putting it at the
forefront of our delivery mechanisms. However, time and again
when I have pressed for a definition, it is like my squeezing a sponge
that slips away from me, because no one appears willing to say that a
social enterprise is one that is carried on for profit, most of which
has to be applied for a public purpose. No one is willing to say that
there should be an asset lock on social enterprises leaving the public
sector to protect the taxpayer’s assets that have been built up
over many years, so that they are not simply transferred to the private
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
had some debate about that on Second Reading, and I had hoped that the
Bill would provide, in legislation, an opportunity to define a social
enterprise. We might still have had arguments about that definition,
because people have different views, but at least there would have been
something on the statute book. I am increasingly worried that the idea
of social enterprise covers a multitude 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 6<a class="bkMark" name="Column6">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of sins and is a very woolly concept. People have come along to various
events thinking that commissioning will be transformed and therefore
that there have to be social enterprises to get the contracts. All
kinds of private organisations are dressing up and putting on the label
of social enterprise. Perhaps they put 5% of their profits back into
the community, but 95% of their profits are basically private
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have no problem with people being in a private sector
enterprise—fine, be a business—but people should be
honest about it and not try to squeeze one form of corporate activity
into what they think is a flavour-of-the-month political position to
take advantage of a commissioning framework. If the commissioning
framework proposed under Government amendments is to be effective in
addressing what I know are the hon. Gentleman’s deep, deep
concerns, we must be far more honest and rigorous in defining the type
of organisations that we want to go forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have a
second concern about deleting clauses 1 and 2. There is a
very good provision for local authorities not only to consult social
enterprises in drawing up a national strategy but to consult the
public. Again, we have amendments that would allow local authorities to
consult the public, but if something is urgent and they are not able to
do so, they would not have to do so. A key part of transforming local
communities means asking what the public want, not just the businesses
that will provide the services. It needs a sense of community
governance of the different forms of organisation. That is where we get
the real community
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister understands that where we involve the users of the service,
the citizens who pay for it and the staff who provide it to get that
whole total approach, we get far more social value out of such
investment. I am worried that we are moving to a simply transactional
process: the local authority purchases a service, which happens to take
place after having an analysis of social value. That is a very small
incremental step, given where we want to be. This is a missed
opportunity to do the transformation that was talked about on Second
Reading. I know the practical pressures that are on the Minister and I
know that the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington is committed, but
I believe that he would want a more transformational
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
we simply end up with another form of transaction—buying the
service that does a little bit of calculation about the social return
on the investment—that does not involve the public, the users
and the people who provide the services, we will not maximise the
impact that we make from our investment. Money is tight across the
public service. The way to multiply social value out of investment is
by ensuring that all partners are involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am
disappointed that the Bill will be smaller. I will support it because
it is an incremental step along the way, but I think that it has been
somewhat eviscerated, given the ideas that the hon. Gentleman
originally proposed. That is not a criticism of him. I know the
practicalities of getting the Government to support any private
Member’s Bill and I think he has done a heroic job in getting
this far, but I would very much like clauses 1 and 2 to remain. I am
not wedded to bureaucratic strategies, but I support the idea of a
definition of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 7<a class="bkMark" name="Column7">&#160;</a>
                  </div>social enterprise that involves all the partners, including the public,

provide.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have concerns about some of the amendments on the process as well, but
on the principle of clauses 1 and 2, I want to say for the
record that I am disappointed that we have not been able to keep them
in the Bill. Perhaps we will have another private Member’s Bill
at some point in the future to bring back some of those items of
substance, and the hon. Gentleman would have my full support in doing
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000045">&#160;</a>

the inevitable intimidation and bullying to which Back Benchers are

nevertheless managed to defend an important part of the Bill.
I genuinely congratulate him on the work he has done,
particularly on clause 3, the fundamentals of which have been protected

relatively technical. The Bill is a worthy and important step forward

               <p class="tabbed">Back
in the mists of time, on 20 January 1999, I had the good fortune to
initiate an Adjournment debate in the House on social enterprises, so I
feel that I have returned to my past by having the privilege of taking
part in this debate. In the Adjournment debate back in ‘99 I
urged the then Government to introduce an overarching strategy that
would tackle the lack of recognition and effective support for social
enterprises—my right hon. Friend touched on that—and the
inability of too many social entrepreneurs and social enterprises to
access finance. We have come a long way since that Adjournment debate,
not least thanks to the considerable work of many members of the
previous Government, including my right hon.
Friend.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000049">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
would be interested to hear the Minister’s reason for trying to
persuade the Committee that clause 1 should not stand part of the Bill.
I suspect that he remembers his own private Member’s Bill, the
Sustainable Communities Act 2007, which also requires local authorities
to prepare strategies for making things better. Clauses 1 and 2 of the
Bill seek to amend that Act in a relatively small way, and I suspect
that, if he were to be honest with the Committee or in private, he has
lost an argument with his friends in the Department for Communities and

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Local Government. The idea that a social enterprise strategy would be a
huge burden on Whitehall or on local authorities is a little
far-fetched. Deleting clauses 1 and 2 and changing the Bill’s
title would gut many of the potentially huge wins that the Bill might
deliver, notwithstanding the benefits of clause
3.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000050">&#160;</a>

Minister, given the training he has received from many of my former
constituents in Pinner and Hatch End, will no doubt merit promotion at
some stage, and the Minister who comes after him may not have his
apparent commitment to promoting social enterprises or his apparent
clout in Whitehall—I take that at face value because I have not
had the chance to study his record in office. In the absence of a
Minister with such enthusiasm, who will encourage the Government to
come together to ensure that cross-Whitehall commitment to addressing
the problems faced by social enterprises is maintained beyond these
first months of the coalition

had with the Work programme and the problems of Central Surrey Health,
a social enterprise set up to win contracts from the NHS, which is a
big society award winner that has lost out to a private sector player.
The benefit of having a strategy is that it creates political space, a
dialogue and a conversation across Whitehall and the sector, allowing
them to think through the challenges faced by social enterprises and
what can be done to meet those
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000052">&#160;</a>

that we should be not only having a conversation, but doing something?
Whitehall is littered with strategies and box-ticking, followed by
award ceremonies for those who have ticked most boxes. Should we not be

talking about it?<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000053">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but we
must have the opportunity to discuss what needs to be done and what
role Government can play in helping social enterprises to flourish. Had
I been given the opportunity, early on, to try and influence the hon.
Member for Warwick and Leamington in the drafting of the Bill, I would
have wanted the clause to be somewhat tougher. I might have wanted to
include a requirement to report to Parliament on the strategy’s
progress.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Nevertheless,
potentially, the clause creates a vehicle for ensuring that the
Government are clearly accountable for their progress in supporting the
development of the social enterprise sector. In the clause, the hon.
Gentleman would allow the Government to make up their own mind about
whether the strategy should be reviewed. Again, I hope we might have
encouraged the hon. Gentleman, with hindsight, to require them to do so
to see how the strategy is working. They might review it after three
years—certainly after five. That is the requirement in other
areas of legislation, and it would toughen up the clause. In so doing,
it would help to ensure that there remained in other Departments across
government—not just the Minister’s—the capacity to
think through the issues affecting social enterprise. It would require
senior officials in each part of Whitehall always to be thinking about
what else they could do to help such 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>social enterprises. Clearly, there are problems with how those in health

social enterprises, and with the scale of cuts in funding for local

social enterprise being important, and she is correct. Looking back, we
can see that that definition has been elusive. I remember at business
school back in the 1980s being taught by Amitai Etzioni, who was
advancing his own view about the definition of social enterprise and
its role. That definition has evolved greatly over the 20 or
so—maybe even 30—years since. The right hon. Lady
mentioned that an asset lock was important, and many of us would agree,
although it is not part of the definition in the Bill. She made the
good point that that is such an important issue that perhaps it should
be in a different Bill. There are many different views on that, and the
circumstances are evolving. It would be a shame to hold up the progress
that can be made now on the impact of social value and procurement

intervention projects, which I feel are the best example of where we
can save money and have a transformational effect on people’s
lives. Much of that work is best carried out by social enterprises
together with other community groups. The Government have now adopted
the previous Government’s proposal on family intervention
projects; I think that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government is talking about the top 100,000 families, which is
absolutely where we ought to be. That is to some extent why I support
my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow West on the need for a strategy.
As I said, I am not wedded to strategies simply to have them lie about
Whitehall and tick boxes. If one wants integrated service provision, it
is essential to get all the Departments lined up, facing in the same
direction and coming together for that purpose. The hon. Gentleman made

                  </strong> I appreciate the right hon. Lady’s
comments. Strategy could happen in two ways. I agree with her that we
do not want to see another report on the shelf. However, we are at a
period in our history, with the circumstances of our public finances
and the evolution of different forms of social and corporate
enterprise, where strategy will emerge from action, rather than being
dictated or viewed from the top. We have the opportunity by passing the
Bill to learn an enormous amount to help us with the definition of the
two parts. That is why it is so important that we move forward with the
Bill and that we encourage—through our words, deeds and
legislation—all the things that will help us to create the
knowledge that in two or three years’ time will enable us to
have a much deeper and richer understanding of the strategy. For that
reason, I shall support the Government on the Bill. I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington on enabling us
together to paint a better future for our
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000068">&#160;</a>

read the Bill, I was hugely impressed and I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington. When I saw the
Government amendments, I felt that the Bill had had the heart ripped
out of it, if I am honest. I was particularly taken with the comments
of the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles. The last thing that I

extensively in procurement policy, particularly procurement from small

of administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000070">&#160;</a>

hear from the Minister whether it would be possible to move forward
incrementally, particularly in the definition of social enterprise, as
mentioned by the right hon. Lady. Perhaps something like that could be
built into the Bill in a Government amendment on Third Reading. That
would take the ideals and the practicality of ensuring that the Bill is
effective and achieves its aims as far as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000071">&#160;</a>

remarks that I made on Second Reading. In contrast to some of my
colleagues, I am delighted that the Government plan to remove clause 1.
I am sure that we all wish to live in a society where the ties of
voluntary association that bind us together and cause us to strengthen
bonds of fellow-feeling are increased. We all value that richness of
relationships, which is the basis of human flourishing. I can think of
nothing more likely to trample and destroy those bonds of voluntary
association than a national or, indeed, local strategy to make it
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000072">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I welcome the

recognise the need to be clear about what a social enterprise is; that
is a conversation we could certainly have. Perhaps we know one when we
see 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 12<a class="bkMark" name="Column12">&#160;</a>
                  </div>it—mutuality, friendly societies, co-operatives and people coming
together voluntarily to serve one another—and, of course, I am
all in favour of that. Local and national strategies may be more
prejudicial to success than helpful, so I am delighted to support the
Government’s stand against clauses 1 and
2.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000073">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
pay a sincere tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and
Leamington, both personally and on behalf of the Government, not just
for his choice of Bill but the skill with which he has built a
coalition of the willing and his patience throughout a frustrating
process. I speak from experience, having shepherded the Sustainable
Communities Act 2007 through Parliament, which was a tortuous process.
I was helped not least by the then Labour Secretary of State, the right
hon. Member for Salford and Eccles, who was extremely helpful. I
heartily congratulate my hon. Friend on what he has achieved so
far.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Building
a coalition around the Bill is no small feat, and it is worth stepping
back and focusing on what we agree on, because it is another milestone
or stepping stone on quite a long journey. I am prepared to pay full
tribute to the previous Administration for their sincere efforts to
support social enterprises, led by the right hon. Lady. I think that we
all agree on the need to try to encourage more intelligent
commissioning.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Most of the
people charged with spending hundreds of millions of pounds of
taxpayers’ money are doing an incredibly difficult job at this
time, and we must support them in doing that job as intelligently as
possible. In the current circumstances, when there is much less money
around, that means trying to extract as much value from every pound of
taxpayers’ money as possible. There is a debate about what value
means in that process, and there is a lot of agreement in the Committee
that value should extend just beyond the lowest price. We want those
who buy on behalf of taxpayers to have the freedom to think with a
little more latitude about wider social, environmental and economic
value in the long term. Most of us who have become engaged with the
issue know the difficulty and the challenge of trying to break through.
It is a cultural challenge as much as anything, when managing risk in
the public
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bill is an important stepping stone in the process; it is not the end
of the journey, but it moves things along the road to more intelligent
commissioning. It encourages innovation, leadership and perhaps some
risk, because the risk attached to the status quo is so high. The cost
of the status quo, which is that we are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 13<a class="bkMark" name="Column13">&#160;</a>
                  </div>failing to deliver value on, is high and consistently underestimated by
the system. There is cross-party agreement—it was good to hear
the shadow Minister articulate it—on the need to try to make it
easier for social enterprises and not-for-profit organisations to
participate in public service and to play a bigger role in challenging
the status quo.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Bill goes
with the grain of that, and certainly with the grain of what the
Government are trying to achieve through public service reform, not
least—this was not mentioned in speeches—the new
best-value duty that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government has placed on local authorities to
consider value, including social value, in all contracts throughout the
process and a recurrence of extensive consultation with
end-users.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Bill goes
with the grain of what the Government want to support and what previous
Governments have wanted to support, so its principle is welcome, but
the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles and the shadow Minister,
who also served as a Minister, both know better than I do that, in
government, one has to strike balances. In this situation, we need to
strike a balance between the imposition of new duties and our desire to
streamline, speed up and make processes more efficient, because there
are lots of complaints from social enterprises and charities about how
slow the process can be.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
legislators, we all have a responsibility, when considering proposals
and new legislation, first, to ask whether a new law is needed and,
secondly, to ensure that that law is focused on what will make an
impact and a difference. That brings me to our first set of amendments
to clause 1. We believe that clauses 1 and 2 should be deleted. The
logic flows across both clauses, so, with your permission, Mr Gray, I
will speak to clause 2 as well as clause
1.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000082">&#160;</a>

that we would be extremely happy to consider it in Committee, but that
we would make amendments. I was explicit at that time in saying that we
wanted to remove clauses 1 and 2, because we believe that it is not
necessary to legislate in this context. That comes back to a
fundamental point that has been touched on by various people: I am all
for strategies, but they have to be driven by need and

               <p class="tabbed">Where
legislation becomes a bureaucratic box-ticking exercise, it loses
tremendous value. I remember being aghast in my first Parliament about
the amount of documents and papers that came thudding through the mail
box into the office and then sat on shelves. There were strategy
documents covering all manner of things. I increasingly questioned
whether they would make any difference to anyone. Precisely because I
want local authority leaders and commissioners to embrace social
enterprises and take forward this agenda with conviction, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 14<a class="bkMark" name="Column14">&#160;</a>
                  </div>I do not want this to involve a sense of duty to comply with a
bureaucratic exercise. We have mentioned sustainable communities and
sustainable community strategies. Too often, glossy brochures are
produced because they have to be and not enough conviction and thought
are put into them.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, there is an explicit coalition Government commitment to encourage
and support social enterprise mutuals to make it easier for them to
participate in public service. Before I give way to the shadow
Minister, I will say that there is an enormous amount of activity going
on to support social enterprise, but there is a fundamental point about
whether we need to legislate to require central Government and local
authorities to produce social enterprise strategies. I fear that we
would lose something in that process. We want to persuade people. We
want to see real leadership. If this just becomes a bureaucratic
function that everyone has to do, there is a danger that we will be
working against
ourselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000089">&#160;</a>

capital, which, as he and the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles

brakes on the expansion of social enterprises. My hon. Friend the

Gentleman’s first intervention. The document was entirely
focused on what we are doing to try to grow the social investment
market. It is a small, fledgling, embryonic but real market, and we are
extremely excited about its potential, because if we can achieve our
aim—the strategy sets out a number of avenues of activity, not
least the creation of Big Society Capital—we will make it easier
for social entrepreneurs to access capital. Over many years, such
people have told us consistently that difficulties relating to that are
the biggest barrier to growth.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000093">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman is entirely right that other
elements are involved, not least the opening up of new markets for
social enterprises, which was discussed a lot in the social investment
strategy and is at the heart of the public service reform White Paper,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are trying
to create new market opportunities for social enterprises and to make
it easier for them to access capital in addition to the Big Society
Capital project, which is working towards creating a new institution
with £600 million of capital. That is a serious play in this
area. We have also announced that we will set aside at least £10
million for a technical assistance fund to help social enterprises
become more investment-ready, so that they can go to Big Society
Capital through intermediaries and try to access the money.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Additionally,
we are working closely with Ministers at the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills to ensure that we are fully joined up on the work
that they are doing and the opportunities that they present to social
enterprises, which, in my view, can play an incredibly important role
in the growth agenda, or the economic priority to create jobs. The
regional growth fund is relevant here, as are the plans to develop a
network of 40,000 mentors to support small businesses, including social
firms.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000097">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government are joined up. A huge amount of activity is going on to
support social enterprises and other entrepreneurs. That is being
communicated to stakeholders, and I continue to discuss with Ministers
whether there are merits in joining that up in a formal strategy
document. I will come back to my earlier point: the previous
Administration were guilty of believing that just publishing a strategy
document was enough and that suddenly doing so would be transformative.
In my view, it is not. There are occasions when a strategy document is
useful—we certainly felt that it was in relation to our plans to
grow the social investment market—but we do not think that it is
necessary to legislate for one.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000098">&#160;</a>

the Minister think it important that we have a proper, agreed

is anything not in the public sector, and I am increasingly worried
that the integrity of the social enterprise sector is being worn down
because organisations that are clearly not social enterprises are

included in the Bill, and it is one that I am perfectly comfortable
with. However, in terms of where legal definitions may emerge and the
need for them, one has not perhaps been required up to now, although
that may change. I refer the right hon. Lady to regulations relating to
the Localism Bill, particularly the right to challenge and the right to
buy, about which the definition of legal form and agenda has been an
issue, and she has spoken consistently and quite rightly about the need
for protection with regard to asset locks. That is the forum for such a
discussion on definition through regulation. We are also about to
embark on a review of charity law, and I suspect that to be part of the
debate, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000100">&#160;</a>

right hon. Lady’s fundamental point is right. As hon. Members
will be aware there is a spectrum, from pure charitable activity to
social businesses. Some blurring of lines might not have mattered until
now. She may be right that we have reached the point at which some
definition in law is needed. As I have indicated, there are two
legislative opportunities for that to
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000101">&#160;</a>

have had in winning contracts connected to the Work programme. Perhaps
the absence of a definition of social enterprise has been one of the
factors. What happens when something goes wrong, as in the case of the
Work programme, with the informal strategy the Minister alludes to?
What are the means of accountability for the Government to put right
those problems and—as the hon. Member for Dover said—as a
result, to make things
happen?<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000102">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman talks about accountability and
suggests that the lack of a formal strategy is a problem. I have
laboured the point that the Government made a formal commitment, for
which we will be accountable. He talks about the Work programme, though
it is a little early to make definitive judgments about whether things
are going wrong. He should know that the Government, including DWP
Ministers, have an explicit intent to make it easier for the
not-for-profit-and-dividend sector to participate in that programme,
precisely because evidence shows that social enterprises and charities
prove extremely effective at the tough work of getting people back into
work, because they enjoy a different relationship of trust with the
people whom they are trying to help.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000103">&#160;</a>

social sector organisations are actively involved in the supply chain.
The Minister responsible has said that they stand to gain at least
£100 million from that process, depending on results. That is a
major opportunity created by the Government for the sector. I know from
my contact with Minsters that they are closely monitoring what is
happening on the ground and take it very seriously. All that flows from
the coalition Government commitment, for which we are prepared to be
accountable.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000104">&#160;</a>

clarified why such a modest proposal to require local authorities to
produce a sustainable community strategy cannot be taken on board by
the Government. He has tabled a series of amendments to the requirement
on local authorities to put together a sustainable community strategy,
but in his response to the debate on clause 1, he did not explain what
has changed since he introduced his private Member’s Bill,
which, in the words of the hon. Member for Wycombe, established a
burden on the Government to produce strategies. Why should things be
different for this
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
part, the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington is seeking to address
the concern that, although some local authorities have a positive
attitude and a real enthusiasm for promoting social enterprises, in
practice, without a legislative requirement to consider the
implications of supporting social enterprises, other local authorities
would not have such an attitude and
enthusiasm.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000126">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The essence of my argument on clause 2 is the same
as my argument on clause 1. Although the goal is desirable, we see no
need to legislate. We want as many local authorities as possible to
seize the opportunity to engage with social enterprises as part of the
solution to some of the problems and challenges that we all face in the
current resource-restrained environment. As the hon. Gentleman has
said, a number of councils get that and are doing it
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
challenge—this is our preferred route—is to identify best
practice and inspirational leadership, to build the evidence
on how an innovative approach to working with social enterprises
delivers better results for service users and the taxpayer and to
spread that through the system, rather than deluding ourselves that
imposing a new duty on local authorities will be transformative. We are
looking for inspirational leadership and genuinely to persuade people
of a course of action. From direct experience, I do not think that it
helps simply to prepare another glossy strategy document that will sit
on a shelf. Such a document may be something of a cop-out, and we can
do better than that.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman cites the Sustainable Communities Act 2007, of which I am
extremely proud, but he is wrong about what it seeks to achieve. Its
premise is that local people know best and should have more
opportunities to present their ideas about things that should change in
their areas. It places a greater requirement on central Government to
change their attitude and to create space for such ideas to be heard.
We started that process, which has effectively resulted in the
bureaucracy-busting service at the Department for Communities and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 18<a class="bkMark" name="Column18">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Local Government. Several hundred communities have taken
advantage of that service. The only requirement imposed on local
authorities that decide to take part—there is no obligation for
them to do so—is that when proposing an idea for consideration
by the Department, they should show that they have effectively
consulted their communities and that the idea is
representative.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">During
the passage of the 2007 Act, we struck the right balance between
placing requirements on central Government and establishing local
freedom and power. I do not think there are any points of comparison.
The central point is whether we need to legislate to impose a duty on
local authorities to publish social enterprise strategies, and we do
not believe that a case has been made for that. We would much prefer to
work with the leaders and the people who are showing best practice to
inspire the rest of the network to understand that social enterprises
can be an incredibly important part of the
solution.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000131">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As the Bill’s sponsor, my hon. Friend the
Member for Warwick and Leamington, flagged up, amendment 3 will limit
the Bill’s scope to include only public services, thereby
removing contracts for goods and contracts for work from its scope. It
will also limit its scope to the pre-procurement stage of the
commissioning process where—this is the critical point—we
believe there is most scope for taking account of those issues. Again,
we are trying to focus on where we think it can make most difference.
For example, we believe that in a contract for care services for the
elderly, consideration of the full social, environmental and economic
value through consultation with service users and the market would lead
to better specification, which in turn should lead to better value for
money through more tailored services. The amendment would also clarify
how framework agreements should be treated in relation to the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
focusing on services, the legislation rightly focuses on the types of
contract with the greatest direct impact on individuals and
communities, and consequently where wider value is likely to be most
relevant. I stress that it is not the Government’s intention to
suggest that there would not be benefits in considering wider value in
other forms of contract, but we do not believe that they warrant
legislation at this
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000137">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Again, I believe that this issue significantly
dilutes the Bill’s original intention, which is to try to
maximise social value. Limiting contracts to services will miss out on
the whole range of public contracts covering purchasing goods. All the
evidence that we have drawn out is that spending money locally provides
seven times the impact of spending it in other areas, so the purchase
of goods by public authorities can have a tremendous effect on the
local supply chain and local economies. Why is the Minister
deliberately removing an opportunity to enhance local economies through
purchasing
goods?<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000138">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I take the right hon. Lady’s point, and
return to the point that I tried to establish at the start of my
comments about trying to strike a proper balance between our objective
to encourage more commissioners to think about wider values, such as
social and environmental values, in their considerations, and our
determination to try to streamline the process and to reduce the number
of additional duties on commissioners. It is a balancing act, and this
is where we have got to in terms of trying to find that balance. We do
not believe that we have necessarily done that in the Bill; we are
focusing on where we think we can make most
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000139">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> May I ask the Minister a specific question? Would
his definition cover a local authority’s procurement of the
construction of housing? Would that be goods, or a
service?<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000140">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That leads me to my next remarks, which are designed
to be helpful in relation to definitions, particularly when there is a
blend of goods and services. We are not saying there would not be
benefits in considering wider value in other forms of contract, and
there may not be much standing in the way of commissioners who want to
apply that at the moment. But in terms of definition, we propose the
following approach if a contract is for services and goods, or for
services and works.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000141">&#160;</a>

is for both goods and services, it shall be considered to be a public
services contract if the value for consideration attributable to those
services exceeds that of the goods covered by the contract, otherwise
the contract should be considered to be a contract for goods. If a
contract is for both works and services, it should be considered to be
a public services contract if the works element of the contract is only
incidental to its principal object. Otherwise the contract will be
treated as a contract for
works.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000142">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I am concerned that
that is simply a recipe for confusion and challenge. I used to run such
organisations, so I have a real-life example. We supplied
publications—published material—on the social security
system. The books were clearly goods, but the information, arguably,
was a service. It would have been absolutely impossible for us to
disentangle the value of the books and the knowledge when we priced up
the contract. Does the Minister not feel that it is a recipe for
confusion and difficulty? How does he see that being
resolved?<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000143">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I do not necessarily see that. At the end of the
day, and underlying this whole legislation, is a large amount of
discretion at the local level to apply this, because the legislation
imposes a duty on commissioners to consider social and environmental
aspects, where they consider it to be relevant and proportionate. The
Bill rightly leaves a fair amount of discretion at a local level. We
are trying to focus the legislation on where it will make most impact.
We think that that will be on public services, rather than goods or
contracts. Where there is a blend, I have given some indication of what
we think is the right approach, but there will still be a fair amount
of discretion at a local level to sort this
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000144">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Perhaps I can pursue this matter a little further
with the Minister. He is aware of a social enterprise in my
constituency, because he has had the pleasure of meeting Aileen
McDonald from B4Box. She provides construction services and
refurbishments while at the same time employing people who have had a
difficult employment history and perhaps have not worked for a long
time. In the process of doing her construction work, she provides
employment opportunities and services. My concern is that when the
Minister says that there is discretion for local authorities, does that
mean that they are protected if they choose to go down the social value
route, even if they are a provider of goods and services? I am
concerned that some authorities will feel
exposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000145">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am always happy to consider helpful suggestions
from all parts of the Committee. The important point, which comes back
to my opening remarks, is that there is a duty on us as legislators to
ensure that whatever we put on the statute book is as clear and as easy
to implement as possible for commissioners, who are doing an incredibly
difficult job. I take on board the right hon. Lady’s point,
although I do not think that it will move the Government’s
position substantively on our desire to limit the scope of the Bill to
include public services only, because that is where there is the most
scope and the greatest direct impact on individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The focus on
the pre-procurement stage will mean that resulting contracts are
awarded on the basis of a more thorough understanding of needs and on
intelligently designed specifications that aim to maximise the value of
what they achieve. The amendment is in keeping with announcements made
by the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office Ministers about simplifying
the procurement process and driving the use of more outcome-based
specifications. The amendment also clarifies that the Bill applies to
setting up the framework agreement but not to individual call-offs,
because call-offs must be let in accordance with the terms of the
framework
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
4 to 17 clarify how the duty will work in practice. Amendment 4
provides that commissioners should consider not only improving the
economic, environmental and social well-being of the service procured
but how the procurement process itself may be improved. For example,
pre-procurement consultation may clarify social or environmental
aspects of the service that can then be reflected in the specification.
I am sure Members would agree that effective consultation can lead to
less bureaucratic procurement processes, which in turn will lead to
responses from a greater range of suppliers and so drive value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
8, which is another technical amendment, includes a provision for
urgent need. It recognises that the duties in the Bill should not
impede commissioning in urgent circumstances. However, proposed
subsection (4B) in clause 3 will ensure that short time
scales or delays caused by the contracting authority do not count
towards urgent need, which means that foreseeable delays are not
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000151">&#160;</a>

from considering non-commercial aspects, such as the provision of

Perhaps he will provide more clarity on the Government’s thought
process by letter if he does not want to do so in his response. The
last thing that Opposition Members—and Government Members, too,
I suspect—want to see is confusion. That would lead to
bureaucratic delays, and legal bills would be incurred by social
enterprises and, in these financial times, by public procurement
authorities, too. More clarity would be

                  </strong> This intervention is designed to be helpful. It is
important to clarify how the Bill interacts with the best value duty
placed on local authorities by the Secretary of State for Communities
and Local Government, which relates to an earlier intervention. That
duty, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, requires local authorities to
consider value, including social value, on all contracts, services,
goods and works throughout the procurement process on contracts of any
value.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000162">&#160;</a>

places a duty on all commissioners in all contracting authorities to
consider how to improve social, economic and environmental well-being

                  </strong> I am grateful for the Minister’s
intervention. As I have said, we will reflect on the comments that he
has made, and I hope that he will continue to consider the concerns of
my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles and her
neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister clarify how the changes to clause 3 might resolve some of the
difficulties that have been thrown up by the Work programme’s
procurement process? He will know about the concerns that the National
Council for Voluntary Organisations has articulated, having had a
considerable consultation process with a series of civil society
organisations that wanted to get involved in the Work programme. People
feel that the prime—framework—contract has, with one or
two exceptions, gone to private sector rather than civil society
organisations. The key concern is that the size, complexity and model
of financing have excluded many CSOs from bidding.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The NCVO made
a striking comment about a further barrier. Some of the subcontractors
are prevented from entering the Work programme because of the overly
bureaucratic processes adopted by primes—private sector
organisations, in the main—which cannot be good. One assumes
that such organisations had not intended for that to be the situation.
When CSOs have had to fill in documentation of more than 140 pages, in
some cases, and still have not gained any contracts as a result, one
wonders whether the Work programme needs substantial reform. If the
Minister thinks that the clause will have no impact on improving the
Work programme, can he tell the Committee what will do so? Such
improvement is needed so that CSOs can have a strong role in that
process, as was the Government’s
intent.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000166">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have a few
questions for the Minister. The area of procurement has been fraught
with difficulty and confusion. Many very good local authorities have
faced legal challenge from a range of competing contractors because
they have not had full confidence in the procurement process. I want to
ensure that the Minister’s amendments send out a clear message
to local government that they are entitled to take into account issues
other than the lowest price and that they can look at social, economic
and environmental well-being, as the Bill
intends.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
of us will know that the European rules have often been cited as the
reason why it is not possible to take into account anything other than
the lowest tender. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 24<a class="bkMark" name="Column24">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Yet other European countries, as I am afraid is often the case with
regulations, have not felt as constrained by such regulations and have
therefore awarded contracts to local suppliers and companies, and have
been able to get the benefit of massive procurement, whereas in this
country, because we always play by the rules—or what we think
are the rules—we have often missed out on getting that local
supply chain, and local labour and investment, which can really help
our local economies to
thrive.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want the Minister’s robust reassurance that if local authorities
go down the route of prioritising within their framework agreements and
contracting process the companies that provide social value—as
in the example I cited earlier, taking on unemployed people, giving
them a chance to work, getting them in a position where they are paying
taxes and national insurance rather than receiving unemployment
benefit—that could be a legitimate consideration in awarding
contracts for goods and services. Unless there is a positive, robust
message that goes out, we will end up being back where we started, with
local authorities feeling afraid to use the muscle of their procurement
process to get the transformational effect that the hon. Member for
Warwick and Leamington wants. I would welcome the Minister’s
confirmation that it is legitimate to prioritise organisations that can
evidence social, economic and environmental
well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bill states that the factors taken into account by local authorities
must be relevant and proportionate to the goods and services being
procured. Perhaps the Minister could give, on the record, examples of
the kind of things that can be taken into account—not and
exhaustive and exclusive list—because it would be helpful to
people reading the transcript of proceedings to know the strength of
the Government’s intent and that we are not fiddling
round the edges and tweaking a little bit of regulation, but
are genuinely embarked on a transformational effect in the procurement
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also want to ask how we evidence the social value that we are trying to
procure. Like social enterprise, it is an evolving field and there are
many different ways of measuring social value. There is social return
on investment, which is a transactional, numerical way of measuring and
does not necessarily get to the heart of real change. There is an
organisation in Manchester—also working in Salford—called
Connectives, in which two young women accountants who have specialised
in social accounting are now beginning to evaluate the accounts of
social enterprises. It is an in-depth assessment process and one of the
best I have seen. It actually gets under the skin of what social value
really
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
idea of simply having a numerical analysis will not achieve what the
Minister wants to achieve, which is a much more textural analysis of
the impact on jobs, but also of the well-being element of the Bill. It
can be a nebulous concept, and there is a lot of work to be done on
what tools we are going to give local authorities to help them with
intelligent commissioning. Some authorities are well developed. We have
the co-op councils and Councillor Steve Reed in Lambeth and all his
colleagues in Rochdale. There are 50 authorities now in the
co-operative network that are exploring this. Manchester City council
has recently recommissioned the whole of its youth service—very
intelligent commissioning—from the bottom up. At Salford
council, we have a range of social enterprises 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 25<a class="bkMark" name="Column25">&#160;</a>
                  </div>in the health and employment sector. Some councils are really good, but
the Minister must acknowledge that some councils will be starting from
scratch. They need to be given real tools— not meaningless
strategies—to be able to do the job, and sufficient reassurance
that they will not be exposed to a legal claim from an unsuccessful
bidder because they have taken into account things other than price,
quality, time and the bottom line. The Minister owes it to us to put
some flesh on the bones in this debate so that it is not a purely
transactional process but people understand the commitment that is
behind it.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I echo the
point that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow West has made that we
are talking about local authorities, because Government and other
quasi-public organisations carry out a huge amount of public
procurement. In my constituency, for example, the BBC’s
MediaCityUK has done a fabulous job of getting local labour. It has
worked tremendously hard with the local authority and local
companies, and twice as much local labour as we had for the Olympics
has been involved in building MediaCityUK, which has had a tremendous
effect on our local economy. That BBC money is public money, but
unfortunately it will not be covered under the terms of the Bill. We
are missing out by constraining ourselves so much when we could have
had more of an impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Work
programme is a huge problem. In Greater Manchester the three big Work
programme contracts have gone to organisations in Newcastle, Leeds and
Birmingham, and the small organisations, which I strongly hoped would
be involved, have been squeezed out of the process. They say that by
the time the money comes out of the main contractors there is nothing
left to trickle down to small social enterprises, which are often best
placed to get people into work. Such enterprises will send people to go
and knock on doors on the estate; they are not big private sector
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
danger that the principle to which we are all signed up, which we are
passionate about, will be undermined unless there is a sufficient push.
I recognise the Minister’s difficulties across Government, with
the practicalities and with the economic situation, but if the
Government are committed to their coalition statement that they want to
develop this sector they will have to be more robust in giving a lead
to public sector organisations. Such organisations look to Government
for a lead and for legislation that drives transformational
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I would
welcome the Minister’s confirmation on the points that I have
raised. I would also welcome a sense that he is not simply fighting a
lone battle in the Cabinet Office. The proposal does not have a
strategy and it does not have any levers across Government; where will
the Minister get the power, which will be shared by all his Whitehall
partners, to make this happen?<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000178">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> There has been a lot of discussion about the Work
programme, and I am not sure that this is the most appropriate place
for an extensive debate on it. It is a large piece of contracting,
however, and in many ways it tests some of the values and principles
that we are debating. Our aims through the Work programme are entirely
consistent with what the previous Administration were trying to
achieve. The scheme is ambitious; it is the largest contracting on a
payment-by-results basis anywhere. It involves contracting at scale, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 26<a class="bkMark" name="Column26">&#160;</a>
                  </div>but there is an explicit desire to engage smaller providers and the
not-for-profit sector in that process. It is the start of the
journey.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Personally, I
was delighted to see two prime contractors from the sector, and I would
be more than happy to see at least 300 organisations in the supply
chain. Not everyone can be winners in that process, and many
organisations in my constituency are frustrated. That’s life,
but the Government have made a commitment to ensure that the prime
contractors in that process do not, in the words of the Minister of
State, Department for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), “duff up”
their supply chain. My right hon. Friend has said clearly that he is
prepared to re-examine contracts where there is hard evidence of that
happening. I am working closely with him to examine the evidence on the
ground and working closely with strategic partners to mine that
evidence to find out what is happening as people start to flow through
the system. It is a little premature to make judgments on that but the
Government are examining it extremely carefully, not least in the light
of the commitments that they have made.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Merlin
standard was negotiated as a framework for handling relationships in
such contracts, and the Government are working hard through the
formation of Big Society Capital to create an environment with a
growing market for social methods to make it easier for social
enterprises and charities to access the working capital that they will
need to compete effectively for long-term payment-by-results contracts.
The Work programme is work in progress and it is too early to say
conclusively that there is a major problem with it, but the Government
are monitoring it extremely carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000181">&#160;</a>

together send a strong signal to local commissioners about the
Government’s desire to encourage consideration of wider social,
economic and environment well-being when contracting. In my earlier
intervention, I tried to make it clear how the best value duty and the
Bill fit together to send an extremely strong signal to contracting
authorities, in a way that is entirely consistent with EU procurement
law. The right hon. Lady made an important point, however, about the
need to support commissioners in that process—they are human
beings doing an extremely difficult job in an atmosphere of a
tremendous amount of change and fewer resources. She has surely spoken,
as I have done, to many commissioners who are trying to do the right
thing and to be imaginative leaders, and when one listens to them one
realises how difficult their world is.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000185">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The shadow Minister says that that is why we need a
strategy but, again, that might reflect the Labour approach to life:
some document issued from central Government can, somehow, suddenly
transform a situation. We are talking about a culture change, and about
making people comfortable with doing things in a different way. The
thought that some strategy document from central Government will change
that is, frankly, for the birds. The reason why such interventions have
not worked before is precisely the point made by the right hon. Lady:
what is the actual human support given to commissioners who want to do
things in different ways? It is not enough to write White Papers or
even legislation and think, “That’s sorted”,
because it is not. That was the mistake made in the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are therefore looking actively at a number of issues, such as social
value. Again, that is one of those phrases, but what does it mean? We
are doing a lot of work with partners in the sector and having a
discussion in a granular, sub-sector way on action and to ask what we
mean by “social value” in the scheme. What should we be
measuring? How do we make it as easy as possible to measure? How do we
achieve the relevant consensus among commissioner, providers of money
and the suppliers of services, so that we make it as easy as possible?
What can we do to send clearer information to commissioners and to
those providing services about what is possible within the law? The
right hon. Lady mentioned European procurement law, which is often used
as a smoke screen, and we need to puncture a few myths on that and to
make it clearer about what is possible and what is
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
talked earlier about the need to find the leadership and the best
practice and to spread it. That will be at the heart of what we are
doing in our new commissioner support programme, on which we are
consulting. We have some resources to invest in the area because it is
absolutely necessary to support those human beings and to provide them
with the inspiration and information that they
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Sitting
behind all that is something that has not been mentioned at all
but is to do with the signals to commissioners about the sincerity of
the Government’s determination in the area: in the Localism Bill
is the right to challenge, which is being defined now through a process
of consulting on the regulations. The creation of a new right for local
communities, social enterprises or voluntary groups to challenge
existing provision, armed with much more information in a new area of
transparency about what is being done in their name, is a powerful
challenge to the status quo. It is radical—if we get it
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11101939000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
sincerely believe that through a combination of the legislation, the
best value duty, the right to challenge and all our work to support at
a human level the people who we want to be a little bolder and braver
in doing new things, we are sending a strong signal to the system that
we want change and transformation. We should not underestimate the
culture change that we are talking about, nor imagine that some sort of
strategy document will change it. We are on a journey, and it will take
some time. On that basis, I close my remarks and recommend the
