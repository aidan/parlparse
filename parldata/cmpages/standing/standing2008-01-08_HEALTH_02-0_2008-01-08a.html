						</i> Briefly, my job at the moment is Lady
Justice of Appeal, a judge of the Court of Appeal. I have been doing
that since November 2002. Before that I was a High Court judge in the
Queen&#146;s bench division, doing a mixed bag of crime and civil
work. I went off to do the Shipman inquiry in January 2001. It took me
four years, I am afraid&#151;twice as long as the Lord Chancellor
warned me that it would, but there it is. That is the basis of such
expertise as I have on these matters.</div>
					<a name="08010928000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must warn you, before you
start questioning me, that since I returned to my day job in January
2005, it has not really been possible for me to keep up as well as I
would like with day-to-day developments in medical regulation. Of
course, I have a maternal interest in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>recommendations that I made and their progress, or lack of it, through
legislation, but you will have to forgive me if I am not aware of
everything that has been going on since January 2005. I do not have
access, now, to the kind of materials that I had during the
inquiry.</div>

							<b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): The Bill makes a number of changes
to the regulation of health care professionals, particularly in
medicine. Are the changes proposed in the Bill broadly in line with
your findings and
recommendations?</div>
					<a name="08010928000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lady
Justice Smith:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, broadly, but this is very much a
bare bones Bill. A huge amount of detail will be left for delegated
legislation. One of my difficulties at the moment is seeing exactly how
it will work because so much is left for secondary legislation. I
welcome the creation of an independent adjudicator and the change to
the standard of proof, which were recommendations of mine. I am
particularly concerned that I do not understand how re-validation will
work. The Bill gives only the vaguest of clues about how it will work,
and I am a little worried about that.</div>
					<a name="08010928000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the independent
adjudicator is concerned, I know that the General Medical Council has
put in a memorandum, which it kindly showed me in advance, expressing
concerns about the independence of the adjudicator, and I share those
concerns. It is vital that an independent adjudicator should be
independent of Government as well as the GMC. The purpose of my
recommendation was that we should have someone adjudicating who is
independent of the GMC because it cannot properly be investigator,
prosecutor and judge in the same causes. I was concerned about its
human rights compliance. That has been accepted, and we will now have
an independent adjudicator, but it should be independent of Government
as well as the GMC.</div>

							<a name="08010928000480"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> Thank you for that. I believe that you also made
some recommendations about the proportion of lay members. Will you
elaborate on them? Did they just seem like a good idea, or did you have
any evidence to back them
up?</div>
					<a name="08010928000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lady
Justice Smith:
							</b>
						</i> I did not have much evidence about
what the proportions should be. I felt that the proportions were wrong
in the GMC at the time and that lay members were not carrying
sufficient influence. I recognised that as the GMC was organised at
that time&#151;and I think that this will change&#151;it needed
quite a lot of medical members to carry out particular functions that
required professional qualifications. I did not want to denude it by
suggesting that the number of medical members should be reduced too
drastically. Besides, it might surprise you to know that I did not want
to frighten the horses too much either. I am very content with the
proposal here that there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>should be equal numbers. I also see that the nature of the GMC is to
change so that it becomes less of a council and more of a board. How
that will work and whether it is a good idea, I just do not know. I
have no view on that.</div>

						</i>There is one matter,
which you might feel is quite small. It relates to the fitness to
practise panels under clause 93, subsection (2) of which
states:</div>
					<a name="08010928000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
fitness to practise panel is to consist of...a chair selected from
the lay members list or the professionally qualified members
list&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08010928000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recommended that
adjudication panels should be chaired by legally qualified people. I
explained a number of reasons why I made that recommendation. The GMC
has never done it. It does not think that it is necessary but, of
course, we are not talking about the GMC. I had understood that the
chief medical officer was more or less in agreement with my proposal,
although I noticed that, in his review of my report, he just said that
there should be an independent adjudicator and that panels should be
staffed appropriately with those who are medically and legally
qualified and lay people. I understood from that that he wanted some
legal expertise on the adjudication panels, which is what I had
wanted.</div>
					<a name="08010928000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now I see that
the chair must be selected from the lay members or the professionally
qualified members. I then tried to find out the meaning of a
professionally qualified member, and the definition section under
clause 93(4) states that
a</div>
					<a name="08010928000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;professionally
qualified members list&#146; means the list of persons eligible to
serve as professionally qualified members provided for by section
94(1)(b)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08010928000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
94(1)(b) states that they
are</div>
					<a name="08010928000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons eligible to
serve as professionally qualified
members&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08010928000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Around we go in
a circle.</div>
					<a name="08010928000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that the provision means medically qualified people, but that is not
made clear. I would like it to be made clear that there can be legally
qualified people on the panels. As the way in which the panels are to
work will be decided by the Office of the Health Professions
Adjudicator, not by Parliament&#151;reference can be made to an
example, under clause 94(6), of the delegated legislation rules that
are to be made by OHPA&#151;I should like the OHPA at least to have
the option of having legally qualified chairs. If you want me to give
reasons why I think that that is a good idea, I shall do so, but they
are set out in my
report.</div>
					<a name="08010928000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe in
horses for courses and in professional expertise being matched to the
nature of the tasks in hand. Chairing a disciplinary tribunal is a job
for a legally qualified person, not a lay person. Legally qualified
people who appear in front of such tribunals are capable of running
rings round the tribunal if no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>one on the panel is legally qualified. The proceedings would take a lot
longer than they needed to if there was not a legally qualified chair.
You would achieve a much higher standard of reasoned decision if you
had a legally qualified chair because writing a judgment, which is what
such a decision is, is a job that requires professional
expertise.</div>

						</b> May I return to something that you said
earlier, Lady Justice Smith, about the status of the independent
adjudicator? You kindly acknowledged that your recommendation stressed
the influence of independence from the GMC, but you now say that you
have some sympathy with the position of the GMC, which is arguing that
it should not be the proposed model that is an Executive,
non-departmental public body along the lines of the Independent Police
Complaints Commission. I wondered what your reasons were for that and
whether you had an alternative model in mind that would satisfy the
need for democratic and public
accountability.</div>

for the GMC? It has written a memorandum, which you might not have had
the chance to read yet. Representatives from the GMC are
here&#151;there they are&#151;and they will be speaking next. It is
a point that they feel strongly about. I confess that the lack of
independence of Government had not jumped out and hit me between the
eyes. It plainly has now and having read the memorandum, I am
sympathetic to that point. I would rather just leave it at
that.</div>

amendment that is tabled to clause 2(4), which in relation to the Bill
performing its functions of looking

appeal from the regulatory bodies who are doing their own thing. The

I am happy, with the proposed appeal arrangements. On the standard of
proof, I recommended that we move to the civil standard because,
essentially, we are talking about a protective rather than criminal
jurisdiction. I know that the consequence could be loss of livelihood
or serious damage to it, but my view, which seems to have been
accepted, is that adequate protection could be given to a doctor within
the framework using a civil burden or standard of proof. I am pleased

						</i> Yes it does&#151;many. It applies
particularly in fraud cases, for example. The notion is that if you
make a serious allegation against someone, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>you need cogent evidence before you find it proved. If you make an
allegation of negligence, it is not so serious. You could be 51 per
cent. satisfied that x happened rather than y, and that would be
enough. However, if you are thinking whether someone has deliberately
told lies in an attempt to defraud x, you would need to be a little bit
more than 51 per cent. sure. I do not want to say 60 or 70 per cent.,
but there is a higher standard of proof, which is what this is all
about.</div>
					<a name="08010928000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">It applies
also in cases in which someone is, for example, accused of murder but
has not been convicted and a civil action is brought for wrongful
death. In such a case, the judge would apply a higher standard of proof
than he or she would when considering an allegation of negligence. For
example, if there were allegations that a doctor had indecently
assaulted patients, you would require fairly cogent evidence before you
would convict him.</div>

recommendation about independence of Government because that was not
what my mind was focused on; I was focused only on independence of the
GMC. However it is important, particularly in the health sphere, that
the adjudicatory body should be seen to be independent of Government
because the Government are a huge customer of healthcare; the biggest
customer of healthcare. Therefore, it is important that there should be
no suspicion that the Government are in a position to pull strings
behind the scenes, as to what goes on. Absolute clarity and absolute
independence are really important. As I say, the fact that you are
apparently intending to have a judicial figure as the chairman of the

going to work and what role they will play in revalidation. I do not
get that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>from this Bill. If you have read my revalidation chapter in the fifth
report&#151;it is long and I would not criticise you for a moment if
you have not&#151;you will know that I was very concerned that the
revalidation process should be clear and understood, that it should be
summative and a proper test, and that it should not just involve
shuffling pieces of paper around and rubber-stamping them, which is
what I was afraid that it would
be.</div>
					<a name="08010928000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot tell from
the Bill how it will work, which bothers me. I am worried about
responsible officers; I see that they can be appointed by employers and
that it is envisaged that medical directors of trusts will also be
responsible officers and that they will have some role&#151;I do not
know what&#151;in revalidation. I am really unhappy about that for
several reasons. First of all, I do not like the idea of a medical
director, who already has a lot of jobs, having to take on
responsibility for revalidation as well as all his other jobs. I think
that that is too much. There is a real tension between, on the one
hand, an employer&#146;s desire to keep all of his employers in post,
revalidated and fully qualified, and, on the other hand, the possible
need to refuse to revalidate somebody, in which case their services
might be lost entirely, diminished or put on hold, from which problems
might arise. I am unhappy about that. I cannot tell how it will work,
but it looks to me that it might be like that.</div>

about GMC affiliates, which are not mentioned in the Bill but,

revalidation. He picked up on my ideas, ran with them and took them
further. I was delighted with that. I was fed up with waiting for him
to produce the review, but when he did, I thought that it was well
worth waiting for. However, I cannot see the extent to which his
proposals are implemented in this Bill, which bothers

just in the throes of setting up its complaints-handling set-up. From
what I heard about it, and from the personnel involved whom I saw and
heard evidence from, I was concerned that it was not going to work very

is patient protection, we welcome many of the clauses and many of the
issues raised in the Bill. We have sent round a note, which I
understand most of you have received, indicating one area of concern,
but it is one area. We have very few other areas of real concern to
bring to your attention. The area that concerns us is the independence
of the independent adjudicator.</div>
					<a name="08010928000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you probably know, all our
arguments have been advanced on the understanding that independence is
important. It is important for the council itself&#151;that is why we
have argued for equal numbers of lay and professional people on it, so
that we are seen to be independent of the profession and any vested
interest. At present, adjudication is undertaken by the General Medical
Council, which itself is quite independent of the monopoly employer. We
are facing a situation where there are clear links between the new
adjudicator and the Department of Health, and that gives us cause for
some
concern.</div>

you kindly gave us a briefing note, and it was very helpful to us that
you clearly said that the general direction of travel is exactly what
you would like to see. You touched on your area of concern. If the Bill
were to change, in what direction would you like it to change, and what
specific measures would you put in place to promote so-called

issues that might help to address the problems that we identify. The
least important are the financial issues, which we discuss in general
terms. Our concern starts from the difference between what was proposed
in the White Paper and the Bill. It is not clear to us how that
important definition of independence will be taken forward, given the
new remit of the independent adjudicator. Some issues can be addressed
by securing from the Department and in the Bill a guarantee of
independence about the status of the adjudicator. That might be
combined with a report to Parliament directly, rather than through the
Secretary of State for Health.</div>
					<a name="08010928000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also want
to touch on the operational effectiveness issues that relate to the
independent adjudicator. Finally, we want to consider effectiveness and

that might be considered&#151;other models that would provide the
safeguards we seek. I am happy to discuss those with you,

						</i> Lady Justice Smith explained it
reasonably well in the previous sitting. The issue is as much about
perception as it is about reality. If you consider the effectiveness of
the General Medical Council and the way in which we have organised
cases in the past, we have done pretty well. The proportion of
decisions that are opened up to review, go through either the High
Court or the Court of Appeal and are reversed is very small. On
effectiveness, it is hard to see how any new body would do better, but
there is the difficulty of being perceived to be judge and
jury&#151;of being partly comprised of doctors, but making decisions
about doctors. We have said in the past, and it is still our position,
that the factual case has not been made, but if that is the view of
Parliament or the Government, we are very happy to work with you to see
how best we can produce an effective new
adjudicator.</div>

sent us, you are generally content with the Bill. In clause 92, the GMC
will still be able to publish guidance telling the OHPA what sanctions
to impose on professionals found unfit to practise, but it will lose
responsibility for conducting the work itself. I assume from what you

						</i> I am not sure that it is a classic example,
but we have received assurances from the Minister that our standards
will apply. We set the standards for the medical profession in the
United Kingdom, and if the regulator is to be responsible for the
integrity of the register, it is important that all doctors abide by
those standards. We have assurances that our standards and indicative
sanctions on the panels will apply. As I understand it, the concept is
to remove adjudication away from the GMC to an independent adjudicator,
but everything else remains more or less the
same.

Can you update us as to the GMC&#146;s position on the question of
doctors who are deemed to be fit to practise, but who offer themselves

the sort of experience that one would expect from somebody who puts

								Sir
Graeme Catto:
							</b>
						</i> Let me move from the specific to the
general to begin with. Our guidance states clearly that all doctors
should work within their competence. That applies to doctors in any
situation, including working as an expert witness. We have issued
further guidance for doctors who work as expert witnesses, and Findlay
may wish to speak on that.</div>
					<a name="08010928000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">

								Findlay
Scott:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, I would like to add to that. In 2006,
there was a case at the Court of Appeal testing the proposition
advanced by a judge in the High Court which stated that expert
witnesses should be outside the reach of the regulator. We resisted
that strongly and we won in the Court of Appeal. Our position is clear.
As Sir Graeme says, doctors should practise only within their
competence. If they do not do so&#151;and that includes acting as an
expert witness when they are not an expert&#151;then we will not
hesitate to take action.

							<a name="08010928000532"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> We kicked off with Laura Moffatt moving into the
question of independence, and we have heard from Lady Justice Smith and
yourselves. You talked about seeking to secure a guarantee of
independence for the Office of the Health Professionals Adjudicator,
and to ensure that it delivers value for money. As we scrutinise the
Bill, it is important for us to understand how it will impact on
specific amendments in order to establish that. General information,
unfortunately, has now got to reach the detail, and there are a number
of amendments tabled that we will look at in order to tease this
out.</div>
					<a name="08010928000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the areas
that I feel very un-briefed on, as we move toward a line-by-line
discussion of the legislation on Thursday afternoon, is the argument
about independence. I would like to know what point the GMC has
reached, either with the Department or in its own understanding in
discussions, in securing the OHPA&#146;s operational effectiveness.
What will be the financial arrangements for the cost of the OHPA? Will
they eventually fall back as a burden on the profession? Will they be
met from central funds? Where is the understanding? As an Opposition
Member who has looked at this carefully, I am at the moment feeling
somewhat unsighted, so I would grateful if you helped me out.</div>

								Sir Graeme

						</i> There are two issues which are separate but
linked. One is the question of independence, and the other is that of
value for money and how we will deal with that. If we take the
independence issue first: we have had helpful discussions with the
Department over many months, but comparatively late in the day, towards
the end of November, came the suggestion that the independent
adjudicator might be an executive non-Departmental 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>public body. I am no expert, but I understand that that leads inexorably
back to the Secretary of State&#146;s being responsible for the
organisation and, in effect, being the sponsoring officer for that
body.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Graeme Catto:
							</b>
						</i> So the question of independence from a
monopoly employer looms large with us.</div>
					<a name="08010928000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we return to the question of
money and who is going to pay for this, the General Medical
Council&#146;s view&#151;and my view&#151;has been that if you
are going to run a professional organisation for a major profession,
you need to take responsibility for those people who fail to abide by
the appropriate standards. Therefore, to a large extent, the costs
should fall back on the profession. Having said that, it cannot mean a
blank cheque; we must have some understanding of where the additional
costs will arise. If you are going to set up a new organisation, there
will clearly be additional costs at the beginning.</div>
					<a name="08010928000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are close
to an agreement with the Department that those additional
costs&#151;accommodation and all the other facilities that would be
required for a new organisation&#151;will not fall directly back on
to the profession. They will not fall on to the General Medical
Council; we simply pass our costs on to the individual doctors.
However, there are a number of areas to be resolved in setting that up,
and there are technical matters such as whether or not value added tax
will be added. It is entirely possible that there could be an extra
17.5 per cent. simply to set this up, without getting any gain from it
whatsoever. There are quite a few issues yet to be resolved. The short
answer is that we are still in discussion with the Department and the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08010928000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">

						<b class="B">
							
94
						</b>
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08010928000535"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I would like to follow that up, briefly; perhaps
the Minister will speak about this, as well. From my point of view,
therefore, trying to understand our role in scrutinising the Bill, it
seems a bit unsatisfactory that there are unresolved matters. As you
rightly said, the point that I raised is both separate and linked, and
a lot of what we will find ourselves discussing may centre around what
we truly mean by establishing the principle, as well as the practice,
of independence. Unless those unresolved issues are resolved before we
get to that point in the Bill, we will have a cart-and-horse situation.
Do you feel the same, or do you think that I am perhaps being a little
too
pedantic?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Graeme Catto:
							</b>
						</i> No, from my
perspective it has been unfortunate that the question of independence
came up so late in the day and without our understanding what was
happening. The financial issues are important, but probably less so.

feeling.</div>

						</i> There are issues of substance and of
perception. I have no doubt that Ministers on the Floor of the House
will offer assurances about their desire not to interfere in day-to-day
decisions, and that may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>deal satisfactorily with the substance. However, we
remain concerned that the major issue is one of perception. The fact is
that under the Cabinet Office guidance, as I understand it, an NDPB is
clearly defined as being a governmental body rather than a
non-governmental body. There has been no role for a governmental body
in the regulation of the medical profession for 150 years. Therefore,
this is something that cannot be lightly ignored as we move into a new
arrangement. Notwithstanding the practical assurances that can be
given, there will be a significant shift in
perception.</div>

&#147;arm&#146;s length&#148;. What one would want to achieve as
we go through the detail is possibly to move away from a
non-departmental body, however it is defined, to an arm&#146;s length
body. That should be set in the Bill as a matter of principle rather
than a question of perception, which I think will be rather
important.</div>

								Sir
Graeme Catto:

						</i> If I may come back on that, somebody
asked Lady Justice Smith at some point if she might be able to suggest
other models that might link in, and the Minister mentioned the
Independent Police Complaints Commission. In a sense, that is not a
very fair analogy, because the IPCC does not make the final decisions.
If issues come out of the IPCC, they end up being determined by the
courts&#151;a truly independent arrangement&#151;whereas this is
the adjudicator, an apparently independent adjudicator, on our
part.</div>
					<a name="08010928000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are quite
a few other organisations that would pretty much fit the remit. One, of
course, is the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal itself, which is quite
independent. Members are appointed by senior judges, but the tribunal
remains completely independent of the Government. There are different
models that could be used. It is not as if we are seeking to establish
something that is completely de novo. Models exist for this
situation.</div>

independent enough about an NDPB? I was going to use the IPCC model,
but there are others. I think that members of the Committee need a
little more clarity about exactly which alternative model you prefer,
or whether you would simply be looking for special guarantees about
independence within an NDPB model.</div>
					<a name="08010928000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a couple of follow-on
questions from that. Is it not the case that the more distant and the
more independent, the less power there is for any financial control or
control of costs, which I know is of great concern to the GMC? Also,
how does one ensure democratic&#151;that is,
public&#151;accountability the more distant an independent body is
from any governmental oversight or
control?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Findlay
Scott:
							</b>
						</i> In a sense, the easy answer to the
Minister&#146;s first question is that we would like a body rather
like the GMC to run adjudication. It is a statutory body; it is not a
non-departmental public body. The White Paper published in February
2007 very helpfully proposed that the GMC should be accountable to
Parliament. There has never been any suggestion that we should be
accountable to or within 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>the ambit of the Secretary of State, as an NDPB would be. It must be
possible to create an independent statutory body of the GMC&#146;s

						</i> Cost control is clearly an
issue. I hesitate to speak for the entire council. I think we start
from the assumption that mechanisms can be found to ensure that costs
are reasonable, but the principle of independence is one which has been
at the heart of the council&#146;s proposals since November 2006. I
am very glad that the Government endorsed and picked up those points in
the White Paper. In a sense, if the trade off was between more
independence with the risk of less control over costs, I think that
that is a trade off that the council would accept, because of the
importance that it has consistently attached to the need for all
elements of the regulatory system to be independent of the

misunderstanding of the way the civil standard of proof can accommodate
cases of significant severity. My understanding is that the amount of
evidence required and the cogency of the argument need to be increased
in accordance with the severity of the charges and, therefore, the
likelihood of the severity of the sanction on the individual
practitioner. Without going into sliding scales, the civil standard
itself can accommodate that type of case. Already, six of the
regulators have moved to the civil standard of proof, and it seems to
be working well for them. I do not see any reason why it should not
work well for doctors.</div>

for doctors who at the present time are erased from the register
because of serious issues relating to fitness to practice would remain
unchanged. There may be an impact on doctors whose practice has failed
to a lesser extent and whom the council may therefore be able to pick
up at an earlier stage in the process&#151;not to seek erasure or
that sort of sanction, but perhaps to make sure that they abide by
conditions and undertake appropriate training before the situation
further deteriorates. Looking at the numbers that we are dealing with,
we think that any impact is likely to be small and it is likely to be

					<a name="08010928000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">From our

what Liam Donaldson described as the &#147;regulatory gap&#148;
between what happens locally and what happens centrally. We believe
that quite a number of cases that come to us might be much better dealt
with at local level before necessarily being escalated up to us.
Clearly, we want to deal with the serious issues, but quite a number of
items that are brought to our attention might be much better dealt with
locally and we see the responsible officers working in that
way.</div>

indicates that we may have a role in the appointment of a responsible

individual appointments of responsible officers. It would be very
helpful, from our perspective, to have people working in the local

Sir Ian Kennedy said in his report on events in Bristol, that it must
be for the employer first and foremost to deal with issues of poor
performance and misconduct. The challenge within the national health
service has been translating that into effective practice. Clinical
governance has come a long way in the past 10 years. We see the
appointment of responsible officers as a further strengthening of local
governance and as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>reinforcement of local responsibilities. It also delivers a second huge
benefit to us&#151;clearer arrangements for the interaction between
national and local regulation. It is not about shifting responsibility
because such responsibility already exists. The measure is about
clarifying and codifying responsibility, which has sometimes not been
lived up
to.</div>

saved doctors&#146; careers, if problems had been identified

you share my concern that the danger for an organisation is that it
ticks the box marked &#147;We have appointed a responsible

resourcing&#151;money and time are the same thing in the
NHS&#151;or no additional resources are put in, or resources are
diverted because there is no new money coming in to fund the set-up.
The new set-up is ideal; as you rightly say, it is evident to most
people that resolving issues locally prevents bigger mistakes further
down the line, but it is enormously time consuming if done properly. It
is not something that can be squashed in on a job description. Perhaps
you are not as cynical as I am, but I am concerned that there will be
no additional funds to support the change, and that it will therefore
not be done

director does not work in isolation: he or she works within a clinical
governance framework and there are clinical directors who know in much
greater detail what is happening in their specific specialties. If the
measure is to work, we will need to ensure that leadership and
management arrangements throughout the NHS make it clear to medical

where you were talking about the changes you felt had been brought
about in the past few years, in terms of doctors turning a blind eye at
one time when they knew colleagues perhaps had some problems and
questions to answer? Could you just clarify for me where we are now?
This applies particularly to very senior doctors at consultant
level&#151;the Minister will be only too familiar with this, as we
both share a general hospital in Devon, where some years ago a
consultant was suspended after an investigation and it turned out that
the problems we experienced in our hospital had been experienced in his
previous hospital. I would like you to talk us through how you sorted
the problem of one colleague&#151;a senior colleague
perhaps&#151;giving references to another senior colleague. Would the
medical directors be involved in that part of the process when people

another?</div>

is that I did not mean to sound complacent and say that we had cracked
this issue, because I am quite sure we have not. Indeed, the cases that
have come to us&#151;with the possible exception of Harold
Shipman&#151;all had a long history in the locality where the doctors
were known and action was not taken, for whatever reason. Often other
doctors were aware of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>what was going on, so I do not want to sound complacent. I think the

absolute reality. In terms of getting references that may be
inappropriate, we have, as you probably know, already taken action
against a very senior doctor who was accused of doing precisely that,
so we take these things very seriously. The point you are making though
is that they ought to be dealt with long before they come to the GMC,

						</i> If I may, two things: Sir Graham says that we
have been very clear on the issue of references, both in terms of our
guidance and also of the action taken. But also within the White Paper
published in February 2007, there is a very clear expectation that when
doctors move, information will move with them within the national
health service, which does not always happen at the moment. That is in
the context of revalidation, so one of the responsibilities of
responsible officers in relation to revalidation will be to pass a
package of information from hospital A to hospital B as the doctor
moves, so there should be no opportunity&#151;as there has been in
the past&#151;for a doctor simply to leave their problems

						</i> As I understand the Bill at the present
time, it does not preclude the possibility of having a legal chair.
Indeed, that has been the situation at the GMC for many years. We want
to have the best people as chairmen and it does not matter whether they
are legally qualified, lay people or whether they are professionally
qualified. We have always adopted that.</div>
					<a name="08010928000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards the independent

						</i> I wonder if I could answer that. There are
essentially two models in play. The current model, which is the one
envisaged in the Bill as it stands, is that the panel normally of three
or more people is supported by a legal assessor and the requirements of
the legal assessor are set out in the Bill. They have essentially to be
a senior lawyer. That is the system we operate at the moment.</div>
					<a name="08010928000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we were saying earlier,
judging by the consistent quality of the decisions that our panels
make, that system appears to work well, but it does not preclude the
possibility of the second model, which is to have a legally qualified
chair. I think if you were to insist on there always being a legally
qualified chair that would raise an obvious question&#151;why do you
need a legal assessor?</div>
					<a name="08010928000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we have sought to do
within the current arrangements is persist with the model based on the
legal assessor but occasionally have legally qualified chairs where
that is an advantage. I would be cautious about having both a legally
qualified chair and a legal assessor. That would seem to be creating a
little more employment for lawyers than was strictly
necessary.</div>

						</i> The original discussion related to
adjudication panels, the ones we run now and the ones the new

about now is the composition of the council itself. Our view has been
the argument of independence. We strongly believe in being independent
of Government and the Secretary of State and of any vested interest,
including that of the medical profession, which is why we argued for
equal numbers of lay and professional people. The council&#146;s
current view is that that is what we believe strongly and we are

Hopkins</b> (Luton, North) (Lab): I would like to reinforce
the point that Stephen O&#146;Brien was making. I must say I found
the arguments of Lady Justice Smith very persuasive, compelling indeed,
about a legally qualified chair. One of the points she made was that it
would shorten proceedings because the chair would know what to do, know
the full legal implications of decisions being made and there would be
less need for a legal assessor if that were the case. No doubt there
are many other arguments but you sounded neutral; it sounded like a
lack of

						</i> I do not mean to be unenthusiastic about
anything Lady Justice Smith says. I think the key point is this: by any
objective measure, our panels make consistent, high-quality decisions
that are rarely overturned by the courts. So if there is an argument
for a legally qualified chair, I do not personally believe it lies in
the quality of the decisions. There may be real arguments in relation
to the ability of a senior lawyer to control the proceedings in a way
that constrains costs while remaining fair to doctors, and I think that
that is an argument that deserves to be fully
explored.</div>

						</i> Well, just by way of introduction, contrary
to what might be believed, we are passionately signed up to wanting to
protect patients. But we believe that one of the chief ways of doing
that is to have a regulatory system that everyone, patients and
doctors, have confidence in. Hearing some of the earlier evidence, I
think that there has been a welcome move over the last few years to
more openness, more willingness to own up, not only to one&#146;s own
faults but to faults in colleagues, and we would not want to see
anything that puts that back. Turning to your question on the standard
of proof, we have consulted very widely on that at meetings, at our
annual conferences and such like, and there is an overwhelming view in
the profession that that move would be seen to be a retrograde step,
partly for some of the reasons I have mentioned, and partly because
they feel that to take away a doctor&#146;s livelihood, which is
effectively what you are talking about, on the balance of probabilities
would seem to be
unfair.</div>

								Dr.
Buckman:
							</b>
						</i> Yes. I think that there are several elements
to the concern about the standard of proof. You talk about a sliding
scale as if, somehow, it will be different when you have got to the end
of the case. But of course, the standard of proof begins the moment
either party starts to speak. You do not know at the beginning,
necessarily, what evidence is going to produced during the course of a
hearing and it may turn out that the standard of proof that is tested
at the beginning of a hearing may subsequently be required to be
reviewed because it has turned out to be a more serious case than we
thought.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>
					<a name="08010928000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most punishments that the GMC
can currently deal out are such that the GP, or indeed, most doctors,
will find it difficult to continue in practice of some sort. Anything
beyond a warning issued to a general practitioner is going to result in
their potential dismissal from future practice. That is quite serious.
You may not know this, but a single day&#146;s suspension from the
list is enough to render you permanently off your PCT provider list.
That means that any punishment beyond a withholding gets you written
off. As a result of that, and the fact that the standard of proof will
be seen as softer, many perfectly good GPs&#151;it will apply to
other doctors as well&#151;will start to practise in a more defensive
way. That defensiveness includes both behaviour and what they do for
patients.
</div>
					<a name="08010928000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the behavioural
theme, you may say that doctors should practise with an eye to being
defensive anyway, yet when it comes to doing things to patients, we
have opportunities to X-Ray them, to scan or to do other things to them
that may be perfectly reasonable in some senses but are inappropriate
in others&#151;both in terms of cost to the Exchequer and in safety
terms.</div>

would be more tempted to consider investigating somebody with, say, a

answer for my actions later.</div>

welcome that. Now, if it is genuinely part of a supportive, helpful

						</i> I cannot speak for other professions. I do
not know. The difficulty for the medical profession is that we have
greater opportunity than other professions to practise defensively in a
way that might put those we look after at greater risk. I am not
suggesting that we would risk patients&#146; lives, but doctors could
feel threatened. It does not matter if I am a good or a bad
doctor&#151;in fact good doctors are likely to feel more threatened
than bad ones, because generally bad doctors do not know that they are
bad, whereas the rest of us are scared stiff that we might be. Doctors
will practise defensively and be more careful and cautious out of
fear&#151;be it real or unreal&#151;that somebody will ask them
difficult questions, so they will tend to do more. Doctors have a
greater opportunity to do that than many other health care
professionals, because of the level of seniority and the opportunities
to do things that many other health care professionals do not have in
quite the same
way.</div>

vast majority of patients who come to me with a headache do not have a
brain tumour or a serious brain disease. They might have a variety of
illnesses, but serious brain disease would be very low on that list. In
future, if I think that I might be taken to the GMC because I failed to
investigate a headache, I will be referring people for CT scans. Forget
the cost&#151;let us assume that they are free. It is inappropriate
to irradiate people for a disease that they do not have because you are
scared that somebody will be worried about it. No one will scan
everybody, but there is no doubt that some people will be submitted to
investigations&#151;not wildly ridiculous ones, but ones that
probably would not be indicated&#151;because the doctor is playing
more carefully. We will see more blood tests and so on, none of which
is done to punish the patient but to be extra careful. You go to your
doctor for good clinical advice and expect him to provide the best
possible service, not to be over cautious, which results in unnecessary
measures for the patients. That is what I am talking

Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): I, too, am very puzzled by
this attitude. My worst case in recent years concerned a child in my
constituency who died of meningitis. There was a great cry for a full
local inquiry, and a number of changes in practice took place in both
the ambulance service and the children&#146;s hospital. How would you
explain to my constituents whose child died why the signs of meningitis
that they thought were there were not investigated&#151;we are
talking about a good competent doctor here? How could you justify the
idea about a more defensive attitude when that defensive attitude might
have ensured that that child was investigated? Those are the sorts of
cases that you will have to answer. You will have to explain to my
constituents, and others in similar situations, why you do not believe
that it is reasonable to have this burden of standard of
proof.</div>

						</i> I am not trying to defend
inappropriate or unfortunate behaviour. In cases in which there is
sufficient doubt about a diagnosis, the doctor has to investigate as
far as they think appropriate. It is easy to say afterwards, when
someone has been damaged, that they should have done
something.</div>
					<a name="08010928000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference is that in cases in which doctors do not need to do these
things&#151;and it is always a grey area&#151;they will have to
make a judgment on whether or not they proceed with an investigation.
If there is any doubt about someone&#146;s illness, clearly the
doctor will proceed with the investigation. My point was that there
will be the temptation to investigate more than there would have been
otherwise. I am not talking about not investigating a kid with
meningitis. Clearly, there is no argument. That case should be
investigated fully and appropriately. It is in cases in which you do
not think that someone has
meningitis.</div>

over-exposure to scans. The Committee needs to consider the
classifications of complaints against doctors and the outcomes of those
different classifications. Before we consider the Bill line by line, I

Hopkins:
						</b> I just wish to pursue the point, if I may. I
shall paint a scenario that is not so distant in reality. An elderly,
single-hander GP in a poor inner-city area, who does not have a high
reputation with the primary care trust, will not retire and has a long
list because the more patients they took, the more money they received.
They have a lack of confidence in their own ability and therefore refer
a very large number of patients to the hospital, which upsets the
hospital. The logical thing to do in those circumstances would be to
persuade that elderly doctor to retire, yet because of the shortage of
GPs, particularly in unpopular areas, they do not retire. Of course,
they have many of the type of patients who do not complain, because
they do not have the skills that some of us here might have to make
complaints. What would you recommend for dealing with that situation,
other than what is proposed in the
Bill?</div>

						</i> It might take quite a long time to go
through all the things, but I am as eager as you that we resolve that
situation. I am certainly aware of the type of practice and doctor in
inner cities to which you refer. There is a long legacy of
under-investment in and a lack of support for such people.</div>

anti-everything that is in the Bill. We are not; we welcome a lot of
things in the Bill. We first suggested a system of re-accreditation
back in the early 1990s, so we are thoroughly in favour of
re-accreditation, revalidation, re-licensing, appraisal of doctors,
more support for doctors and the National Clinical Assessment Service
to help retrain and support doctors. We are certainly
in favour of not allowing doctors who are isolated and clinically
detached not to be properly supported, and in some instances they must
be encouraged. If they cannot be encouraged, they may have to have
their fitness to practise taken away. We are not arguing against
certain doctors losing their right to practise, we are questioning the
mechanism for deciding who those doctors are and whether it is fair and
appropriate and the profession perceives it as being so. I could talk a
lot more about how we support inner-city practice, but that gives you a
flavour.</div>

being more careful, because they felt that they should be. Nobody would
do a test that they could not justify somehow, so I think that that is
what would happen. The number of referred matters would go up. We can
argue about whether that is a good or bad thing, but it is probably
what would happen. That reflects they way that practice would go, and I
advance that case to the Committee because I believe&#151;I am sorry,
the BMA believes&#151;that we should raise it and bring it to your
attention. But do I believe that people would behave hugely
differently? No, at first they would not. They would start to feel more
defensive, and that is the concern that we are trying to

of Government and the GMC, there may well be that perception. I said at
the beginning that the profession would want very much to see the
proposed structure and operation of the independent body. We have some
idea within the Bill, although there are some problems with that in
that some of the links with Government, which Sir Graeme and Findlay
referred to, are perhaps still too strong. There are certainly concerns
about how such a body would be funded, following experiences with, for
instance, the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board, which
oversees medical training. The profession feels that it has almost had
a licence to set its own agenda and its own fees without any check or
hindrance, so there would be concerns about that. In terms of seeing a
degree of independence, within the whole context of what the profession
still believes is important to professionally-led regulation, and
therefore a profession in some way having responsibility for its
members and those it represents, I think that an independent body would
be looked on quite favourably by the

directors in trusts, or whoever&#151;whose loyalties have been
primarily to their trust. We are not saying that their loyalties should
be to the profession, but they should be to the wider benefits of
health care. It is about achieving that balance by a degree of
separation of function and a degree of separation of loyalties from the
employer, and having an effective and practical operation. That is
quite difficult; I accept
that.</div>

conflicts of interest, but there are some who will be under
considerable pressure from their employers to act in certain ways. How

point about training. I am glad that came out, because I think that we
shall have to pursue it. Although the GMC did not say so in their
evidence, I got the impression that what lay behind their discussion
was that there is a degree to which there is merit in having a medical
director who is also the responsible officer, because they have the
credibility of somebody who understands what it is like to practice
medicine, and who is therefore a peer. That can help when it comes to
making a judgment about somebody&#146;s ability and so

						</i> Obviously, we have concentrated very much on
the standard of proof. I reiterate what I said at the beginning: we
welcome a lot of the direction of travel. We want to weed out
incompetent, poorly performing doctors, but we want to do so as much as
possible in a climate of support and rehabilitation, because we do not
believe that most doctors set out to be bad doctors; there are often
circumstances that perhaps make it easier for them to be less than
adequately performing doctors. We want to try to continue a move
towards more local resolution and more support for doctors, at the same
time coming down very hard on those few doctors who are not only
performing poorly but are not amenable to or will not co-operate with
remediation. We feel that that is the best way to protect
patients.</div>
					<a name="08010928000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
my earlier comment. A system that has the confidence of the profession
is much more likely to encourage doctors to be honest about faults in
themselves and colleagues. In my experience, that has always been the
most common way that problems with doctors come about. We have heard
about cases&#151;Sir Graeme alluded to them&#151;in which, after
the case comes out, lots of people come out of the woodwork to say,
&#147;We knew for ages that he wasn&#146;t a very good man.&#148;
We want a system that makes such people come forward at the beginning,
which is why we want a system that has the confidence of the

of health and social care services in the United
Kingdom?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Helen
McCallum:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, it is. Which? is
very supportive of a merged health and social care regulator. From the
perspective of the user or patient, the mystery of the boundaries
between health and social care has certainly been confusing for people.
We think that it will provide a real opportunity to drive a more
patient-focused approach, but we should like to see two things to
strengthen that. We feel that it is an omission that the Bill does not
set out clearly a distinct purpose for the body, which articulates its
role as being primarily for the protection of patients. I do not know
whether you would agree, but I am not certain that clause 2(5) cuts the
mustard in terms of intelligibility to the average lay person. We would
like to see something more along the lines of the Food Standards
Agency, which has a very clear statement of purpose. It allows for the
lay person to understand what the body is for. It allows the focus of
the body to be clear to everyone and it allows for a revaluation of
whether the body has, in fact, met the functions that it has been
required to meet. That is one thing that we would like to
see.</div>
					<a name="08010928000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Associated
with that is the fact that we would like to strengthen the Bill in
terms of a duty to take on board and listen to the views of patients
and service users. At the moment, the Bill states that the CQC will
&#147;have regard to&#148; the views of the public. We are not sure
that that is specific enough. Our research has shown that patients and
service users have a number of issues that, for a variety of reasons,
they are reluctant, unwilling or feel unable to raise. It is there that
the real signals of what might be going wrong with the system are to be
found. We would like the Bill to strengthen that for the
CQC.</div>

arisen as a result of the changes in the Commission for Health
Improvement and ultimately the community health 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>councils, which were an avenue for such a voice. I do not know whether
you feel that that therefore sits as a logical step in restoring some
of that independent voice and the listening process. In order to meet
that need, what would you do to amend the legislation in light of last
year&#146;s Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act,
which clearly intended to go some way down that track? From what you

as you know, focuses in part on malnutrition issues and it would be
helpful for us to understand the degree to which that as an initiative,
not a legislative approach, is not necessarily delivering in the terms

food and social care services are as fundamental as cleanliness to the
delivery of patient progress care. We are delighted to see that the
Bill addresses those issues, and there is clearly a significant need to
address those matters of cleanliness. The service that we have, has
shown that patients and service users are concerned about the standard
of food that they receive. That is not a question of whether or not
they like it, but is about the nature of the food with respect to
certain medical conditions and the extent to which people actually
receive the food as it arrives. It seems to us to be another potential
scandal waiting to happen, in the same sense that there has been a real
consumer detriment around issues of inefficiency and cleanliness. We
think that this issue is just as important, and it should therefore be
stated as a responsibility of the regulator.</div>

returns to my point about triggers with regard to the
regulator&#146;s listening capability in receiving intelligence from
patients and service users, who are often concerned about cleanliness
as well as food and a variety of other issues about the organisation of
care. Our research has shown that a significant number of those do not
at the moment feel able to make the right representations in the right
place. The powers are adequate, but we should ensure that the
intelligence comes to the regulator in the most effective way. The best
way to do that is for the regulator to have a duty and responsibility
to enable people to &#147;indicate&#148; that there is a
problem.</div>

to practical examples provided, for instance by Maidstone Tunbridge

going in. Research that we did for the consultation on complaints
reform last year shows that fewer than one in three people who felt

issue is not so much the powers, but the means of indicating that there

<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>trusts&#146; financial problems in the past few years. We would like
the same kind of focus on the quality of experience, particularly on
cleanliness. However, closing down a local hospital or even a local
ward is not necessarily the solution because it might leave local
people without an alternative&#151;fines on services could,
potentially, end up penalising other service users. There needs to be a

of the most serious problems concern the care of the elderly. The fact
that one third of people do not report their problems very often is
because they cannot articulate them, owing to their age, frailty,

the experience and another 40 per cent. or so did not want to make a
fuss. Those surveyed could choose more than one answer&#151;in case
your maths worked out that that added up to more than 100. For a
number, the process was too complicated or they did not know how to
make a formal complaint. However, of most concern&#151;this is
reinforced by a report produced by the Healthcare Commission earlier
this year&#151;about one third feared that it would jeopardise future

narrow one. The health in pregnancy grant will be a one-off financial
payment at a specific point in a woman&#146;s pregnancy, with the
stated objective that she will be encouraged, even likely, to use the
money for the proclaimed purposes. Based on your expertise, experience
and understanding of how consumers behave, how do you react to it as a
consumer issue? How are people likely to receive the payment, and would
their behaviour be natural if the grant delivered on its stated
objective? Ultimately, fiscal policy has to work with the grain of
human behaviour rather than simply be an announcement from on high.

						</i> At the moment, the administration of dermal
fillers, including some that are semi-permanent and permanent, of Botox
injections and of such things as chemical peels do not come under the
Healthcare Commission&#146;s remit. It is a rapidly growing market
and is likely to grow even more rapidly. The consequences of things
going wrong and not being done correctly are significant, and the
report that we published this week highlighted an industry that is, to
use a word that was used earlier, cavalier. Poor practices and rule
breaking are prevalent, and we have also found in our research that the
drive to make a sale&#151;it is very much a private market&#151;can
put consumer safety at risk.</div>

changes in technology, some of the currently more invasive treatments
are moving towards the non-invasive spectrum. That is why we would like
an explicit reference to cosmetic treatments. We recognise that the
Department believes that the taxpayer should not pay for regulation in
that context, but actually the taxpayer often ends up paying if it goes
wrong, because the NHS often picks up the pieces. Providers pay a

								David
Rogers:
							</b>
						</i> I will set out three particular concerns that
we have, and Anne may then wish to add to them. We certainly want to
see a duty to co-operate and share information locally because that is
where service delivery happens and where mistakes are sometimes
regrettably made. Anything that can be done to prevent such a situation
arising is to be welcomed. The relationship that the new regulator
would have with service deliverers in local communities up and down the
country is very important from our perspective.</div>
					<a name="08010928000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
major issue is about performance indicators. As I am sure that members
of this Committee are aware, a concordat has been entered into between
central Government and local government, which was agreed by the
Secretary of State Hazel Blears and Simon Milton on behalf of the Local
Government Association. It is all about co-operation in general and, in
particular, about a much smaller set of indicators&#151;198 as
opposed to the previous figure of more than 1,000. Therefore, we do not
want to see any more specific indicators added to that
bundle.</div>
					<a name="08010928000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
element is that public health powers relating to things or premises,
rather than to individuals, should remain with local authorities. We
feel that the proposal for that to go to JPs could cause unnecessary
delay in certain circumstances. We can elaborate on any of those should
you
wish.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B"> </b>
						</i>Yes, I should like to make a
couple of points about the first point&#151;the
duty to co-operate and share information. It comes from several
operational experiences. First, we want to avoid duplication between
the commission and local authorities&#146; powers over contract
monitoring and commissioning. There are concerns that people who want
to make complaints can fall through the net, and it is important with
the rising concerns about adult protection that we have robust local
systems whereby information is shared between all local agencies,
including what the commission, local authorities, the police and other
agencies know. The issue is about operating in a joined-up way and the
willingness to be open and share information. It goes both
ways.</div>

measures work very well. For instance, we could talk about the practice
with Ofsted in child care settings, whereby local authorities have
responsibility for food safety and hygiene, and Ofsted has
responsibility for inspection. Increasingly, locally, relevant
information is shared so that if one body becomes aware of
circumstances that relate more to another, the information is passed on
and the responsible body can take action. You might know about that
situation in particular, because councils in Surrey are trailing an
aide-mÃ(c)moire for Ofsted on that very issue so that there is good

flagged up areas in which they have difficulty with

levels for support, either elderly, learning disabled or whatever,
there are inevitably people below the threshold. The individuals
expressed concern about their inability to check whether there is a
problem with that group below the eligibility threshold. Equally, on
mental health, there was concern about their inability when they
inspect to access records and more detail about individual people in a
hospital or in residential care. Could you outline the problems with
practice, so that sharing, in terms of inspectorates, can be improved
in those areas?</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>We are<b class="B"> </b>in
favour of one commission largely because so much provision is currently
integrated and more and more will be. The public do not care who
delivers services as long as they are of a good quality, flexible and
treat people with dignity and respect. The public want to be assured
that one body is responsible, and that it does not duplicate or focus
on different things. As the Bill outlines, there is much scope for the
reviews to be joint reviews of, say, provision for older
people&#151;how people are treated with dignity and respect
throughout health and social care. There is much to be learned from
practice across the existing commissions, because some have had far
more involvement of users and carers in inspection processes than
others. In one way, there should not really be difficulties for, say,
the Mental Health Act Commission accessing records and information, but
obviously it has told you that there has been. I cannot comment in any
detail on that, because it is able to interview people and
staff.</div>

intervention, but there is an awful lot more that can be brought to
bear on that. As we integrate more and more, it is also about seeing

						</i> To add to that, the wider picture is of
enormous demographic challenges; in 20 years&#146; time, 20 per cent
of the population will be over 65 and, therefore, whatever the
situation is now, there will be greater demands then. Of course, that
is already true in some less urban parts of the country. The number of
children with disabilities has risen by 62 per cent over the past 25
years, we know that there are good reasons for that. It shows that, in
relation to eligibility criteria, the challenges that individual local
authorities are facing, especially at this time of the year, as they
come to setting their budgets, are very severe
indeed.</div>

this, but the principle is that services are increasingly being
provided jointly or in an integrated way at local level, therefore,
whatever the regulatory framework is, it needs to reflect that. That is
good for the individuals concerned, because sometimes it is hard to
discern where social care ends and health care begins, and vice versa.
That is something that we are entirely comfortable with, and it is also
why we support the integration of regulation, but the practicalities of
it need to ensure that it works, is effective and has the right balance
between regulation, which is of course necessary, but without spending
too much on it at the expense of those front-line

						</i> As the Association of Directors of Adult
Social Services, clearly we have a huge investment in
making sure that there is detailed attention to the quality and
regulation of social care. As we have said, the way forward is
integration, and we have to make sure that the commission works in an
integrated way. That is going to be the key. In local government, we
have as much investment in making sure that health services are of high
quality and people are treated with dignity as we have in social care,
because we are dealing with these people and they are crossing between
health and social care all the time. It will be down to who is
appointed as the commissioners, and their background, who the staff are
and having a true, joined-up approach to the reviews. We already have
some joined-up performance indicators; as time goes on and practice
emerges, we would like to see more&#151;within the overall basket of
198 indicators&#151;that really focus on the integrated nature of
what we are trying to do.</div>

arising in parallel with the Minister&#146;s question, when you say

are you talking about the regulatory system or about the whole of
health and social care provision becoming integrated? In which case,
are we in danger of letting regulatory frameworks and processes get way
ahead of where we are in the delivery of services on the ground, given
the very sharp divide between what you, as local government
organisations, can offer versus what the NHS offers in terms of health
care&#151;and, of course, given the massive difference between the
central taxpayer-funded NHS versus local government, local
taxpayer-funded social services? I just wonder whether you are getting

right that it causes problems at the front line because of the wavy
line, if you like, between health and social care&#151;and, often,
continuing care. That should be no reason not to be able to integrate
as much as we can. I would agree with Councillor Rogers that an awful

particularly, returning to a point we have already made, their local
relationships with service providers and local authorities. If that
operates in the way that I believe it could, there will be one port of
