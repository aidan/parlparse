<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> When the Committee adjourned last Thursday, we were debating amendment No. 120 to clause 92. A mistake has been made whereby amendment No. 120 has been omitted from today's amendment paper, but copies of it are available in the Room.
<H4><center>Clause 92</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Postcode Address File</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [16 March]: No. 120, in page 50, line 16, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) In the File—
<P>
(a) each address shall include a county; and
<P>
(b) each postcode shall reflect the county in which the addressee resides, except in as much as the efficiency of sorting addresses near county boundaries requires reference to a neighbouring county on the official address'.—[Mr. Duncan.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> We are about to start the last few streets of our final delivery here at London SWlA 0AA. You were not with us, Mr. Maxton, when we began the debate under Mr. Butterfill's excellent chairmanship last week, but we spent longer than I had expected discussing postcodes. There was some confusion about the postcode—what the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) described as the ``wretched postcode address file''—and the understandable concern felt by people when their address is not described accurately. Postcodes are made up of a series of routine instructions that enable mail posted in any part of the country to be delivered by the most efficient and economical route to its intended destination. The routine instructions are interpreted by the Post Office machinery. Along with Royal Mail staff, it now sorts video coding through optical character recognition machines.
<P>
The amendment would make it possible to ask for postcodes to be changed to reflect the county of the addressee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>each postcode shall reflect the county in which the addressee resides.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The postcode is the combination of factors, such as SW1A 0AA. To change that to reflect the county in which the address resides would mean changing almost every postcode in the country. Apart from a few exceptions, postcodes do not reflect the county in which addressees reside. Changing postcodes would be as inconvenient as changing telephone numbers. Postcodes are now widely used; the Post Office needs them for its own purposes, but it is happy to share such information with other organisations. In fact, the census in 2001 will be based on postcodes.
<P>
People engrave postcodes on to their car windscreens as a security device; they put them on their bicycles so that, if they are stolen, they can be returned to them. Postcodes are used in many different ways and one of the reasons why they are so used is that they are reliable and change very little. The Post Office Users National Council investigated the matter some time ago and established a code of practice, which said that postcodes should be changed only when it was operationally necessary to improve the delivery service. That reflected the fact that changes in postcodes would be extremely inconvenient to customers and businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Can the Minister think of any postcode apart from London, which is a capital city, that does not reflect a county?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I cannot think of many postcodes that do reflect the county. The county title is not part of a postcode. Croydon, for example, is the post town, not the county. Surrey is not reflected in the postcodes of Croydon. Aylesbury is not reflected in any Buckinghamshire postcode. Somerset is not reflected in any postcode for Weston-super-Mare. Derbyshire is not reflected in postcodes for Derby, although the county takes its name from the city. County information is not included in postcodes. The few remaining references to counties, which appear in some Scottish postcodes, are due to be removed at the end of the year. The point of the postcode is to route the mail to the 60 or 70 major processing centres so that it can be passed on to delivery offices. I am sorry that there is a misunderstanding
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): The Minister is making a good point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am honoured to hear that accolade. Opposition Members are being fair, in that there is obviously a concern about Rutland's county status. I was a postman sorter in the early 1970s, and, due to the actions not of the Post Office but of a Conservative Government—
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> No, Heath. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggests that the changes were nothing to do with a Conservative Government, but due to Heath. Rutland disappeared. Slough, where I lived at the time, was dragged across the county border from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire. Mr. Butterfill will remember that Bournemouth was moved from Hampshire to Dorset. All kinds of problems occurred. Many Scottish counties disappeared altogether. It was a time of considerable confusion. Hull did not want to be part of Humberside, but wanted to be in East Yorkshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Betts </B>(Sheffield, Attercliffe): It wanted to be Hull.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Yes, it wanted to be Hull as well, an independent republic that now has a bigger gross domestic product than most south American republics. The words ``East Yorkshire'' have returned to Hull postal addresses.
<P>
The Post Office is not responsible for changes in county boundaries. Postcodes were in their infancy in 1974, but now there is more than 90 per cent. postcode usage. A good reason why the county should not be reflected in postcodes is that the Post Office would have been forced to change them to reflect the boundary changes made in the Local Government Act 1974, or whatever legislation introduced those changes.
<P>
People are entitled to use counties in addresses, whether Rutland, East Yorkshire or any other. The Post Office wants to see a postcode on an address. To a certain extent, the rest of the address is superfluous. It is necessary for manual sorting, but the equipment reads only the combination of letters and numbers at the end of an address. In a Bill designed to give the Post Office greater commercial freedom and more power over how it runs its business, it would be strange to determine how to specify postcodes and what information is necessary to deliver letters.
<P>
I have informed the chairman and chief executive of the Post Office about the understandable concerns raised in a previous debate. They confirmed that they had had much correspondence with my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mrs. Organ), who has concerns about three villages in her constituency. Those are important issues, but the amendment would be pernicious. It would not be sensible to reflect counties in postcodes, so I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> That was helpful; we are making progress. Having listened to the Minister, I accept that a postcode reflects not a county but a town or city and a sorting office through which letters are routed. I also accept that proposed new subsection (lA)(b) of the amendment would cause a conflict. For instance, LE is not Leicestershire but Leicester, and NG is not Nottinghamshire but Nottingham. Similarly, CV is not a county in the west midlands; it is Coventry. I concede that point and admit that what the Minister said made sense. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), I find saying, ``I was wrong'' does not come easily to my lips, but this is such a moment. I recommend that Labour Members savour it for all it is worth, as it is so rare.
<P>
However, the main part of my argument, to which the Minister referred in his correspondence with the chief executive of the Post Office, relates to the other details that appear in the file. We have not dealt with that issue in detail so far, so I seek further clarification from the Minister on the various other layers of detail, such as house and street names, that appear in an official address list. Perhaps they matter rather more than the postcode.
<P>
The Minister says that he is trying to give the Post Office commercial freedom. I accept that, but in this respect, it is a monopoly. The Post Office is the monopoly holder of the one database that is used by everybody, for subscriptions, lists, checking exact details, and probably for credit checks. The database is also important for insurance purposes, because the lack of accuracy in the detail of someone's address may inadvertently make the insurance company think that he lives in a higher risk area. Therefore, if there is inadequate information in the address file, someone may—unfairly—have to pay a higher premium for his insurance if he lives close to the edge of a town, rather than in a village, or whatever. That is unreasonable, and it would be a perverse effect of the Minister's refusal, so far, to accept my earlier suggestion. Proposed new subsection (lA)(a) would ensure that each address included a county—I think that that is always possible.
<P>
The Post Office wants commercial freedom. Other people besides those who deliver letters will probably buy its database. With the increase in telecommunications power and global satellite systems, taxi drivers and taxi systems are using electronic dispatch systems, which direct them straight to someone's door if they are closest to where a fare is waiting. I imagine that the database will be used for that purpose. Again, not only the postman but the delivery vehicle driver, taxi driver and so on will want to use the database.
<P>
Before we decide whether to push the amendment to a Division, I seek further clarification. Setting aside all arguments about the postcode, which we can bury for the moment, does the Minister accept that the other layers of detail should be properly recorded in the file, to everyone's advantage, and that some means of putting corrections and greater detail in the file should be permissible?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I accept the need to ensure that corrections are made to postcode addresses. Post Office staff have no problem with people using counties or any other information in addresses, although where a number exists, they prefer a house number to a house name. The point of the postcode is that it is for the Post Office's own use. It allows staff to route mail effectively and efficiently to its destination. It is asking too much to say that postcodes should include, as a matter of course, a county on a postcode file when the county is not needed for the mail to reach the right address.
<P>
Virtually all the mail that arrives for me in Hull has the county on it, which is East Yorkshire, not Humberside. That is because I, like others, am insisting on letting people know my correct address. If I receive from my bank or building society correspondence addressed to, ``Hull, Humberside,'' I write back to say, ``No, I'm sorry, it's Hull, East Yorkshire,'' and they comply. I cannot think of any occasion when my address has not been corrected. The clause allows access to what the hon. Gentleman calls the ``wretched postcode address file'', so that the Post Office does not gain a competitive advantage from it, as other postal operators might need to use that information. The clause will make it available elsewhere. The people running the Post Office could rightly say, ``We have the onerous duty of keeping the file, which we put together for our own purposes. It is there purely for what we want it to perform. We do not need counties on the postcode address file, but now we will have to go through the lengthy process of adding that information because we are making it available to other people.'' This is where I part company with the hon. Gentleman. Addresses should be described properly, but we do not need to rely on the postcode address file alone to ensure that that is done.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the calculation of insurance premiums is one of the many things for which postcodes are used. If insurance premiums are lower in one area than another, surely that reflects the number of claims in that area. If people change their details so that they are registered in a different area, insurance premiums may go up in that area, owing to an assessment made not by the Post Office but by insurance companies. The Post Office is in a sense being blamed for the effects of the information that it has kept, simply because it has made that information, which is such a valuable tool, freely available elsewhere. The 2001 census, for example, will be based on postcode information.
<P>
I hope that the amendment is not pressed to a Division. The insistence that counties be included in each address, even without the impractical point contained in proposed new subsection (lA)(b), would add too much to the Bill. The hon. Gentleman openly admitted that that wording would probably cause more difficulties than it would correct. Such admissions are rare, so that was a moment to savour: it will go down in history. I hope that the Committee will oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should make it clear that we are debating a specific amendment. I have been tolerant, but the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton was beginning to stray back to the previous amendment when he talked about changing and amending. I should be grateful if he would stick to the amendment that is before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Of course, Mr. Maxton, I will confine myself to discussion of amendment No. 120. I would not dream of straying.
<P>
The Minister keeps talking about postcodes. I think that we have dealt with that, and that the real issue is the rest of the information in the address. New Labour likes the idea of thought control, but I am sorry to see that it also wants address control. The Post Office is a monopoly and the file is primarily for its use, but it is a great pity not to appreciate that the use of the file extends far more widely. We want there to be detailed information in the address, to suit both the person delivering the mail and the person whose address is described. The clause as it stands takes George Orwell a little too far, and it needs further debate before a wider audience of intelligent people. I will bring up this question again, or something similar, on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not certain whether that was a criticism of the Chair.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 92 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 94 and 95 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 96</center></H4>
<H4><center>Orders</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment made: No 147, in page 52, line 19, after `59' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`[Further provisions relating to the capital structure of the Post Office company],'.—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]<P>

<P>
Clause 96, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 97</center></H4>
<H4><center>Directions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> What does this short clause mean? I should have thought it implicit in the Bill that if someone is told to do something under statute he should do it. Why does it need a special clause entitled ``Directions'', which specifies:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person to whom a direction is given under this Act shall give effect to it?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that not already implicit? Is the provision not superfluous?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> No, we do not believe that it is. The clause is a standard clause that also provides that any power conferred by the Bill to give directions includes the power to vary or revoke any such directions. It also provides that such directions should be given in writing. The clause specifies technical matters relating to the powers of direction covered elsewhere in the Bill, and it is necessary.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 97 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 98 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 99</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 53, line 9, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and includes an enactment comprised in, or in subordinate legislation under, an Act of Parliament, whenever passed or made'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment will clarify the interpretation of ``enactment'' in clause 99, to ensure that it covers Acts passed in the same Session as the Bill. The timing differences for the various Bills being introduced in this Session, will make it practically difficult to make any necessary consequential amendments to other legislation. The amendment will ensure that the Secretary of State's powers to make orders, regulations and modifications by order to an enactment, instrument or document as a result of the Bill covers Acts passed in this Session.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 53, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but shall exclude any communication which has been converted into a physical form by a postal operator from electronic data transmitted to him by means of a telecommunications system'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When I read the clause, I was overcome with nostalgia. Memories came flooding back. I was transported some 19 years back in time to the Committee that considered the Bill to divide the Post Office from British Telecom. We were told that it would be the ruination of both organisations and that the world would never be the same again. Interestingly, the clause is a rerun, although the roles are reversed, as Opposition Members are arguing that remonopolisation, or renationalisation, should not take place, whereas at that time the argument was reversed. It was interesting to read the list of Committee members to find that three are dead, three are noble Lords, three are knights, three are spending more time with their families, and only two survive—the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. McWilliam) and myself. It would be a moment of nostalgia for him, too. I shall acquaint him with this rerun, as he argued the contrary of what I shall argue.
<P>
The clause represents a complete turnaround. It will extend the monopoly section. It is a form of renationalisation. I do not know why the Government want to return to that argument. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, it just goes to show that, despite all the spin and the statements, the clause is a clear sign that leopards never change their spots, and that old Labour is alive and well and living in No. 10 Downing street, among other places.
<P>
As I understand it, under previous legislation, the Post Office can provide electronic mail, but BT also can issue licences to private operators to run such services. It appears—no doubt the Minister will correct me with glee if I am not correct—that clause 99 will allow private operators to transmit electronic mail up and down the country, but they would depend on the Post Office to deliver messages to a third party at the destination, and perhaps in some cases even to collect the messages before they were transmitted.
<P>
The hybrid mail service was liberated in 1981 specifically to give it a chance to expand and take off. I will return to that failure to expand and develop in a moment. The clause would remonopolise the service. There is a definition in the British Telecommunications Act 1981, and communications that are to be or have been transmitted by means of a telecommunications system are not included.
<P>
At the time the then Opposition argued that the exclusion of hard copy electronic mail was not necessary; if the service proved to be inadequate, the Secretary of State could use his powers to license private operators or to derogate that category of mail completely. It was a ``Let's wait and see what happens'' type of policy. That might be true in theory, but it was feared at the time that if the Post Office had the monopoly, private operators would be deterred from setting up that type of electronic mail business. We would then never know whether the Post Office service was adequate or inadequate.
<P>
As the Minister knows, this area has been noted for masterly inactivity. Neither the Post Office nor the private operators have taken advantage of the situation; perhaps they have not seen it as a sufficiently dynamic area of the market. I do not feel that there is any need to change the current legislation, but electronic mail could be a large area for growth. The Post Office has a natural monopoly—or rather a dominant position, as we know it is unlawful to prevent private operators from entering the sector.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to the following points. Is this a new service that may not be reserved? I refer him to recital 21 of the preamble to the postal services directive. Furthermore, is it not a fact that the remonopolisation of these services is not only a step backwards from the general process of liberalisation that the Opposition wish to see, and which is contemplated in the postal services directive? It is a state measure which is contrary to, and an abuse of, the competition rules. That could be regarded as infringement of the European competition treaty. The use of hybrid mail is quite low in many countries because monopolies are still in place. In Sweden, where the market has been liberalised, the proportion of physical mail that is converted into hybrid mail is about 1 per cent. That has provided competition with traditional delivery methods and improved price and quality, and has not significantly eroded the revenue stream of the universal service provider.
<P>
When hybrid mail was debated back in 1981, one of the chief supporters of the amendment that would have taken it back within the Post Office remit and extended the monopoly argued that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We could suffer an erosion of the letter traffic of about 25 per cent., which represents 35,000 jobs.—[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 19 February 1981; c. 479.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know where he got that figure from. I am sure that he did not pluck it out of the air; it will have come from the Post Office or the unions. However, that erosion has not taken place, to any extent. I believe that Italy has one of the highest rates of diversion to hybrid mail: we are told that it is around 10 per cent.—although that might be a reflection of the quality of the Italian universal service provider rather than of any genuine enthusiasm for hybrid mail. I should be grateful if the Minister told us the figures for current usage of hybrid mail. I believe it to be so low as to make the proposed change unnecessary.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The communications market in this country continues to evolve and develop. Although the volume of direct mail is increasing, which is obviously to the good—and internet trading, an industry that will continue to expand, will provide a huge boost to companies delivering packages and parcels, which will obviously benefit all the players in our Post Office—its dominance will be challenged by other forms of communication such as fax or e-mail. Indeed, Members of Parliament see the use of such methods of communication growing inside the Palace of Westminster. Their significance was recognised in the British Telecommunications Act 1981; I shall not go through the relevant sections of that Act because the Minister knows them and has them in front of him.
<P>
I think that I have shown the importance of allowing electronic mail and hard copy to lie outside the Post Office monopoly. To re-monopolise them could stifle moves in that liberalised market, as it starts to expand. Our amendment is to be commended. Its objective is clear; indeed, even the Minister agrees ruefully that it is relatively easy to understand. To reject the amendment would be to try to turn the clock back to 1981 and extend the Post Office monopoly to cover the transmission and delivery of electronic data. While that might be intoxicating for some trade union officials and Post Office managers, it would damage several businesses in this country and be a serious mistake. I hope that the Minister can find it in his heart to support what we are saying.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): We talk about leopards and spots; the hon. Gentleman has obviously had an encounter with a leopard somewhere along the way—he seems to have been clawed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It was me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> Perhaps it was by his hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton, whose claws are rather sharp this morning.
<P>
I am pleased by the honesty of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) in admitting that he wants to see the end of the Post Office. His claim that he wants to protect sub-post offices and the universal postal service has been shown for the charade it is. He says that electronic commerce is the future of the universal postal service, which he wants to be abolished. The amendment would bring about the withering of the universal postal service and that is what the hon. Gentleman wants. I hope that the Minister will challenge him on that. The amendment is a back-door method of ensuring the ending of the universal postal service and of sub-post offices. Instead of taking up the real challenge of protecting them, the hon. Gentleman wants to abolish them.
<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Perhaps I could add to what my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire has said and comment on the remarks of the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)—of whom all I could see, with the bright window behind him, was the silhouette of his ears. It was a peculiar sight.
<P>
We are talking about what will happen to the telegram—or any modern form of telegram. Everyone knows how letters are delivered: they go to the sorting office and are delivered by the postman. The new forms of communication will not directly compete with the existing letter and parcel delivery service; they belong to a different market with a different purpose. Will the Minister tell us what has happened to telegram deliveries over the past few years? My hunch is that they have significantly declined. Electronic communication may bring about the revival of such transmission; some form of electronic telegram could be sent to the local post office and delivered in printed form to people who do not have e-mail terminals at home. Such messages can be much more complicated than the old three-line telegram with ``stop'' every six words. I say to the hon. Member for Chorley that far from threatening the rural post office network, the amendment could give it a new opportunity. Rural post offices could be used as printing stations for such electronic mail, with the delivery leg provided locally. The postman and post van come from not the local post office but the local sorting office; they constitute a different leg of the network.
<P>
The amendment would allow a rural or community post office to receive electronic communications, for which it would probably be paid, that would then be delivered, perhaps with the evening paper round. A little kid could do it for 10p, or 26p, or whatever. A little system or market could develop. It is not for me to describe it; perhaps the hon. Member for Chorley is about to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> I am saddened that the hon. Gentleman has not accepted the national minimum wage—some young boy, some child, peddling round a village delivering telegrams for 10p? I hope that the hon. Gentleman will immediately withdraw that disgraceful suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Even I am not suggesting 10p or 26p an hour.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, the Bill could remonopolise that form of mail delivery, when it should be freed up. Our amendment would not undermine the universal service of the Post Office nor would it destroy its competitive position. It may awaken a new and slightly different form of service, which, at present, is dormant. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Chorley said, the amendment would provide a good opportunity for little post offices, which, at little expense these days, could obtain the equipment to receive and print such mail and enable it to be delivered, either privately or by another means.
<P>
I do not envisage postmen delivering such items from small rural post offices, but another supportive service could complement the facility offered by them. The Bill is unduly restrictive. The provision is an unnecessary restraint on people who, with a bit of initiative and effort, could provide a service that would benefit communities as well as themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I am not surprised that the Opposition tabled the amendment. In fact, I would have been surprised if they had not. That is their job. The hon. Gentleman described the provision as one of renationalisation. That might help my street credibility. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire referred to leopards changing their spots and other such gentle hyperbole, which made me fairly nostalgic for what happened in 1981. At that time, the British Telecommunications Act 1981 placed a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>communication which has been converted into a physical form by a postal operator from electronic data<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
outside the reserved area. It is right that we are looking to bring such a provision into the reserved area, not because of a sudden shift towards old Labour and renationalisation. In fact, we have dealt with propositions for brokers' research and document exchange centres that are currently subject to a class licence to be outside the reserved area. Why are we arguing against the amendment and wanting to embrace communications that are transmitted electronically and turned into a physical item that can be delivered to the door? Why do we want to return to 1981?
<P>
I was fascinated to hear about the debates that took place in 1981. Computers were in their infancy. There was a feeling that such a market needed to be developed and it was understandable that that class of mail should be placed outside the monopoly area. What has happened since then? The majority of mail is now produced electronically. It is estimated that about 3.5 billion items can be transmitted electronically—a situation that probably was not conceived of in 1981 and not foreseen as coming about within 20 or 30 years. I shall return to telegram services in a second, but the amendment would create a possible breach of the licensing conditions and undermine the universal service. It has not happened, but because the majority of mail is created electronically and can be so transmitted, someone might set up an organisation and say, ``We will deliver mail in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow that is electronically transmitted to the city, and we will have a team of staff to deliver cross-city mail at rates well below the current tariff of 26p for a first-class item; perhaps 5p or 6p.'' We are considering something that could seriously undermine the universal service obligation. It is inconceivable that people could have held such views in 1981.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Since 1981, there has been no great move by the private sector into the market for such services. Only one company—the Royal Mail—deals with electronically transmitted mail, despite the fact that such mail is outside the monopoly. The Royal Mail deals with 75 million items a year. There are currently no companies in the reserved area that would be affected. I accept that that is a reason why Opposition Members asked what the problem was, but the problem is what could happen in the future.
<P>
The important point about the return of the telegram service was made by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton. The service ceased in 1982 or 1983, and is sadly lamented by lots of ex-telegram boys. A third of all recruits into the Post Office between the wars were telegram boys, who came in and stood to attention, which is the kind of regime that the Opposition would like to reintroduce. The system was changed to that of telemessages, which are operated by BT. I believe that that system still exists, but it costs more than £1, so it is outside the reserved area. At the moment, electronic mail is mainly direct business and advertising mail transmitted and delivered in bulk. It is almost inconceivable that anyone could run a reproduction of the telegram service at less than £1. I have long felt that there is a problem with people who do not have telephones or are away and urgently need to be contacted, and that the same-day instant transmission of telegrams is a gap in the market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> If a rural sub-post office received electronic mail and decided to deliver it down the street, would it be in breach of the monopoly of the reserved area? Could the community Post Office network do that without falling foul of existing legislation? Would it have to do it at a uniform tariff?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The Post Office could provide such a service, but it would have to do so at a uniform tariff at the moment. The most common message on the internet is ``Send me something through the post'', so e-commerce presents opportunities to the Post Office as well as threats. I shall develop my point and move on to that subject. I have been advised that the telemessage service withered on the vine and was killed off by BT a couple of years ago.
<P>
If there is a market for the service that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton mentioned, dealing with requests for a licence will be a matter not for the Secretary of State but for the commission. That is understandable if the fee is less than £1. If it is more than £1, it is outside the currently defined limit of the reserved area. It is less than £1, an application could be made for a licence for that kind of service. There has to be a balance.
<P>
E-mail comes straight to most people's computers; it is almost inconceivable that it would then be put in physical form and delivered for a return. Someone simply someone passing e-mail to someone else as a favour is completely different, and is outside the terms of the debate. Possible services may emerge that cost more than £1, in which case they would be outside the reserved area. Some imaginative company could apply for a licence if it planned to reintroduce the telegram service and deliver items for 80p. Against that is the fear that at some stage all communications might be generated and transmitted electronically, which could constitute a serious breach of the universal service obligation. There is no problem with the monopoly and reserved area being breached by a licence holder, in accordance with the Bill, but the amendment would allow a coach and horses to be driven through the legislation.
<P>
An estimated 3.5 billion items are already convertible by electronic transfer, and that number is likely to grow. Having reflected carefully, and having predicted the arguments involved in considering a Bill designed to provide greater liberalisation, we are retreating from that. As Opposition Members will accept, we have balanced the arguments carefully and have accepted that a real threat exists. That threat outweighs considerations about new services, especially as the new services that have been mentioned, if they are feasible, will, I am sure, be licensed by the regulator once he is convinced that they will not jeopardise the universal service obligation.
<P>
If another company enters the market in which the Post Office operates for the electronic transmission of large quantities of mail—none has in almost 20 years, since 1981—and applies for a licence and the commission, whose prime responsibility the matter is, is convinced that providing one will not undermine the universal service obligation, a licence will be provided.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> Will my hon. Friend comment on the myth being perpetuated by the Opposition that for a small amount a sub-post office could acquire a machine, go to a local newspaper shop and ask the local newspaper boys or girls to deliver mail? Does my hon. Friend recognise that people would use the newspaper shop or a local taxi company, rather than sub-post offices? People would use a service that can deliver, and that would affect sub-post offices, which we want to protect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. The Post Office network may have an advantage in handling e-commerce shopping if local customers want somewhere accessible to pick up their orders. The opportunity for the Post Office network will probably be in handling packages rather than messages.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I hope that the Committee will reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Although I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, it was predictable and disappointing. My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said that all that he could see of the hon. Member for Chorley was his ears. I am sorry to say that although his ears were all that my hon. Friend could see, the hon. Gentleman was not using them. He alleged that I advocated the removal of the universal Post Office, whatever that might be, and that I attacked the universal service, which is completely incorrect. I am reminded of a little ditty from ``The Gondoliers'', by Gilbert and Sullivan, which states:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That we treasure beyond measure<P>

<P>
I am not sure whether the Minister will endorse the errand that the hon. Member for Chorley has run. I realise that he is not a Minister of State, but the way that the Secretary of State is going, it will not be long before he is moved up the ladder—
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> The hon. Gentleman recognises his talents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I go along with that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton pointed out that the amendment might help sub-post offices to offer a new delivery service. I am sorry to say that the Minister is trapped in the past, rather than looking to the future. He seemed to say that keeping the service outside the monopoly was the right decision in 1981, but that doing so now would be the wrong decision. His right hon. and hon. Friends argued then that it was the right decision to keep the service inside the monopoly, and we are now seeing a reversal to type. Now he says that everything is different. Life is different, and the only way to react to changes is to move with them. The Post Office has been remarkably slow to offer such a service. Indeed, it has not even started to do so. It is behaving like a dog in the manger: it wants the service to be back in the monopoly, but it has not guaranteed that such a service will be available. Neither the Minister nor the Post Office has suggested that it intends to operate such a service, but it wants the service to be brought back into the monopoly to ensure that no one else can.
<P>
The Minister's position is luddite. He has not answered any of my questions about how the clause might contradict the postal services directive. We should debate the matter further on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 56, line 24, after second `to' insert `90, sections 92 and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it is convenient to take Government amendment No. 149.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The amendments enable the Post Office to take greater advantage of the benefits of the Government's policy of greater commercial freedom at the earliest opportunity, before it becomes a plc and after the Bill is enacted. Under current legislation, the Post Office is not able to do certain things that may be commercially in its interests. For example, it cannot undertake currency swaps or borrow in a foreign currency from the national loans fund. Similarly, the Secretary of State's powers are limited to certain activities in respect of the commercial activities of the Post Office. For example, the Secretary of State can borrow only from the national loans fund and make loans to the Post Office in sterling, and can lend direct only to the Post Office, not to its subsidiaries. The provisions of clause 91 enable the statutory corporation to take advantage of the greater freedoms provided in part IV of the Bill for the Post Office company.
<P>
The Government do not wish to delay any longer than necessary enabling the Post Office to take full advantage of the commercial freedoms set out in the reform package to be completed under the Bill. The amendments provide that the extension of the powers of the Secretary of State and the Post Office under clause 91 will come into force as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill by making specific provision for clause 91 to come into force two months after enactment.
<P>
Time is not standing still in the marketplace and if we are to have the world-class Post Office in the United Kingdom that we all desire for the 21st century, we must enable the Post Office to meet the challenges ahead as soon as it can. The amendments ensure that we shall do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
This is a technical amendment to the Bill. It will introduce a protection for licence holders. The Postal Services Commission has a duty under clause 14 to make final orders against the licence holder when it is satisfied that the licence holder is contravening any condition of his licence or is likely to contravene the licence. Under clause 15, the commission must make a provisional order against the licence holder when, although it is not satisfied, it seems that a contravention is or is likely to occur and than an order is needed. Under clause 16, the commission must confirm a provisional order if it is satisfied that a contravention is occurring or is likely to occur and that confirmation is needed.
<P>
In most cases, it will be clear cut whether a licence holder is contravening a licence condition. However, circumstances could arise in which there is room for dispute about a grey area between the licence holder and the commission. Furthermore, if the commission has failed to follow the procedural provisions of clauses 18 and 19, the licence holder may be disadvantaged. In such cases, it would be reasonable to give licence holders a right of appeal to the courts similar to that contained in the Electricity Act 1989 and other utilities legislation.

<P>
(b) the value or amount (as at the time of transfer) of any asset or liability of the Post Office taken to have been transferred to the Post Office company by virtue of paragraph (a) shall be taken to be the value or (as the case may be) the amount assigned to that asset or liability for the purposes of the corresponding statement of accounts prepared by the Post Office in relation to that year.

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause provides for continuity in the business across the transfer by providing that the Post Office corporation's closing accounts are also the Post Office company's opening statutory accounts. It will mean that assets and liabilities of the Post Office are to be taken as transferred at the value given by the accounts of the Post Office for its last accounting year. It also means that anything done by the Post Office is treated for accounting purposes as if it had been done by the Post Office company. For example, the profits of the Post Office will be carried forward and treated as profits of the Post Office company and the same would be true of losses, if there were any.

<P>
Government new clause 7—References to the Competition Commission.

Government new clause 8—Reports on references.
<P>
Government new clause 9—Modification following report.

Government new clause 10—Power of veto of the Competition Commission.

<P>
Government new clause 12—Application of competition legislation to references etc.
<P>
Government new clause 13—Modification by order under other enactment.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 163 to 168.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I apologise to the Committee for tabling so many clauses at this stage in our proceedings. [Interruption.] I believe that that was applause from the Opposition. We considered putting the licence modification provisions in the licence itself but, on further reflection, we decided, to put them into the Bill to safeguard the position of licence holders. I shall spend a little time explaining the clauses.
<P>
The amendments will provide a fair and transparent system for licence modifications. They set down the steps that the Postal Services Commission and others must follow in the event of licence modifications. Most modifications will undoubtedly be by agreement between the Postal Services Commission and the licence holder. However, experience of the utilities sector suggests that regulatory relationships do not always run smoothly and that, sometimes, there is a need for an appropriate mechanism for those instances when the licence holder and the licensor cannot reach agreement on a licence modification.
<P>
In proposing the possibility of reference to the Competition Commission, we are following the precedent set in utilities legislation. In its previous guise as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the Competition Commission has demonstrated its ability and independence on such matters on several occasions. The amendments are technical and I hope that the Committee agrees that they are a welcome addition to the regulatory framework in the Bill. I will briefly explain each clause.
<P>
New clause 6 sets out the procedure that the Postal Services Commission will follow to modify a licence. The procedure is inclusive and transparent, and under subsection (1) the commission may modify a licence only by agreement with the licence holder. New clause 7 allows the commission to make a reference to the Competition Commission, requiring it to investigate and report. New clause 8 concerns reports on references. New clause 9 provides for modifications of licences following a report in which the Competition Commission has identified an operation against the public interest, and has concluded that remedies could be made by licence modifications. New clause 10 provides that the Competition Commission may give a direction to the Postal Services Commission if it considers that the modifications proposed by the commission are not appropriate to remedy or prevent the adverse effects specified in a report. New clause 11 sets out the procedural requirements for licence modification following a report by the Competition Commission; those requirements are self-explanatory, and are intended to ensure that the process is fair and transparent.
<P>
New clause 12 provides for the application of competition legislation to references. The purpose and effect of the provisions is to ensure consistency between the Competition Commission's procedures in relation to a reference under this part of the Bill, and those in relation to its functions under competition legislation. The new clause deals with the treatment of witnesses and documents, for example, with penalties for giving false and misleading information, and with time limits for reports. Details of the provisions are set out not here but in the relevant competition legislation.
<P>
New clause 13 allows for the modification of licences as a result of investigations and reports under the Fair Trading Act 1973; it provides that if the Secretary of State by order exercises any of the powers specified in the 1973 Act, he may provide for the appropriate modification of a postal service licence to give effect to or to take account of any provisions made in such an order.
<P>
The introduction of the new clauses requires some small modifications to schedule 6 to allow the disclosure of information to relevant bodies; the modifications are contained in Government amendments Nos. 163 to 168.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Are we debating new clause 6 alone, or may I speak to new clause 7 at this stage?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> All the new clauses have been grouped with new clause 6, so the hon. Gentleman may debate any of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I have a brief question about new clause 7. As I understand it, the commission has the power to make a reference to the Competition Commission, requiring it to investigate and report on licence holders. Under subsection (5) of the new clause the Secretary of State has the power to direct the Competition Commission not to proceed with the reference. Will the Minister confirm that that negative power is the only one that the Secretary of State enjoys? Does he feel that that power is consistent with his own policy of trying to take politics out of competition references of that sort?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I can confirm that. The Secretary of State has been given that power only to ensure that unnecessary references are not made to the commission when it would be better to consider other ways of reaching agreement between the parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I express my appreciation of the fact that all the new clauses have been grouped, because they flow on from each other, and it makes debate a lot easier. I am concerned about the areas of conflict that could arise from the new clauses; my hon. Friend has just touched on one of them. The Secretary of State appears to have been given the power to dip in and out of the procedure as he—or in the fullness of time perhaps she—may think fit.
<P>
Several questions are raised by the new clauses and I will go through them in chronological order. However, I will omit new clause 6, because I think that we all support the attempt to achieve a consensus on modification of licences by agreement. That would be better than a diktat.
<P>
New clause 7 envisages a permissive power for the Postal Services Commission to make a reference to the Competition Commission, requiring the latter to investigate and report on practices that are against the public interest in the provision of postal services. Will that not require a regulatory body to decide whether it wants to have areas under its own supervision examined? What will the Commission be doing if it may require the Competition Commission to carry out an investigation? I realise that the likelihood of that happening frequently is remote. Nevertheless, if what has been described to us as a powerful commission is running the Post Office scene, why would it want to ask for an investigation into something that it should be able to investigate on its own account?
<P>
My second point is about the form in which references to the Competition Commission must be made. The provisions in subsection (3)(a) and (b) will allow the Postal Services Commission to state its own views on any potentially adverse effects, and on possible variations in licensing conditions that may be necessary to remedy the problems mentioned in the reference itself or in subsequent variants of it. Would some licence holders not regard that as possibly prejudicial to the references and the inquiries made by the Competition Commission?
<P>
Thirdly, if the Postal Services Commission refers a matter to the Competition Commission, is it not an absurd idea that the Postal Services Commission may have information relating to a matter within the scope of the investigation, but will forward it only if the Competition Commission so requests? I wonder whether the phraseology of the new clause is correct.
<P>
New clause 8 relates to reports on references. I think that I could advance an argument that the Competition Commission should have the freedom to comment on whether clauses 3 and 5—which set out the duties of the Postal Services Commission with regard to the provision of a universal postal service, and to consumer interest— are being observed effectively. I refer specifically to subsection (5)(1), which requires the Postal Services Commission
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to further the interests of users of postal services, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between postal operators.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps the Minister can put me right, because I am sure that this is not the intention of new clause 8, but the present wording appears to preclude the Competition Commission from investigating the promotion of competition between postal operators. If it does, it is nonsense, but I am sure that I am reading it wrongly—no doubt the Minister will tell me so. Then I can emulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton by saying that I have made a mistake, although I will make a much quieter and more unassuming withdrawal than my hon. Friend did.
<P>
New clause 9 is self-explanatory and causes no concerns. New clause 10 deals with the power of veto of the Competition Commission. It will give the power to veto licence modifications proposed by the Postal Services Commission on receipt of the Competition Commission's report. That power can be exercised if the Competition Commission believes that the proposed licence changes do not meet the objective of remedying, in whole or in part, the practice that it has investigated and found to be against the public interest. My concern is that that could open up a bureaucratic minefield, with various parts of the Government and the Postal Services Commission arguing with each other, and the poor company being the ultimate victim. Who will benefit from the Competition Commission preventing the Postal Services Commission from making modifications to licences, on the grounds that they do not meet the former's recommendations? The lawyers and courts may face the task of adjudicating between two bodies created by statute. The standing of the Postal Services Commission is bound to suffer if it is overruled in the way envisaged by the clause. Again, perhaps the Minister will explain that.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have only one further point—no doubt the Minister will be delighted—which is on new clause 13, the modification by order under other enactments. I apologise in advance for galloping through it, although the Minister presented all the clauses in about three minutes flat, so I have a right to proceed with similar speed.

<B>The Chairman:</B> You also have the right to take as long as you wish, Mr. Page.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I would not want to try the patience of the Committee and shall be commendably brief. I hope that the hon. Member for Chorley is listening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> The hon. Gentleman gives a good impression.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> All I could see was the hon. Gentleman's ears.
<P>
Apart from the Post Office acting within its preserved areas, I know of no other monopolies, under the definition used in the 1973 Act—to go all that way back—that operate in the postal services sector. If there are others, I shall be glad to know of them. Does the Minister therefore consider it appropriate for the Department to leave intact the Post Office monopoly in the reserved area? If no other postal operators are exposed to the legislation, why should the monopoly of the Post Office remain immune? I would very much like him to respond to that. Those few points arise from the clutch of new clauses that have been thrown at us; I have no doubt that further points will arise that can be investigated on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I have no complaint about the speed with which the hon. Gentleman put his questions. As I said at the beginning, I apologise for tabling such a huge tranche of new clauses. It must be very difficult for Opposition Members to get their mind around them in such a short period.
<P>
When I referred to the precedent set by utilities legislation, Opposition Members might have thought that I meant the Utilities Bill that is going through the House. I was not; I was referring to utilities legislation enacted by the previous Government. We considered whether to include that in the licence itself, but decided that it should be transparent in the Bill. We therefore put in—almost slavishly—every dot and comma of the provisions in previous utilities legislation to deal with potential conflict between the regulator and the regulated. Some of the provisions have stood the test of time.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked how new clause 7 would be invoked. There are two areas involved. The new clause would provide first that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any matters, which are specified in the reference and which relate to the provision of postal services whose provision is authorised or required by a licence, operate against the public interest or may be expected to do so<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, secondly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if so, whether the effects adverse to the public interest that the matters have or may be expected to have could be remedied or prevented by modifying the conditions of the licence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the terms on which new clause 7 can be invoked.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the referral powers of the Postal Services Commission and whether that would be healthy. Once again, we have followed the utilities legislation that was passed by the previous Government. There may be fundamental differences between the licence holder and the commission. The Post Office monopoly was referred to, and it is important to recognise that we are not just talking about the Post Office, but a potential array of licence holders that may develop over the years during which the Bill will be in operation. There will be an open and transparent system whereby the licence holders can refer their problems to the regulator.
<P>
The argument was advanced that such references would be prejudicial under new clause 8. We do not agree. The commission can outline its concerns adequately and ensure that they are examined properly by the Competition Commission, which has a long and distinguished record of dealing with such problems. It is competent and has particular expertise that we do not think any other public body could replicate. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said that information must only be at the request of the Competition Commission. He has misunderstood the clause. New clause 7(6)(b) allows the Postal Services Commission to give information voluntarily if it so wishes.
<P>
The power of veto was also mentioned. It is a significant power for the Competition Commission, but it is necessary because the commission is acting as a reference panel between licence holders and the regulator. It is important that the licence holder can have faith in the process. Without such power, the licensee may rightly consider that the Postal Services Commission can ignore the advice of the Competition Commission and act against the interests of the licensee.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said that new clause 13 was a bureaucratic nightmare. I hope that notification will be by agreement, but it is important to have transparent procedures in place, not least because it is a monopoly area. The people operating within it have certain privileges, and there must be clear recognition that a regime is in force that will allow any problems between the companies and the regulator to be examined by the Competition Commission and dealt with openly and transparently. That is why we want the clauses to be part of the Bill. They will improve it to the benefit of all participants.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
We believe that the new clause is necessary because companies that do not face full competition should be open to public scrutiny on their standards of performance of service provision, as customers cannot easily take their business elsewhere if service is poor. Under the amendment, a holder of a licence under the Bill that is also a company will be required to disclose the links, if any, between the achievement of service standards in the activities covered by the licence, and the remuneration of its directors. The requirement to disclose what links, if any, exist between service standards and remuneration is intended to encourage companies to establish and strengthen such links, and thereby to stimulate improvement in service standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> the Minister has slipped in the new clause on the sly at the end, and has rather sprung it on the Committee. I would be speaking only mildly if I were to describe it as an insidious piece of interfering old Labour filth. The Minister says that he wants freedom and competition for the Post Office, and only a moment ago from his lips fell the words ``an array of licence holders''—in other words, he hopes that there will be lots. They will be free to operate, and will be set standards by all the organisations that the Bill creates. How and how much people are paid is no one's business except inasmuch as any director's emolument must be disclosed by virtue of the company's being a plc or a limited company, and such companies are obliged to disclose that information. Specifying in the Bill a requirement that a director's payment and how he is paid should be a matter of public record is entirely unnecessary. What matters is whether a company properly fulfils the licence conditions laid down for it. How much people are paid to do that is none of my or the Minister's business. If the company is private, such arrangements can rightfully remain private, and it is between the director and the Inland Revenue how much he is paid and pays in tax.
<P>
Moreover, invoking the other provision under which the company can be instructed to have a performance-related system of pay would be doubly bad. The company must deliver, and measuring the company's performance is what matters. Attempting to insist that performance be linked to pay is not the business of the Secretary of State or the House. The stipulation in the licence should govern the company's conduct, and that should be separate from how people are paid. We are very unhappy with the new clause, and we are likely to oppose it either here or on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> When the Opposition spokesman begins by calling the new clause ``an insidious piece of old Labour filth'', I do not have much chance of persuading him of our cause. We are not trying to set the company directors' wage levels, or even insisting that there be a link between their remuneration and service standards. It should be clear if there is not a link. That is especially relevant to an organisation such as the Post Office. Who can tell whether there will be an array of licence holders in the future? At the moment, we are dealing with the Post Office, and whoever is in the licensed and reserved area will be responsible for delivering an important service on which people rely.

My hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Mr. Colman), who has recently joined us from an Adjournment debate, remarked on what has happened in Putney in south-west London. Having heard that and other remarks, I think that it is reasonable that the link between the remuneration of directors and the achievements of service standards should be made clear. It would have been discussed with the commission and agreed with the Government as part of the licence and the strategic plan. That is an important principle when there are operations inside the reserved area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The public would have something to say if service standards were not achieved and there were no link between remuneration and service standards, because they deal with the Post Office on such a frequent basis. If there were a link and standards were not met, the public would have great cause for concern. The issue is not about salary levels or being able to set the right rate for the job, but about whether remuneration is linked to the achievement of service standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Surely the issue of service standards is simply that. Any link with what people are paid is a different issue altogether.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I do not think that that is the case, specially in a market that is not fully competitive. We suggest that the link should apply not to those outside the licensed area but to people who operate in a privileged position. In the case of the regulated postal market, the reserved area is by definition not a fully competitive market. It is fair to make the link. It is not insidious or old Labour, and it is certainly not filth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> One can envisage a situation in which service standards have been met and are constant, so they would be satisfactory in that sense. However, the efficiency of the company delivering the service might have so dramatically improved that there would appear to be a divergence between what the director had been paid and what had happened to service standards. There could legitimately be constant service standards and a rising director's salary, because the company was efficient. Under the new clause, that would not be permitted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman hits an important point. It would be possible for the Post Office—the only licence holders after the legislation comes into force—to raise efficiency by sacrificing service standards. Delivery staff walk round the streets twice a day, but it would be much more efficient for them to do so once a day. The public would probably get a later and worse service than the two-delivery system that they know and love. It is important that consumers in sub-competitive markets recognise that they have less choice than consumers in competitive markets. The provision will ensure that companies that do not face full competition do not realise efficiency savings at the expense of customer service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Colman </B>(Putney): I am afraid that I was engaged in Westminster Hall until recently and so missed the beginning of the debate. I do not oppose the new clause. I support it, as it would help to ensure that the Post Office operates on a commercial basis while remaining in public control. It is important that remuneration is available for directors and senior management, but that that remuneration package relates to the standards of performance. As my hon. Friend the Minister has said, the problems in my constituency continue and have spread to SW18.
<P>
Wandsworth borough council is having a meeting tomorrow night of which my and the Minister's attention will again be drawn to continuing concerns about the failure to meet standards of performance. Housing benefit letters are not being returned but are being redirected so the anti-fraud procedures that the council has in place are not being carried through. On inquiry, a large batch of Wandsworth benefits mail was discovered in Hemel Hempstead after apparently being lost within the Post Office sorting system. This is beyond a joke. Standards of performance in the Putney area of Wandsworth would lead me to ensure that the directors of the Post Office were not paid a bean; their wives and children might object, although perhaps the working families tax credit would kick in.
<P>
We have a particular problem with the Greater London authority assembly elections coming up. In view of the poor standards of performance in the Wandsworth area, the council has offered to bid for the delivery of this mail. It is typical of Wandsworth council that its ``ardour'' for moving into privatisation knows no end. I have to say that the performance on the ground leaves a great deal to be desired, especially in comparison with neighbouring Labour boroughs.
<P>
The paper that will be considered by the council's policy and resources committee tomorrow evening, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To the best of our Knowledge there is no Post Office postal services customer charter—something that almost all major service sector organisations consider to be essential in this day and age.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The improvements that the Bill will introduce—they include a charter and standards of performance—reflect on how we as a Labour Government are making sure that standards of performance are met. Under the previous Conservative Government, Ministers—
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> As the hon. Gentleman is praising the operation of the present system so much, would he care to say a few words to the constituents of Watford, who are receiving mail for the London mayoral election because the Home Office is insisting that Watford is in the London area?
<P>
<B>Mr. Colman:</B> As the Committee knows, I was the Labour parliamentary candidate for South-West Hertfordshire back in 1979 and I know that there are parts of that area that are right on the border with London. It may well be that some post has gone astray. I hope that it was not post from the Putney area of Wandsworth.
<P>
The previous leaders of Wandsworth borough council who allowed this situation to continue were the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford) and the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope). No action was taken by them during all those years when the problems of the Post Office in Putney continued—[Interruption.] No action was taken, Mr. Maxton, to ensure that standards of performance—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Even using the odd relevant word does not bring the hon. Gentleman's remarks into order in relation to the new clause. I suggest that he returns to the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colman:</B> I accept that I have stretched the rules set within the Committee, but the directors, management and unions of the Post Office rightly want commercial freedom within public control, and if the standards of performance are not met, then the remuneration of directors and senior management should suffer.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The hon. Gentleman has ingeniously woven an important constituency interest into the debate—although what he said seems to suggest that the postcode system is not working as well as it could. Perhaps it would have been helpful to put more specific addresses on the letter.
<P>
The clause remains unsatisfactory. Only a proper sense of competition will improve standards of delivery. All sorts of performance indicators to which a director's payment is linked will create difficulties and, particularly in a large organisation like the Post Office, will be somewhat unrealistic. It will not be easy to devise a formula that links it to individual statistics and measures. More important, competition—in the structure that we wish to create—should deliver better service. The Minister is doing what he has said throughout our proceedings he does not wish to do. He is introducing a straitjacket for the way in which Post Office services will be organised, delivered and improved. The rough-and-ready formula in the clause will directly link director's pay to performance. Implicit in that is the ability of the licensed body to insist on some kind of performance-related pay, which might apply to a fresh licence holder but not to the universal service provider—the first ever licence holder—in the way that the hon. Member for Putney hopes. So we would end up with a two-tier system whereby the existing universal service provider does not have such a link but a new service provider has it imposed on it. That is an inequitable state of affairs.
<P>
The new clause will also necessitate some very perverse incentives for and conduct by licence holders. Statistical straitjackets are not a good way of conducting business—one need look only at the obscene distortions that the national health service waiting lists have thrown up to know that. Just as clinical priorities are distorted in the health service, commercial priorities are likely to be distorted in the Post Office. What is worse, the new clause will also put standards at risk by forcing service providers under licence to behave in a tightly prescribed way.
<P>
So this is gesture stuff—but gesture stuff that will come at a cost. It is a political attempt to score brownie points by rehearsing the old debate about fat cats, but the legislation is not the place to do that. The new clause will not do the new licence holders a service. I see that there are bleepers galore on the Labour Benches; all Labour Members are attentively studying their bleepers, which must be throbbing with the new Labour message. The new clause will not help improve standards but will just introduce a straitjacket, which is commercially perverse and unnecessary. We should put that old argument behind us and allow licence holders the freedom to meet as they choose the standards that they are obliged to meet. We will press the new clause to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The new clause is not about the commission or anyone else insisting on the rates of pay that are paid to directors. The way in which pay is linked to performance is a matter for the company involved; indeed, at the moment, the Post Office pays its directors a performance-related element. We are talking about an organisation that serves all 24.5 million addresses six days a week; 28 million people go into post offices every week. Service standards are an important element of postal services. We are not giving the commission the power to set the levels of directors' pay but simply obliging the Post Office to publish the links between service level standards and the remuneration that directors receive. If there is no such link, there will be no disclosure under the new clause and consumers will draw their own conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Will the Minister say whether, in his interpretation of the clause, anyone would have the power to insist on performance-related pay?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> My interpretation is that no one would have the power to insist, but the absence of a link between service standards and remuneration must be transparent and it must be published.

The new clause exempts the Secretary of State and the Treasury from the administrative provisions of the Companies Act 1985 in the event that either of them is a shadow director of the Post Office company.

Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill.
<H4><center>New clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reasonable excuse: meaning</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—In sections 68 and 69 reasonable excuse includes intentionally delaying or opening a postal packet in the course of its transmission by post—
<P>
(a) pursuant to a request from any constable or the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, or
<P>
(b) if a person reasonably suspects that the postal packet contains goods which may be illegal.'.—{Mr. Page.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause refers to our old friend ``reasonable''. I am devastated that my Liberal Democrat colleague, the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter), has deserted his post. I had hoped that he would weigh in with a forceful argument about the importance of the word ``reasonable''—[Interruption.] I looked around with hope in my heart, but I saw only the hon. Member for Putney.
<P>
Clauses 68 and 69 do not provide a clear definition of what might constitute a breach of duty and, thus, an offence on the part of any person engaged in the business of a postal operator if,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>without reasonable excuse, he intentionally delays or opens a postal packet in the course of its transmission.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Similarly, a person other than a postal operator who, without reasonable excuse, intentionally delays or opens a postal packet in the course of its transmission will also be guilty of an offence.
<P>
A person opening a postal packet that is incorrectly delivered to him with the intention of acting to another's detriment and without reasonable excuse is also guilty of an offence under clause 69. One can see that the purpose of the new clause is to try to draw out the Minister on how he intends those clauses to operate.
<P>
According to the explanatory notes, the intention of clauses 68 and 69 is to amalgamate
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the content of offences previously included in the Post Office Act 1953.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Sections 58 and 68 of that Act made it an offence punishable by a fine and imprisonment for employees of the Post Office wilfully to delay or omit to deliver packets and messages, and for any person to solicit or endeavour to procure another person to commit such an offence.
<P>
The problem with the clauses is that they offer no guidance as to what constitutes a reasonable excuse. It is possible, if not probable, that the definition of that term will be dependent on decisions in court. No doubt barristers and solicitors will welcome the opportunity of future employment, but I always like to think that we should do what we can to make legislation as clear as possible and not have to run to the courts to arbitrate and adjudicate every time.
<P>
Would the wording of the two clauses permit trade unions in pursuit of industrial or political objectives to attempt to delay the transmission of postal packets? The Minister will remember from his previous incarnation that, in the mid-1970s, the Union of Post Office Workers attempted to stop the handling of mail to South Africa because it disapproved of the then South African Government's politics.
<P>
Would such a reason constitute a reasonable excuse? I shall listen with interest to whether the Minister endorses or condemns such actions. That may create some awkwardness for him, given his involvement with the Union of Communication Workers, but he has long since moved on and waved it goodbye, viewing it as a step up the ladder to becoming Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>
The advantage of our new clause is that it would make requests from the police and Customs and Excise for delays to the transmission of postal packets or for their opening a sufficient defence for the offences listed in clauses 68 and 69. The new clause would also offer a complete defence when postal packets contained goods that were in defiance of the law. I am not sure how I shall bring the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare up to speed to enable him to talk in favour of the reasonable new clause. No doubt, he will make his own judgment in the fullness of time. If the new clause is passed, postal operators will enjoy a greater degree of certainty about what they may do than if clauses 68 and 69 were left without further interpretation. The Minister and his department might be clear about what is intended, but the industry and its representatives are not. I am fully willing to accept that the drafting of the new clause is not perfect, but, if he asks me to withdraw the clause, I hope that the Minister is prepared to table an amendment to clarify the situation and put to rest some of the concerns of those in the industry.

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I shall do precisely as the hon. Gentleman asks, and I thank Opposition Members for their work in drafting the clause. At the moment, the legislation contains only an offence of wilful delay of mail, and there is no express provision that allows custom officers, for instance, to open mail. The phrase ``wilful delay'' goes back to the time of Queen Anne. In the past, it was often suggested that a postman who arrived 10 minutes late for work could be said to have wilfully delayed the mail. No reasonable excuse provision existed, and the legislation was simple and all-embracing. If people wilfully delayed the mail, they would be subjected to cruel and unusual punishments.
<H4><center>[MR. JOHN RANDALL in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
Provision for a reasonable excuse was included to ensure that Customs officers could make use of it, and so that the clause would not be used as a sledgehammer to crack the nut of internal Post Office discipline procedures. By proposing the new clause, the hon. Gentleman has led us to consider whether we are sure that we need not go a step further. Our main problem, which he could have predicted, is that paragraph (b) is too all-embracing and too open-ended. However, if the hon. Gentleman withdraws the new clause, we will undertake to consider the issue carefully, with a view to making amendments on Report. If we feel that ``reasonable excuse'' is enough to cover Customs officers and others, as it is intended to do, we will give a good explanation for that. If we think that we need to go a step further, we will do that on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Are not the Opposition left rather weak now, Mr. Randall? There is no greater joy in heaven than the joy over a sinner who repenteth, so I welcome what the Minister said. I fully accept that our new clause was not perfectly drafted, and I look forward to seeing it honed to even greater brilliance on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> What a pleasure it has been to take my first Bill through Committee. I got off to an auspicious start: I made three horrendous errors in my first two sentences. When I was a parliamentary private secretary on two Finance Bill Committees, I listened to hon. Members on both Front Benches make eloquent speeches on the sittings motion, so I decided that I would show off my profound knowledge of Labour history. Of course, Mr. Maxton, I wanted to ensure that your status as the son of John Maxton was properly recorded. However, it was not your father, but your uncle, and his name was not John, but Jimmy. Then, in my second sentence, I called you ``Laxton'', instead of Maxton. No Minister can have been destroyed so comprehensively in his first couple of minutes.
<P>
We have also all enjoyed serving under Mr. Butterfill, Mr. Hood and Mr. Randall, who have expertly chaired the Committee. After the past few weeks, we will never forget words such as ``alocytes'' and ``scragging''. In addition, we will never want to go anywhere near areas such as London SW15—Putney.
<P>
This has been a congested Committee, but we have done our job of scrutinising the Bill well—and we have done it in the correct way. Good humour has been evident throughout. There has sometimes been a bit of bad humour on the Government side, but that had nothing to do with our debates and everything to do with my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley making rude comments in my left ear.
<P>
We have appreciated—and I have personally appreciated—the constructive way in which everyone on the Committee has approached the task. Although I am pleased that we have finished in time to hear your uncle's biographer make his Budget speech this afternoon, I will miss the Committee and reflect with great nostalgia on its proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am pleased to be able to commend the Minister on his sense of history I hope that on Report I will be able to commend him on his sense of geography. We have had a very constructive Committee, which has actually done what Committees should—it has scrutinised the legislation line by line. It is fair to say that we have had some constructive debates, and we have made slight changes to the Bill. I am grateful to the Minister for listening to our arguments, although we would have liked the Bill overall to have gone further. Nonetheless, we give it a qualified welcome and hope that it will lead to the competition and improvement in services that we would like to see.
<P>
The Committee will not have observed the one slip-up that I made outside the Committee Room, which fortunately I did not make in here. During an interview on share swaps I kept talking about swear shops—I hope that that has been edited out.
<P>
I thank you, Mr. Maxton, for the manner in which you have overseen our proceedings; please convey the same thanks to Mr. Butterfill. Your back-up team of Mr. Hood and Mr. Randall have also done supremely good work. No doubt we will debate the Bill further on Report, and it will be considered in another place. We now look forward to seeing what the Chancellor will offer us this afternoon.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I, too, should like to say what an enjoyable Committee it has been, in the main. One of my most difficult moments came when there was a change of Chairman. I had been studying my notes; I suddenly looked up and there was a spectre in front of me.
<P>
I am pleased to have been associated with some reasonable and relevant amendments. I am sorry, Mr. Maxton, that I was a bit pre-occupied today—my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) has been otherwise occupied, and I missed part of the debate on one reasonable amendment. No doubt we will have a chance to discuss it on the Floor of the House.
<P>
A key issue that has arisen during our proceedings is the difficulty of seeing the hon. Members who are sitting opposite when we are looking into the sunlight. As the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said, sometimes it is possible only to see their ears; whether that is a bad or a good thing depends on the hon. Member. Perhaps we could have sunglasses in future so that we on this side of the Room can see the hon. Members sitting opposite in their full glory.
<P>
After that digression, I should say to the Minister that I have appreciated his good humour and the way in which he has responded to our points—except for the time when he called me mischievous. I am sure that he regrets that comment, as I am never mischievous; I just probe the Government occasionally. I congratulate him on the way in which he has conducted his first Bill.
<P>
I thank you, Mr. Maxton, the other Chairmen, and the House officials.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank hon. Members for the remarks that they have made about myself and my fellow Chairmen—including Mr. Randall, to whom I owe an apology for my absence. However, it is the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire whom he has to blame, as I had assumed that the hon. Gentleman would keep the debate going until I returned.
<P>
On the behalf of hon. Members, I thank all the staff, the Hansard writers, the Doorkeepers and the police who man the Committee. My particular thanks go to the Clerk, who is the person who—nearly always—keeps the Chairman in order. The Committee has been good-humoured and I have enjoyed chairing it. At times it has been so amusing that even the Clerk has laughed. I must say to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that if he was so perturbed by the ears of the hon. Member for Chorley, he could have asked for the blinds to be pulled down.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
