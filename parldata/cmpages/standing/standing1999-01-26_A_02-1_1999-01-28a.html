</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. First, may I welcome you to the Chair. I know that the Committee will expect you to keep to the same tough but fair line as Mr. Winterton kept.
<P>
My point of order relates to the announcement that was made in the Chamber an hour or two ago. The Leader of the House announced that the House would probably rise between 16 and 22 February. I am not sure whether those dates are inclusive or exclusive, but either way, we are going to lose Committee time. We shall certainly lose a Thursday sitting, and we may even 
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> We are losing time at the moment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the right hon. Gentleman make his point of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> If the Committee is to lose sitting time between now and the date agreed for the end of its proceedings 30 March should we not review the Committee's sitting pattern to ensure that there is not a further reduction in the time available to scrutinise the Bill?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Of course I am not in a position to respond to that point of order. However, it is a point that the Committee will want clarified, and I will ensure that the Clerks do that at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): Further to that point of order, Mr. Stevenson. It would also be helpful if the Government's business managers could tell us what they propose to do on 9 March, the date announced for the Budget. Will we sit while the Budget speech is being delivered?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I will try to delve into the minds of the Government's business managers in an attempt to obtain an answer to the right hon. Gentleman's request.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Filling a vacancy in an Assembly constituency</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 7, line 13, leave out "six" and insert "three".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 13, in Clause 16, page 9, line 36, leave out "six" and insert "three".
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The amendment highlights our concern about the provisions in respect of members resigning or leaving the authority for one reason or another and creating a vacancy for six months. We understand that this clause is modelled on the standard provision that one would find in most local authorities if a member leaves and creates a vacancy.
<P>
One of the most crucial times of the year for the Greater London authority will be in the period from Christmas to February, when the authority is deliberating on its budgets. The mayor will be making his or her proposals to the assembly and the assembly will be involved in moving amendments to the budget. An important process will be going on.
<P>
When the GLA is engaged in that process, a particular constituency, such as Croydon and Sutton, could go unrepresented. It is important that constituents are represented and have their views properly reflected in the assembly while it is scrutinising and checking the mayor's budget proposals. We therefore believe that a period of three months rather than six months is more appropriate when vacancies are to be filled in a new and unique institution. We hope that the Government might be willing to consider that point.
<P>
If three months is, for administrative reasons, inappropriate, perhaps another limit could be found. We feel that to deny local residents the benefit of a representative advocating on their behalf in the assembly and taking their views into account when the budget is being checked would be a shame, to say the least. We hope to receive a positive response from the Government.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey):</B> I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Stevenson. I hope that the afternoon will be interesting.
<P>
I sympathise with the objective of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to ensure that the people of London are properly represented by the people whom they have elected to the important offices of mayor or constituency member. However, I cannot support the effect that his proposal would have. If the hon. Gentleman thinks seriously about the matter I am not suggesting that he has not, but perhaps he would like to think about it a little more he will find that the proposal is impracticable. In certain, admittedly unusual, circumstances the provision could result in a mayoral by-election or a constituency member by-election, or possibly both, taking place only weeks before the next full, ordinary election is held.
<P>
That is because subsection (5) in line with the provisions for the rest of local government provides for a by-election to take place
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"no later than 35 days"
<P>
after the date on which a vacancy is declared. In practice, because of the complex administrative arrangements that will need to be put in place particularly in the case of the London-wide mayoral election it will usually be necessary to use all of those 35 days to organise and hold the elections.
<P>
Let us take 1999 as a hypothetical example and assume that the first Thursday in May 6 May is the next ordinary election date, and that the mayor dies or[Kate Hoey]
resigns in the final week of the fourth month before the next ordinary election for example, on 31 January. Under the amendment, a by-election would have to be held not later than Friday 19 March. That would leave the new mayor in office for only six and a half weeks, or 38 working days, before having to represent himself at the full election.
<P>
The cost implications of holding two major elections in close succession cost implications for the public and for the parties would be substantial. That has convinced us that the proposal is wrong and likely to be unfair. Although even the poorest of the major political parties might be able to afford the expense, there would certainly be a significant disadvantage for smaller independent candidates.
<P>
I recognise that deciding at what point such cut-off dates should be introduced will always be arbitrary and cannot be a scientific act, and that it is therefore never easy to guarantee that the correct date has been chosen. However, I believe that the six months that we have included in the Bill strikes the correct balance between the need to ensure that Londoners and their interests are properly and effectively represented, and the need to avoid unnecessary, uneconomical and impracticable arrangements.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the budget, which is an important part of any local authority or Government cycle. However, under his proposal, the elections would be going on anyway and the member would not take his place in the assembly until after the budget procedures were completed. Although we do not want anyone to be unrepresented at any time, such things happen; they are a fact of life, and six months is a fair amount of time. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have listened to the Minister's arguments, and her concern over administrative difficulties is reasonable. We wished to test the Government's intentions by moving the amendment, and we hope that they will continue to consider a change from six months, although a decision will not necessarily be made today. In view of the Minister's comments, we shall reconsider the amendment and perhaps return to the subject at a later date. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

New clause 8 London member vacancy: individual candidates 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1) This section applies where a vacancy arises in the office of a London member who was returned as an individual member.
<P>
(2) Where there is only one vacancy to which this section applies, the vacancy shall remain unfilled until the next ordinary election.
<P>
(3) Subject to subsection (5) below, if there should be two or more vacancies to which this section applies, the Greater London returning officer shall arrange a poll of all electors in Greater London, and the candidates obtaining the highest number of votes shall be returned until all vacancies hve been filled.
<P>
(4) Part III of Schedule 2 shall apply to the filling of vacancies under subsection (3) above.
<P>
(5) If, within six months of the next ordinary election, vacancies arise which would, but for this subsection, cause a poll to be held, such poll shall not be held and the vacancies shall remain unfilled.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> For reasons that are not clear, two issues have been put together in this group of amendments. I will speak first to amendments Nos. 138 and 149. Amendment No. 149 would amend schedule 3, which deals with vacancies on the party list. I will then speak about the issue of vacancies on the individual list, which is dealt with by amendments Nos. 136 and 137.
<P>
Under the proposals whereby London members are elected by means of the top-up system the additional member system and under the clauses that we have already passed, a vacancy can occur. If there is a vacancy for a London member elected from the party list of a registered political party, the next person on the list will move up into that slot to fill the vacancy. That is what we hope is intended, but we believe that there is a certain amount of ambiguity in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 138 would make it clear that the list from which the candidate is drawn to fill the vacancy is the one that existed at the time of the election. Therefore if, following the elections on 4 May 2000, there were a vacancy in May 2002, it would be filled from the list that was filed in 2000. That point is not clear in the Bill, and amendment No. 138 would clear up the ambiguity.
<P>
Amendment No. 149 would stop the political parties fiddling and messing around with the list. It would stop them pushing up the list someone who they wanted to fill a vacancy. More to the point perhaps, it would stop them keeping out of a vacancy someone who was on the list, but whom they did not want to see in a position of elected office. The amendment, which would amend schedule 3, would ensure that there was no hanky-panky by the political parties.
<P>
The second category of amendments, which consists of Nos. 136 and 137, paves the way for new clause 8. The amendments relate to London members of the assembly elected as individuals. Under the Bill, if there is an individual member vacancy, it will not be filled. No one feels particularly comfortable with that, but I accept the Government's case that it would be hard to hold an election across the whole of London to fill a single vacancy on a proportional representation basis. It would, in effect, become a first-past-the-post election.
<P>
The amendments deal with what would happen if there were two vacancies among individual London members; that is a possibility, although I am not sure how likely it is. I can see that there could be one individual member vacancy on the list, but one could also conceive of circumstances in which there could be two vacancies.
<P>
Two vacancies would amount to 8 per cent. of the voting power of the assembly, and we believe that those vacancies should be filled. The amendments would provide for an election to take place to fill the vacancies on the list and to give the individual members the chance to be replaced. I hope that the Minister will consider those two modest proposals sympathetically and favourably.

<P>

<B>The Minister for London and Construction </B>(Mr. Nick Raynsford): I, too, welcome you to the chairmanship of the Committee, Mr. Stevenson. I do not know whether you know what you are letting yourself in for.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall soon find out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that you will enjoy the many occasions on which we, in turn, will enjoy your chairing our proceedings.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) has made clear, the amendments fall into two categories. I shall cover them in the same sequence that he did. I shall deal first with the procedures for filling a party list vacancy, and secondly with the procedure for filling individual and independent vacancies.
<P>
If a vacancy occurs in a seat held by a registered political party, it will be filled by someone whose name was on the list that was submitted to the Greater London returning officer for the preceding ordinary election. That is the effect of the Bill. There will normally be more than one name on that list and the highest placed candidate not elected at the previous election will be successful. That is the clear arrangement.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 138 and 149 would prevent any possibility of names being added to the list of candidates after it had been submitted to the Greater London returning officer but before the election date. Under the Bill, if a list is submitted and a candidate dies or decides to change party during the run-up to the election, there is still the flexibility for a party to make an alteration at that point. However, there is no question of the addition of names to the list after the election. The amendment would remove the sensible degree of flexibility that is necessary in the period leading up to an election, and it is not necessary to achieve the hon. Gentleman's aim.
<P>
It is true that the proposed new section 36(2B)(a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 includes a reference to the making of rules dealing with the addition of persons to lists. In practice, that will enable the rules to deal with the consequences of withdrawals by candidates at an early stage before an election.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be improper if people could be added to the list between ordinary elections. We intend to make that point absolutely clear in the regulations. That has always been our intention, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that the regulations will make that crystal clear. There can be no question of any name being added to a list after an election. The amendments would remove necessary and sensible flexibility in the period leading up to an election, so we do not believe that it would be appropriate to incorporate them in the Bill.
<P>
New clause 8 deals with individual list vacancies. It would provide that, where there are two or more vacancies in seats previously held by independent London members, a London-wide poll should be held to fill them. That is unnecessary and could result in considerable expenditure on a full London-wide election. The likelihood of such an occurrence is so remote that it is not appropriate to include the new clause in the Bill.
<P>
Currently, the House contains 659 Members, of whom one, the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell), is an independent. The assembly will contain just 25 members. It is highly unlikely that two or more independent list members not constituency members out of only 11 will resign, die or cease to be eligible during the same four-year period. The hon. Gentleman is proposing procedures for an extremely improbable set of circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): If someone, having been elected as a Conservative, became an independent Conservative, or, similarly, a Labour member became an independent Labour member, would he count as an independent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No, because, as the hon. Gentleman will recall from our debate on Tuesday, we do not propose that the changing of parties after an election would result in disqualification from office. That is what his amendment was supposed to achieve, but that is not appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I know the position that the Government have set out, but the debate has moved on one step. If someone ceases to be a Conservative member, the Government rules allow him to stay on as an independent Conservative, but he can then resign. If there were two such members, as there were last week in the European Parliament, would that come within the definition of independence under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I accept that the hon. Gentleman is influenced by the curious activities in the Conservative party, but what is happening at present is somewhat abnormal. In normal circumstances, I do not envisage a situation in which members both change party and resign during a parliamentary term. I accept that various Members of this House have passed from party to party to party [Hon. Members: "And back."] but such a process usually takes years, and the prospect of its being compressed into a four-year period and affecting more than one member is implausible, so the amendment is inappropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): Is it not more likely that two vacancies could arise on the party list?[Mr. Andrew Dismore]
Let us suppose, for example, that two members were found guilty of gerrymandering and fined &#163;27 million as happened to Dame Shirley Porter and David Weeks of Westminster City council or, under the revised arrangements, faced imprisonment. Given the current strange happenings in the Conservative party, such a situation could arise. Such people might be thrown out of the Conservative party although Dame Shirley Porter and David Weeks have yet to receive a condemnation from the Conservative party for their activities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would be grateful for short interventions rather than long speeches. Perambulations around political parties may be interesting, but I ask hon. Members to return to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. My hon. Friend has made an apposite point. We have provision for the replacement of candidates from a party list and, as we debated on Tuesday, there will be scope for 25 members on the party list. It is not likely, even in the Conservative party, that such a large number of people will disappear, change party or resign during a four-year period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): Is my hon. Friend aware that, for many years in some parts of the country, the Conservative party has put forward candidates not as Conservatives but as independents? Does the amendment have a hidden agenda, because the Conservatives do not consider that they can win elections in London, so they intend to run candidates as independents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I saw in the local press recently, admittedly not in London, that the Conservative party was advertising for candidates in the forthcoming local election, such was its difficulty in securing them. The advertisement contained the interesting comment that the candidates need not be members of the party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for drawing to our attention the fact, of which I was not previously aware, that the Conservative party was advertising for candidates. Is he conscious that an alternative interpretation of the advertisement can be envisaged, whereby the Conservative party was so anxious to ensure that its representation on the local authority was of the highest quality, that it wished to enlarge the pool from which it could draw its candidates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have to admire the right hon. Gentleman for the characteristic ingenuity with which he has responded to the tone of the debate. But such action on the part of the Conservative party is more likely to be the politics of desperation than a search for quality of representation. Lest I incur your wrath, Mr. Stevenson, by continuing down such byways, I shall return rapidly to the amendment.
<P>
The assembly would continue to function even if an individual member, or, in an extreme case, two individual members, were no longer eligible, yet were not to be replaced because they were individual list members and there was no individual replacement. We have created an assembly that will require an absolute minimum of 14 members to operate and fulfil all the necessary functions, and they are filled by the constituency members. So, even in the most unlikely situation that there are no list members, the assembly would still function.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South has acknowledged that the cost of organising London-wide elections, in which every voter in London is asked to cast a vote for one or two members of the assembly for a relatively short period it is very unlikely to be the whole four-year period is a good reason not to agree to the amendment, so I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it. If he does not do so, I will urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): My hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South and for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) have done the Committee a service, inasmuch as they have yet again shown the serious failings and deficiencies of the additional member system of representation.
<P>
Her Majesty's Government have done their very best, by what was agreed on the Floor of the House, to limit the possibility to the barest minimum of either an extremely minority party or an individual securing election to the assembly as a London member, in that we were told that the normal threshold of eligibility will be 3.8 per cent. or thereabouts. Even with that threshold, there is a possibility that a personality might be so outstanding, so dramatic and so attractive to Londoners, that he or she might notwithstanding all the difficulties be returned on the list. If he or she died, or if some other circumstance caused a vacancy, there is no possibility of filling that vacancy under AMS.
<P>
I know of no system in our history whereby an elected representative who ceases to hold office and thereby causes a vacancy does not initiate a by-election so that the vacancy is filled. That has always been the normal procedure in our country, and I do not see why Londoners should be done out of a representative simply because Her Majesty's Government have chosen such a daft and undemocratic system of election. Surely, it is up to this Committee to devise an alternative whereby the vacancy may reasonably be filled.
<P>
The Minister for London and Construction said that it would be unreasonable for Londoners as a whole to face a by-election if there were an individual vacancy, and I am not clear how such a by-election could be effective given the tiny majority vote. My hon. Friends postulated an arithmetically and, I think, electorally more sensible circumstance, although I am not so sure whether it could be conceived of in reality. However, from the point of view of the argument, they made the valuable hypothesis in new clause 8 that two vacancies would cause a London-wide by-election. However, could not the political party or a like-minded individual find a representative to stand and fill that vacancy? If the assembly were to agree that the substitute so chosen should fill the individual vacancy, or the minority party vacancy if there were no other candidate on that minority party's list, would not that be a sensible way forward?
<P>
As things stand, the Government are happy to see translated into law a provision whereby, perhaps because of death or accident, a London member vacancy might remain unfilled throughout the mandated period of the assembly. That is undemocratic; it is detrimental to Londoners and again shows the deficiencies of the additional member system.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone </B>(Brent, East): I join other members on the Committee in looking forward to serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
The hypothetical situation proposed by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) is almost self-defeating. So charismatic, brilliant and outstanding an individual the Prime Minister's sister-in-law makes some valuable points on the issue in today's Evening Standard could not, by definition, be replaced. It is likely that the strong network of community groups and neighbourhood associations in London will decide to put forward independent candidates but they will have read the legislation and listened to our debates, as a result of which they might well take the commonsense approach of forming a coalition. In that way, genuinely independent, non-party political London groups could come together and perhaps easily win two seats from the list. However, they would not be so stupid as to field only two candidates; they would also draw up a list. The very fact that we are having this debate will probably prevent the problem about which Conservative Members are concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): The hon. Gentleman makes a valuable point. He is saying that there would be little merit in individuals standing because if they were to lose their seat, through death or resignation, there would be no one to replace them. Independent candidates are therefore actively discouraged from standing. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that independents should group together because independents standing alone would be at a disadvantage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> If the independents could not work together to assemble a list, they probably could not mobilise the resources to put together the campaign to get there. By forming a group, they could preserve their independence and be represented.
<P>
I do not anticipate the issue being the problem that Conservative Members imagine. The debate will spur some serious thinking among independent, non-party political Londoners about putting together an independent list of Londoners. They would therefore have the requisite list of 11 or so members, which would enable them to work their way through vacancies in the same way as the established political parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The thrust of the Minister's argument is that the amendment covers an unlikely eventuality and is therefore unnecessary to which the counter argument is that if it is not likely, he has little to worry about. No explanation about that has been forthcoming from him.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) was the leader of the Labour group on Westminster city council and was regularly soundly beaten [Laughter.] at the ballot box.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As everyone knows, following our procedures is difficult, and I too am relatively inexperienced in my role, but I ask members of the Committee to help me by not digressing into discussions of electoral processes or Westminster city council. We are debating vacancies and how they are filled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson, but I think that it is valid to consider the circumstances in which vacancies are likely to arise. An example of such circumstances is the event that took place 12 years ago on Westminster council a council that has subsequently been re-elected on no fewer than three occasions, and none of the parties involved are now sitting on it.
<P>
As someone who is in the habit of picking up stories of councillors' poor behaviour, I flicked through my dossier this morning to find no fewer than 114 examples of Labour councils the length and breadth of the country under investigation for inefficiency, maladministration or, in some cases, downright criminal corruption. Such examples could lead to the resignation of councillors. In the event of 8 per cent. of the assembly being vacant, it would not be acceptable to have no procedure for replacing that 8 per cent. of assembly members. Eight per cent. of this House is roughly 50 Members. In the event of the absence of 50 Members, it would be quite monstrous if we had no intention of replacing them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I share and support my hon. Friend's righteous indignation. The role of independents and minority parties in the assembly might well be crucial. Traditionally, voting in London has been evenly balanced, and representation and control might well hinge on single votes. For Londoners to be denied the possibility of filling a vacancy in such circumstances is, as he says, quite monstrous. Londoners will merely think that the assembly will have a fundamental democratic deficit that Her Majesty's Government did nothing to rectify when they drafted the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) asked what will happen if several sitting members resign the whip and sit as independent members. I do not think that he received a sensible answer; I am still not clear about what will happen.
<P>
If 50 Members of the House were to be absent, that would, roughly speaking, exceed the majority of all the post-war Governments in this House. To say that it is simply too expensive. [Interruption.] It may be expensive, but democracy is an expensive form of government, and must be paid for. Although I accept the Minister's sensible explanations for opposing amendments Nos. 138 and 149 and his reassurances that[Mr. Ottaway]
I need not worry, I should like to divide the Committee on amendments Nos. 136 and 137.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Having listened to the debate, we believe that changes to the culture of politics in London will follow once we have an assembly elected using AMS. The hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) may be right: groups may decide to co-operate to produce slates of candidates for the lists, which could lead to different outcomes. The amendments do not directly address that, but hon. Members have raised fair points that Ministers must consider further. If a single or, indeed, two elected independents resign and a by-election does not take place, the assembly will have vacancies. Ministers must give that serious consideration. Part of the proposal is designed to ensure that the assembly is as representative as possible of Londoners' views, so if it loses representation through vacancies, the less credible it will be in checking and holding the mayor to account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In the interests of agreement in the Committee, I shall try to clarify matters and bring light to shine where darkness is all that is evident.
<P>
We are creating a new framework comprising a small assembly of 25 members, 14 of whom will be directly elected by their constituents and may include some independents. There is no reason why an independent should not stand and win a constituency. However, they are all elected directly by the constituents, and if they resign, an election in the constituency will follow. A further 11 top-up places will ensure broad proportionality in line with the votes cast across London as a whole. In general, we expect those to come from party lists, but, in the interests of fairness, provision has been made for independents who want to stand on the party list to do so. It is conceivable that an individual might be so charismatic and well known throughout London that he or she might succeed in securing a place via the party list. The likelihood of more than one such individual doing so is extremely remote. At present, the House has one independent Member, and it has had only one in the past 25 years. The idea of more than one independent list member, with only 11 places, stretches credulity.
<P>
When party list members resign, die or cease to be eligible, they will be replaced by other people from their party list. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey suggested that a number of party members could resign the whip. The party in question would be able to continue to replace those members from its list, because the Bill will allow it to put as many as 25 names on the list. There are only 11 list members, so for the list even to begin to look exhausted would require the resignation of two separate loads of 11 even if the party were to have that number on the list. That outcome is so fantastic as to be almost impossible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I accept that the scenario of the meteorite, which was mentioned on Tuesday, may be highly unlikely, as is the possibility of the plane full of list candidates being killed by crashing into the meteorite 
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Or by the black death.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Does the Minister agree that hon. Members' scrutiny should ensure that we do not simply legislate for what we expect? Should not the Bill provide for things that, although the Minister does not believe they will happen, are legitimate concerns that ought to be dealt with? That is the point of the amendments; why will the Minister not accept them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We are legislating for all reasonable eventualities. We are not legislating for the possibility of Martians landing on the millennium dome.
<P>
When an independent constituency member resigns, his or her post will be up for election. When a list member resigns, the provisions allow for his or her position to be filled by another person from the list. An unfilled vacancy can arise only when an independent list member resigns and there is no other person on that list. The Opposition amendment does not provide for an election to occur in such circumstances. They accept that it would be unreasonable, in the words of the hon. Member for Croydon, South, to hold an election for just one position.
<P>
For an election to occur, a second such vacancy would have to arise, which is entirely incredible. It is not appropriate to amend the Bill to take account of such far-fetched circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We must avoid the fantastical. As my hon. Friends have said, however, we have to think about the unlikely. The House may not have had many independents, but it has a first-past-the-post system. The Bill provides for a different system. As the hon. Member for Brent, East said, independent candidates are much more likely to stand under such a system, even if there is a small number of seats. As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) said, the balance of power in London is very even. The Labour party received less than 50 per cent. of the London vote at the election. One regular absence from the assembly could probably determine the balance of power. Such a vacancy, perpetuated by Government legislation, could predetermine the outcome and distort what Londoners vote for.

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but the amendment would not remedy the problem. It does not provide for an election to occur when a single vacancy arises. The hon. Member for Croydon, South rightly recognised that it would not be appropriate or cost-effective to hold an election to fill a single vacancy.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary, and I urge the Committee to vote against it if the hon. Gentleman presses it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I failed to welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Stevenson, when I raised my original point of order, because I knew that at that stage you wanted to get on to the main business but I welcome you now.
<P>
My remarks will be brief. On the theme of the risk of meteorites and suchlike, members of the Committee may recall the maiden flight of one of the Comet aircraft. The Government Chief Whip approached the then Prime Minister and asked if it would be in order for 60 Conservative Members of Parliament to travel on the flight. Sir Winston Church replied:

I have no intention of rehearsing all the circumstances of the 1949 London county council election. I could talk in code to the Minister, who would know exactly what I was talking about. If I refer to it often enough I may, by popular demand, have to reveal what happened. [Hon. Members: "Yes".] If I did so, you would rule me out of order, Mr. Stevenson. There was one decisive result in that election, which went in favour of a Liberal. In 1949 a Liberal was as rare as an independent is today, and he was therefore a critical figure. The Minister will know of the manner in which the Labour party in the LCC circumnavigated the one Liberal member who was prepared to vote with the Conservatives. I must say, without rancour, that that was to the shame of the then Labour representation in the LCC. It would be a happier situation if the Bill ensured that nobody had to be in that position again, and prevented the wrong result from occurring because the provision had not been made in advance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I should like to point out to the Minister that, in view of the Committee's discussions about falling meteorites, Labour Members should also be well aware of rising stars.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> We have had a useful debate on the amendments and the Committee has reached its decision. Nevertheless, two important issues remain from clause 11. I hope that Her Majesty's Government will consider them further and that they will, on reflection, contemplate tabling an appropriate amendment on Report or in the other place.
<P>
The first issue relates to the fact that parties exercise increasing control that is certainly the case with the new Labour party. It might be difficult for talented candidates to be selected as official candidates and to stand as constituency representatives or even to get sufficiently high up the party list to secure return as an assembly member on a London-wide basis. The individual concerned could, however, be a person of independent mind and character who gets much air time and has much merit, and he or she could be returned. We have seen what would happen if he or she caused a vacancy as a result of their death, resignation or disqualification. I urge Her Majesty's Government to think again and not to dismiss lightly the possibility of independents doing well on the list.
<P>
There is another aspect of the over-mighty power of the party machine. Under subsection (5), a person cannot fill a vacancy as a list member for a London-wide seat if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he is not a member of the party".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All too frequently these days, new Labour and perhaps other parties, too, although I hope not ours arrogates to itself powers to dismiss people from the party peremptorily. An individual might secure a high placing in the election, although it might not be quite high enough to win him or her a place outright. If a vacancy occurs, however, he or she might move up the list and become eligible to fill it. Yet, as I understand it this is the tenor of starred amendment No. 250, which you understandably did not call, Mr. Stevenson, because I tabled it late last night the person concerned could be unable to fill the vacancy even though he or she had done well at the election. He or she might be ineligible by virtue of having fallen out with the party or being ideologically incompatible with the way that it was going. He or she might, however, be highly agreeable to the objectives that Londoners had espoused when giving a particular party a high rating in the poll at the original election. I ask Her Majesty's Government to consider both the aspects that I have raised because they merit reconsideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to pick up the point that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood identified and to seek clarification of the way in which the Government think subsections (5) (a) and (b) will work in practice. The explanatory notes on the clause are rather vague; indeed, they do not really explain the workings of the clause at all.
<P>
The two subsections raise at least the possibility that the party might give notice to the proper officer that a person who had not been elected but who was first on the list to fill a vacancy was not, for whatever reason, to be selected to fill it. We would then go to the next person. That places in the hands of the party machine the possibility of reordering its list after an election, when the electorate had already decided on and approved the list through the ballot box.
<P>
I want to be clear about whether the provision is intended to be a device for party control. I am concerned about that. In our debate on Tuesday, the Minister for Transport in London gave us some important assurances. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Candidates will not present themselves as list members or as prospective members of the assembly in a way that is based exclusively on a party political affiliation". [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 26 January 1999; c.24.]
[Mr. Burstow]
<P>
Yet subsection (5)(a) is about having to be a member of a political party, and the political party having the right to reorder its list after the election. That is a point of serious concern. It would be useful, given that the explanatory notes are singularly vague on this point, for the Minister to clasify the intention of this part of the clause. Is is intended as a way of downgrading a party member who does not come up to scratch in the party, for whatever reason?
<P>
Finally, if someone has been passed over once in this procedure, can he or she still be put up for a vacancy later? Or once someone has been notified to the proper officer as not being qualified to fill a vacancy, can he or she be put back later? Perhaps that point could be clarified, as I am not sure whether it is specified in the Bill.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We are now dealing with some extremely arcane circumstances. However, I shall not refer to meteorites. Instead, I shall try and ensure that the power of logic convinces even the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The procedures for the refilling of vacancies are as follows: first, in the event of constituency members resigning, there is an election to fill the constituency place. Secondly, there are circumstances in which a list member resigns from the assembly or is ineligible to remain a member. We are not talking about someone who is simply denied the party whip; we made it clear on Tuesday that, in line with the tradition of this place and other institutions, someone who is elected by the people continues to serve that term until the next election. He or she cannot be removed simply because their political party chooses to withdraw the whip. When someone resigns from the assembly or is ineligible to remain a member, the list vacancy falls to be filled by someone from the party list in the order set out at the previous election. We believe it reasonable that if someone who was on that list at the previous election has subsequently left the party, the party should not have to nominate that person to fill the vacancy.
<P>
That is the point for which subsection (5) caters. It does not make provision for the party to amend the pecking order, to change the order on the list or to add names a point I made in an earlier debate. It simply copes with circumstances in which someone has resigned form the party after the election in which his or her name was on that party^s list. The party is not required to put that person^s name forward for a vacancy on the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister^s argument seems exactly the opposite of the one put forward on Tuesday. The Government seem to want it both ways on the clause. If it is unreasonable for the list members who are on the list, potentially becoming people who can fill vacancies, to change party, why is it unreasonable, once someone has been elected as a list member on a party list, to remain as a member of the assembly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, the Government do not want it both ways. We simply want those who are elected by the electorate to serve all the electorate for the duration of that period in office. In filling vacancies, according to votes cast for a party, it is right and proper that that party should be able to exclude someone who has ceased to be a member of the party in the intervening period. I am surprised that the logic of that fails to get through to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow).

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Perhaps the Minister is not so surprised about me he regards me as more irrational and emotional. He appears not to have grasped the point raised by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, yet it is extremely serious.
<P>
When the electorate cast their votes, they have no idea who on the list will be returned. They regard as potential members of the assembly all those who have been adopted as potential members of the assembly all those who have been adopted by their party to stand as list candidates. They remain potential, and their potential is greater the higher up the list they are; but surely it should not be grounds for disqualification if a political party by diktat requires someone to leave the party. The validating criterion is the original vote of the electorate.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I made a plea earlier for interventions to be just that. I repeat that plea, and I am sure that hon. Members will help me by not requiring me to make it again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. In reply to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, I would say that the electorate will have a clear idea as to who is likely to represent them, because parties will publish their lists. The pecking order will be known, as it will for the forthcoming European elections. People will know well the order of priority of the party candidates and therefore who is likely to be elected depending on the proportion of votes cast for each party.
<P>
I accept that the hon. Gentleman^s party is suffering a lot of defections at the moment. For entirely understandable reasons, Mr. Stevens has just announced that he is not prepared to carry the Conservative banner in Europe any longer. If the list system already existed, would it be right and proper for the Conservative party to have to nominate him as a Conservative to fill a vacancy? That would be the effect of the hon. Gentleman^s argument. Any fair-minded person would recognise that as preposterous. If the electorate have voted for a certain proportion of seats to be given to the Conservative party and one of those becomes vacant, it is reasonable that it should be filled by a Conservative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> Purely on a point of clarification, we talked about how the whip could be taken away or party membership removed without it being a disqualification. Would it be right to say that the same principle applies in this instance and that if someone ceases to be a party member, it must be by his or her own volition, rather than by the party apparatus? If not, there is a disparity. If, however, it is purely a resignation, I would accept the Minister^s point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clause 11(5) has two parts paragraphs (a) and (b). Paragraph (a) refers to a person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is not a member of the party".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not mention the whip being withdrawn. I accept that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood had the unfortunate experience of having the whip withdrawn in the previous Parliament, although he went on to resume his position. Thus, the measure would not have applied to him. However, if someone resigned or was expelled from a party and so ceased to be a member of it, and the party made it clear that it did not want that person^s name to go forward, we believe that it is right and proper for it to have this option.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> The Minister makes a valuable point, but I should like a little more clarification. He speaks of expulsion from the party as opposed to the whip being withdrawn. The whip can be withdrawn from people who are part of an elected assembly, a council or, indeed, this place. Expulsion from a party involves members of a party. The same logic could therefore be applied: people could be expelled from a party against their will. I wonder whether we are allowing party managers whether they are acting as whips or managers of a party as a whole too much power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have tried to seek an appropriate balance, which is to ensure that individuals who get into temporary difficulty with their whips, as happens from time to time hon. Members on both sides of the House have experienced that should not be removed but should remain on the list. Let us imagine, however, that someone has either resigned from the party saying, "I do not wish to be a member of the party any longer", or has gone so far that the party has chosen to expel him. I am not familiar with the Conservative party procedures, but in my party, expulsion is an action that is taken only in extreme circumstances. It happened when we had undesirable entryists from the Militant tendency in the mid-1980s, but it does not affect more than a handful of people.
<P>
In those circumstances, it is not right and proper that someone who has been expelled from a party should be put forward automatically by that party to fill a vacancy on a list according to votes that have been cast for that party. We are not seeking to give undue power to the whips, but we are saying that if there were a procedure under the additional member system that allowed for seats to be allocated in proportion to the number of votes cast for a party, it should broadly reflect that preference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I accept the logic of the Minister^s argument in respect of subsection (5)(a), but can he take us on to subsection (5)(b)? All that is required is for the party to give notice to the proper officer that the next person on the list is not to fill the vacancy. Such a sweeping power is not defined in the clause. I want a clear explanation from the Minister of how he expects it will be exercised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I thought that I had made it clear that the two provisions are not alternatives. They both have to be satisfied. There is the word "and" between paragraphs (a) and (b). It is not a matter of only being in circumstances in which the party announces that it does not want a particular person^s name to go forward; that person must no longer be a member of that party. Both tests must be satisfied, and I hope that I have allayed the hon. Gentleman^s anxiety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I share some of the concerns that have been expressed. When people cast their vote for the lists in the second vote, all the parties will have constructed their lists with, presumably, their most attractive candidates at the top and the complete non-entities at No. 25. When people are casting their vote, many, if not all, of them will have a fairly good idea of the ranking order.
<P>
I am genuinely unhappy about the prospect of giving to the party bureaucracy the power to strip a member of his or her party membership. That person may be high on the list but, as a result of such action, cannot go forward when a vacancy arises. I shall not vote with the Opposition, but I might do so later if more thought is not given to that issue. It is a damaging precedent. When people have cast their vote, we are stuck with it. That is it. We should not reserve for ourselves the right to affect the vote that is cast by the people.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not sure whether that was an intervention, a personal statement or a speech, but I am being put in some difficulty and I have a responsibility to keep the business of the Committee going.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Two simple principles are involved. On a list, the votes are cast for members of the party. As my hon. Friend rightly says, the party will organise its list to make clear the pecking order of the candidates who stand to be elected in the event of the party receiving a certain number of votes. In the case of other parties, there may be non-entities at the bottom of the list but, in respect of the Labour party, all 25 candidates will be of supremely high standard, although some will be higher up the list than others.
<P>
We are not proposing to give a power to the party by which it can simply chop and change the order on the list, according to the preference of the whips. Although flexibility will be allowed before the election, once the list has been finally agreed, the order of the candidates will not change. We believe that if a vacancy subsequently arose and, therefore, someone had to fill the place vacated on the list, the party should not have to propose someone who had ceased to be a member of it in the intervening period.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East would agree, if he were to reflect on it, that it would have been entirely inappropriate if a list system had existed in the early 1980s for the Labour party to have been required to nominate those members who had left to join the Social Democratic party for the list vacancies that should have gone to the Labour party. I hope that he will accept that logic and recognise the need to vote for the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I have not discussed this matter with my hon. Friends, and they might not wish to shout as[Mr. Wilkinson]
loudly as I do. However, members of all three parties have expressed sufficient doubts in Committee for Her Majesty^s Government to reconsider the clause. I would not presume to speculate about what the pecking order might be in the new Labour hen house; Labour Members might understand that much better than I do.
<P>
In modern technology and Euro-speak, cronyism exists and perhaps people high up the list will be "limog\ae", as the French say that is, have their knees taken away by party apparatchiks so as to introduce a favoured candidate when a vacancy occurs. There is no way of obviating that risk under the clause. In fact, as Liberal Democrat Members have said, subsection 5(b) will allow that risk to become a reality. Therefore, I shall vote against the clause. Whether my hon. Friends do so is obviously a matter for them, but I will shout very loudly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Let us consider international experience. List systems operate in various countries in Europe and the rest of the world. In those countries such as Sweden, about which I know a little, and Denmark the runners-up in elections might not want to be elected perhaps two years later. They might have a job in another country, have a personal problem or have decided for family or personal reasons that they do not wish to stand as a substitute for someone who was elected.
<P>
I have been told that, in Sweden, people have resigned for health reasons, the substitute did not want to stand and the party has chosen someone who was willing to take the place but was not the next person on the list. Presumably, if the intention of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats was followed, people would be prevented from having that flexibility. Several years might separate elections, so it is common sense to have flexibility if we are to have a list system.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
so the flexibility is there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> People might be willing to serve at the time of an election, but circumstances might change. It is necessary for parties to have discretion and be able to make a judgment because people are not elected as individuals under a list system; they stand as candidates of the party. People who stand as candidates of the party are not elected by virtue of their individual characteristics; they stand on behalf of their political party.
<P>
<B>Mr. John McDonnell </B>(Hayes and Harlington): The anxiety that several of us have is about the party machine. Dunleavy and Margetts the academics who modelled the different systems recommended that we consider whether to include in the Bill a condition that such decisions should be taken by one member, one vote ballot on all occasions.

<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> The method by which candidates are selected is surely a matter for each political party. The state should not dictate a political party^s internal democracy. I have enough confidence in my own party to trust that it will choose candidates democratically. I cannot speak for other parties, but I want the Labour party to have the autonomy to decide how it will select candidates. I do not want to have candidates imposed by another party that is likely to want us to choose candidates who will help them, not us, win.

Motion made, and Question put, That the clause stand part of the Bill: 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The information that I seek may be set out in another part of the Bill, but the "proper officer" referred to in the clause, to whom the mayor should resign, needs clarification. Who will that officer be? If that is not specified, we may have the undesirable situation of a mayor who has decided to resign roaming the corridors of Authority hall like a Flying Dutchman, trying to find out to whom he should hand in his resignation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has conjured up another delightful image. On Tuesday he was a galley slave in Barbarossa^s galleys; this afternoon, he is sailing with Wagner on the Flying Dutchman. I hate to think where he will take us next. However, I can assure him that the provision is linked to the requirement that the authority shall nominate a proper officer. That officer may be the chief administrative officer or another, defined officer, but the GLA will have to designate a proper officer who will perform the functions, just as all local authorities determine who whether the chief executive or another officer shall conduct electoral matters. The proper officer, to whom the mayor must hand his or her resignation, must be specified.

<H4><center>Failure of Mayor to attend meetings</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:  </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 10 in page 8, line 21, leave out from "fails" to "pursuant" in line 22 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to attend any ordinary meeting of the Assembly held within three months except when the absence is unavoidable or the absence is by leave of the Assembly."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 139, in page 8, line 21, leave out "six" and insert "three".
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> You have been in the chair for some time, Mr. Stevenson, but this is the first chance that I have had to welcome you.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>  I am overwhelmed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The amendment is designed to probe the Government^s thinking in clause 13. According to the Bill as drafted, the mayor may not come to the assembly for six months, which is an awfully long time for assembly members to have to wait before they can question the mayor. Clause 13 refers to Clause 44(2), which provides that the assembly must meet at least once a month. If the assembly chooses to meet only once a month and, having been given 15 days^ notice, the mayor fails to attend assembly meetings on six consecutive occasions, the assembly will not have questioned the mayor for half a year. If he attends the next meeting, he could subsequently absent himself for another long period. A mayor elected to serve the people of London might therefore be questioned on only a small number of occasions during his period of office, which is extremely worrying.
<P>
The mayor is a powerful figure, as the Government made it clear in their Green and White Papers that they intended him to be. It is only right that the assembly should check that power by calling the mayor to account. The amendment is designed to provide protection reducing the number of meetings that the mayor must fail to attend before he is deemed to be disqualified. It clearly states that no problem would arise if the mayor had an unavoidable reason for being unable to attend a particular meeting, such as the London underground system having broken down again so that he could not arrive on time, or if the assembly gave him or her a leave of absence for other understandable reasons.
<P>
The Amendment is designed to show the Government a real danger the Government may think that it is a theoretical danger, but we feel that we should deal with such hypothetical contingencies in our proceedings and to ensure that the Government^s intentions are met. Although we shall not seek to divide the Committee on the amendment, we hope to clarify the Government^s thoughts on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I speak to amendment No. 139, which stands in my name and is similar in tone to that tabled by the Liberal Democrats. We are dealing simply with a question of credibility. For the mayor to be absent for up to six months would do absolutely nothing for the credibility, probity and accountability of the authority and of the mayor^s office.
<P>
The amendment is all the more relevant when one considers how it interacts with clause 44, which does not provide for a substitution of the deputy mayor in the mayor^s place. It is even more relevant when one remembers that, when we considered the Bill on a Committee of the whole House, we tabled an amendment that proposed that a deputy mayor speak with his own mandate. Given that that was voted down, if the authority is to function properly, the Government must consider what will happen if the mayor is absent for such a long period.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I should like to make just a few points. In my experience of local government I realise that the proposal is new and radical six months is not an inordinate length of time. The wording of the first amendment is, not unexpectedly, vapid. Who defines "unavoidable"? We have just heard the version of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), who talked about London Underground trains. We could be equally specious and talk about a Tory mayor who writes bad books and gives people he does not know &#163;2,000. He might go on a cruise liner for nine months. Who knows? Would that be considered unavoidable or unacceptable? I do not know.
<P>
In terms of legislation, if the Liberal Democrats sought parliamentary counsel^s opinion on their amendment, they should sack the parliamentary counsel. If
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the absence is by leave of the Assembly",
<P>
there is no difficultly, regardless of whether it is for three, six or nine months. Amendment No. 10 makes no sense at all, it is a complete waste of time.
<P>
The provisions in clause 13 refer not to some permanent leave of absence on the part of the mayor, but to absences within reason. We should ignore the darker recesses of the LG^s imagination judging by his socks, it is very dark indeed and perhaps he will show them to us later. Six months is entirely reasonable. The assembly, the authority^s work and the mayor^s work will not grind to a halt. The provision is included in the Bill simply to take account of possible difficulties.
<P>
Under clauses 44(3), (4) and (5), a mayor could attend any number of extraordinary meetings that we called 14 days^ notice by the chair or five members of the assembly. If Liberal Democrat amendment No. 10 is accepted this is why it is so vapid he could attend all those and still be sacked if he missed three regular monthly meetings. What possible sense is there in that? Liberal Democrats can probe away by all means, but they should withdraw this silly amendment and let us move on.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I share the misgivings of the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) about the wording of the Liberal Democrat amendment. My[Mr. Brooke]
misgivings are different from his, although I recognise their force.
<P>
The Liberal Democrat amendment refers to the mayor failing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to attend any ordinary meeting of the Assembly held within three months".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under a perfectly logical interpretation of the words "within three months", the first time that the mayor fails to attend an ordinary meeting he would have to resign. I cannot believe that that is what the Liberal Democrats intend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The amendments are revealing about the attitudes of Her Majesty^s Government towards their new creation the mayoralty and towards the mayor^s responsibility to the assembly. They are also revealing, in the words of the hon. Member for Harrow, East, because of the vapidity of the Liberal Democrat amendment. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) has exemplified that further in his comments.
<P>
Our amendment No. 139 is absolutely clear. the maximum time between the mayor^s attendances at ordinary meetings of the assembly should be three months. I am sure that most Londoners would expect him to be available to attend each monthly meeting of the assembly. They will not be interested in individuals who are off on an ego trip and who, once elected, find all sorts of reasons for fraternal visits to authorities in other capital cities. They will not be interested in business men who find reasons to attend to other business and who have commercial interests that conflict with their work. Londoners will want individuals who are totally committed to working hand in glove with the assembly to provide the best governance for London. On that basis, the mayor should be available for question time every month. If he is not, he will have to give a good reason to the assembly. If he has to be away for a period of, say, two to three months, he will do so only with the express permission of the assembly. That is how a democratic institution with a proper balance between an elected assembly and an executive the mayoralty in this case should be.
<P>
I wholeheartedly congratulate my hon. Friends on tabling a clear-cut amendment that demonstrates that our party at any rate wants the mayoralty to be fully and regularly accountable to the assembly and the people of London. That is as it should be. The Government will show a frivolous attitude towards democracy in London if they do not accept that.

<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Let us pause for a reality check. Knowing what we do about the personalities of most of the people who will put their names forward, should we not be considering an amendment to keep them away from the assembly? When I last debated with Jeffrey Archer, he demanded the right to a question time every week let alone every month. People who devote all their efforts towards being elected mayor will not have to be dragged to the assembly. A rule to exclude them would be more to the point that would give assembly members a rest from their armtwisting and browbeating. I could understand it if we were in a country without our strong tradition of democratic politics, by which people have to get elected and keep their names in the public eye. This is an enormous amount of old nonsense about nothing.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> As I do not wish to overwhelm you, Mr. Stevenson, I shall not welcome you to the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister is very kind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): But you are nevertheless welcome, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Particularly welcome.
<P>
I should like to respond in particular to the probing amendment that was tabled by the Liberal Democrats and moved by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I am somewhat bemused that the period of six months, which during a previous sitting was considered adequate before an assembly member had to be considered for any kind of punishment, has suddenly become too short a time in terms of the mayor. Attendance at the assembly^s monthly meetings is the central requirement placed upon the mayor and the holding of the meetings is, up to a point, a central requirement of the assembly. The meetings are, in the main, intended for the express purpose of examining the mayor^s actions, proposals and conduct. Attendance is, therefore, core to the relationship that is to be the creative element of the Greater London authority.
<P>
Failure to attend would represent a very serious situation for anyone who had presented themselves for selection and election as mayor. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East said, it is highly unlikely that anyone who had gone through the process of selection and election to this unique position in the history of this great city would not want to be there if not necessarily for 24 hours a day, then certainly to ensure that they are fully carrying out the requirements of the job and assuring the people who have placed their trust in the mayor that that trust has not been misplaced. I agree with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood: it would be entirely unacceptable if anyone elected to any high office were suddenly to take it into their head to disappear from the work even for an infinitely shorter period than that of three months.
<P>
We are not in a position to know what the timetabling of the meetings will be until the GLA has been formed. It is possible that the incumbent mayor could be working every single day and night of the week. The mayor will be required to be outside London, and outside the United Kingdom, as part and parcel of mayoral duties, yet must nevertheless manage to attend assembly meetings for three consecutive months. It will, of course, be possible for the mayor to delegate authority in some respects. One of the primary functions of a deputy mayor would be to attend such centrally important meetings if the mayor were to be incapable of attendance. It will be possible, furthermore, for the assembly to summon the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Lady will be entirely delighted to know that I agree with her sentiments, except in one respect. We are not only discussing the forthcoming election and mayoralty, but making legislation that will stand for a long time. The hon. Member for Brent, East made a point about high-level, high-profile candidates. That may not always be the case. The hon. Lady is right about what would be unacceptable. Why can we not put that in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am somewhat bemused, because I do not think that the hon. Gentleman actually stated what he wishes to see in the Bill. Perhaps he will help me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the point. I should like the Bill to include a provision, as proposed in the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, that the period in question should be three rather than six months. I agree with the hon. Lady that it is highly unlikely, certainly for the first mayoralty, that there would be a problem. But as I pointed out, we are making legislation for an extended period. Therefore, as the hon. Lady agrees that it would be unacceptable for someone not to attend meetings for, as she said, a significantly shorter period than six months, could that not be put in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining what he wishes to see in the Bill. But as I thought that I had evinced in some detail, in my response to the point made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, what is implicit in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South and that tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, is that only by attendance at the assembly meetings will it be proven that the mayor is working extremely hard and fulfilling the job.
<P>
Over a three-month period, as I pointed out, it is possible that the mayor might be incapable of attending those meetings because of the exigencies of timetabling, yet would be fulfilling the functions of mayor and working extremely hard, not only for Londoners but for London. It will occassionally be necessary for the mayor to be outside not only the city but these islands. A period of six months, for whatever reason, without the assembly questioning and probing the mayor on policies and actions would be long, yet would accommodate an extremely hard-working mayor. Mayors can delegate their powers, and it is possible for the assembly to summon the mayor outside a structured timetable. Six months seems to be the right period of time to ensure that no one could behave in a cavalier fashion towards either the assembly or the people of London who have returned that individual to the mayoral office.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about the passage of time. It seems to me and I am speaking entirely personally that we sometimes believe the age we inhabit to be the definitive age and the time of perfection. Everything that went before was not as good as it is now, and the time that is coming will probably not be as marvellous as we have managed to make ours. I do not share the hon. Gentleman^s cynicism that those people who will be presenting themselves for public office as the decades roll on will take any less seriously that commitment to public service that we expect of everyone in our day and age.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) clearly understood the intention behind the amendments. The legislation establishes a new constitutional government of London. We are creating a new executive and legislature. It is important that the assembly can hold the new executive to account. The Minister^s response to the hon. Gentleman showed that she had missed that point. She talked about how London would know that the mayor was working hard because he or she would be so busy doing lots of things. The amendment is not about the work load or performance of the mayor; it is about holding the mayor to account and ensuring that he or she is answerable to the assembly.
<P>
I was surprised by the contribution of the hon. Member for Brent, East. In many other arenas he has talked about the need to hold executives to account. The amendment would include in a Bill that is certainly constitutional a safeguard to ensure that the assembly can hold the mayor to account.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain how the mayor would be held to account if he or she could from my reading of clause 44(3), (4) and (5) attend up to six extraordinary meetings of the assembly within three months, duly called under the legislation, yet still be sacked for missing the three regular monthly meetings?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman clearly has not read the amendment properly. It refers specifically to ordinary meetings and excludes extraordinary meetings.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Exactly so. Therefore the mayor would be sacked for missing three ordinary meetings, yet no provision is made for extraordinary meetings. He could therefore attend up to six extraordinary meetings with due notice given, as I understand the Bill that were called by the assembly, yet miss three regular monthly ones, and the hon. Gentleman would sack him. What sort of accountability it that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am prepared to accept, as, I hope, are the Government, that there may be a technical deficiency [Laughter.] Labour Members may laugh, but the whole point of the Committee is to try to get the Bill^s final wording right. That is why the Bill undergoes a Second Reading, a Committee stage and Report [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an important point. As everyone knows, the hon. Gentleman has a right to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> If, as hon. Members seem to think, we are in some difficulty, they clearly do not understand the procedures in this place. Legislation undergoes different processes to ensure that we get it right. It was interesting that when he first spoke in Committee, the hon. Member for Harrow, East told us about his wonderful experience in local government and said that he knew from that that this was relevant. He seems to be making the same assumption as the Government make in the Bill erroneously in my view that we are talking about local government. Clearly, we are not. The hon. Gentleman is trying to compare local councils to the mayor of London. Obviously, he does not support his Government^s policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Just two small points, given that the hon. Gentleman is on this journey for clarity. First, will he explain the word "unavoidable" and show us how crisp and sharp a legal point it is in the Bill? Secondly, will the hon. Member for Kingston and Sutton say why in last Tuesday^s sitting, as reported in column 33 of the Official Report, he thought that six months was plenty [Interruption.] I apologise: I mean the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Wherever it is, he has a majority of 56, so he should enjoy his time here. On Tuesday, the hon. Gentleman said clearly that a six-month limit on non-attendance was plenty for assembly members. What is the difference between them and the mayor?

<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has raised that point. The Minister made the same point in her remarks. I am a great competitor with the hon. Member for Harrow, East in a regular radio programme and I am used to being interrupted by him. He has not yet learned the manners of a radio interviewer, let a alone a Committee member.
<P>
There is a simple reply to the hon. Gentleman^s and the Minister^s point: the job of an assembly member is different from that of the mayor. The mayor is an executive person. The mayor is like the British Prime Minister in terms of his or her executive power. Would we really be happy for the British Prime Minister to be able to come to the House once every six months? Of course not. We would not be able to hold him to account. But you seem to be happy [Interruption.] I beg your pardon, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am wondering whether the hon. Gentlemen should get their pistols out at dawn on the Terrace.
<P>
I am advised that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton used unparliamentary language. I have to say that I have heard worse in some bus garages where I have worked. I am sure, however, that he will not repeat it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Stevenson. I did not mean to refer to you. I meant that I was surprised that some Labour Members seem to be happy that a member of the executive should come so infrequently to the legislature. The hon. Member for Brent, East thought that it was a flight of fancy. Perhaps the Government could take their minds back to before the election. I imagine that the then Prime Minister did not like coming to the House of Commons and that if he had had the chance he probably would not have come.
<P>
<H5>4.15pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is why safeguards are important. An unpopular mayor who is having lots of difficulty will not want to go to the assembly to answer questions. If you pass [Hon. Members: "Who?"] If the Committee passes the legislation without thinking more deeply about the time limits, a future generation may have a mayor who does not allow him or herself to be properly questioned. That is a serious matter.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> What we have witnessed in today^s Liberal Democrat contributions, in the amendment and in what the hon. Gentleman has said, is central to their whole approach to government, be it local or central. The central, essential and exclusive concentration of their approach is on discussion and never on action. They rarely argue a subject to a point at which something can be achieved, and they totally disregard the inherent burden of responsibility that will be placed on the mayor. They also discount the central relationship between the mayor and assembly, which requires the mayor to be scrutinised by the assembly. If a mayor fails to attend six consecutive meetings called at the behest of the assembly, he or she can be disqualified. For the Liberal Democrats, three months is enough time to be able judge whether work is being achieved and whether policies are being put into place. I have already suggested one scenario in which it would be impossible for the mayor to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall not allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is arguing that the Government have not put into the Bill requirements sufficient to cover all of his points, which he has made at inordinate length, or to ensure that anyone elected to the high office of mayor cannot treat their responsibilities in a cavalier way. I hope that he will agree that he has probed deeply enough, and will ask leave to withdraw his amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will do the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey rose </B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The amendments, as do others that we have tabled, seek to take away from the Secretary of State the very powers that the Government seem to want to give him. We are trying constructively to take on board the Government^s support for the recommendations of the Neill committee, which last October proposed that an election commission be established. Lord Neill and his committee proposed that the election commission should, among other things, take over
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"responsibility for the registration of political parties and, in conjunction with the existing network of returning officers, having broad oversight of the conduct of elections."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report received cross-party support for almost each of its recommendations. Since then, Ministers have said that they intend to publish a Bill on the conduct of elections and party political funding possibly later this year and that it will contain provisions to set up an election commission. We want to ensure that that Bill does not have to amend this Bill. I hope that the Minister will consider our amendment in that light and will agree that it is right and the powers should not remain only with the Secretary of State, but be passed to the election commission when it is established.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on 9 November that the Bill to implement the main findings of the Neill committee will include provisions to set up an electoral commission. We are currently considerating the precise role and remit of the commission, having regard to the detailed recommendations of the Neill committee report.
<P>
The committee envisaged that the commission would have wide-ranging responsibilities that would go beyond policing the new controls on the reporting of donations to political parties, the ban on foreign donations and the limits on election expenditure by political parties. We are sympathetic to that view, but we need to examine carefully how the electoral commission will fit in with existing electoral machinery.
<P>
The Government will announce their conclusions when they publish a draft Bill before the summer recess. There will then follow a period for consultation with political parties and others. The Government intend to legislate in time to establish the new electoral commission in advance of the next general election. We shall consider whether the electoral commission should have a role in the designation of returning officers and the making of election rules in the context of the GLA election. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will take note of what the hon. Gentleman has said in Committee today.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that such issues need to be considered in the wider context of arrangements that will apply more generally than just for the Greater London authority. For that reason, we do not consider it appropriate to accept the amendment that would create specific arrangements for the GLA outside that wider context of provisions for the electoral commission throughout the whole electoral processes in the country. I ask him to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that we are sympathetic to its spirit and that the Government will make provision in due course or, if time permits, in time for the GLA election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister^s remarks have been extremely helpful and encouraging. Given those assurances, I accept his invitation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 146, line 26, leave out "4" and insert "5".
<P>
When I am suffering from insomnia, I pick up the Bill and idly flick through it. I find the schedules a particularly good cure. While flicking through the Bill, I spotted in line 26, page 146 a draftsman^s error: reference should have been made to paragraph 5, not paragraph 4. Ever mindful of the need to help out the Government in their hour of stress, I tabled the amendment to correct that error.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am pleased to learn of our contribution to the hon. Gentleman^s late nights when, racked with horror at the plight of his party, he can find solace by reading the schedules of the Greater London Authority Bill. I am delighted that, while struggling to keep his eyes open, he managed to spot the incorrect reference, which should indeed be to paragraph 5, not paragraph 4, of schedule 2. I hope that the spirit of constructive opposition, which has characterised the Committee^s proceedings so far will continue to flourish, and I am happy to accept the hon. Gentleman^s amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is a milestone in my political career. It is the first time that a Bill has been amended on my initiative in exactly the way that I proposed. I draw the Minister^s attention to the fact that, far from worrying about the state of my party, I was plotting the downfall of the present Government in two years^ time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman wish to speak to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Yes, I do, but I did not know whether the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) wanted to do so first.
<P>
The Minister paid tribute to my hon. Friend, and it would be wrong for that great milestone to pass without its having been recognised by Conservative Members, too. I am sure that I speak for all our supporters when I say that we would follow my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South anywhere.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 208.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendments modify the usual local election provisions when that is necessary as a result of the proposed new electoral systems for the mayor and the assembly. The first amendment would make changes in three distinct areas, which I shall address in turn. First, it will provide for the same election agent to be appointed for all the candidates on a given party list. A single agent will be appointed for each list for elections to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the European Parliament. The reason for appointing a single agent is that it is the party as a single unit, rather than individual candidates on the party^s list, which is contesting the London-wide seats.
<P>
The amendments provide that when no agent is appointed, the top-placed candidate on the list should be named as agent for the whole list. That approach is also taken for list elections elsewhere. Given the large geographical area over which the campaigns will be fought, provision is made for the appointment of sub-agents. I hope that the Committee will accept that that is a sensible, practical provision, which will assist in the smooth running of the list elections.
<P>
The amendment will provide for a personal expenses limit for assembly constituency candidates of &#163;600, which is the same as for parliamentary elections, and a personal limit I stress the words "personal limit" of &#163;900 on each London list candidate. That differential is intended to reflect the far greater geographical area over which list candidates will campaign.
<P>
Our proposals are consistent with the proposed personal expenses limits for constituency and regional list candidates in Scottish and Welsh elections. As in Scotland and Wales, we propose to set a limit of &#163;900 for candidates who contest both a constituency and a list seat. I am not persuaded that personal expenses need to be the sum of the two limits in such cases; we believe that the higher figure is appropriate.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Given the unique nature of the post of mayor, I am still considering what would be the most appropriate arrangements to put in place, and I would welcome any views expressed in Committee this afternoon. I intend to return to the subject at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I pay tribute to the Minister^s open-mindedness on this matter. It is crucial that there should be no question whatever of any mayoral candidate being able to bankroll the electorate of London. Therefore I hope that Her Majesty^s Government will be very strict in setting low and reasonable limits on expenditure, which must be accounted for in the due and proper way, as is normal in elections.
<P>
Will the Minister undertake to return to the matter on Report in this House not in the other place, for good and understandable reasons? It does not normally discuss money Bills and should not discuss money matters about elections; it has no experience of them we do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that I intend to return to the issue on Report in this House. However, let me explain why further thought is required. We are talking not about campaign[Mr. Raynsford]
expenses those are a different matter but about purely personal expenses for travel and subsistence. Although there is no particular reason why the mayor should incur larger subsistence expenses than list candidates over the same period, he or she might nevertheless be required to travel extensively around London during an election.
<P>
It would be wrong if a mayor who was acting in good faith was disqualified for exceeding the &#163;900 limit the appropriate figure that we have set for list candidates simply because of the exigencies of campaigning for office. We believe that further thought should be given to the matter, simply because of the unique nature of the post. We would welcome the views of members of the Committee whether expressed in Committee or elsewhere before we reach a decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Will the Minister confirm that he expects all candidates for the office of mayor to travel extensively throughout London on public transport to set a good example?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I would certainly expect candidates to travel on public transport, as I endeavour to do myself on my journey from home to work most days. However, given the fares charged to travel on public transport in certain areas, it would be possible for a mayor who travelled exclusively on public transport to exceed the &#163;900 limit during a five or six-week campaign. That is the nub of the problem.
<P>
We would not want a prospective mayor who was genuinely campaigning and trying to respond to pressure from all over London, inadvertently to exceed the personal expenses limit and therefore be debarred from office. I stress that we have no wish to provide any succour to fat cats who wish to bankroll their campaigns because they happen to have huge resources. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood might give us their views of the ability of any individual candidate whether from their party or not to try to buy votes by the use of prodigious wealth. Our intention is not to allow that to happen and to ensure that candidates who are legitimately campaigning do not inadvertently incur a technical breach of the rules, simply because we have set the expenses limit too low.
<P>
Thirdly, the amendment makes provision for placing limits on election, rather than personal, expenses. As we said at paragraph 4.21 on page 34 of the White Paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There will need to be a limit on the amount that candidates for the Mayor and the Assembly can spend."
<P>
The amendment makes the necessary technical provisions to enable suitable limits to be put in place. The existing local government rules are not well suited to the electoral systems that we propose for the GLA. For example, there is no provision in the local rules for limits to be placed on the election expenses of list candidates. The amendment provides for limits to be set on the election expenses of mayoral candidates, party lists, individuals contesting London member seats and assembly constituency candidates. The limits would be set in an order made by the Secretary of State, subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, which would allow full debate to take place in both Houses of Parliament. That is absolutely right for such a provision.
<P>
Arrangements for London cannot be considered in a vacuum. The Home Office is assessing the implications of Lord Neill^s recent report on the funding of political parties and the Government will bring forward legislation in due course. Until then, however, it is necessary to have appropriate interim arrangements in place.
<P>
Hon. Members will understand why I am not in a position today to specify the level of any limit on candidates^ election expenses, or to debate the criteria for determining those limits. That is a matter that needs considerable debate and thought, but which must be considered in the light of Lord Neill^s report into party funding.
<P>
For that reason, we are providing only the mechanism to specify the figures through a resolution. As I have said, that will be the affirmative resolution procedure, thereby ensuring full debate in both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Randall:</B> May I made one plea? When the Government specify those figures, could they ensure that the limits are strictly adhered to? Members on both sides of the Committee would agree that political parties treat the rulings on election expenses with too much latitude. There are several cases before the courts of election expenses allegedly having been exceeded. I hope that the Government make the limits practical and realistic so that they are abided by.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman had experience of a by-election just over a year ago. Those of us who have experienced the special circumstances of by-elections know the difficulty of adhering strictly to the expenses limits. However, the hon. Gentleman makes the valid point that we need genuine, workable expenses limits that neither provide excessive opportunity for rich individuals to secure support by using their wealth nor encourage decent reputable candidates who are campaigning properly to commit technical infringements of the rules because the limits have been set artificially low. It is genuinely difficult to decide what figure to set the mayoral elections, and the matter requires careful thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I accept that the matter is complex, but can the Minister not tell us the ballpark figures that he has in mind? Surely he will accept that although, as he has repeatedly emphasised, the matter will be subject to regulations that will be put into force by affirmative resolution, that will give the House no opportunity to amend or alter the proposals. The proposals will be made on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. It is therefore all the more important for him to give us some idea now of what is in his mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is not our intention to come forward with proposals on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. I have openly invited members of the Committee to give us their views, and I shall enter into discussions with the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Kingston and Surbiton, if they so wish, before coming forward with proposals.
<P>
However, it may give the hon. Gentleman a feel for the problem that we face if I explain that we applied the traditional local government formula and came up with a limit of about &#163;215,000 for the mayoral expenditure. It has been calculated that the cost of doing a mailshot to every household in London would be about &#163;700,000. That gives the right hon. Gentleman a sense of the enormous disparity between the two bases that might be applied to determine the limit. We need to explore the issue much more carefully and thoroughly before producing a precise figure. We welcome comments and suggestions. The right hon. Gentleman looks aghast perhaps he has knowledge of the cost of mailing. If so, I will be happy to hear it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> No, no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am genuinely trying to be helpful by explaining the wide latitude that might exist, depending on the basis that is adopted for determining the appropriate figure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I do not want the Minister to get bogged down in a detailed discussion at this stage. He has generously acknowledged that he will listen to representations from members of the Committee and others. On the subject that he raised, is he talking about the cost of postage? Does not he envisage at least one free mailing, as is allowed in normal parliamentary elections? Was he referring to the cost of printing the material, which would then be posted free as part of the normal provisions of an election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was referring to the total cost of printing and mailing. That includes paying for mailing the leaflet.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman raised the different issue of whether a free mailshot should apply, as in parliamentary elections, or whether it should not, as in local government elections. Perhaps he has raised one more issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to raise a matter that the Minister might not have considered at first. We will in effect have three elections within one institution the list elections, the direct constituency elections and the mayoral elections. The limits that are set for the different types of election might overlap. If there is a list for the Liberal Democrats, there will be a spin-off in terms of the expenditure for that campaign. There will also be a spin-off for the constituency and mayoral elections. We need, therefore, to look at the totality of limits and at what a party is allowed to spend. Given the Minister^s point about how wealth could distort outcomes, I hope that he will consider that, too. I hope that he will consider the picture in the round as well as the individual parts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair point. As I said, we propose to make provision for separate limits for the four separate categories. I entirely take his point that there is a potential overlap, which requires careful thought. That is why we are not producing figures today that have been plucked out of thin air. We intend to do more work on the issue in the light, among other things, of Lord Neill^s observations. We will then make proposals. As I said, they will be subject to debate by both Houses under the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
Our objective will be to set expenses limits that are realistic and allow candidates to campaign properly and without incurring technical problems. At the same time, we do not want to give unfair advantage to those with large financial resources. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that that is our objective and that it is the right way forward.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eileen Gordon </B>(Romford): This may be in the Bill I admit that I have not read every single word of it, although I have read most of them. Will my hon. Friend be taking the opportunity to limit spending by national parties? The election of the mayor and of the assembly will involve a high-profile campaign. Has my hon. Friend considered putting a limit on what the national parties can spend within London?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. We have made provision to set limits in four separate categories. As I said in response to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, there is the issue of overlap. Expenses can be incurred by political parties that field candidates in at least three of those separate categories. The issue of overlap must be considered, and we will take it on board.
<P>
National expenditure by political parties is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. It would not be appropriate for us, in legislating for London, to legislate on a matter that has a national impact. However, it is a factor that should be taken into account.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have must been advised that as the Minister is moving the amendment, interventions are not appropriate. I am doing this after the event, so to speak. It is entirely my fault, and I apologise to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was about to turn to the second amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Your ruling, which I would not dream of challenging, puzzles many members of the Committee. It is a new rule to me that when a Minister, in all his dignity and majesty, is moving an amendment, members of the Committee are not allowed courteously to intervene in that speech for the sake of clarification. Perhaps you will help the Committee, Mr. Stevenson, by clarifying that point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Further advice in my not-so-good ear is that I misinterpreted the first piece of advice. [Laughter.] I hope that I am not testing the patience of hon. Members too much. I am grateful for their guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was just reflecting on the fact that the right hon. Gentleman referred to my majesty. This is only the second time in my life that that term has been used. The first time was a very interesting mistake made when I was leaving a trade mission in Egypt. The good[Mr. Raynsford]
people who were receiving me clearly misunderstood the briefing and thought that I was someone else. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Following your ruling, Mr. Stevenson, may I bring the Minister down to earth? I refer to the interesting observation about promotional material put about by political parties and the fact that the Home Secretary will be responsible for that matter. Surely this is germane to the amendment that Her Majesty^s Government are putting forward, inasmuch as it could be crucial to determine the expenditure on television advertising, for example, especially for the representation of London Members on the list. Could the Minister reconsider that aspect with extreme care and come back to the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman^s point is entirely appropriate. It is precisely because of the complexities and inter-relationships of advertising at a national level as against advertising specifically in London, and other expenditure in London, that we need to take great care, as I have already emphasised.
<P>
Amendment No. 208 is a technical modification to ensure that any reference to a registered political party submitting a list of candidates is construed in accordance with clause 4(5)(a) and part II of schedule 2. I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South has not, in a sleepless night, alighted upon these clauses and discovered that we have the wording or the numbers wrong. The provisions make explicit provision for the submission of party lists. It is a technical clarification which I am sure members of the Committee will welcome, and I urge them to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I simply want to reinforce what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge in his intervention in the Minister^s speech. I was involved in negotiations with the Labour party in 1989 for the change in arrangements for by-elections. The situation then seemed wholly appalling in that national parties were descending on elections as they may do in this case and the poor fellow who would suffer the worst penalties in the event of a challenge was the agent. It seemed quite wrong that practising politicians should put agents at that risk. That view was shared by the Labour party and the 1989 legislation was passed with common support. I feel strongly that my hon. Friend^s views should be taken seriously in the determination.
<P>
I understand the reference in clause 4(5)(a) to a registered political party, but I do not immediately see why it is necessary in addition to the references in part 2 of the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Liberal Democrats agree with the Government on their amendments in almost every aspect. [Hon. Members: "Oh."] However, I should like to probe the Minister on one or two points.
<P>
In the interests of constructive debate, the Minister asked Opposition Members what we felt about the various limits that are being debated in the Home Office and in his Department. Earlier today, I discussed with the Electoral Reform Society the limits that it would consider for the mayoral campaign. It is a complicated issue, as the Minister said. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to the question of overlapping.
<P>
London-wide elections for the European Parliament will take place later this year. The Electoral Reform Society has told me that the Home Office will soon publish those limits. The proposed limits for the whole country for party lists will be &#163;3.5 million. Clearly, other arrangements must be made for parties that campaign only in particular parts of the United Kingdom. I have been told that the regulations covering a party such as the Scottish National party when it campaigns in Scotland would divide the &#163;3.5 million by the number of Members of the European Parliament that is, 84 and then multiply that figure by the number of MEPs in any particular region 10, in London^s case. If my maths or that of the person who helped me is correct, that would give a figure of &#163;416,000. That is somewhat less than the figure that the Minister quoted as the cost of a direct mail operation across the entire capital. That sort of figure around half a million pounds is probably appropriate, giving the complexities that have already been conceded.
<P>
I hope that what I have just said represents a first contribution to meetings that I hope that the Minister will have with my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and the hon. Member for Croydon, South. It is important to achieve cross-party consensus on what the limits should be.
<P>
I impress upon the Minister that the matter is urgent. The Green Paper in 1997 referred to the necessity for these measures. It is crucial to ensure that wealthy individuals are not able to buy their way into public office. The Green Paper was followed by a White Paper in 1998 and by the Neill Report in October last year, but we are still waiting for action. I appreciate that the Home Office is considering the details and that a Bill will be introduced in due course.
<P>
However, the mayoral election is very different from the other elections that are under consideration. It is a new type of election. Parallels can be drawn with elections for United States^ governors, senators and presidents. Those types of election, if the American experience is anything to go by, can involve a lot of money. Political action committees are set up to ensure that individuals are extremely well funded. I am sure that the Minister would not like to see such money entering British elections and playing the major role that it does in American elections.

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We should be so lucky.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I know that the right hon. Gentleman is a great America-phile. However, I hope that even he, who supports most things that come out of the United States of America, agrees that the way in which money has entered politics is not one of the best things about that country.
<P>
Bearing in mind the imminent election of a London mayor, I hope that the Minister will understand that it may be inappropriate to wait until the Government have made up their mind on election finances and drawn up new draft law for all election campaigns. We in the capital see people already gearing up for campaigns some would argue that they have already started their campaigns. I shall return to this matter when I speak to our next amendment, but it is important that limits are set as soon as possible. As the Neill report said, it is possible that potential mayoral candidates could stock up on their credits with Londoners before limits are decided and come into place. Will the Minister reflect on the urgency of setting such limits after due discussion in time for the mayoral election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that it will help the Committee if I respond briefly to the main points that have been made.
<P>
I must tell the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that the amendment inserts a definition into the Representation of the People Act 1983 to make it clear that references in that Act to submissions of political party lists should be construed in accordance with the whole of this Bill. That is the reason for the amendment. As I said, it is an entirely technical requirement, but without it there would be a lacuna in our legislation.
<P>
With regard to the speech of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, altough the Neill committee considered this matter, it did not specifically address the Greater London authority elections. We therefore lack its guidance. Had we had such guidance, we would probably be able to make slightly quicker progress, but in its absence, we have had to take further soundings.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman recognises the complexities. We do not want to hang about, but I remind him that there are still some 15 months to go before the election of a mayor. We have plenty of time to consider the issue carefully, take on board all relevant matters and introduce sensible, practical expenses limits which will have the desired effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I believe that the Neill report and the White Paper say that the Government intend to hold consultations with the Association of London Government. Have those consultations started? It is important that we move ahead. If they have not started, will the Minister tell us when they will take place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have already given the Committee an absolute assurance that we will consult before we come forward with proposals. I have undertaken that those consultations will include both the hon. Gentleman^s party and the principal Opposition party. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<H5>4.58</H5>
</P>
<P>
Committee suspended.
