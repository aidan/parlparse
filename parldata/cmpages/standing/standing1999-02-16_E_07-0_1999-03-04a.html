<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): It may for the convenience of the Committee if I say now that we will sit next Tuesday from 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and in the evening from 6 p.m. to allow members of the Committee to attend the Budget debate in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee will have noted that. If there is a Division in the House during our proceedings, I shall adjourn the Committee for 15 minutes. If there are likely to be two Divisions, I shall adjourn the Committee for 30 minutes. That will give hon. Members the opportunity to get some tea.
<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>CAC: members</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 13, line 29, after `members', insert `nominated by ACAS'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 123, in page 13, line 31, leave out `Secretary of State', and insert `Central Arbitration Committee'.
<P>
No. 124, in page 13, line 36, leave out `and'.
<P>
No. 125, in page 13, line 37, at end insert&#151;

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We shall now consider the Central Arbitration Committee. I wish to say two things: first, as I said on Second Reading, the CAC is perhaps one of the most self-effacing public bodies in the land. I have no problem with that. I forget who said, ``Happy is the nation who has no history''. The CAC has no form and has never excited a complaint from any side of industry or featured in any correspondence that I have received. I welcome that; it suggests that it is doing a pretty good job.
<P>
Its chairman has been in place since its inception in 1976, which suggests a stability that is welcome to a Conservative and, I hope, to all members of the Committee. I have no problem with the Central Arbitration Committee.
<P>
Secondly, in general and conceptual terms, the amendments are not about subverting the work of the CAC nor are they about subverting the Government's intentions&#151;there may be other occasions when the position will be different. They are probing amendments and aim to ensure that the committee's new and enhanced duties work effectively as possible. We want to tease out its relationships with bodies, such as the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. It would be inappropriate to speak at length about ACAS when debating the amendments, and I do not intend to do so. There will be an opportunity for that later. Indeed, amendments have been tabled for that precise purpose.
<P>
Given that the CAC has a relatively low profile and that the explanatory notes, although perfectly clear, do not explain the Government's thinking about why the clause is so structured, it is important that the Minister clarifies the committee's relationships with other bodies, the appropriateness of its procedure for appointments and so on, so that the Committee has a clear understanding.
<P>
It is self-evident and explicit both in the Bill and the original Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 from which the Bill is derived that those involved with the CAC should know their onions in relation to industrial relations matters. That is fine, but the extent to which legal input is important is not clear, although it is clear from his curriculum vitae that the chairman is a legal person.
<P>
The Minister of State will remember from our deliberations on the National Minimum Wage Bill that I have some experience of tribunal work. I am most familiar with a panel that has a lay chairperson and two members who broadly represent the two sides. The relationship between the members on the tribunal on which I worked was sufficiently good that I could never quite remember whether I was meant to be a farmer or a landowner. In other words, there is a legal input, but the law is not predominant. It is clear that trade union officials and representatives of employers' organisations know as much about that narrow area of the law as most qualified legal persons, but it would be useful if the Minister would tell us something about what might be termed the legal input to the CAC.
<P>
I shall come to the amendments in a moment, Mr. Atkinson, but my comments on the CAC are germane to amendment No. 129. Perhaps the Minister will think aloud and help us on this matter. The CAC's independence is explicit in the 1992 Act, and it derives from the Employment Protection Act 1975 but it has always functioned as what might loosely be termed an arbitration sub-committee of ACAS. It is not ACAS, but its members are nominated or recommended for nomination by ACAS. Its servicing has traditionally been in the hands of ACAS; certainly, it was so prescribed in the legislation.
<P>
It may be that the Government want the CAC to be at least a little more distanced from ACAS. I have no ideological view on the matter, but I would like the Minister to comment on the fact that that change will give CAC a rather different structure when considering matters of statutory recognition from that which already applies to its traditional functions of arbitration, the provision of information and so on. We need to pause to work out why the structure should be changed, because it will create a slight problem for the organisation.
<P>
Amendment No. 129 is intended to allow ACAS to nominate the members of the CAC rather than them being appointed by the Secretary of State. As I recall it, the 1992 Act provides that ACAS should appoint the members of the CAC, which should include representatives of both sides of industry and independent persons; that is the substance of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). The Bill appears to take the job closer to the Secretary of State and further from ACAS. ACAS would, of course, be involved and able to give advice, but it would not be in the driving seat. It would help if the Minister were to tell us his rationale for making that change.
<P>
Clause 22 provides that the Secretary of State should appoint the chairman of CAC. I shall leave the hon. Member for Eastleigh to speak to amendment No. 123, but I have some sympathy with him wanting to probe the Minister's thinking on that point. The hon. Gentleman has tabled other amendments consequential to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey: </B>(Wentworth): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the current position is exactly the same? At present, the chairman of the CAC is appointed by the Secretary of State, after consultation with ACAS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That may be so, and the hon. Gentleman is right to raise the point. The exigencies of time have forced us to put our amendments together rather quickly; it is not always easy to compare texts and I may well have slipped up. It seems that the wording of the formulation is a little different, but the result may be exactly the same, which would be satisfactory. However, we need to tease that out, not least because there have been beneficial changes in the past few years, such as the development of the Nolan principles in the appointment of members of public bodies and the openness with which such bodies declare their interests. I shall return to that later. I hasten to say that I am not casting aspersions on members who were appointed before Nolan. To my knowledge, there has never been a problem.
<P>
The last amendment in the group refers to the interests of small employers. I have a feeling&#151;possibly because of my writing&#151;that a word may have been dropped out of the text. It was not my intention to suggest that the other person should be co-extensive with those representing the interests of small employers. I wanted to put down a marker saying, in effect, that it is easy when consulting both sides of industry at the macro-level&#151;the large firm and the national office of a trade union&#151;to have an understanding. However, down on the shop-floor, possibly with smaller employers and at some distance, or if there is a particular local employment practice, it may not work out so easily. The interests of small firms are part of the Minister's remit, so he should be able to explain how he will involve representatives of small businesses as well as of large businesses.
<P>
We have been discussing the rights of individuals to date, but collective rights and statutory recognition may apply at the level of smaller businesses. For example, family businesses, which may have traditionally resented and resisted registration or recognition of trade unions will be subject to a process that will consider them.
<P>
Our amendments are not intended to subvert the Government's proposals. The purpose is to tease out the nature of the relationship and how it will be conducted, especially in relation to new appointments. We are interested in how independent and small business inputs can be included alongside those of the traditional two sides of industry, or social partners, to use the modern phrase.
<P>
If the Minister will respond to my concerns and those that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will no doubt express, we shall leave the CAC in peace&#151;not for the next 25 years, but long enough to let it get on, and with the minimum of interference from this place.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I shall begin by commenting on an earlier exchange. I understand that the chairman of the CAC is appointed by the Secretary of State. The role of the CAC is important; it has been successful, as its deliberations have not been the cause of great public controversy.
<P>
The purpose of amendments nos 1234 and 125, which deal primarily with the independence of the CAC, is to recognise that its role will change. They are also probing amendments because I am anxious to ensure that the system works effectively, that it helps the process of trade union recognition and derecognition, and that it is conducted in a way that is acceptable to all parties.
<P>
My amendments were tabled in that spirit.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The CAC was established under the Employment Protection Act 1975 as an independent public body. I am therefore interested to know why Ministers do not feel that they can reinforce its independence by allowing it to appoint its chairmen rather than the Secretary of State of the time doing so. It is important that the CAC is seen to be as distant from the Government as possible. I do not think that Ministers would disagree with my saying that its role is sensitive.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the CAC's new role is likely to be even more politically sensitive than the one that it has traditionally amply discharged?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention&#151;he leads me to remarks that I will use to stress the significance of my amendments. Whatever side of the political fence one comes from&#151;or even if one comes from the top of it&#151;no one would deny that the issue of trade union recognition or derecognition by statute is a political one. It has dominated industrial relations politics for at least the past 18 months, perhaps even shortly before the election as well. We must not frame legislation that carries that political debate into the statute. The political argument is one thing, the statute is another, and I want the statute to work.
<P>
There is a political dimension, so I should like to know how Ministers believe that the information, duties, organisation and membership of the CAC will be set up in order to minimise that political dimension. We must remember that the CAC will undertake much wider responsibilities than it has in the past. The issue of trade union recognition and derecognition will be immensely important to the way in which industrial relations are conducted in the future.
<P>
By comparison, ACAS members are not drawn from only the traditional sides of industry. Employers' and employees' representatives are drawn from not only the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress, but from those who are independent of both. I tabled the amendment on the independence of the membership of the CAC to test Ministers' thinking on the benefits of not extending its membership to those three groups. The tripartite grouping of ACAS is a tried-and-tested formula that is generally accepted by all parties involved in industrial relations. I see value in extending that independence into the way in which the CAC works.
<P>
The CAC has a quasi-judicial role in determining cases of trade union recognition and derecognition. I want to be safe in the knowledge that its decisions will receive broad acceptance from those involved. If the Government are too closely involved in the selection and appointment of those making the decisions, there will always be a groundswell of discontent that decisions are not truly independent, and that the Government of the day are putting pressure on the body that makes judicial judgments. That is at odds with our system of government in the broadest sense. Can the Minister give me some comfort by assuring me that the CAC will be independent, not only in spirit, but in action? Does the Minister appreciate the importance of the CAC making judicial decisions that are broadly acceptable in the wider world?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> All the amendments are about membership of the CAC, but they are aimed at different aspects of the appointments process. I welcome Opposition Members' constructive approach in tabling probing amendments. However, none of them is necessary. I shall deal with the points that have been made, and I hope that, after I have explained the Government's thinking in more detail, Opposition Members will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 129 would restore the requirement for CAC members to be nominated by ACAS as a precondition to appointment by the Secretary of State. The Requirement for nomination by ACAS would limit and restrict the pool from which CAC members could be drawn because ACAS traditionally nominates from its panel of arbitrators. Moreover, the requirement is not consistent with the spirit of Lord Nolan's recommendations on public appointments. I know that the hon. Members for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and for Eastleigh are concerned about that.
<P>
The CAC is not covered by the Commissioner for Public Appointments because it is considered to be a tribunal, not an executive non-departmental public body. However, the Government are committed to applying the spirit as well as the letter of Lord Nolan's recommendations to appointments such as those to the CAC. Therefore, clause 22 proposes to remove the requirement for ACAS nomination and, instead to require the Secretary of State to consult ACAS before making appointments to the CAC. That procedure already applies to the appointment of the Certification Officer for Trade Unions and Employers' Associations.
<P>
I shall explain a little about our intentions for appointments to the revitalised CAC. The current chairman, Professor Sir John Wood, is due to retire this summer after more than 20 years of distinguished service, and a distinguished career as an expert on industrial relations. His successor will have to manage a significant expansion in the CAC's activities. We shall be looking for someone with the necessary experience and qualities. I shall return to that later. We need someone who can win the confidence of employers and trade unions as well as set up and run the revised and expanded CAC.
<P>
We shall also want to appoint new deputy chairmen and members of the CAC to deal with the new work load. All appointments will be made in accordance with the rules on public appointments. We expect the posts to be advertised and to be filled on merit in open competition. I should be pleased to receive any suggestions for suitable candidates from members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am immediately disarmed by that offer. We shall put our thinking caps on. I promise not to nominate any of my Committee colleagues. However, perhaps I shall have to revise that in the light of their subsequent speeches, especially if they are short.
<P>
Will existing members of the CAC, apart from the chairman, have to retire and be re-nominated, or can they continue indefinitely in their normal terms of appointment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We will, in effect, start from a green field, but we shall be happy to consider all applications. Removing the requirement for ACAS nominations is an important part of making the appointments process more open and transparent. I am sure that all hon. Members will welcome that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I do not mean to be mischievous and nor am I offering my services. However, I have on another occasion found something lacking with respect to political balance in appointments, in a Department other than the Minister's&#151;the Department of Health. It is claimed that matters have been dealt with within the Nolan rules. However, there is a marked political imbalance, identified through the declaration of active political interest. I should like the Minister's assurance of an intention not merely to adhere to the letter of the Nolan rules but either to avoid those active in party politics or at least to ensure balance between the parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hoped that I had already made it clear that we shall abide by the spirit as well as the letter of the Nolan rules. That is why we are taking the measures in question. As I said, what we are discussing does not, technically, count as a tribunal within the Nolan rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I simply ask for the record whether&#151;I have not been able to find out&#151;Members of Parliament are disqualified under the disqualification legislation. That concern was behind my saying that I would not nominate my colleagues. It would look very bad if an hon. Member from any party were to be involved in the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> They will not be eligible.
<P>
Amendment No. 123 would remove the Secretary of State's power to appoint the chairman and, at his option, deputy chairmen of the CAC and would instead give CAC members the right to choose the chairman and, if they wished, vice-chairmen, from among their own number. The amendment is based on a misconception about the nature of the posts of chairman and deputy chairman. The CAC chairman already has a significant managerial role, but that will be substantially increased and enhanced as a result of its new functions. It might increase further if, for example, the CAC were to be given a role in implementing the European works councils directive.
<P>
In the circumstances, we shall obviously look for a chairman who commands the respect of both employers and trade unions, and who has substantial managerial and organisational skills, suitable to leading an enhanced CAC. It might well be a full-time appointment.
<P>
As to legal expertise, the hon. Member for Daventry is right that the chairman and deputy chairman will need a good knowledge of the relevant law, but that does not mean that either will necessarily need to be legally qualified. Professional legal advice will be available to them. The case is analagous to that of the Certification Officer. Those appointed to the post have traditionally been expert in the relevant law, but not necessarily legally qualified, since they have access to legal advice. We think that that system works well and envisage the same model being followed for the chairman and deputy chairman of the CAC.
<P>
The deputy chairmen also need to be people whom both employers and trade unions can trust to act impartially. They are likely to have experience of industrial relations in an academic or legal capacity, which would distinguish them from those with experience as employers or trade union representatives.
<P>
It seems right to us that in the circumstances the selection criteria for the chairman and deputy chairmen should differ significantly from those applied to the other members&#151;for whom I should like to find a description other than ``ordinary members'', since, clearly, they will be exceptional people. It would of course not be sensible for the CAC members who had been appointed to pick a chairman or deputy chairmen from their own number. One could easily imagine that, regrettably, such a choice might be based on horse-trading and compromise rather than merit. That is quite apart from the fact that the selection criteria might be different from those that I outlined earlier. The CAC would be damaged by that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I am following the Minister's argument closely. However, I am slightly worried about clause 22(3), which refers to those whose
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``experience is as representatives of employers and some whose experience is as representatives of workers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is rather restrictive, and appears to suggest that such representatives should be trade union officials, not well known people in the trade union movement who could actually help. The same applies to employers. Very few people act as representatives of employers, but many people work with the CBI and other bodies providing nominations. Is not the clause unduly restrictive? I accept that my reservations should possibly have been the subject of a different amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Our intention is clear. The purpose of the reforms and the clause is to have as wide a pool as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I will continue, as I have been giving way all the time and we have an enormous volume of work to get through.
<P>
It is far better that the chairman and the deputy chairman are selected in an open and transparent way than in the way proposed in the amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos 124 and 125 would add another group of independent members to the CAC. They are unnecessary because those appointed as chairman and deputy chairman will be carefully selected for their ability to behave in a neutral, independent way. Otherwise, such people would be unable to gain from employers and trade unions the respect needed to do their job properly. People appointed because of previous experience with employers or trade unions will, of course, be obliged to act independently, not as representatives of employers or unions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) made an important clarification.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. When the hon. Member for South Dorset made his point, he was straying away from the amendment and on to a subject that would be better raised in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Amendments Nos. 124 and 125 are unnecessary. The Bill's criteria make plain that independence will be essential. The amendments would add unnecessarily to the cost and size of the CAC, and would cast doubt on the independence of the chairman and deputy chairman. That is an unfortunate implication which, I am sure, was not intended by the hon. Gentlemen who tabled the amendments.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 130.
<P>
<B>Mr Boswell:</B> May I assist the Committee by saying that I have asked for inquiries to be made because, unfortunately, a line was omitted from amendment No. 130, although it appears to make sense in its truncated form. I have not brought the full text with me, although the Minister might have seen it in an earlier print. I shall not rest on the matter, as I listen to his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As I have ministerial responsibility for small firms, I take a particular interest in amendment No. 130. Intriguingly, it seems to say that the Secretary of State may consult representatives of small employers about CAC membership. That appears to be a thoroughly good thing, but it implies that no one else should be consulted. That may not be what the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) intended, but that is its effect. I suspect that he is now about to provide clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Miraculously, the original text has reached me, so my memory is refreshed. Amendment No. 130, as tabled, would allow the Secretary of State to consult people
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``seeming to him to represent significant interests on either side of industry, or to represent the interests of small employers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would apply to both sides of industry, rather than concentrating exclusively on small employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I was sure that he did not intend such an exclusive application.
<P>
The amendment is not necessary. As I said in the few moments that I have been allowed to stay on my feet without constructive interventions from Opposition Members, we are committed to an open process of appointment. Anyone may make representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and I should especially welcome small firms doing so. As Minister with responsibility for small firms, I am determined that representative organisations and, indeed, any small firm, have the opportunity to be consulted on CAC appointments, as on all other matters that affect them. I never cease to emphasise the importance of small firms to the economy. I am keen that that should apply to all firms, even those small firms that will not be subject to the clause. We do not want small firms to feel that their horizons are limited. We might want to involve small firms that do not employ more than 20 people but anticipate that they might in future, and might therefore be brought into the ambit of the clause. We would enthusiastically welcome any representations that they made. However, despite my ministerial responsibilities, I do not think it desirable to single out a particular interest group for consultation in that way. Of course small firms will be welcome, but, notwithstanding the clarification that the hon. Member for Daventry has given, I do not want any implications&#151;
<P>
given, I do not want any implications&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall first conclude on that point.
<P>
We want to consult as widely as possible, and I shall of course involve small firms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister, who seems to be groping his way towards a more satisfactory position than that from which I thought, rightly or wrongly, that he started. I was encouraged by his reference to the importance of consulting small firms. Is he open not only to the idea of consulting small firms about appointments but to the likelihood of appointing people who are involved in small business to the Committee? I am not quibbling, but, as he knows, the clause refers to ``representatives of'' employers. Would it be possible to appoint not only representatives of employers, such as trade associations, but employers themselves&#151;the real thing, the finished article, the desirable product?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Perhaps we could discuss that when we debate clause stand part. The amendment is specific, and, if hon. Members will forgive me, I shall confine myself to it at this stage. In light of the full explanations that I have given of the Government's thinking, I invite hon. Members to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It has occurred to me in considering public appoinments that, even with the purest of motives, the result has sometimes appeared to be partial or partisan in terms of political affiliation. Subject to the important reservation of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), in the face of a battery of fire, questions and corrections to the text, which must have disconcerted him as much as me, the Minister has tried to deal with some of our genuine and probing anxieties. For the purposes of this group of amendments, disbelief should be suspended, and the tripartisan spirit between the three parties represented in the Committee should be dominant. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 13, line 39, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3B) A register shall be drawn up of the interests of members of the panel for the time being.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be brief. As the Minister may have anticipated, we are anxious to ensure maximum independence for members of the committee. I draw attention to a recent case involving a Law Lord. I make no comment on whether the person involved should have been empanelled or should have declared his interest; that is not a matter for this Committee, although the law lord's colleagues may have reached a conclusion about it.
<P>
The matter is important in any consideration of a public body, especially a quasi-judicial one such as the proposed committee. People who are appointed to it should not merely be independent but should be seen to be independent. One of the best ways to let some light into the process is to ensure that any interest that those appointed may have which might conceivably be, or be adduced to be, relevant or likely to influence their judgment should be declared at the start.
<P>
I referred to the anxieties expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West about political bias. He was concerned that people might say that the Central Arbitration Committee should be loaded in one direction or another. The Minister must remember that Governments change. It is sometimes said about the Supreme Court of the United States that it was loaded by the President of the day in one direction or another. We do not want such a situation and one way to avoid it would be, as the Minister suggested, to choose the best and most suitable people. I hope that the Minister will consider advertising for people to offer their services as well as doing the usual trawl through Government Departments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> Is the intention behind the amendment to ensure that people who are appointed to the CAC would have to register their membership of, for example, masonic lodges?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As I recall it, the Lord Chancellor has taken an interest in the matter. I have no interest to declare in the subject, but my reservation is that a register of interests should be as comprehensive as possible so that there is no doubt where people are coming from.
<P>
The more information that is available the better. It is possible that people will make allegations of political bias even when that is not appropriate, sometimes about decisions that are taken later down the track. It is better for everything to be out in the open and up front in the most explicit form, so that everyone knows about it. I need hardly remind the Committee that trade union recognition will raise some sensitive issues and it is important that people should be clear from the start where they stand.
<P>
I do not say that the precise formulation in the amendment is the right one; the Minister and his colleagues would have to consider carefully how it harmonises with other practices. However, there is a strong interest in what the Minister himself described as transparency, openness and fairness and one of the ways in which that can best be served is by the proper publication of any declaration of interest. That is not meant to suggest that existing members of the Committee or any subsequent members whom the Minister may choose to nominate are biased, but publication is essential to avoid their being seen to be biased.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment. I understand and agree with the spirit that drives it, but I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will agree with me when I have explained why it is unnecessary. There are existing arrangements governing the CAC which deal with the question of members' interests and I shall briefly go through them to reassure the Committee.
<P>
First, there are individual letters of appointment, which set out the terms of membership. Those letters include passages on members' conduct and interests and I quote from the current CAC chairman's letter of appointment:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``You must avoid behaviour which would bring the Committee into disrepute, for example by using your position or information obtained in the course of your duties for personal gain, by accepting gifts or hospitality that might be seen as a reward for personal favours . . . The integrity of the CAC chairman and members should never be in doubt . . . You must declare any personal interest you may have in matters which come before you in the course of your duties as a member of the Committee. The Chairman should have no business or personal interests which could conflict, or be seen as conflicting, with his responsibilities as Chairman.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So the individual letters of appointment clearly provide the first safeguard.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second safeguard is even more relevant to the amendment. There are long-standing rules on the conduct of non-departmental public bodies, which deal with ethical considerations, responsibilities, responses to sponsor departments and to Parliament, accounting and audit, reporting and so forth. They also cover the financial interests of members.
<P>
The Cabinet Office publishes a draft code, which each NDPB adapts to its own circumstances. The draft code requires the chairman and other members to declare any personal and business interests that may conflict with their responsibilities as members. NDPBs are required to draw up rules of conduct in consultation with their sponsor departments to identify and deal at an early stage with any conflicts of interests.
<P>
The draft code refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the keeping of a register of interests appropriate to the body's activities. The register should, as a minimum, list direct or indirect pecuniary interests which members of the public might reasonably think could influence judgment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The code goes on to say that NDPBs should consider whether registers should include non-pecuniary interests. It says that the register should be published once a year, or annual reports should give details of how access to registers may be obtained. The fact that there is access to the register should be made widely known. NDPB members should be required to update the registers as changes occur.
<P>
I could go on, but I hope that I have provided the hon. Member for Daventry with sufficient reassurance that his point is comprehensively dealt with in the Government's standard rules, which are applicable to all NDPBs. It will also apply to the CAC. The code deals with the problem more thoroughly than would the amendment, not least because it more readily allows for updating and improvement.
<P>
An additional point may not have been in the hon. Gentleman's mind, but if we were to accept the amendment in respect of one body, it could raise doubts about the position of other NDPBs for which there is no such requirement in statute.
<P>
As I said previously, the CAC is in a curious position because it is regarded as a tribunal rather than an executive or advisory NDPB, so it is not automatically subject to the Cabinet Office guidance to which I referred. Nor is it subject to the supervision of the Council on Tribunals. However, the policy of the Department of Trade and Industry is to apply the Cabinet Office guidance to all of the NDPBs that the Department sponsors.
<P>
At present, given the small scale of its activities and resources&#151;it has only one part-time member of staff&#151;the CAC does not apply the full panoply of NDPB requirements. However, I can assure the Committee that as the CAC expands its functions and resources, it will be treated in the same way as all other NDPBs&#151;including the parts of the code that relate to a register of members' interests, as I described earlier.
<P>
In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that his concerns have been met and that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has reassured me to a substantial extent. It is right that the issue has been raised and he has clearly explained that the body will be under the code. Instead of pressing the amendment to a Division, it might be sensible to reserve any further consideration for a later stage and to take advice from those who have an interest in the matter. The Minister has been helpful and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Briefly, the point that I sought to make under the pretext of speaking to amendment No. 129 was simply that clause 22(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may appoint as members only persons experienced in industrial relations''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
fine&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and they shall include some persons whose experience is as representatives of employers and some whose experience is as representatives of workers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that the Secretary of State is somewhat limiting himself, especially in dealing with employers.
<P>
Many employers who have enormous experience of working in a trade union environment would never be described as representatives of employers. In other words, they are employers, but the term, ``representatives of employers'' suggests that those appointed will either have worked full-time for the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors or some other body, or at least worked as representatives of employers on such bodies.
<P>
Some of the best people in industry who have good common sense and experience of such matters spend their time running their companies, not running off and being representatives of other employers. I am not trying to restrict the Secretary of State; I want to broaden the scope of the subsection.
<P>
To a lesser extent, the experience of workers' representatives should be used. The Secretary of State might want to include those who are known both to the trade union movement and to employees, who might say, ``I want someone who understands my work and feelings.'' I put that down as a marker. Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the wording of subsection (3).
<P>
The subsection is not exclusive; it uses the phrase: ``shall include some persons''. However, that suggests that, on every panel of three people, one person will be a trade unionist, one a representative of employers, and the other more or less independent, as the chairman of the panel. A better choice of words would make people think that all sides of a dispute&#151;those who speak for employers and those who have experience of being employees&#151;should be involved.
<P>
I would hate to think that an hon. Member who lost his seat at the next general election after 20-odd years in the House, but who had never been a representative of employees, could not be appointed. The Minister of State has been a representative of employees.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> And employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> So he would not be excluded from either side. In fact, he might be a one man, three-man committee. Despite the sizeist remarks that he makes about himself, he is a big man from that point of view. He could take all three roles.
<P>
We want to ensure that experienced Labour Members who know all about what employees think, but who lose their seats will not be excluded from those roles. I assure hon. Members that the Labour party will lose seats at the next general election.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We may be forced to move an amendment on unfair dismissal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall not be tempted down that route. Before the Committee reports, I, or another hon. Member, should move an amendment to the Bill that would ensure that people who work for employers are paid for the job that they do. The unpaid parliamentary private secretary might vote for such an amendment, although he might have to declare an interest. I rest my case on those narrow points. As I said, the Opposition are trying to be helpful to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We have had an interesting discussion on the clause and on the CAC, which has probably not had so much attention for many years. The CAC will take on important new functions as a result of the legislation. The clause and the following one are designed to adapt the statutory basis of the CAC to enable it to take on its new duties effectively. The clause effectively makes one significant change. At present, the Secretary of State appoints the chairman of the CAC, after consulting ACAS and the other members of the CAC, from persons nominated by ACAS. In practice, ACAS nominated members of its panel of arbitrators. The requirement for nomination by ACAS limited the potential pool from which CAC members could be drawn and was not consistent with the spirit of the recommendations of Lord Nolan on public appointments. The clause therefore removes the requirement for ACAS nomination and merely requires the Secretary of State to consult ACAS before making all appointments to the CAC. The same procedure already applies for the appointment of the certification officer for trade unions and employers' associations.
<P>
I have already spoken on amendment No. 129 about our intentions for appointments to the CAC. I shall address the specific concerns of the hon. Members for South Dorset and for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), who is sadly no longer with us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> He is here in spirit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Yes. The essential point is that we cannot guarantee that there will be representatives of small firms or indeed small business men on the new, enhanced CAC. Appointment will depend on merit and on whether such people apply. However, we shall of course do all that we can to encourage them to apply, as we shall encourage a wide range of people to apply to participate in that important body.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset is getting over-exercised&#151;I hate to see him doing so&#151;about the definition of representatives. I read the clause differently. I understood it to mean that we do not expect anyone who has run a small business and who is appointed to the CAC, on merit as all members of the CAC will be, to act purely as a representative of his or her firm; he or she will come onto the committee generically, if I can put it that way.
<P>
The concerns of the hon. Member for South Dorset are perhaps overstated, particularly as the wording of the clause follows the wording of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which the hon. Gentleman's party enacted when it was in Government. That states that the CAC shall include such representatives; that has not caused problems and we do not envisage that it will.
<P>
I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and enables him to lay his concerns to rest. It will be crucial to the legislation's success that in its new, expanded role, the CAC has high-quality members in whom unions and employers can have confidence. We will devote all the necessary efforts and resources&#151;this responds to the point made by the hon. Member for Daventry&#151;to finding suitable candidates for those important posts. If members of the Committee have any suggestions about that, we will be delighted to hear them. The clause and the other changes we propose will ensure that the CAC is ready for its new tasks and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) a member of the Committee who is independent'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The amendments are largely consequential on the previous group of amendments, particularly in regard to the CAC membership&#151;as was amendment No. 128, which will form part of a subsequent group.
<P>
I shall be brief as the Minister has gone a considerable way in answering my probing thoughts in his earlier comments, with one small exception, on which he might like to elaborate further. While he put up a case for saying that it was unnecessary to extend the membership of the CAC, he has not satisfactorily explained why it is not reasonable to draw its membership from both sides of industry and from neither. The members of ACAS are drawn from both sides of industry and from people who are independent. Could representatives on the CAC be drawn from places other than the unions or business?
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Amendments Nos. 126 and 127 follow on from amendments Nos. 124 and 125 which, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh recognised, have been withdrawn. I have already explained why the Government see no used for an additional group of independent members of the CAC. The chairman and deputy chairmen are intended to fulfil that role. Further independent members would be an unnecessary addition and complication. The CAC will in effect function as a tribunal. That concept is well established and proven, as, for example, in the employment tribunals and the employment appeals tribunal. There is no case for departing from that well-accepted model.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> My specific point, and I appreciate that the Minister could not read my thoughts in advance and needs a little time to gather his own, is whether membership of the CAC is exclusive to recognised representatives of industry, on one side or the other, or is open to a wider body of candidates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not quite following the purport of the clause. The CAC will have an independent chair and deputy chairman. That will be established. It may also include representatives of the employers or representatives of trade unions, the precedent for which is well established. There is no reason for us to depart from that model. It is vital however, and this is a common-sense point, that they have experience of industrial relations. That does not mean that they must be employers or have trade union experience, although, given that they must have experience of industrial relations, it is likely that they will. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied by that answer and will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): As the chairman of the committee would be independent and there would be a representative from both sides of industry, does it not follow that accepting amendment No. 126, and adding a fourth person, would mean that a split decision could leave the committee in an intolerable position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We will come to that point in a moment. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will now withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am pleased that the Minister has responded directly to my question, and I am satisfied with his answer, which relates to amendment No. 128, which will no longer apply. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 132, in page 14, line 20, after 'chairman', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'and with the consent of the Chairman of the Committee or his deputy.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In much the same spirit of probing how the Committee is to work most effectively, and rather picking up my earlier amendment No. 131 and our discussions about openness and transparency, I tabled the amendment to flag up concern about the panel's decision to meet in private. Occasionally, particularly on very sensitive matters, it may be right for a panel to meet in private. But this is a quasi-judicial process and since the Committee's formation in 1975 there has been increasing emphasis in public debate on the importance of openness and transparency. I very much hope that it would be the exception rather than the rule that the committee met in private. It is better for matters to be discussed openly and put on the record so that they are subject to evaluation or criticism thereafter. That is certainly so&#151;this is germane to later amendments&#151;if a tendency in one or other direction is developing in the arbitration committee's deliberations that others may wish to criticise, flag up or support.
<P>
This proposal would go further than the existing provisions of the CAC whose terms of reference would provide almost exactly for a resolution to meet in private were their wording to include, vis-a-vis the committee, the phrase ``in relation to one of these three-person panels''. Although I did not intervene on the previous debate, I did notice that it was easier to get a majority among three than among four. Nevertheless, if a three-person panel decided that it wished to meet in private, there would be an additional filter in that they would have to apply to the chairman of the overall committee, or his deputy, to establish the case for doing so.
<P>
The Minister should address the delicate balance between the occasional need for confidentiality and sensitivity, and the need almost always for maximum transparency and openness. It is important that the hon. Gentleman should try to find the right procedure by which all that can be reconciled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful for the constructive approach taken by the hon. Member for Daventry. I hope that I can set his mind at rest.
<P>
There is no devious purpose behind subsection (4). The wording is closely modelled on section 263(3) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which in turn has its origins in schedule 1 of the Employment Protection Act 1975. It merely seemed sensible to allow for the possibility of private sittings. We have no firm views on when they might be appropriate. That is a matter for the CAC. However, we can imagine, for example, that where a business in the defence industry is the subject of an application for recognition and there is a dispute about the bargaining unit, the employer might not wish to make public arguments about the organisation of the business. There may be sensitivities there, as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate.
<P>
It is also conceivable that an employer might not wish information about the number of employees in certain categories&#151;perhaps in the research department&#151;to be made available, on the ground of commercial confidentiality. We expect such cases to be very rare, but in our view it is sensible to give the CAC discretion. It is superfluous to require the consent of the chairman of the CAC or his deputy for private sittings. The chairman of a panel is, by definition, the CAC chairman or a vice-chairman, who is the chairman's deputy, appointed by him to chair the panel. I hope that in the light of that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not wholly satisfied. I have tried to help the Minister with what he said earlier about transparency. I referred at one point to my experience as a member of tribunals. I recall one interesting case in which it bcame necessary, in the interests of justice, to subpoena a witness. That tribunal, which had a national as well as regional remit, had never subpoenaed anyone, and we had to ring up the Lord Chancellor's Department to get advice on how to do so.
<P>
The Minister somewhat deftly elided the argument, by saying that panels may sometimes wish to sit in private. I would not dissent from that, nor from the examples that he gave. We are asking for the additional filter of being able to make a reference not to someone external such as the Lord Chancellor or a High Court judge, but to the chairman of the overall committee. the Minister said that there would probably be a full-time chairman. It will certainly be a highly professional job; no one could do it part-time. If the chairman was not available, his deputy could act as substitute. In the interests of justice, and to put down a marker for the least amount of sitting in private that is appropriate, I am minded to invite my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendment relates to earlier discussions about deciding on the number of members of a panel. There will be occasions, event if it is a three-person panel, when some event or contingency may make it impossible for the three persons to make a decision. Perhaps the most typical reason would be indisposition or illness, or a member's being unavailable on a particular day. Another reason might be that a relevant interest suddenly emerged during the course of the panel's deliberations, so that the panel member concerned would want to stand aside.
<P>
I promise, Mr. Atkinson, that I did not spend my life doing it on purpose, but I remember being empanelled as a member of an Agricultural Lane Tribunal. During the course of some extremely expensive proceedings, which involved a leading silk and a former chairman of the Society of Labour Lawyers, I disqualified myself as a tribunal member by becoming special adviser to the Minister of Agriculture. We had to shuffle very quickly, for the benefit of the parties, to find a way for me to sit so that the panel could conclude its judgement; if we had not, it could have been an extremely expensive business for the parties.
<P>
We have cleared out of the way the fact that the panels will consist of three people and the point about the lack of a natural majority. If it were impossible to make a decision, the chairman would have to make the final decision. I am not sure whether my suggestion is exactly the right way to proceed, but it is worth considering. Such contingencies may arise, and it should be absolutely clear what to do, especially when a reasonably prompt decision is required.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): The hon. Gentleman's experience of tribunals no doubt matches my own, but does he accept that the circumstances that he described would usually have been recognised before the start of the tribunal, and members would be swapped? Such circumstances have been coped with in the past by giving the applicant and the respondent the opportunity to say whether they wish the tribunal to be stopped or, as happens in most cases, to go ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I readily accept that that happens by custom and practice. We are all in the business of trying to get practical decision-making. Will the Minister say whether it is necessary to make special provision along the lines that we suggest in the amendment? I shall cheer him up by saying that it is not one that I shall press to a Division. Do the helpful comments of the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) meet the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> For the record, I confirm that the points raised under amendment No. 128 have been covered by the Minister's earlier response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for raising the matter, and I am about to return the compliment by cheering him up, too. The amendment has made us think again about our proposal, so perhaps we can find a way through an amalgam of the exisiting provisions in section 263 of the 1992 Act and the proposal in clause 23 of the Bill.
<P>
First, I should explain why we departed from the formula in section 263, subsection (4) of which provides that when the CAC cannot reach a unanimous decision, the chairman alone can decide. I believe that that was designed to encourage members of the CAC to reach compromise decisions rather than adopting entrenched positions. Clearly, there is merit in that approach, but it has the disadvantage that it allows the chairman to overrule the other members if he disagrees with them, even if the other members agree with each other.
<P>
Looking at the CAC's new functions and considering the example of determining the bargaining unit, it seemed to us that if the members of the panel, with their experience as employer and trade union representatives agreed that the bargaining unit should be X, the chairman should not be able to override their joint view based on their practical experience, and insist that the bargaining unit should be Y. That is why we preferred the ``opinion of the majority'' formulation in clause 23.
<P>
Having reflected on the amendment, we realised that in some circumstances there might not be a majority in the CAC panel for one course. For example, one member might think that the bargaining unit should be X, while another favoured Y and the third wanted Z. Most decisions on recognition will not fall into that category. The decision on whether a union has 10 per cent. membership and is likely to win a ballot is a simple choice between two options, but other matters, such as the bargaining unit, are potentially more complex and the umpire formula may be appropriate as a means of avoiding deadlock.
<P>
We remain of the view that when there is a majority in favour of one course, that majority should prevail. We are willing to table an amendment, if possible on Report, to provide that when there is no majority the chairman should decide, acting with full powers of an umpire or an oversman&#151;as my hon. Friend the Minister of State would say.
<P>
It seems at first sight that, if we make such an amendment to the proposed new section 263A, we should also make it to the existing section 263. However, I should like the opportunity to reflect further on that point. I hope that, in the light of my assurances, the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It would be churlish if I were not to thank the Minister for flattering us for having spotted that point. I am grateful for his response. It is nice to take part in the constructive improvement of legislation and I shall sit down, quitting while I am ahead. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 14, line 31, at end add&#151;

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall speak now on a more substantive point, although it may not be necessary to do so at length. Concern has been expressed&#151;indeed, it was explicit in some of the things that my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West said&#151;that it might be argued that a culture has grown up in which the Central Arbitration Committee was leaning in one direction or another. I have no evidence of that having taken place in the past and certainly have no wish that it should do so in future. I take the Minister's assurances that he does not want that to happen at their face value.
<P>
To prevent that from happening, it would be helpful if&#151;not necessarily with the formulation that I have given, but in some other form&#151;the CAC could publish the ground rules or the basis under which, to use the Minister's formulation, its panel members will decide whether the bargaining unit should be A, B, C, X, Y or Z, so that some consistency can be established.
<P>
The Minister will rightly say that the tribunal should not be nobbled, that it must consider each case on its merits and that industrial situations vary hugely between industries, sectors, sizes of shops and employment. However, to get the process started it would help practitioners if the committee could publish guidance&#151;with revision as a pattern builds up&#151;on the basis on which it would approach the criteria for making decisions on recognition and derecognition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is likely for efficient running, the CAC will wish to draw up guidelines for its own internal purposes? When the Government get around to legislating on freedom of information, it is likely that such material will have to be in the public domain anyway. They may as well accept my hon. Friend's amendment, so that the committee can formally publish such guidelines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I sympathise with my hon. Friend's comment. It might be a case of the Government getting their retaliation in first, or the committee doing so. When I tabled the amendment, somewhere at the back of my mind was the analogy of the Office of Fair Trading and the Director General of Fair Trading, not that he is directly responsible for, or instructs, its officials. The director general may, and does, issue guidance on matters, for example, in connection with market shares, that establish the ground rules under which he is likely to make decisions and, thus, enable practitioners to know from where such guidance is coming.
<P>
The Minister could save a lot of time through having precluded vexatious or misguided applications if such ground rules could be considered and published so that everyone knows the basis on which the committee intends to operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that the Committee will have realised by now that the Government are in favour of guidance to help people understand and work within the law. However, the amendment proves that it is possible to have too much of a good thing. [Hon Members: ``Surely not.''] Yes, I am afraid so. Of course the Government will produce guidance on the Bill once it is an Act. I imagine that Committee members are already familiar with the extensive guidance material on employment legislation, but if anyone is not, I should be happy to provide examples or indeed a comprehensive selection. Those hon. Members who want to use the internet can find all the information on the DTI's excellent website.
<P>
It will, of course, be a Government priority to produce guidance of the kind that I have mentioned with respect to the Bill after it receives Royal Assent and before its provisions commence. In addition, the Central Arbitration Committee is likely to adopt common rules of procedure and forms of applications. Schedule 1(23), for example, enables the CAC to specify the form of applications and the required accompanying documents.
<P>
Paragraph 85 enables the Secretary of State to issue guidance to the CAC on the way in which it is to exercise its functions under paragraph 14 of the schedule.
<P>
I am not sure whether there is a market opening for any more guidance. Nor do I think that it would be wise for the CAC to issue guidance
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``on the basis on which it will approach the criteria for making decisions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CAC, as we have discussed, is a quasi-judicial body and will need to decide each application on the facts. It could well prove unwise to have issued guidance in the abstract. It might subsequently prove difficult to reconcile that with the facts of a particular case. The CAC would risk inviting applications for judicial review if one of its panels felt the need to depart from such guidance in certain circumstances.
<P>
During our discussion of the Bill, Opposition Members have said much about the risk of unintended consequences. The amendment carries a high risk of unintended consequences. It would put pressure on the CAC to issue guidance even though it was not obliged to do so. It would be better not to present the CAC with such a dilemma. I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thought for a moment that the Minister would persist in the confusion between guidance on procedure and the operation of the Act on the one hand&#151;which is highly desirable, and we commend his efforts to publicise it&#151;and, on the other hand, the guidance proposed under the amendment, for people who might want to know the basis on which they should approach a recognition claim. I am sensitive, although I am not a lawyer, to the legal points that the Minister made about appearing to rig the course. However, it is unfortunate&#151;the point was put to us by lawyers&#151;that no guidance seems to be available on the ground rules. I drew an analogy earlier with the competition legislation, under which the director-general may act as a filter before the final deliberation and decision of the Competition Commission. That filter does not exist in the case that we are considering, although I suppose that ACAS might act as something of a filter. The Minister might want to reflect on whether ACAS, rather than the Central Arbitration Committee, could introduce the advice.
<P>
Rather than press the point now, I shall reflect on the Minister's remarks and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have had an extremely good and constructive rattle round the clause. I want only to make a small point on which the Minister may want to reflect. The new role of the Central Arbitration Committee will clearly be its central role in future, although additional elements may be bolted on, and I noted with concern the Minister's roll-out of the future work programme involving works councils. Nevertheless, an important residual function will remain. I find it confusing, and I suspect that even practitioners may find it confusing that there will be two differenct sets of procedure for applications to the CAC. The procedure that is used will depend on whether the application relates to the statutory recognition&#151;or derecognition&#151;scheme, or whether it relates to arbitration matter such as the provision of information. I am not sure whether it would have been better to relegislate for the whole procedure, and thus to provide for one system. I have no settled view on the matter, but I am anxious to avoid confusion and producing a structure that is less than optimal.
<P>
I do not know whether the problem can be resolved in the Bill or whether objective reasons, other than conservatism with a small ``c'', exist for persisting with the provisions that appeared originally in the Employment Protection Act 1975, and were consolidated in the 1992 Act. I hope that the Minister will consider that point and respond to it.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I agree that we have had a good discussion. The clause has a simple and straightforward purpose. The CAC is currently not required to sit in panels that include a chair, an employer and a trade union representative. However, in practice, that often happens. As part of its new recognition functions, the CAC will be required to adopt the employment tribunal formation of a chair or a deputy chair, a member who has experience of being an employer and a member who has experience as a union representative. That ensures balanced membership, and reinforces other measures that help the CAC to be perceived as an even-handed body.
<P>
The CAC will continue to operate as it does now for its existing functions, dealing with complaints that allege failure to disclose information for collective bargaining, and acting as arbitrator in trade disputes that ACAS refer to it. Formal hearings are conducted by a tripartite panel, but informal, preliminary discussions may be conducted by the chair or deputy chairman alone.
<P>
The hon Member for Daventry asked why there were two different procedures. Complaints about the disclosure of information, as required by section 183 of the 1992 Act, are much less complicated than applications for recognition. They involve fewer quasi-judicial decisions, and such complaints can often be resolved without the need for a formal hearing. The CAC began the last year for which figures are available with 19 references from the previous year, and it received 22 new references. Nineteen cases were withdrawn or otherwise resolved and only three hearings were held.
<P>
We hope that many applications for recognition will be resolved without formal CAC hearings. However, it is likely that there will be a higher percentage of hearings than that which took place under section 183. That higher percentage will need some sort of formal ruling, for example, on the bargaining unit.
<P>
The CAC will also have to ascertain preliminary issues, such as whether an employer has more than 20 employees, whether the union's membership is at least 10 per cent., whether it is likely to win a ballot, and whether a union is already recognised. Employers and employees will wish to be sure that a full panel considers those issues. I hope that that helps to explain the reasons for our method of proceeding.
<P>
The clause also makes two minor amendments to the existing provisions on CAC awards. It extends its existing powers to correct clerical errors and to clarify the interpretation of its awards, and the decisions and declarations that the CAC will make in future in the context of recognition. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 23 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 24</center></H4>
<H4><center>ACAS: general duty</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take new clause 6&#151;General duty of ACAS&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ` . In section 209 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (ACAS's general duty) add at the end ``so far as may be consistent with individual and collective employment rights, and the promotion of an efficient and competitive economy in the United Kingdom''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should explain that if the Committee agrees that clause 24 should stand part of the Bill, I shall not be able to put new clause 6 to the vote because it is incompatible with clause 24. I hope that that is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Hon. Members will know from the explanatory notes to the Bill that clause 24 amends ACAS's general duty by repealing the requirement that it should give priority to its work on disputes resolution. That requirement was much criticised by ACAS and others when it was introduced by the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993. The amended wording of section 209 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, will specify that it is the general duty of ACAS to improve industrial relations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am a little perplexed. I am not trying to trip the Minister up, but my reading of section 209, as amended, is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is the general duty of ACAS to promote the improvement of industrial relations''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister confirm whether that is correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman is correct, and I accept his definition. I will provide confirmation in a moment.
<P>
However, the fundamental point is that the amended wording is in line with our wish to enhance the standing of ACAS's work on dispute prevention. The current wording requires ACAS, in its general duty, to give priority to fire-fighting rather than fire prevention. That does not make sense, especially in the context of our overall approach to industrial relations.
<P>
It is obviously important to settle disputes quickly and effectively. However, surely it is as important to ensure that disputes do not arise in the first place.
<P>
ACAS provides a range of services to employers, workers and unions that can help to prevent disputes. It runs a telephone network which has inquiry points throughout the country and handles about half a million inquiries a year. Every year, ACAS organises hundreds of conferences and workshops on aspects of employment law and good employment practice. It also provides information in the form of handbooks and advisory booklets.
<P>
Those materials and facilities are especially valued by small firms, which do not have in-house personnel specialists. In effect, such firms use ACAS as one of their main sources of advice on employment issues.
<P>
In addition, ACAS provides more intensive advisory services. For example, ACAS is able to provide in-depth advice to organisations with a history of poor labour relations or with a major problem in managing change in the workplace. Such work is undertaken by joint working parties in a non-adversarial atmosphere.
<P>
Under ACAS's guidance, such organisations can identify and resolve their deep-seated problems, thereby establishing a new culture at work. The Bill is intended to assist with that. Such activity can represent vary good value for public expenditure. It is far better to prevent disputes than to suffer the dislocations to an industrial sector or public service that strikes might create.
<P>
Clause 24 makes a small yet important change to ACAS's statutory terms of reference. It has been welcomed by the ACAS council and signals an appreciation of ACAS's work on dispute prevention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> I am sure that Conservative Members wish to join the Minister in his tribute to ACAS. We agree that its work is a very good form of public expenditure.
<P>
The Minister has talked about the Government's wish to enhance ACAS's work and status. Has that translated into the identification of additional resources for ACAS's additional high-profile work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I continue to address clause 24. The Committee is under intense pressure of work, and I do not want to stray.
<P>
New clause 6 is unnecessary and unhelpful. It suggest that ACAS must work to improve industrial relations in a manner that is consistent with employment law. That baffled me. Are Conservative Members seriously implying that ACAS would promote the improvement of industrial relations by encouraging the parties to operate outside the law? ACAS will, of course, ensure that its efforts to improve industrial relations are consistent with the individual and collective rights embodied in the law. I must confess to being surprised by the uncharacteristic, unnecessary and pointless verbiage of the new clause.
<P>
Similarly, ACAS's promotions to improve industrial relations will help to promote a competitive economy in the United Kingdom. I should not need to spell it out at any length that the competitiveness White Paper, which I am always happy to bring to the attention of Opposition Members, has highlighted the fact that a key part of improving the performance of all businesses in this country will be the pomotion of a culture that supports fairness and trust and that creates the right conditions for business success at the workplace. Employers and employees alike recognise that improving industrial relations encourages greater commitment on the part of the work force, greater co-operation and leads to increased productivity and competitiveness.
<P>
On those grounds, I cannot accept the new clause, which unnecessarily complicates ACAS's general duties. Our wording is clearer and simpler.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The structure of the debate means that the Minister has replied before I have made my speech, so perhaps I should now provide some explanation of the new clause.
<P>
Let us start&#151;and, I hope, finish&#151;on a note of consensus. To my hon. Friends and myself, ACAS in practice is a good thing. It is an extremely effective&#151;and cost-effective&#151;organisation. I note in passing the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) about resourcing. We know that extra resources will be required, for example, for the process of conciliation before an employment tribunal. The Minister would be well advised&#151;and would receive Opposition Members' support&#151;if he ensured that ACAS was well set up to discharge its tasks.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> As the Minister responsible for the day-to-day relationship between ACAS and the Department, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we are in the process of a quinquennial review. The review team is working hard and we await the report. One of the issues being considered is the duties that will be placed on ACAS&#151;as well as its general organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a helpful intervention from the Minister. I appreciate that a quinquennial review is not by itself consultative, but I hope that he will take some account of Opposition Members' comments in deciding what is necessary.
<P>
We are talking about a good and delicate job, which cannot be done on the cheap. At the national, regional and local level, ACAS has always been helpful and constructive. It is also helpful to Members of Parliament. My comment to ACAS&#151;I suspect that our debate will find its way to it&#151;is not a criticism, but the organisation should consider raising its profile with the House and others.
<P>
As I said, at the local level, I have found ACAS valuable when I have referred occasional cases involving constituents to it. I became aware of industrial disputes through ACAS and it is good to encourage participation where appropriate. There is no doubt&#151;and no dispute across the Committee&#151;about the general efficacy of ACAS. Of course, the purpose of the new clause is different from that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> In addition to the hon. Gentleman's statement about the efficacy of ACAS and its assistance in disputes, will he join me and other members of the Committee in recommending that ACAS' profile should be raised in relation to its advice service to employers? The advice service is free and all employers can make use of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I could not agree more with the hon. Gentleman that that is extremely important. If the Minister gained the misconception from the wording of the amendment that I sought in any sense to run down the advisory side of ACAS, I would wish to disabuse him of it. Jaw-jaw is much better than war-war and advice, thought and sensible advance planning are much better than allowing the matter to deteriorate or fester and then having to call in ACAS to pull chestnuts out of the fire. That is not an issue across the Committee and nor should it ever be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): In my company I have found ACAS extremely useful. Raising its profile would be excellent so that people who are not aware of its work could know that it is there to help.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is useful. These tripartite messages will help to inform ACAS that we would like to hear more from it. Hon. Members who are not participating in this Committee could benefit from hearing more from it.
<P>
This should be at the upstream end of the process rather that a last resort. I would not dissent from the Minister's comments about that or the overt intentions of his proposals. It is clearly far better to give advice at the beginning. The material that I have seen from ACAS has been sensible and helpful. As the Minister himself said, even, if ACAS cannot replace the human resources departments that small businesses cannot resource, it can provide an alternative method of good practice and good advice.
<P>
The Committee disagrees about none of that. We then come to the issue of a general duties clause. These started to come into favour about 30 years ago. I remember being involved as a briefer on the Countryside Act 1968, which was possibly the first time a general duties clause was imposed on a non-departmental public body or indeed a Ministry. What such a clause should say&#151;and the emphasis that it should give&#151;is always a term of art.
<P>
The only note of dissent I enter at this point is that there is a slight, not ambiguity, but asymmetry in the Government's argument which seems carefully balanced. They say that they want to take out the emphasis on dispute resolution because they want disputes to be prevented. That is entirely consistent with what we have argued. However, there is a slight difference because when a dispute is taking place, it is possible to resolve it. When a dispute has not taken place, it is hard to tell whether that is because it has been prevented. It is a bit like insurance. We do not know what we have prevented.
<P>
I hope that the Minister would not wish to signal that the emphasis he is giving to dispute prevention, which we think is desirable, should be interpreted as meaning that ACAS would want to muscle in on a situation, because it did not like the look of what it saw and could therefore stop it before it happened. The Minister will rightly remind me that ACAS is a body that is invited in and does not force its way in. I just make the point that there is a slight difference between the resolution of disputes that are taking place and the prevention of disputes so that they never take place.
<P>
The other point, which I do not labour, is that the clause was not designed to set in stone the final and total role of ACAS. People think of ACAS as a dispute-solving solution, and a great deal of that concerns individual rights as well as collective rights. ACAS needs that role.
<P>
Secondly, the Bill is about having an efficient United Kingdom. I would agree with the Minister and cite some evidence from the Institute of Personnel and Development that good human relations and training policies will do most businesses far more good than any amount of physical investment. It is the best investment they can make. I am glad to see hon. Members nodding; we need not argue the point.
<P>
The new clause was tabled to make the point that ACAS has a double role. It has a role in individual cases&#151;by reference, as the Minister may remind us, rather than by pushing its way in&#151;and, by being available to give general advice, it has an overall economic role to make this country and its economy more successful and efficient. We are not arguing about that.
<P>
As to what the general duties should be&#151;I slightly corrected by the Minister on the wording of the proposal&#151;in the end the best tunes are the simple tunes, the ones that he and I can remember. As we have been all round the houses, if clause 24 really will state that section 209 of the 1992 Act provides that it is the general duty of ACAS to promote the improvement of industrial relations, that is where we should end up. Therefore, I will not resist clause stand part or press the new clause to a Division.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 25</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abolition of Commissioners</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 14, line 38, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `Provided that the Commissioners described above shall have the right to conclude any cases currently under consideration or brought to their attention before the implementation of this Act, and that the Certification Officer shall have the duty to consider such cases thereafter.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are delighted that you are in the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Atkinson. If Mrs. Dunwoody were here she would not wish me to use Latin, so I shall do so very quickly. The Committee will all be familiar with the formulation of Occam's razor, particularly those who have been trained by the Jesuits. It is of course: entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem&#151;concerning the number of bodies we should not increase their number. That was the spirit in which I gracefully withdrew from our consideration of clause 24 and gave it to the Minister.
<P>
Two bodies are about to be abolished. That is simplication, if not deregulation, and it is music to our ears. The amendment would ensure that the work that they do does not disappear with them. To devolve the powers of the two bodies to the certification officer would be a sensible simplification and may even reduce costs.
<P>
Until I have the Minister's assurance on the matter, I shall not know whether it is stated in small print somewhere that the work of the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members and the Commissioner for Protection Against Unlawful Industrial Action&#151;they are the same person and operate part-time from Warrington&#151;will be transferred. I was in correspondence with the Minister of State about the matter when ``Fairness at Work'' was published and my impression, although I do not have his exact text, is that he said that substantially it would be transferred.
<P>
The two commissioners are concerned with the position of an individual who may feel aggrieved at the conduct of a trade union. Although I accept that practice is incomparably better than it was some years ago, partly because of legislation introduced by the Conservative Government, and although trade unions now function better and&#151;dare I say it&#151;act more in the interests of their members, the commissioners were set up with public money to protect the interests of individual trade unionists.
<P>
It would help if the Minister could tell me that someone who made a complaint to one of the commissioners would not be cut off at the knees by the Bill and told that his complaint would no longer be heard. Can the Minister assure me that if a subsequent case of the same type arose there would be the same entitlement to take up the case, but it would to to the certification officer? If he can assure me on those matters, I will sit down content. We do not want the two bodies to continue if the job can be done more efficiently, but we are anxious to have the Miniser's reassurance that the rights given to individuals to complain abou the conduct of their trade unions are not being surreptitiously withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> I apologise to my hon. Friend the Minister&#151;I will be very brief&#151;but I cannot let the clause go without comment.
<P>
By my calculations, we have now dealt with 10 clauses. Each time, the Opposition have opposed clause stand part or have with varying degrees of reluctance sat silently as we took the vote. I am glad that the hon. Member for Daventry said that the clause was music to Conservative Members' ears, and look forward to their active support on clause stand part.
<P>
The record of the commissioners speaks volumes and makes the case against them. Last year, the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members dealt with 94 calls and 12 applications, two of which were carried over from the previous year. That absorbed a budget of &#163;247,328. I calculate that that is roughly &#163;2,600 per call and &#163;20,000 per application.
<P>
The Commissioner for Protection Against Unlawful Industrial Action was even more profligate and a greater waster of time, dealing with two applications last year. Both were withdrawn, at a cost of &#163;37,345 each.
<P>
The Commissions and commissioners are grotesque, ridiculous, irrelevant and a scandalous waste of public money. They were set up during a period that was an example of the worst political prejudices and the worst Conservative ignorance of trade unions and their members. I want to record my delight in seeing this overdue measure abolish the commissions and commissioners, and I look forward to some support from Opposition Members.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing out so cogently the problems of the existing arrangements and summarising so well why we are making the changes.
<P>
I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for raising the issue of the transitional arrangements that will follow the abolition of the commissioners. I assure him that provisions already exist in the Bill to cover such arrangements. It is intended that the commissioners shall remain in existence to deal with any applications for assistance that they receive before the provisions in the clause come into effect. That will be done by secondary legislation under the transitional and commencement provisions in clause 36.
<P>
The amendment seeks to extend the powers of the certification officer to cover all cases currently covered by both commissioners. I can give the hon. Member for Daventry a lot of comfort on the matter, but I am afraid that I cannot agree with him that such arrangements are necessary.
<P>
We are empowering the certification officer to deal with all cases in which the Commissioner for Rights of Trade Union Members can currently provide material assistance, with the exception of complaints about the misuse of union funds and about alleged breach of law and rule in respect of the authorisation of industrial action and the undertaking of industrial action ballots.
<P>
The certification officer will not be given power to deal with complaints about the misuse of union funds, because he already has powers to investigate and report on that. It would be wrong to extend those powers of investigation to enable him to judge the merits of a case.
<P>
Similarly, giving the certification officer powers to deal with cases involving breaches of law or union rule on the conduct of industrial action ballots would draw him or her into deciding matters that involve relations between employers and unions.
<P>
As for the commissioner for protection against unlawful industrial action. The incidence of unlawfully organised industrial action is very low. There are already provisions in the law to enable employers to take action in cases where it occurs. The commissioner's office has supported only one application in its history, which did not proceed to court. Therefore, there is no demand for its continued existence or for the transfer of its duties to the certification officer.
<P>
The abolition of the commissioner does not extend to removing the right of individuals to obtain an injunction against a union organising unlawful industrial action. I hope that that gives the hon. Member for Daventry some comfort. It simply removes the possibility of public funding for anyone seeking such an injunction. In the light of that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was slightly distressed by the remarks of the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey)&#151;whom we greatly respect for his conciliatory and constructive role in industrial relations&#151;because they were not exactly designed to win friends and influence people. I might have been minded to advise my hon. Friends to vote for the clause; the hon. Gentleman will recall from previous deliberations on employment legislation that I readily do. I am about to move several amendments intended explicity to be trade-union friendly, which, I promise him, I shall not now withdraw. Nevertheless, he puts me off voting for the clause.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman does not understand two points. First, past practice was, to put it delicately, less than ideal. As I acknowledged earlier, that has now been brought into an appropriate relationship between trade unions and their members. Secondly, the relatively few references to restraining public bodies and persons such as commissioners does not mean that they have failed. It may show that the sanctions that they may impose are beginning to have an effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall that the establishment of the office of Commissioner for Protection Against Unlawful Industrial Action was part of the citizens charter? The Labour party, which much mocked it at the time, has now embraced the citizens charter: indeed, the Prime Minister made a passionate speech at the citizens charter awards&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is moving into territory that relates not to the amendment but to a clause stand part debate. I was liberal-minded when the hon. Member for Wentworth spoke, as I felt that that might give the Committee some economy of time. However, if hon. Members would like to debate the wider issues, I ask them to do so in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I had substantially concluded my remarks about the hon. Member for Wentworth, but I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. New Labour is apparently taking over some of the previous Government's interests, such as much of our industrial relations legislation.
<P>
Although the hon. Member for Wentworth did not speak specifically to the amendment, the Minister did, and it has been useful to smoke out the rights and obligations that will be transferred, and to hear his assurances on transitional arrangements. He will recognise that the clause contains some interesting small print. For example, as he said, public funds will no longer be available to an individual who wants to take suit, perhaps with a good case, against a union that behaves unlawfully or encourages its members to do so, which I note with some anxiety. However, rather than press the point now, I shall study the Minister's reply in detail, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I was about to make a speech on clause stand part that mirrored the remarks of the hon. Member for Wentworth. I served on the Committee considering the Bill that set up those commissioners, and well remember speeches from the Minister of State and others then on the Opposition Benches predicting that giving individuals rights to deal with their trade union would result in the commissioner's receiving a flood of foolish and silly claims.
<P>
Trade unions, by and large are law-abiding organisations. When we legislate, saying, ``You have a right, Mr. trade union member, to take action against unfair treatment by your own trade union'', generally, the union will say, ``Whoa, you can't do this, as you might have previously, because there is now a commissioner to protect the individual trade unionist.''
<P>
In the past, the individual trade unionist had no power. He could be ostracised at the workplace, and it was ridiculous that he had to pay his own expenses to attempt to sue a huge trade union. So in some ways we have been proved right, in that the commissioners have not been used in a foolish way.
<P>
Even more have we been proved right in that a Labour Government have gone through the schedule thinking about what an individual trade unionist might suffer at the hands of his union, and set up in schedule 4 a list of what might have been done to him, and what provisions clause 25 contained.
<P>
I am slightly saddened that the Minister decided not to transfer the functions of the Commissioner for Protection against Unlawful Industrial Action. But I suppose that one could say that the office has been largely de minimis. The Minister explained again that an employer, by using his own funds&#151;after all, an employer perhaps has easier access to funds than an individual trade unionist&#151;would be able to take a trade union to court, and I hope that that never changes. We could not allow a clause that will abolish the two offices to go through without recording the fact that they have helped, I believe, to give the unions back to the trade unionists. Moreover, I am certain that the number of working days lost through strike action has decreased considerably because of legislation that our Government introduced.
<P>
Lest members of the Committee think that I do not have an interest in trade unions settling without striking, let me tell them a little tale. I used to work for a company called Haverhill Meat Products, which was owned by Sainsbury's. Basically, its job was to take pigs in at one end and send bacon out at the other. Whenever there was a strike, the work study officers&#151;the time and motion men&#151;were volunteered by the management to go down and supervise unslaughtered pigs being removed from the plant, and to get in and clean up the layerage&#151;the area where the pigs wait.
<P>
Now, pigs do what pigs do when they get to a place after a long lorry journey. We had to shovel out the remains of what the pigs left behind. That was a real incentive for ensuring that when we introduced incentive schemes for employees, we did so in a way that would not cause a strike, otherwise we would have been down there clearing out the layerage. I have some experience of that. I am extremely glad that Conservative legislation, which gave back rights to trade unionists and allowed them to feel that they had the right to take action, will be consolidated in schedule 4, and that new Labour has accepted sensible Conservative policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The clause provides for the abolition of the offices of Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members and Commissioner for Protection against Unlawful Industrial Action.
<P>
The first commissioner's main function has been to provide material assistance to a trade union member taking legal proceedings against his union for breach of certain duties imposed by statute or for certain breaches of the union's rule book. The second commissioner's function has been to provide material assistance to a person seeking an order against a trade union to stop unlawfully organised industrial action which prevents or threatens to prevent the supply of goods or services to that person. For both bodies, assistance usually takes the form of paying for legal advice or meeting legal costs.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth pointed out, since its inception in 1988, the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members has assisted only 10 applicants a year on average, whereas the other commissioner has assisted only one since the office was created in 1993. In the circumstances, we consdider that the commissioners are superfluous to the orderly conduct of employment relations and represent an inefficient use of public funds. Their abolition will create a net saving in public expenditure. I can sum up our interesting debate on the rights and wrongs of previous legislation by saying that we are getting rid of an inefficient, costly system and replacing it with an informal, accessible system which is tried and tested and is trusted for its impartiality and the quality of its decision-making.
<P>
Protections will remain. We propose to extend and redefine the role of Certification Officer to empower him to adjudicate disputes between individual trade unionists and their unions in relation to many of those areas where the CRTUM can currently provide assistance. The Certification Officer is well respected and already provides an accessible alternative to the courts to resolve disputes involving trade unions. The extension of the Certification Officer's powers is in line with the Government's wish to encourage potential litigants&#151;in any branch of the civil law&#151;to use practical alternatives to court proceedings to resolve their disputes. That saves court time and often produces quicker, cheaper and more effective remedies for the parties concerned.
<P>
The right of individuals to obtain an injunction against a union organising unlawful industrial action&#151;the so-called citizen's right&#151;will remain. However, the abolition of the CPAUIA will remove the possibility of public funding for anyone seeking such an injunction&#151;although since the right was introduced in 1993, nobody has applied to the courts for such an injunction. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 26 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 59, line 2, after second `member', insert `in good standing'.
<P>
I had two considerations in tabling the clutch of amendments on the schedule. First, it is wrong as a matter of principle both to let schedules, with their acres of small print, pass without several debates on them and to suggest to the outside world that we find it too difficult to have a cursory look at them. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset said, the legislation represents the Government's codification and acceptance of the previous Government's advances in the field of industrial relations.
<P>
Secondly, if Labour Back Benchers have read the schedule, why have they not tabled the sort of amendments that we have? On my informal score-card of the four amendments&#151;Nos. 136, 137, which is grouped with 138 because it has the same effect, 139 and 140&#151;two might be seen as explicitly pro-trade union and two are no less than neutral towards trade unions. In the absence of any amendments from Labour Back-Benchers, I offer them to the Committee&#151;in an effort to highlight several issues and possibly to improve the Bill. Given the limited time available, I shall speak in as brisk and business-like manner as I can.
<P>
The amendment would restrict the power to take up an order, or to make a complaint about its non-enforcement, to those members of a union who are in good standing. We will discuss that issue&#151;on which I have tabled an amendment to schedule 1&#151;to smoke out concerns that trade union membership is not always what it ought to be. Schedule 4 makes it a specific requirement for trade unions to prepare lists of their members' names and addresses for the certification officer to draw on if necessary
<P>
Some may worry that trade unions may have, as they certainly used to have, shadow, phoney or phantom members. The amendment, which is meant to be helpful to the unions, seeks to make it clear that people who are only nominal members of a trade union&#151;they may, for example, have been entered in the union's register but have never paid a due or are late in paying; they would be freeloading on the union&#151;should not be entitled to say, ``I am a member of the union, and I shall take it to court to get an order enforced.'' That action should be available only to people who are ``in good standing'' as members of the union. It is no more or less than that, and I hope that the Minister will respond accordingly.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The purpose of this part of the schedule is to ensure that union members can use the Certification Officer as an accessible means of enforcing their entitlements in respect of their union's register of members' names and addresses. They can ensure that their union compiles such a register in accordance with the law. It is of particular significance that union members can enforce their entitlement to check whether their own circumstances are accurately recorded.
<P>
If the Certification Officer issues an order in respect of a breach of those statutory requirements, any member of the union, or anyone who was a member of the union when the order was made, can enforce the order through the courts. That is a sensible and democratic measure, which permits any union member to ensure that the union has complied with court orders. It ensures that unions are accountable to their members.
<P>
The amendment broadly supports that approach. However, it also seeks to narrow the definition of those who were members when the order was made who can seek enforcement orders from the courts. According to the amendment, only those members who are ``in good standing'' can apply for orders. Despite the attempts of the hon. Member for Daventry, it is unclear what that phrase means. Does it mean that a member had fully paid his subscriptions, or only partly paid them? Does it mean that he has been in breach of other union rules or subject to union discipline? Does it have some other entirely different meaning, perhaps related to the union member's standing in the community. That lack of clarity poses a real problem, and it opens the way for what we believe would be completely unnecessary legal action being taken to establish whether a member had ``good standing''.
<P>
It is not clear whether the amendment deals with a recognisable problem. Unions have rules that define who are and who are not members. In particular, they often state that when an individual's membership lapses, because he has failed to pay his subscription, he is no longer a member. If an individual breaks the rules, it follows that he is not a member of the union. In those circumstances, the individual cannot apply for an order because he or she is not a union member.
<P>
The Government therefore do not support the amendment, because its effect is unclear, because it would complicate the process and because the problem that it seeks to address does not exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am a little disappointed at the Minister's reply. I wanted to help the Minister and trade unionists&#151;especially the latter&#151;by trying to avoid the problem of free-loaders. I do not believe that it is beyond the wit of man, or of the parliamentary draftsman, to come up with a formulation that made it clear what I meant by my rather shorthand and elliptic phrase.
<P>
However, our exchange has been useful in smoking out something from the Minister. He may not wish to respond, but I shall tell the Committee how I interpret what he said, which is that if there were an evidential dispute as to whether a member of a union was a member&#151;I described it as being ``in good standing''&#151;the Certification Officer or, if the alterntive route of the courts had been chosen, a judge, would look at the circumstances of the case and make a preliminary ruling, against a possible objection by the union, that the member might not be a member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, in practice, the Certification Officer would look at the union's rule book, which defines membership quite specifically? The lodging of the rule book with the certification officer is one of the prime duties of unions. The amendment would add another possible layer of confusion on a common trade union practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; I defer to his knowledge of industrial relations and industrial law. He is right that the rule book would be the main determinant. I am not a lawyer and neither, I suspect, is the hon. Gentleman. However, a common law judgment might be taken in some cases, which would have to be taken by the courts rather than by the certification officer, as to whether the facts of the case indicated that someone was a member of a union. We need not debate that nice point of law now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Just for clarity, I should tell the hon. Gentleman that such a situation does not often arise. It normally arises when a union member contests his trade union's refusal to provide him with legal assistance. In such cases, I am not aware of its having not been decided by the courts as part of the legal proceedings relating to what is normally a personal injury claim. Again, the amendment is superfluous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; this is a genuine and useful clarificatory exercise. There may be some difficulty, which I flag up; the certification officer might not be equiped, or it might not be appropriate, to decide a preliminary point of law on membership before deciding whether he could hear a case of objection through non-compliance with an order, the point to which the amendment is latched.
<P>
It has been useful to rehearse the issue. The Minister has probably substantively answered our concern. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amentment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 60, line 8, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any similar or related failure'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 138, in page 60, line 11, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any similar or related failure'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This debate may be even briefer than the last. Our concern is simply that the schedule gives a complainant the option of routes&#151;either the certification officer or the court. That is mirrored in several other cases of industrial relations and employment practice, and I have no objection to it. We are worried, however, that it would fail to prevent what the lawyers call double jeopardy.
<P>
It would all be clear if a complaint was set out in exactly the same terms to one or the other. The schedule allows either one route or the other. I want the Minister to consider what might happen if a complainant, who may well be vexatious, makes a second complaint that is not expressed in exactly the same terms. He may say, ``Ah, this is different. This is a new complaint against my union. I did not get on very well with the certification officer, so I shall have a punt in the court.''
<P>
jf1That, I hope, would be untypical, but in seeking to get the legislation right, I am anxious that we should at least be able to take a view on cases that are, to put it simply, as near as damn it the same, but that are not expressed in quite the same way. A court may be able to ask quite readily whether the certification officer had considered the case. If it decided that it was substantially the same case, it could strike it out.
<P>
I am not sure whether the certification officer would have the legal competence to be able to say the same as the court. It is a matter of symmetry, and of trying to avoid frustrating and vexatious situations that are not fully embraced in the wording of the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Throughout the schedule, we have ensured that individuals cannot take parallel proceedings with the Certification Officer and the courts about complaints relating to the same alleged failure. Individuals must decide at the outset whether they wish to use the courts or the Certification Officer; they cannot use both, because that would obviously be a waste of public funds.
<P>
As I understand the amendments, the hon. Member for Daventry accepts our approach. Indeed, the purpose of the amendments is the extent of the prohibition. Our proposals will simply stop a complainant taking up a case relating to the same alleged failure with both the courts and the certification officer. The hon. Gentleman wants to extend the provision by including a prohibition on complaints relating to similar or related failures.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's objectives. We recognise the problem of vexatious litigants that he has highlighted. We are considering how to protect the certification officer from vexatious litigants, and we might table an amendment at a later stage. However, we must proceed with care. Prohibiting access to the certiifcation officer or to the courts is a very serious matter. We must protect basic human rights and preserve essential freedoms relating to access to justice.
<P>
We share the same basic objective: we want to avoid duplication and unnecessary legal action. However, the amendments present problems. It is one thing to prevent the same complaint from being heard twice; it is quite another to prevent a different case&#151;albeit a similar or related one&#151;from being heard. That would constitute a major limitation on an individual's basic freedoms and rights of access to justice. Indeed, it could easily be portrayed as an infringement of a basic human right, and as such could breach the European convention on human rights.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the Secretary of State has made a statement, which is printed on the front of the Bill, that it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``compatible with the Convention rights''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments could breach that convention, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment; we cannot support it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was a satisfactory reply, and I ask for no more now. Perhaps the certification officer or the court would be given the option of ruling that a particular case is vexatious so that it could be struck out. That ruling would be appealable to a higher court, or to the tribunal in the case of the certification officer. I share the Minister's concerns and sensitivities and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 64, line 42, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(9) Any appeal against such an order made by the Certification Officer under this section on a matter of law shall lie to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure whether this is the right place in the Bill to raise this issue. It is inevitable, when considering schedules, that eventually the print starts to swim before our eyes, and we cannot even remember where we have got to. That might be a problem for others; it certainly is for me.
<P>
I have tied the point that I want to make to paragraph 17, on the amalgamation or transfer of engagements. I am trying to smoke out the facts. On my cursory reading, this seems to be the only case in which no appeal to the tribunal will be allowed against a decision taken by the certification officer. Are there other such cases? Will it be the general practice that matters undertaken by the certification officer should be appealable to the employment appeals tribunal?
<P>
Given the Minister's reply to the previous debate, it is clear that we do not disagree about the need to secure justice. The hon. Member for Wentworth is not here at the moment, but we want to put the emphasis on resolving disputes informally, or less formally, rather than on using the full fury and force of the law. We also want to ensure that the decisions taken by the certification officer on matters of law are appealable to the tribunal. That will be fair to all the parties involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The Government have no difficulty with the amendment. Of course, trade union members should have the right to appeal against decisions taken by the Certification Officer in respect of the law on union mergers. The law already allows for such a right of appeal to the employment appeals tribunal. Section 104 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An appeal lies to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, at the instance of the complainant or the trade union, on any question of law arising in any proceedings before, or arising from any decision of, the Certification officer under section 103.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Section 103 is the part of the 1992 Act that confers powers on the Certification Officer to hear complaints from union members on alleged breaches of the law on union mergers.
<P>
We have, unintentionally, drawn the employment appeals tribunal powers too widely. The Bill, as currently drafted, provides that appeals can be made to it against the Certification Officer's decisions on administrative matters, as well as on members' complaints. That is unnecessary. We shall table amendments to restrict the tribunal's role to appeals against the Certification Officer's decisions on members' complaints. I hope that in the light of my remarks, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The general point about whether there is a lacuna that is not covered by section 103 of the 1992 Act when the Certification Officer takes decisions and whether such decisions should be appealable is perhaps something that the Minister may like to consider at leisure with his officials. As he has given a satisfactory assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 140, in page 66, line 38, after `breach', insert `within a reasonable time'.
<P>
The amendment would allow a reasonable time to remedy a breach. As we have said, we are not in the world of abuse of membership and trade union power that sadly characterised and scarred some trade unions a generation ago. But in cases when a breach does arise, a union should have a reasonable period&#151;such period that could be judged reasonable in court&#151;for repairing that breach, rather than suggesting that it is necessary to remove every last instance of the breach immediately, or in a way that is not in the interests of the union's members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We have no objection in principle to setting deadlines. However, it would be wrong to leave it to the unions to decide when to comply with the Certification Officer's orders, as that could encourage inactivity or procrastination. The hon. Gentleman should note that deadlines are addressed in our proposals. Subsection (4) of proposed new section 108B uses the same form of words that is used when a court makes an order, such as in section 81. The wording does not state explicitly that such deadlines should be reasonable. We leave it to the good sense and experience of the Certification Officer to decide what the deadlines should be, and there is no reason to believe that he would set unreasonable deadlines.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. It would introduce an explicit reasonableness test, with the Certification Officer setting deadlines. There are many interpretations of the word ``reasonable''. Unions might argue for one period and the complainant for another, which would open the door for further legal wrangling. We want to avoid creating additional grounds for dispute or appeal against the certification officer's orders. In the light of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman can see his way clear to withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for signposting the relevant provision under the schedule that will enable the Certification Officer to set deadlines. He will know, as a matter of administrative law, that being a public official, the Certification Officer is required at all times to act reasonably anyway. The Minister is nodding.
<P>
I agree with the Minister that it is not necessary to introduce into the schedule a specific provision as the amendment would do, but our debate and earlier exchanges have proved that we were right to question the small print and elicit encouraging ministerial assurances. Perhaps we should end our debate on that friendly note. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
