<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000312"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I would like to deal with some domestic matters
and make a few preliminary announcements. Members may remove their
jackets during Committee sittings to ensure that they are attentive and
comfortable at all times. Members should ensure that mobile phones,
pagers, BlackBerrys and other electronic gadgets are turned off or
switched to silent during Committee sittings&#151;I feel that
strongly and say it forcefully. There are money resolutions and Ways
and Means resolutions related to the Bill, and copies are available in
the Room.</div>
<a name="09012774000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
Members that adequate notice of amendments should be given: to be
eligible for selection at a Tuesday sitting, amendments must be tabled
by the rise of the House the previous Thursday; and for a Thursday
sitting, they must be tabled by the previous Monday. As a general rule,
my fellow Chairman, Mr. Hugh Bayley, who is sitting to my
right, and I do not intend to call starred amendments. I hope that that
is carefully noted by all Members, particularly by the political
parties.</div>
<a name="09012774000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not everyone
is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public Bill
Committees, so it might be helpful if I briefly explained how we will
proceed. This morning, the Committee will first be asked to consider
the programme motion, which is on the amendment paper and for which
debate is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to
report written evidence, then a motion to permit the Committee to
deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence sessions, which I
hope we will be able to take formally. I will then ask members of the
public to leave us briefly. Assuming that the second motion is agreed
to, the Committee will then move into private session. After we have
deliberated, witnesses and members of the public will be invited back
and the oral evidence session will commence at approximately 11
o&#146;clock.</div>
<a name="09012774000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give the
spokesman for Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition due notice that, with
regard to oral evidence, I will call him first to question our
witnesses. If the Committee agrees to the programme motion, it will
hear oral evidence today and on Thursday then revert next week to the
more traditional&#151;I was going to say &#147;familiar&#148;,
but I prefer &#147;traditional&#148;&#151;proceedings of
clause-by-clause scrutiny.</div>

David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): It is always a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas, and to
debate with the Minister. We have previously debated measures in
Standing Committee and in Statutory Instrument Committee, and we have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>always had a fruitful and businesslike way of
dispatching business. I hope that that continues, but I have some
comments to
make.</div><a name="09012774000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is important, and Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition are supportive
of some of its principles. However, there are also some thorny
questions about how the clauses will operate in practice, so it is
incumbent on us to test carefully and scrutinise in detail the way in
which many of those well-meant clauses would operate. In my judgment
police reform is not thoroughly covered in part 1, and there are some
omissions. I understand, and the Minister will no doubt remind us, that
the announcements in the Green Paper have been carried through,
particularly in relation to targets and the policing pledge. Changes in
primary legislation are not needed to effect those&#151;we understand
that.</div>
<a name="09012774000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
might also be said of reforms to Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of
constabulary. However, it is disappointing not to see in the
legislative programme&#151;and certainly not in the
Bill&#151;important changes to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984 which would, if brought in quickly, ensure that more police time
would be spent on the street. I shall not detain the Committee, but an
important consultation was launched by the Minister&#146;s
predecessor in March 2007&#151;it went to two consultations&#151;on
reforming the Act.</div>
<a name="09012774000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000317"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I hesitate to stop the Opposition
spokesman, but this is a programme motion. We should not be going into
the substance of the Bill. I should like to establish with all members
of the Committee, right at the outset, that my fellow Chairman, Hugh
Bayley, and I are very much on the ball. We are following what is going
on, not just sitting here. If hon. Members go off the subject and are
not speaking either to the Bill or to the relevant amendment,
we shall quickly remind them.</div>
<a name="09012774000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000318"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Your strictures are taken into account, Sir
Nicholas. I shall move on to say that part 1 contains police reform
provisions, which need adequate time for debate; where the Bill deals
with police reform, in a way that does not involve reform of the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the provisions partly contentious. The
clauses on the senior appointments panel and on collaboration&#151;a
hugely important issue&#151;will require the Committee&#146;s time,
although not to oppose the principle of the reform of
arrangements to facilitate collaboration. With your permission, Sir
Nicholas, I stress that while some of the issues in part 1 and other
provisions are, in principle, not inimical to the Conservative
position&#151;some of the principles are sound&#151;the manner in
which the clauses have been drafted prompt many questions. I am sure,
Sir Nicholas, that you would not want us just to rubber-stamp things
that look okay on the face of it. That is not the case in relation to
collaboration or the senior appointments panel in part 1, nor is it the
case in relation to part 2, which deals with sex offences and has some
important aims. However, as we shall hear from witnesses, and as we
shall tease out in future sittings, the drafting of part 2 is
incredibly contentious both for support groups that want to help
vulnerable sex workers and victims in the sex industry, and for the
bodies responsible for clamping down on trafficking. Those important
issues are not contentious in principle, but their
implementation under the Bill is contentious.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="09012774000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same can
be said of alcohol misuse and the proceeds of crime in part 4. The
Opposition are tough on serious organised crime, and tough on
terrorism, so the reform of the proceeds or assets from crime regime
has our general support. The way in which those provisions will be
implemented, however, is quite another question, and it must be teased
out in full, not truncated, debate. Finally, aviation security, about
which we shall hear more in our evidence-taking session, raises all
kinds of questions for industry at a time at which the recession is
biting. We certainly want to see what the balance is between better
security arrangements, if that is what the clauses deliver, and the
cost of implementing them. On the face of it, the programme motion
appears to provide adequate time for hon. Members to debate important
clauses in an important Bill, but I, for one, am not keen to truncate
or cut short any of our sittings, and I expect that they will all be
needed adequately to scrutinise the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09012774000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000319"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call Paul Holmes to speak on behalf of
the Liberal Democrats, may I make the same observation that I made
during the Programming Sub-Committee discussions? In its Tuesday and
Thursday afternoon sittings, the Committee has the opportunity to sit
rather longer than has become the custom. If there is a
problem&#151;if we are behind and there are issues that the
Opposition parties want to debate at greater length&#151;I remind
Members that those sittings provide the opportunity for
longer-than-normal debates. I urge Members to take advantage of that
provision.</div>
<a name="09012774000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012774000320"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): May I welcome the way in which
the Committee has begun proceedings under your chairmanship, Sir
Nicholas, both this and last week, and the good signals sent out by the
way in which the Government and the Opposition parties consulted last
week, both informally and in the Programming Sub-Committee, to try to
expedite business? Hopefully, that is a good sign of things to come in
the forthcoming sittings. Following our debates and conversations last
week, I am happy with the programme motion. The only thing that I would
like to ask of the Minister is whether we managed to arrive at a
resolution of the issue raised last Thursday in the Programming
Sub-Committee about the clash between business in the Chamber and
business in our Committee next Tuesday, and whether a rearrangement has
been possible. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West
and Abingdon wishes to raise the issue of proceedings on Report, after
we have finished our consideration in Committee, but that is all that I
wish to say.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000321"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am happy to call the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon, so long as the matter is entirely relevant to the
programme
motion.</div><a name="09012774000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012774000322"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): When going
through clauses in Committee, an important issue is the commitment to
return to something on Report. It would help us if we knew that there
was a commitment from all parties to come back to those matters on
Report, and we always look to your guidance, Sir Nicholas, on whether
we are debating the matter exhaustively or prematurely before other
Members of the House have a chance to give their views. That matter 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>was raised in business questions last Thursday.
Generally speaking, there is sufficient time on Report to deal with
anything that emerges from a Committee&#146;s deliberations, but
there are eight substantive parts to this Bill that we have to get
through according to the timetable. That suggests that eight groups of
amendments might emerge on Report, and I have never known eight groups
to be addressed on Report in one day. To aid us in our deliberations
according to this timetable, will the Minister indicate whether we are
likely to get that and whether he will hold open the opportunity for us
to have sufficient time on Report to debate, in particular, Government
amendments in response to points we raise that are restricted by the
timetabling motion? That would aid the Committee&#146;s debates and
considerations.</div>
<a name="09012774000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000323"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman and ask the Minister
to respond to that point in particular. Sadly, matters relating to
Report are not in the hands of Committee Chairmen, but rest with the
Speaker, the Deputy Speakers and the Leader of the
House.</div><a name="09012774000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000324"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I again thank members of the Committee for the way
in which they have begun deliberations, and I thank Mr.
Ruffley for his comments. He and I have worked together on several
Committees, as he said, and I have also worked with Mr.
Brokenshire. We have at times had fervent and passionate disagreements,
but only when fervent and passionate disagreement was needed and
because we believed in the arguments&#151;that is unlike the
grandstanding that sometimes takes place. Hopefully, that will help
proceedings in this Committee.</div>
<a name="09012774000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to
Mr. Ruffley, and partly in answer to Dr.
Harris&#146;s question, that we will always consider ideas that
emerge as we go through the Bill and that appear to be sensible. I know
that Mr. Campbell and Mr. Fitzpatrick are of the
same view. I cannot always guarantee that we will accept an amendment,
but as Members know, I have at times changed certain things in Bills in
that way, not only in Committee, but on Report.</div>
<a name="09012774000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order that
the Committee&#146;s proceedings are meaningful, I intend to address
any good ideas that Members come up with, as it has always seemed to me
ridiculous not to include a good idea at some stage. The point of the
Committee is to improve and adapt the Bill, notwithstanding the fact
that there are sometimes disagreements. I hope that that is helpful to
Dr. Harris, Mr. Ruffley and other members of the
Committee.</div>

how much time will be available on Report, but I, like everyone else,
want an appropriate amount, because, as Dr. Harris will know, if
matters need to be brought back on Report, I bring them back. If
necessary, we will try to ensure that sufficient time is
available.</div><a name="09012774000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the debates on the police grant and the local
government grant will be held on the afternoon of Tuesday 3 February,
but that is not yet 100 per cent. certain. The usual
channels will keep it under review and, if necessary, bring forward an
agreed amendment so that we do not lose any time if it is necessary to
change the timings on the programme motion in the sub-committee. To be
fair both to Mr. Ruffley, given the amount of time he would
spend on his feet, and to me, given the amount of time I would spend on
my feet, I hope that the usual channels will consider us 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>in their deliberations. The commitment to the Committee is that, if we
do need to change the business that afternoon, we will obviously do it
with the agreement of the Committee, but in such a way that no time is
lost.</div><a name="09012774000032"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
1</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000330"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Good morning. I would like to ask Sir Norman
about the principle of collaboration in this Bill, making it easier for
forces to collaborate, which you should be aware has cross-party
support. However, the history of voluntary collaboration is not
particularly a success story, which is why we have these clauses. Do
you believe that the provisions in this Bill would allow a Home
Secretary, whether Labour, Liberal Democrat or Conservative, to divide
up the country on a regional or sub-regional basis and say to a cluster
of forces, &#147;You have not been collaborating well and have been
dragging your feet. There have been personality clashes between police
authorities, and we Ministers are determined to make collaboration
work.&#148;? Could a Home Secretary in effect mandate the five forces
and give them a lead force to collaborate on whatever five things they
think should be imposed, whether IT procurement, non-IT procurement or
fixed-wing helicopters, and then impose that on the five forces that
they think are dragging their feet? Speaking for ACPO, do you think
that that can be delivered by the clause and, more importantly, that it
is desirable for Ministers to mandate in that
way?</div><a name="09012774000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Norman Bettison:</b></i> My interpretation is that, because
of the way the Bill is drafted, that could be the ultimate end of the
spectrum of influence. The Bill will place requirements on chief
constables and chairs of police authorities and contains various nudges
and pushes that could be used before the point of mandation was
reached.</div>
<a name="09012774000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing that the Committee might like to think about is that it seems to
ACPO that at the mandation end of the spectrum there would come some
transfer of accountability, which currently is fairly and squarely on
the shoulders of individual chief constables in all operational
matters. If they choose to collaborate, that accountability remains
with them collectively, but it seems to ACPO that the Bill will create
several clauses that will encourage, nudge and push them towards
collaboration. Our reading of the Bill is that ultimately the Home
Secretary, who currently has the power, will have a mechanism by which
to mandate collaboration.</div>
<a name="09012774000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">ACPO sees
collaboration not as an end in itself, which we are in danger of
lighting upon, but as a means to an end&#151;a means of providing
either more effective policing services at the serious and strategic
end of our business, or creating more cost-effective services by
collaborating on procurement and back-office
services.</div><a name="09012774000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000331"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Do you see a problem with police authorities
buying into more collaboration, because for collaboration to take place
there needs to by a buy-in from the chief constables of the forces that
might be part of a regional or sub-regional collaboration and from
police authorities? Why has the record been so dismal, taking the whole
of England and Wales, when it comes to collaboration for the right end,
which is squeezing efficiencies that mean more money for the front
line? Is it to do with clashes between police authorities or
disagreements between police authorities and chief constables? Is that
a fair characterisation?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div><a name="09012774000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Norman Bettison:</b></i> No, that is not a
fair characterisation. Chief constables and police authorities often
see the benefit of collaboration. The problems are threefold. The first
problem is that the current 43 police forces have differential and
variable costs, so collaborating on an issue is rarely a fair and
equitable discussion, because different authorities and police forces
have different costs sunk in operations, equipment or plant. The second
problem is that there is variability in the vision of priorities. For
example, I am the chief constable of a large metropolitan police force
that is prepared to stand up and say that it has a problem with
serious and organised crime. When engaging with colleagues in
neighbouring forces and police authorities in more rural areas, we
often have different priorities. It might be for the general good to
collaborate on serious and organised crime, but there are different
views on the
priorities.</div><a name="09012774000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third problem, which is probably driven by the first two, is something
that I refer to as the net donor syndrome. Every individual force and
authority imagines that they will contribute to a collaboration and
that they will be a net donor. If I were chief or chair of a big force,
I might consider that my current assets would be diluted. If I were
chief or chair of a smaller force, I might consider that my
contribution would be sucked into the bigger metropolitan
forces.</div><a name="09012774000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Along
with a tendency towards local sovereignty, those three problems are
barriers to the voluntary end of collaboration. For the greater good,
there must be some nudges, pushes and pulls within the
process.</div><a name="09012774000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000332"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Can I take it from that that ACPO would not
object to mandation by Ministers&#151;whoever they may be&#151;at
the extreme end of the scale and that some forces would have to take it
on the chin? Is it fair to say that ACPO would say that mandation by
Ministers will deliver the benefits that the amalgamation and merger
process would have
delivered?</div><a name="09012774000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Norman Bettison:</b></i> The strategic threats and risks that
mergers were intended to address are still present in policing. ACPO
believes that collaboration around some of those risks would be a good
thing. We see mandation as the extreme end of the spectrum. The Bill
allows for consultation, discussion and negotiation with chief
constables and chairs of police authorities before that point is
reached. I ought to answer your question directly, however. If ACPO is
convinced of the general good, we are prepared to concede to mandation.
ACPO would be vociferous in pointing out to Ministers of any hue where
the common good was being compromised rather than
advantaged.</div><a name="09012774000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000333"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Although we want to make progress,
Mr. Ruffley, do you want to put a similar question to Dave
Whatton for a brief answer, because he represents a rather different
police authority to Sir
Norman?</div><a name="09012774000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000334"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I know that Mr. Whatton has had
experience of this matter as deputy chief constable of Greater
Manchester police. I do not wish to hog the Committee&#146;s time and
will allow other hon. Members to ask questions. However, I have a final
question for Sir
Norman.</div><a name="09012774000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is fairly well known that quite a few chief constable posts do not
attract many applicants. I can think of two examples having met the new
chief constables of Thames 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>Valley police and Lincolnshire police. This is no
reflection on the incumbents because I regard them both highly, but
they were the sole applicants for those incredibly important jobs. Will
the clauses on reforming the senior appointments panel really effect
the step change that is required to get more high-potential officers
into chief constable
jobs?</div><a name="09012774000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Norman Bettison:</b></i> Not unless the intention is to mimic
the military approach of moving people to posts around the country
against their will. For that reason, ACPO does not necessarily think
that the senior appointments panel measures should be contained in
primary legislation. The aims of the senior appointments panel are
supported by ACPO. However, unless talent management is taken to the
extent of directing who applies for which jobs&#151;there are
personal and domestic barriers against doing so&#151;it is not clear
that the senior appointments panel arrangements will affect the number
of people applying for particular posts. Many different reasons play
into this. First, the differential between deputy chief constable pay
in a larger force and chief constable pay can be so small that moving
family and house makes no sense.</div>
<a name="09012774000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
imposition of a five-year fixed term appointment on postings affects
the number of people applying for particular posts. Officers are very
careful these days to ask themselves, &#147;Is a five-year window
appropriate for me at this particular time in that particular
place?&#148; Because it could be that, at the end of that five-year
fixed-term appointment, they will be left somewhere high and dry where
they do not want to be and, possibly, before reaching pensionable age.
So, the constraints in previous legislation that have been placed on
the employment of chief constables and deputy chief constables are in
themselves a barrier to free movement.</div>

5</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000335"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> That is a very elegant exposition of the advice
and lobbying that I have had. Finally, from what you have said, the
clause on reform of the senior appointments panel clearly does not

6</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000336"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> We have just heard an exchange on the new power in
the Bill for Ministers to compel and direct collaboration. How does
that tie in with another new power in the Bill, which is the
requirement that police authorities have regard for the views of local
people? Can there not be a tension there? From my discussions with him,
I know that Mick Creedon, the chief constable of Derbyshire, who is
giving evidence to the Committee later, says that, in the east midlands
area, collaboration is going ahead very well, but there are tensions in
that you have to put resources and manpower into matters such as
terrorism, serious and organised crime, internet paedophilia or
whatever the issues are. However, locally, as I know from police
authority meetings and residents&#146; meetings, people say,
&#147;We want more police on the beat.&#148; In the event of such
competing directions, the Bill says that we must have regard to what
local people say, for example about police on the beat, and to what
Ministers might be directing in relation to collaboration. How do you
square that circle?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div><a name="09012774000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000337"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Holmes, are you addressing this
to Sir Norman or will you broaden it to Bob Jones of the Association of
Police Authorities and Dave Whatton from
Cheshire?</div><a name="09012774000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000338"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Initially, I address it to Sir Norman, while he is
on a roll, because it ties in with the previous answer. Then,
obviously, it would be interesting to hear from the APA on that
one.</div><a name="09012774000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Norman Bettison:</b></i> The Government, in both the Green
Paper and this Bill, have made it clear that local policing, as
constructed around 43 separate police forces, is here to stay. There
are all sorts of drivers towards the local, including the
accountability to local people that you describe, but also funding
decisions, the raising of local council tax and the accountability for
the expenditure of local money. In a sense, if one is keeping 43 police
forces, something is needed to catalyse the integration of policing
services beyond the local. The collaboration clauses that are contained
within this Bill are one such feature. But you are right to see that
that would in a sense be against the grain, against the current, of the
focus on policing being a local
dimension.</div><a name="09012774000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dave
Whatton:</b></i> The issues for me are that, in terms of
operational collaboration, it makes complete and utter sense to be
doing that on a regional basis with adjoining forces where there is
coterminosity. One of the things that you touched on earlier in the
questions was about back office functions and support services. On
occasions, the emphasis on Government office areas acts against
collaboration. If legacy systems are due for renewal at different times
from those of other forces in your region, but there is a legacy system
coming up somewhere else in the country, with the growth of the
internet and other means, we should look wider across the whole of
England and Wales to the most suitable points of
collaboration.</div>
<a name="09012774000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
extensive work has gone on: 14 forces across the United Kingdom
collaborated really effectively on forensic science support services
and developing contracts there. Work was led by Merseyside constabulary
to look at human resources and finance functions and shared services.
What stopped it being taken forward at that time was that the upfront
investment in capital that was required for a joint venture could not
be found. That work is still going on behind the scenes among a number
of forces including Thames Valley, ourselves and others spread across
the whole of the country.</div>
<a name="09012774000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
talk about collaboration across England and Wales and not get focused
on the regional initiatives. Some of the significant savings that could
be made will only be possible if there is some real investment up
front. That is where the difficulty comes in the short term with the
current funding arrangements. That is one of the things that needs to
be looked at seriously if collaboration is to be mandated. If we are to
do it properly, and as Sir Norman said, the accountability for
mandation sits with the person who is mandating it as well, the issue
around resources could also be resolved through that
process.</div><a name="09012774000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000339"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> How much difference does the new provision that
police authorities must have regard to what local communities are
saying have? How might that clash with a central direction to direct
resources to collaboration?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="09012774000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Jones:</b></i> From a police authority&#146;s perspective,
I do not think that it will make much difference to the way that police
authorities operate. Effectively it will merely formalise and enshrine
in legislation what we do and consider our core duty anyway. We
consider that our first priority is to listen to the communities and to
take their views into account. Obviously that has to be balanced
against the professional views of our chief constables and police
force, particularly as there are a number of issues that would not
immediately be visible to members of the community, such as serious
organised crime, counter terrorism and so on.</div>
<a name="09012774000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the
priorities that we ultimately set, while we start from a bottom-up,
listening-to-the-community approach, need to be balanced against some
of the other key strategic issues&#151;protective services issues and
so on&#151;and they ultimately have to be balanced about what is
affordable. It has always been the duty of police authorities to have
that balance. We have a statutory duty under the Police Act 1996 to
require our chief officers to collaborate effectively. So, in effect,
we will have all elements of that balance enshrined in legislation if
the Bill proceeds as is intended. I do not think that it will make much
difference to that aspect. We welcome the fact that there is potential
in the Bill to give us a clearer legal framework for collaboration. One
or two of my members have run into difficulties through a lack of legal
clarity. We would welcome greater clarity. We very much welcome the
fact that the Bill could facilitate a legal framework for that
area.</div>
<a name="09012774000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
concerned about some of the measures in terms of the way of achieving
them. There is considerable progress on collaboration, driven on a
non-mandatory and incentivisation basis. A lot is being delivered. A
lot was delivered historically. That is very much underestimated. There
is a lot of impetus behind it. Clearly if we could facilitate a legal
framework, that could improve it still further. This particular formula
may cause problems, particularly in terms of separating out a police
authority collaboration from police service collaboration and not
allowing for joint collaboration. Most collaborations will involve
resources and decisions that are under the control of both the chief
constable and the police authority. Being able to facilitate joint
arrangements as well as the other two would be even better.</div>
<a name="09012774000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
slightly concerned about how far reaching some of the proposals are,
particularly the ability to issue direct orders to chief constables.
Under the current legislative framework the Home Secretary can issue
directions to chief constables. It is on the advice of Her
Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary and through the police
authority. This proposal takes it much further than the current
arrangements where the Home Secretary can directly mandate individual
chief constables with no reference to and consultation with the police
authority. We believe that that level of mandation is not
necessary.</div><a name="09012774000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000340"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> One more question on a slightly different issue.
Sir Norman in one of his answers introduced as a sideline the issue of
raising funding for police authorities through the levy of the precept
on the council tax. Is the Bill a missed opportunity to tackle that?
Most police authorities are capped by the Government by central
directive, and, certainly in Derbyshire, are subject to what the
majority group on the county council says that it will allow in terms
of an increase? Last year, in my area, it would not allow a big enough
increase in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>council tax to offset what was perceived to be
underfunding from the Government. Do police authorities need more say
in how they raise their
funds?</div><a name="09012774000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Jones:</b></i> We, as police authorities, fundamentally
believe in the principle of no taxation without representation. We
believe that the current safeguard of ensuring that the majority of
local councillors must be able to agree a precept is an important part
of that principle. We also believe that if we do not have our own
fund-raising responsibilities and duties, if decisions are taken
elsewhere, without finance we effectively have no meaningful local
accountability. We become a quango, such as a primary care trust,
rather than a police authority that independently represents the views
of the local community.</div>
<a name="09012774000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000341"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Sir Norman, Mr Whatton, any comment on
Mr. Holmes&#146;s
remarks?</div><a name="09012774000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Norman Bettison:</b></i> The question is directed to the
local precepting element of the policing budget, which is always the
smaller part. The larger part is the general grant from the Government.
I would say&#151;but I suspect that I will get no support from my
right-hand side, from Mr Jones&#151;that there are opportunities,
which do not need legislation within this Bill, to fund the general
grant, as alternatives to simply dividing it between the 43. Some of
the strategic and serious risks faced by the police service might be
better addressed by directing funding at other than the 43&#151;by
directing it as a core grant to achieve some specific
objective.</div>
<a name="09012774000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dave
Whatton:</b></i> It goes back to the point I was making
earlier. In the future, the financial position of everybody in public
service will become even tighter. With the restrictions that have come
in through capping, which has affected my force and other forces, we
really do have to look at the efficiency and effectiveness of
everything that we do. I am very keen to look at collaboration and
other aspects of work, but on occasion our hands are tied, preventing
us from investing in long-term measures, without in the short term
cutting back on services we provide on the front line. So there is a
real issue for us about dealing with things in the short term and
long-term gains. That is something we need to be looking at across the
board. That is where it is really important to look, on occasion, at
the greater good&#151;for support from forces, the Home Office and
other areas between each other, to provide better services across the
board, rather than looking at individual police areas, on occasions
where the finances really do drive the activity that you would like to
do in a different way if you had the
opportunity.</div><a name="09012774000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000342"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Good morning, and thank you for your evidence so
far. May I ask a couple of questions on collaboration, and then on
accountability? Sir Norman is absolutely right to say that mandating
forces in the Bill is seen very much as a last resort, which the
Government would consider only when everything else had failed. I am
glad Sir Norman has put that on the record; I think that is an
important point to make. To reiterate here, it is very much the last
port of call, not the first port of
call.</div><a name="09012774000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could
I ask whether Mr. Jones, Sir Norman and Mr.
Whatton think that the measures in the Bill will encourage police
forces to share services and collaborate? There has been a lot of
progress, but what people want 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>now is to try to encourage greater momentum and sometimes a bit more
speed. Will the measures in the Bill encourage
that?</div><a name="09012774000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Norman Bettison:</b></i> I think they could facilitate,
without necessarily encouraging. I think&#151;this has been touched
upon by other witnesses as well&#151;that an incentive is needed that
stands outside the clauses. The clauses facilitate; the encouragement,
to take your word, is better addressed through invest-to-save,
pump-priming and the incentive to address central targets that go
beyond the local, because much of the targeting regime is about local
delivery. In addition to the clauses, incentives must be thought
through to encourage the direction of travel.</div>
<a name="09012774000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Jones:</b></i> I very much concur. There is some potential to
facilitate matters and to remove some of the obstructions&#151;the
lack of legal clarity&#151;to the frameworks for collaboration;
however, there is the potential to add confusion, because the issue is
about the separate arrangements. There is no arrangement for
collaboration between the authority and police service, and that is the
more normal pattern of activity in such collaborations. However, there
is a lot of momentum from successful collaboration, and there is active
support throughout the area, but there is a danger of throwing in
additional areas where the issue is confusing. If the message is that
the powers will be used only as a last resort, particularly changing
from the previous arrangements with HMIC and the police authority
arrangements to powers to give direct instructions to police
constables, they are likely to be perceived as powers that could be
used not as a last resort but as the first port of call. If the
perception is, &#147;We are about to be forced into doing these
things, so we might as well wait for that,&#148; there is a danger
that it might disrupt the substantial progress that is being made on a
voluntary and incentivised basis.</div>
<a name="09012774000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dave
Whatton:</b></i> For a long time, there has been a desire to
do more work on support, and that continues. However, there has been
some reticence about operational collaboration. In the forces that I
used to work in, West Midlands and Greater Manchester, there was a
clear need to deal with serious and organised crime, terrorism and all
sorts of things, but that is not so visible in my current force in
Cheshire. One issue about operational collaboration is that we have
only a limited pot of police officers with the right skills and
abilities, and that goes back to Mr. Holmes&#146;s point.
If we are going to invest police officers in the tackling of serious
and organised crime, and put large resources into surveillance,
detectives and various other things, it will come out of another area
of policing&#151;quite often, the local BCU, policing and community
matters. They will be replaced over time by new probationers, but,
initially, the staff will have to come from somewhere else, unless
there is significant investment.</div>
<a name="09012774000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that, with many of these things, we are trying to make better use of
our resources, but that means some tough decisions about priorities. On
collaboration, that is no different nationally or regionally from my
own constabulary, where the urban unitary authorities regularly
complain that there are not enough staff to deal with the issues that
are relevant there, and the parish councils complain that rural
officers are not visible enough there. We have difficult decisions to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>make, and we make them daily. That issue was just
the same as the one under discussion, so we just need a forum, and, on
mandation, opportunities&#151;going back to the point about the
greater good&#151;may be realised at the expense of some parts of
policing and some parts of the country. Ultimately, however,
accountability is important and we have to make tough decisions about
our available resources. There will be some help and some
uncertainties, but there seems to be an urban myth that chief
constables and police authorities do not want to collaborate. We do. If
the legislation and changes come in, they will take out some of the
uncertainties, but we need support on other things behind the
scenes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000343"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Minister, you had a second question before we
move on.</div>
<a name="09012774000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000344"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Mr. Jones, what do you think of the
changes that have been made to clause 1 on the accountability
arrangements for police authorities? Would Sir Norman and
Mr. Whatton like to comment on whether they see the
accountability arrangements as an improvement on what was previously in
the
Bill?</div><a name="09012774000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Jones:</b></i> We see those proposals as a massive
improvement on the original Green Paper. We welcome the formalising of
what we have always considered to be our core role. This is a much
better way forward than the proposals on directly elected
representatives. We felt that the involvement of all three political
parties might have brought party politics into conflict with policing.
We are in the process of writing to all three political parties to ask
whether it is possible to attempt to achieve a consensus on future
accountability arrangements. That should be dispatched
today.</div><a name="09012774000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current situation is dangerous because policing could be seen to be in
conflict with political parties. That is dangerous for confidence in
policing. It is essential that the whole community feels that the
agenda of police constables and police services is to operate with
fairness to all, without fear or favour and in the interests of the
whole community rather than those of one section, whether that be a
political party or not. This is a key issue that must be explored
further.</div><a name="09012774000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Norman Bettison:</b></i> ACPO supports the removal of the
proposal for directly elected local police authorities. I stress that
there is no resistance to accountability, nor is there any reluctance
to democracy being the wonderful cocoon in which UK policing
exists.</div><a name="09012774000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have talked already about the currents that pull towards the local.
ACPO thinks that local elected members would be neither fish nor fowl.
At the basic command unit level, they might represent about 100,000
people, which means they would not be so very local. However, being
directly elected would give them a mandate and they would be required
to renew that mandate on an annual or biannual basis. Therefore they
would concentrate on and lobby at only the local level. The day-to-day
task of chief constables is to balance the local with the serious,
national and international. Having a directly elected member with a
democratic mandate to concentrate only on the local would skew that
balance. We therefore support the removal of those
proposals.</div><a name="09012774000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dave
Whatton:</b></i> Accountability is vital in being a chief
constable. I have felt very accountable to my police authority on a
number of occasions. I am not clear about the meaning of the provisions
on collaboration in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>clause 5. Proposed new section 23(6) of the Police
Act 1996 refers to a chief officer&#146;s accountability in
decision-making and collaboration,
stating:</div><a name="09012774000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
chief officer may make an agreement only with the approval of the
police authority responsible for maintaining the chief officer&#146;s
force.&#148;</div><a name="09012774000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 23A(5) speaks of collaboration for police authorities,
stating:</div><a name="09012774000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
making an agreement a police authority must consult the chief officer
of the police force maintained by the
authority.&#148;</div><a name="09012774000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
subsections use different words. Personally, I believe that the
tripartite structure should be equal. Those words seem to change the
balance. The agreement of both should be required equally. Is this an
issue of wording or is it the intention that the relationship between
police authorities and chief officers be changed? If that is the
intention, it is not explicit. This raises some
questions.</div><a name="09012774000099"></a>

Chairman:</b> Have we exhausted the new duty on police
authorities, the appointment of chief officers and collaboration? If
there are no further questions, perhaps Mr. Ruffley or
Mr. Brokenshire will bring in the other two witnesses on
airport
security.</div><a name="09012774000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><a name="09012774000346"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): May I say that it is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Sir Nicholas? First, I
would like to ask the relevant witnesses if they agree with the premise
that the current situation, in relation to policing at airports, does
not work, is not effective and requires
reform?</div><a name="09012774000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Siddall:</b></i> Yes, I think we would agree. We worked
closely with Stephen Boys Smith, whose review ultimately triggered this
legislation, and since his report, we have also worked with Government
officials. Our take on his review was that we agreed with the diagnosis
but not the prescription. The current system of designation is in need
of overhaul&#151;it does not work particularly well&#151;not least
because it creates a distortion among airports, as our own members will
testify, as some are not designated and some are. Time seems to have
rather passed by the reasons for those particular nine being designated
as of today. So yes, we would agree.</div>
<a name="09012774000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000347"></a>James

impediments, or what would you say is most in need
of&#151;</div><a name="09012774000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000348"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Would the hon. Gentleman and the witness
speak up so that we can ensure that everything is taken down
accurately?</div>
<a name="09012774000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000349"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I was simply asking
the witness what is the primary area of concern not addressed by the
Bill&#146;s proposals, given the issues he has highlighted?</div>
<a name="09012774000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Siddall:</b></i> Perhaps I can give an overview, then ask my
colleague, Ian Hutcheson, to provide an additional perspective. The
problems that have dogged the policing of airports for twenty-odd years
are clear, and there have been any number of working groups,
committees, and so on.</div>
<a name="09012774000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
fundamental problems. First, when deciding how an airport should be
policed, in the final analysis, it comes down to a subjective
judgement, which may rely heavily on the personal views of police 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>officers involved with that airport or in the final instance, the chief
officer of the force where the airport is situated. There is therefore
a degree of subjectivity, which has caused problems. The second big
issue is that for designated airports today, one party pays while
ultimately, the other is making the lion&#146;s share of the
judgement on what the resource numbers should be. Those familiar with
quality management in industry might remember its original strap
line&#151;&#147;Quality built in.&#148; What we are seeing with
this legislation and the previous regime, is that because of the
design, disputes are built in. One party pays and another makes
judgments. In business, that would be known as the principal agent
problem, which means you have two parties whose interests are not
exactly aligned. That is the fundamental flaw in the
arrangements.</div>
<a name="09012774000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Hutcheson:</b></i> Robert has hit the key points, as the
current arrangements rely heavily on personal relationships. The debate
about accountability in relation to the Bill is interesting. In many
respects, accountability is at the heart of some disputes in the
policing of airports&#151;what accountabilities lie with the chief
officer, and what accountabilities lie with an airport&#146;s
managing director? Despite 18 months of debate, we are no clearer on
those issues. In fact, the latest position is that they should be
decided locally. That could lead to accountabilities being different
all around the country, which I do not think would be very
good.</div><a name="09012774000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other aspect is that knowledge of one another&#146;s business will
help to develop relationships. Too frequently, police forces seek to
replicate the policing structure of a basic command unit or a small
town in an airport that does not require all those levels of policing.
Again, that comes down to a subjective judgment. There are no
structures or methodologies that you can fall back on to say who is
right. My fear is that the Bill does not change any of that. It
introduces an executive committee and formalises the multi-agency
threat and risk assessment, but multi-agency threat and risk forums
have been operating at the designated airports ever since Sir John
Wheeler recommended them. They have been extremely useful in informing
the debate, but not at all helpful in dispute resolution.</div>
<a name="09012774000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Bill addresses the designation and de-designation issue, and all
airports will be susceptible to having police on a regular basis, my
fear is that it does not remove the subjectivity to which Robert
referred or the reliance on personal relationships. Today&#146;s
overall economic climate will put pressures on the individuals in those
negotiations, and I fear that there will be more disputes than ever
before.</div><a name="09012774000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000350"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Would it be fair to say, in characterising
what you have said, that the arrangements rely on the personal
relationships between each of the relevant partners and that the
proposals risk upsetting those relationships and making them more
difficult?</div><a name="09012774000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Hutcheson:</b></i> I am not saying that they will make them
more difficult. The relationship between Heathrow and the Met, for
example, is so mature that it can stand some of those pressures, but
where you seek to establish new relationships at airports that have
never been policed on a regular basis, the overall operational
environment will put real strains and stresses on the attempts to set
up the relationships on which the police at the airport
depend.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div><a name="09012774000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000351"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Mr. Whatton, perhaps I can ask you
about the impact that the changes will have, as they are in essence
mainstreaming airport policing much more than has ever been the case.
What sort of impact will that have on the individual forces
affected?</div><a name="09012774000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dave
Whatton:</b></i> We welcome the proposals that the Bill puts
forward. That has been an ongoing issue for several years, and we are
getting to the point where we can take it forward in a meaningful way.
It is completely unfair on the communities we serve that nine airports
have a requirement for policing and a methodology, and that a large
number of airports that have grown up since the designation was brought
in have significant risks but do not have effective mechanisms for
managing them in order to protect the public. One of the key aspects of
that process is that it will apply across the board.</div>
<a name="09012774000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are a couple of things that I would like to raise. With regard to
the conversation we had about collaboration a short while ago, one of
the issues is that experienced officers are taken away from communities
or other roles to fulfil the new specialised roles to deal with
organised crime. Exactly the same applies to airport policing, so no
chief constable will want to put additional police officers into an
airport unless there is a real need to do so to protect the public. It
is not about growing police forces through the back door, because the
individual staff have to come from somewhere else.</div>
<a name="09012774000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
that we need to take serious decisions before we put any staff into the
airports and transfer the costs across. It requires knowledge and
openness, and these provisions mean that police officers, as well as
senior staff in airports, the airlines and the industries concerned
will have access to secret and sensitive information so that we can all
properly assess the risks and come up with solutions, which might not
mean extra policing. There might be other ways of doing this, such as
investing in CCTV or other hard, protective measures: it does not
automatically have to be police officers on every occasion. It means
that we have to assess risk properly, then take forward, in agreement,
measures to protect the public against the risk that we identify. One
of the stumbling blocks that there have been for some time is the issue
of accountability. Previous legislation was clear that the chief
constable or his staff were accountable if they identified a risk and
did not put in effective measures to mitigate it. If there was a
disagreement among airport operators, and other issues arose, there was
real lack of certainty about who was responsible for any
decisions.</div>
<a name="09012774000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision
by the Secretary of State to take on the dispute resolution process
and, ultimately, the accountability for the decisions that arise from
that, has cleared up the ambiguity as far as we are concerned. We do
not expect lots of disputes to develop: we expect people to work
together effectively to come up with reasonable measures to protect the
public. However, now there is ultimately a mechanism by which a dispute
can be resolved. Whoever resolves it, the payments proceed as a result.
Airports are not the same as other areas of the community, and the cost
of policing for them should not be put up nationally in some places and
in other places by local taxpayers through the police authority and the
precept. We need that fairness and equality across the board, and we
fully support the proposals.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="09012774000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000352"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we continue with the questioning I remind
witnesses and Members that we have just under a quarter of an hour
until I must bring this set of questions to an
end.</div><a name="09012774000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000353"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> May I put one further question to
Mr. Whatton as a supplementary on the risk of additional
pressure being brought to bear, and on the limitations of front-line
officers? Do you have any concerns that by changing a situation by
establishing formal airport security plans, perhaps for airports that
do not have such arrangements, a temptation or feeling will be created
that there is a requirement to place additional police resource in such
airports? That is not necessarily because there is any flaw in the
judgment on risk assessment, but simply by virtue of there being a plan
in place the subconscious impact may be greater focus, exposure and
perhaps public scrutiny.</div>
<a name="09012774000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dave
Whatton:</b></i> I do not think that there will be any
increase in police officers or resources going into airports just
because we have a plan. Additional resources may need to go in, because
we have, by this process, identified genuine risks against which we
need to protect the public. The plan per se will not bring in any
resources, but if we identify risks which we did not know about
beforehand then, quite properly, we need to do something about
it.</div>
<a name="09012774000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000354"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I have just one question on funding for security.
The Airport Operators Association believes, as would any business, that
policing should all be done through central funding and that you should
not be picking up the tab. Can you justify that approach with
airports?</div><a name="09012774000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Siddall:</b></i> It is probably a more nuanced position. We
accept that there is a degree of local decision making, because the
whole process is based on MATRA, which looks at local threat and risk
assessment. I would not say that we are set on some kind of central
solution with regard to funding. However, that is a position that we
have held because we got to a point where we lost so much faith in
these arrangements, that we felt the only way to solve that was by some
sort of central levy. There are two aspects: security is paramount and
our first concern is absolutely that passengers can travel safely and
securely. However, while that has to come first, we do have an eye to
affordability, especially in the current climate, as Mr.
Hutcheson has mentioned.</div>
<a name="09012774000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
arrangements create a problem, as it is not clear that there will be
value for money. Despite what Chief Constable Whatton says, if you
consider this objectively, you have to ask why would police forces not
put lots of officers into an airport, apart from the fact that those
resources might be limited, so a decision has to be made about that.
There is only one case going through this process that has not obtained
an agreement through custom and practice&#151;Prestwick airport,
which is one of the nine designated airports. If it had not been for
the frenetic activity of officials in recent months, that case would be
in dispute. Unsurprisingly, the problem is that the police would like
to put a great many more officers in than the airport believes is
appropriate. To me that seems to be a case in
point.</div><a name="09012774000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is one side of the coin. The other side is that we accept that airports
should pay where policing is appropriate for risks that occur on the
airport. However, a great deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>of the policing will be for counter-terrorism
measures, which are somewhat subjective and perhaps more vague than
other measures in terms of making the linkage as to what you get for
what resource. We feel that that is also partly a threat against the
state. We feel that that should be looked at in that way. We are not
simply saying that we do not want to pay for any of this: it is a more
complex picture than
that.</div><a name="09012774000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000355"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> What would you change in the Bill to deal with the
difficulties as you see
them?</div><a name="09012774000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Siddall:</b></i> That is a very good question&#151;I wish
that I had a good answer. The Bill designs in a problem whereby one
party pays and another effectively decides the resources. We would like
to see the Government stop and look at alternatives such as using
British Transport police to police airports, which is an alternative we
pushed in the days of the review. We felt that Stephen Boys Smith
dismissed that too lightly. That would be one example. The other is to
go back to looking at some kind of central
system.</div><a name="09012774000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000356"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> But why would using British Transport police not
give rise to exactly the same problems? The police would want to
over-egg the security, which is their job and you would not want to pay
for that, which is your
job.</div><a name="09012774000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Hutcheson:</b></i> The earliest part of the debate was about
collaboration as a driver for economies of scale. The deployment of a
single force across the UK&#146;s airport would bring economies of
scale to airport policing that the current arrangements do not. It is
very much a local negotiation on risk and who can negotiate the
hardest. You may not always get the correct deployment of police. One
area that is particularly difficult is the deployment of armed police
at airports. There seems to be a growing view in the police service
that all airports need to have armed police. The airport operators see
armed police very much as a deadly force and the last resort: there
must be other ways of mitigating risk. Armed policing is a very
specialist skill. Permanently to deploy armed police at airports could
lead to the de-skilling of these officers. That is something that we
would like to look at. If you had a national approach to the policing
of airports, it could be built into
that.</div><a name="09012774000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000357"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Could I ask Bob Jones to come in? You reacted to
one of the comments
earlier.</div><a name="09012774000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Jones:</b></i> The Committee would find it interesting to see
the level of resource put in by airport operators, particularly to the
non-designated airports, including some very hard negotiations by some
of the designated airports. I understand from my Scottish colleagues
that the offer at Prestwick was of no support whatsoever to local
policing. In places like Merseyside, the agreement is one funded by the
police authority and by the airport operators. That is the information
that I have from my colleagues who are involved in those negotiations
from our side.</div>
<a name="09012774000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Stephen
Boys Smith review not only analyses a problem, it puts forward some
potential solutions. We have had major problems with designated
airports having some degree of legal framework to ensure that there is
a commitment, including a financial commitment from the airport
operators, while the non-designated airports, many of which now have
much greater passenger numbers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>than many of the designated ones, do not have the problem. It is a
question of fairness. It is a question of fairness for the airport
operators, as well as particular police services, to ensure that they
have a standard legal framework: it should not be the case that some
airports are designated and some are not. If you looked at the figures,
I think that you and the public would be concerned about the low levels
of support for policing, particularly at non-designated airports, but
also at some designated airports. If that became a matter of public
knowledge, there would be a greater clamour to move this legislation
forward as quickly as possible.</div>
<a name="09012774000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our only
slight reservation, probably contrary to the airport operators, is that
the current system effectively requires unanimous agreement. That is a
commendable desire, but it effectively results in a position where
there is an individual veto. The appeal against that is extremely
cumbersome and mechanistic, and can drag on for a considerable period
of time, when there may be an important security risk that needs to be
addressed in the short term rather than going through such a cumbersome
process. I would hope that the Committee looks at the arrangements for
resolving those issues where there is not unanimous
agreement.</div><a name="09012774000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Siddall:</b></i> I disagree with a lot of what was just said,
although I can see why that perspective is taken. If we look at the
Prestwick case&#151;I do not think it is appropriate to bring all
that out in front of the Committee&#151;Prestwick airport, as an
operator, has played a constructive role in those discussions with
Strathclyde police. In fact, in the first instance, it believed that it
had reached an agreement with Strathclyde police. I do not believe that
it can be the case that it offered no input at all; it believed it had
reached an agreement, which was overturned on the appointment of a new
chief officer. That tells us something about the subjectivity problem
that was raised earlier.</div>
<a name="09012774000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we look at
other non-designated airports and their reluctance to fund&#151;I
fully agree with Bob Jones that that is true in many areas, although
the picture is patchy&#151;there are examples of good relationships
where police are funded at airports, and I can cite a few. Where there
is reluctance&#151;and I agree that there is&#151;part of the
reason is that this problem has not been solved. The reluctance arises
because the airport fears that, as soon as it sits down at the table
with its cheque book, it will suddenly be staffed out with a large
number of officers. That stand-off remains until we solve this problem.
That tells us that there is a problem&#151;it does not tell us
something about the solution. As for designated airports being
under-resourced&#151;that would be an issue if it were a matter of
public scrutiny&#151;perhaps Ian Hutcheson could comment on
that.</div><a name="09012774000134"></a>

left?</div><a name="09012774000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dave
Whatton:</b></i> The issue of arms support at airports needs
to be dealt with on a threat basis, and needs to be dealt with through
the process, but it is appropriate at some airports. Something else is
really important: we have talked about a large number of police
officers and replicating BCUs. There are three airports that have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>large numbers of police officers
present. At most of them, we are talking about 10s and 20s, but in
Prestwick&#146;s case, we are talking about moving from two police
officers to nine, so I think that the word &#147;large&#148; is

<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div><a name="09012774000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000363"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Ms Adams, to give a scale of the problem, could
you estimate how many prostitutes in the country are controlled for
gain&#151;that is a term used in the
Bill?</div><a name="09012774000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> You have hit on the first big problem with the
legislation. &#147;Controlled for gain&#148; has a wide definition.
People working in the sex industry are no more likely to be controlled
for gain than any other worker in the UK. The definition that Fiona
Mactaggart said the Government would use, in the Second Reading debate,
was that they would require compulsion; but you can see from the
definition of &#147;controlling&#148; in the Bill, plus the
definition used in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, that it in
fact would include any woman working in any situation where there was a
work rota; workmates could be criminalised under it.</div>
<a name="09012774000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have seen
prosecutions of women; we are actually working with a woman at the
moment whose case is coming to court. She is the mother of four young
children, who was working with another woman in premises, and is being
prosecuted for controlling. We have, here, some women from Soho who
work in flats with maids. They were raided in December and threatened
by the police with being prosecuted for controlling, when they are the
first line of defence for working women against violent attacks and
exploitation. I hope that you will give them an opportunity to speak
and will hear evidence from them.</div>
<a name="09012774000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000364"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am afraid only those who have been asked to
come as formal witnesses can address the Committee. I have no doubt
that you will be able to speak on behalf of those for whom you have
just replied. I am sorry; those who are not registered with us as
official witnesses cannot give
evidence.</div><a name="09012774000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000365"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> You are confirming that the definition is very
wide, and can catch a large number of people.</div>
<a name="09012774000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> Yes, and already it is being used in that way,
so what Fiona Mactaggart said in the Second Reading debate in fact is
not true; we have already seen prosecutions, and prosecutions for
controlling under the 2003 Act have actually gone up significantly
since 2003 when the definition was changed. The Proceeds of Crime Act
2002 has enabled the police to claim 25 per cent. of the money, assets
and other resources collected at the time of arrest and after
prosecution, and we think the Act is a big motivation for the increase
in raids and prosecutions in this
area.</div><a name="09012774000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000366"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I can help Niki Adams. I have just given advice
on what is permitted at this Committee sitting, but there is nothing to
prevent your colleagues from submitting written evidence to the
Committee. Such evidence, as long as it is acceptable, not in offensive
language and is appropriate to the Bill, will be circulated. If your
colleagues would like to give evidence they can, but, sadly, it has to
be in writing.</div>
<a name="09012774000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000367"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On how the clauses might operate in practice, it
has been suggested to some members of the Committee that it would not
be easy to enforce them, because quite a lot of women who were being
forced into this industry would not give evidence, to put it bluntly,
against a pimp or someone who was controlling 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>them. They would be scared of being brutalised or
attacked if they gave evidence to the police or the Crown Prosecution
Service. From what you are saying, that does not seem to be so much of
an issue. Enforcement is happening, from what you just
said.</div><a name="09012774000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> Yes, that is very much the case, because it is
being used against people who are involved in consensual sex. There is
not any force and coercion present, but those are the people who are
primarily being prosecuted under both the controlling legislation and
also, unfortunately, under the trafficking legislation, which, in the
UK, also does not require force and coercion to be proved. A woman in
our network who is from Brazil and who has been here for 25 years
running premises that everyone accepted were a safe and good
environment for women to work in was prosecuted for trafficking and
sentenced to three years in prison. She nearly lost custody of her
young son, and is now facing deportation. She had her life savings, her
house, her car and all her possessions confiscated. The law is being
used in that way to prosecute people who are involved in consenting
sex.</div>
<a name="09012774000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figures
that have been used to justify the proposals&#151;the figures on
trafficking&#151;are false. They have been discredited in many
academic studies including on a recent radio 4 programme, where they
showed that the figure that was widely being used&#151;that 80 per
cent. of women working in the sex industry in the UK are
trafficked&#151;actually came from POPPY project research that found
that 80 per cent. of women in the sex industry are immigrant women.
There is a very big difference between being foreign and being forced,
which is what the programme concluded.</div>
<a name="09012774000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000368"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> But paying for sexual services from a person who
is controlled for gain will be an offence. May I just give you this
scenario? If a man understands that seeking and using the services of a
woman who has been trafficked is a strict liability offence and he will
be committing an offence, in practice, if he knows the law, he might
say to the woman, &#147;Have you been trafficked or are you
controlled for gain?&#148; Let us just imagine that scenario. It
seems that there is no incentive whatsoever for the woman concerned to
answer that question truthfully because if the man asks the question,
she will understand that he knows the law. If she says, &#147;Yes, I
have been trafficked,&#148; the first thing the man will do in all
likelihood is say, &#147;Okay, I&#146;m not going to commit an
offence; I&#146;m going out the door.&#148; The woman will then
lose the
money.</div><a name="09012774000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems almost impossible to conceive of a sex worker&#151;a
female&#151;answering that question truthfully because the minute she
does so she loses business and, if she has already been brutalised, she
will face heaven knows what consequences for losing trade and money.
What are the chances of women answering that question
truthfully?</div><a name="09012774000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> The problem is that the figures on how many
women are trafficked are distorted. Where women have been trafficked or
are facing rape, violence or other kinds of coercion, the question is
what will best help them escape from that situation and get the help
that they need. Criminalising them and their clients is certainly not
going to help. What does help, as has been shown in New Zealand, is
decriminalisation, which has enabled women to come forward, report
violence and get help in many different areas. The New Zealand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>experience has not been looked at properly by this
Government and, in fact, was reported falsely in the debate on 19
January, when it was said that what New Zealand has done was
legalisation, which is not true. Fiona Mactaggart claimed that there
had been an increase in the number of people working in the sex
industry. In fact, a substantial and thorough recent Government review
found no increase in the number of women in prostitution. They found
that women were more able to come forward to get help and that
conditions were less exploitative in the brothels in which women
worked.</div><a name="09012774000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to your question, the crucial issue is what most helps women
to escape from violent and exploitative situations. The legislation
will do nothing to help that, and will actually force prostitution
further underground and make it harder for women to be public and get
help.</div><a name="09012774000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000369"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Ruffley, I think that Niki Adams
mentioned the POPPY project in one of her answers relating to
statistics. Do Frances Brodrick or Denise Marshall want to come in on
the
question?</div><a name="09012774000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000370"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Sir Nicholas, you have asked my question for me.
If I could ask for a response to those
points?</div><a name="09012774000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Denise
Marshall:</b></i> I think that Niki Adams said that the Radio
4 programme claimed that 80 per cent. were foreign nationals and were
therefore trafficked. Unfortunately, we cannot control the media. What
we said in our report &#147;Sex in the City&#148; was that 80 per
cent. of the women were foreign nationals and that we believed a
significant proportion of them were trafficked. We did not say that
they were all trafficked; we have not claimed that. We do not know the
figures. We were able to show that around 80 per cent. in off-street
sex commercial establishments were foreign national women, but we did
not claim that they were all trafficked.</div>
<a name="09012774000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> The problem has been that, for example, in
relation to Soho, which is one of the areas where the sex industry is
less underground and where it is easier to see what is going on, even
the police said for many years that 80 per cent. of women there were
being trafficked. One of the women here today works in Soho. She is
from Hungary. Her father died when she was younger and she is here
supporting her son and her family back home. That is the most common
average situation of women working in the sex industry. Some 70 per
cent. are mothers who have gone into prostitution to support their
families and other people in the community. We are in an economic
recession, and more women will be forced into prostitution to survive.
The legislation will do nothing to help women get safe working
conditions or survive in that way. What it will do is actually force
prostitution underground and make it worse&#151;more
dangerous.</div><a name="09012774000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000371"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> This is my final question. May I ask the
representatives of the POPPY project whether they think that the
clauses as drafted&#151;predominantly those relating to the strict
liability on men&#151;are going to choke off demand and help to solve
the problem through the straightforward criminalisation of the punter,
so to speak? Do you think that that is going to
work?</div><a name="09012774000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Denise
Marshall:</b></i> We think that the Bill does not go far
enough. We think that women should be decriminalised and do not
understand why that is not part of the Bill. But, yes, we do think that
men should be criminalised.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div><a name="09012774000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000372"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Do you think that the proposal will drive down
the number of men seeking sexual services and paying for
them?</div>
<a name="09012774000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frances
Brodrick:</b></i> Absolutely. We think that it will have the
really big effect of making men think about their responsibility for
funding the sex industry and the growth of that industry. We also think
that it will also make them examine their responsibility for the
further exploitation of women who have been controlled for
gain.</div>
<a name="09012774000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Denise
Marshall:</b></i> Interestingly, in the time we have run the
POPPY project, we have had 22 referrals from punters&#151;from those
buying sex from trafficked women. They made the referrals because the
women were in an obvious physical and emotional state of distress. That
sounds good on the surface until you realise that all the 22 men had
sex with the trafficked woman before they phoned us. These are
trafficked women whom we have taken into our projects and whom have
given evidence to us in statements. All those men, knowing the women
were trafficked, had sex before phoning us to help the women to get out
of their
situation.</div><a name="09012774000170"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000373"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call Mrs. Nadine Dorries to
put a question, I know that Hilary Kinnell would like to add something
to the evidence that has been given.</div>
<a name="09012774000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Kinnell:</b></i> The first question Mr. Ruffley
asked was about the proportions of women who are controlled for gain.
The UK Network of Sex Work Projects has 63 member organisations
that work directly with sex workers. A survey of the client group of
projects affiliated to the network showed that, in 2007-08, more than
6,500 indoor female sex workers were in touch with projects in our
network. The majority of them are in premises where there is more than
one person&#151;either more than one sex worker, or a sex worker and
a receptionist&#151;because those are the indoor scenarios that are
easiest for social worker-types of whatever description to access.
There is much less contact with independents who work alone or through
escort
agencies.</div><a name="09012774000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the basis of our expertise, and if you have the network&#146;s
submission in front of you, you will see that we agree with almost
everything that Niki Adams has said about the clauses on controlling
for gain, which relate to not only the criminalisation of clients, but
the closure of indoor premises.</div>
<a name="09012774000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
thing I would point out on the question of statistics is that
the POPPY project&#146;s survey was of indoor sex workers in London.
The 80 per cent. of foreign women at the premises that they surveyed
applies to the London area, not to the rest of the country. It needs to
be made absolutely clear that everywhere in the country, street sex
workers are nearly all British women. Outside the London area, large
numbers of women working at indoor premises are British. As Niki has
explained, over the past few years a number of premises that have never
caused any trouble, where the women working there have reported their
own concerns about trafficking and coercion to the police, have been
raided on the pretext that there is evidence of trafficked women
working there. None have been found, but the people who have been found
have been prosecuted. That is the way things are working at the moment.
We have no confidence that the provisions of the Bill will make matters
any better; rather, we are convinced that they will make matters
worse.</div>

Adams:</b></i> It will have a very negative impact on women
working in the sex industry. Women will be forced out of premises. Many
women will not have the option of giving up prostitution and will
therefore end up on the streets. Nuisance has been raised as a problem
in relation to women working on the streets. We feel that that is no
justification for criminalising women working on the streets. The law
should be abolished to allow women to work together from premises,
which, in New Zealand, has been shown to help women move off the
streets and inside. We know that it is ten times safer for women to
work inside than out on the street.</div>
<a name="09012774000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Existing
legislation has been implemented against premises where the allegation
is that drug use is taking place. Release has described that
legislation being used in a very insidious fashion.
It said that the evidence used to close down premises is often very
tenuous, in that magistrates rarely refuse police applications for an
order for closure and the police have been able to present hearsay
evidence. No actual evidence has to be produced to get a closure order,
and like antisocial behaviour orders, that has led to enormous
injustice. People are accused and they do not have the opportunity to
confront their accuser or to counter the evidence that has been
produced. In the same way as with antisocial behaviour orders, the
order starts off as a civil offence, but the breach of the order is
treated as a criminal offence. In this case, with the closure orders,
people end up with six months in prison. The idea that, under the Bill,
women will be forced out on to the street and may face imprisonment of
up to six months is a dangerous proposal.</div>
<a name="09012774000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact of
criminal records on women lasts their whole lives. A woman whom I was
hoping that you would be able to hear from today, from our network out
of London, has worked on the streets for many years. At quite an early
age, she got a criminal record, which has now prevented her from being
able to work in many other areas. She initially went into prostitution
to support her disabled daughter. She wants to work with children. She
is very involved in her community and was offered a job by her
community centre, but she had to turn down because she knew that as
soon as she was investigated, it would come up that she had a record
for prostitution. Even if that did not prevent her getting the job, she
did not want everybody in her community to know that that was the
situation.</div><a name="09012774000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
a thing has happened over many years to many thousands of women, and it
has institutionalised women in prostitution. This measure and any other
measure that increases criminalisation will continue to wreck
women&#146;s lives and prevent them from getting out of
prostitution.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000376"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> We know that there are two groups: those who take
the intelligent and informed decision that they want to sex workers;
and those who end up there as a result of need,
trafficking or whatever. On the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>drug issue&#151;representatives of the POPPY project might want to
answer this&#151;a huge number, although I do not know the
percentage, of sex workers are also involved in the drug industry. That
is why raids have been made on the various indoor premises that you
have spoken about. Is there an effective way in which the law could be
decoupled so that drug offences could be prosecuted without closing
down the
premises?</div><a name="09012774000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> Women who are using drugs need the same help
as all drug users. In New Zealand, as a result of the change in the
law, there was a big shift in how women who use drugs were treated.
They were treated as patients, not criminals, which had a big impact on
enabling women to get off drugs. There is a problem with the
rehabilitation services in this country. We have worked with women who
have tried to get into rehab and have been prevented from doing so over
and over again for many months. The Bill includes a measure on
compulsory rehabilitation, which I know you have spoken against, but
there is no evidence that compulsion works, and all that will happen
due to that measure is that women will end up in an endless cycle of
breaching orders. It is not an alternative to a fine, because as soon
as you breach your order, you go back to court and face a fine and
possible criminalisation, as you would have before. It is really a
punitive measure that will increase criminalisation and
imprisonment.</div>
<a name="09012774000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000377"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> The provision will ask a sex worker to attend
three meetings. Do you think that the compulsory aspect will deter sex
workers? If so, how should help be given to a sex worker who wants to
move out of the industry?</div>
<a name="09012774000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> I think that it will deter
women. The meetings will be largely useless because resources are not
being provided. To get out of prostitution, women need resources to
address their particular economic needs. Drug use might be involved, in
which case they need rehabilitation services to be provided when they
are ready and able to take up those services. Much of our day-to-day
work is about pressing for resources, such as housing and benefits, to
help women get out of prostitution, if they want
to.</div><a name="09012774000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the aftermath of the Ipswich murders, for a very short period, there
was a determination to try to find ways of getting women out of
prostitution. Women were given a small amount of money each week, which
dealt with their daily needs. Women were prioritised for housing and
assisted through the labyrinth of the benefits system to ensure that
they had an income. Child care was provided, which had an impact. Those
services were then withdrawn and there was a reversion to the age-old
clampdown on clients. That meant that prostitution was forced
underground, and there was no decrease in the number of women
working&#151;they were simply displaced or made invisible. So, there
have been times when people have looked at what women need to get out
of prostitution and things have worked. Fundamentally, it comes down to
resources, not compulsion or a criminal record, which would mean that
even if you were able to leave, your chances of getting another job and
finding another way of supporting yourself would be
destroyed.</div>

Marshall:</b></i> One thing that I wanted to agree with was
that there is an appalling lack of resources for women in London if
they wish to get on to any rehabilitation programme and get off drugs.
There are two residential services, at most, for women and children
across London. The resources are simply not there for housing or any
other services. I do not think that you can do one without the other:
you cannot not provide exits for
women.</div><a name="09012774000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
you decriminalise women, you will enable them to work in
projects&#151;with children and young women at risk of entering
prostitution&#151;but they are not currently able to do so as they
have a record because they were working as prostitutes. I think that
you should be decriminalising. However, I do not think that sustaining
women in prostitution is the answer. The criminalisation of men will go
someway towards ensuring that they take responsibility.</div>

Lev</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Ãª</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">que:</b></i> Just to
pick up on the point about making punters think twice and take more
responsibility for their actions, due to the nature of what Object
does, we are approached regularly by women who have been involved in
prostitution&#151;on the street, in brothels or as escorts&#151;and
say that it is extremely hard for their voices to be heard. The
not-so-nice reality of being in prostitution is often ignored by the
media. You have this Belle de Jour stereotype of what it is to be in
prostitution. Obviously, as we are hearing today, that does not reflect
the reality. One woman who contacted us last week got involved in
prostitution at the age of 13. She had left her home and had been on
the streets of Coventry from that age. She welcomes this move because
it will make people think twice before they pay someone for sex. Even
if there is consent, you do not know the routes into that situation. We
wholeheartedly welcome measures to make people think twice in that
respect. I wanted to say that on behalf of those women who contacted
us.</div><a name="09012774000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000379"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> May I confirm first that none of the witnesses
supports the provisions in law and in this Bill that criminalise women
in prostitution? Is there anyone who supports that? No. Turning to Ms
Marshall first, do you think that men who knowingly have sex with women
who are trafficked and forced into prostitution are committing rape?
Did you report the 22 men who had sex with trafficked women who you
believed, rightly or wrongly, knew that they were trafficked and forced
into sex when they came to you with the referral? Did you report them
to the police for
rape?</div><a name="09012774000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frances
Brodrick:</b></i> They did not disclose their identities so
we were unable to. We take referrals from the general public and as
part of encouraging referrals we often allow people to give anonymous
referrals.</div><a name="09012774000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000380"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So to encourage referrals you allow anonymous
referrals. I can understand why. Is that because you think that if
people who refer feel that they will be prosecuted they are less likely
or not likely to refer?</div>
<a name="09012774000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Denise
Marshall:</b></i> I think that if they thought they would be
prosecuted they would be even less likely to refer. However, they have
made telephone referrals and made anonymous referrals to give us the
addresses of premises. We then pass that information on to the police,
but unfortunately that is a telephone call and one punter and so we are
not able to track those men.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="09012774000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000381"></a>Dr.

unless there is overlap, are responsible for helping you to save 22
women from mass rape on a daily
basis?</div><a name="09012774000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Denise

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000382"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So on the basis of 10 times a day and then for
another month, hundreds of rapes are prevented by each of those men
coming forward. Do you think we should do more to encourage more men to
come forward, whether or not they have had sex with these women, in
order to help you and the authorities to prevent rape on this
scale?</div><a name="09012774000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Denise
Marshall:</b></i> I am not sure how to encourage them. In the
latter part of last year we conducted face-to-face interviews with 104
customers of commercial sex premises. Many of the men were aware that
the women they had sex with were potentially trafficked or potentially
unwilling. In the time that we have been open we have had only 22
referrals. I do not know how one would get them to be more willing to
come
forward.</div><a name="09012774000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000383"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Is there any evidence from abroad that anyone is
aware of as to how they manage to increase the number of referrals from
men? Do they use the Bill&#146;s approach of trying to deter men
through criminalisation, or do they use another
technique?</div><a name="09012774000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Kinnell:</b></i> I believe that in some countries a hotline
has been set up for clients who have concerns about the conditions
under which women are working. Our network and the International Union
of Sex Workers have argued for such a line. My area is violence against
and murder of sex workers. In practically every case where a sex worker
is murdered, the first group of people whom the police want to come
forward are the sex worker&#146;s clients. In a number of cases
successful investigations have been dependent on clients coming forward
as witnesses. There have also been unsuccessful cases where crucial
clients&#151;who are not suspected of the murder&#151;have been
seen in the area but have not come forward. Those cases have been in
areas with heavy anti-kerb crawling operations, where the local press
and sometimes local politicians and police have done their best to
demonise clients and paint them all as rapists and scum. My work on
violence against sex workers shows clearly that they are much more at
risk from people who do not pay than from people who
do.</div><a name="09012774000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000384"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Ms Evans, you are from the Children&#146;s
Society. I think in the briefing that you and your coalition sent on
Second Reading that you wanted to see decriminalisation of
under-18-year-olds. You said&#151;and I would be grateful if you
could confirm it for the record&#151;that you thought that the
Government had planned to do that at some point earlier. Do you know
why that has not happened in this
Bill?</div><a name="09012774000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathy
Evans:</b></i> The turnaround in public policy to view the
involvement of any young person under 18 in prostitution as being the
victim of abuse rather than committing an offence, started in 2000 with
the guidance on safeguarding children involved in prostitution. The
Government&#146;s policy has been clear and welcomed by the
children&#146;s sector in terms of viewing the child in need of
support and at risk of significant harm under the Children Act. What
remains is to remove the legislation that currently would still
criminalise them for various offences related to involvement in
prostitution, of loitering and soliciting. Our particular concern is
that that continues 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>to be an anomaly. A raft of offences has been
created for any adult, male or female, who is in any way involved in
the sexual exploitation of children, whether as a customer or involved
in the chain of offences. At the moment it also includes in law the
child who is abused through that involvement. We have heard a lot about
how the industry is pushed underground and is therefore more invisible,
adding to the vulnerability of women and boys under the age of 18 who
are sexually exploited. It is already underground and it is difficult
for those children to feel they can come forward. They are often told
and reminded that they are doing something illegal; that is one of the
tools with which they can be coerced. It is the only case where a child
who has been abused by someone else is considered to be doing something
wrong themselves. We need to see that legislation
repealed.</div><a name="09012774000201"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000385"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> My question was, why has it not been
repealed?</div>
<a name="09012774000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathy
Evans:</b></i> Attitudes are starting to change. There has
recently been consultation on the Government&#146;s intended revised
updated guidance on safeguarding children involved in prostitution. A
straightforward question was asked whether responding organisations had
views about decriminalisation. My understanding is that a high
proportion said that they did and the Government are currently
compiling the analysis of those views. So the Government have said they
are open to the case for final legal repeal of those offences. In the
past they have been concerned that to repeal the law would send a
message that it was all right, but that is not our experience in any
other form of abuse or exploitation of children. That is the anomaly
that we want to
undo.</div><a name="09012774000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000386"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> One of the issues for me is whether the intentions
of this legislation will be effective in making women safe. I think we
all share that objective. I understand that it has been subject, as far
as possible, to academic inquiry. I shall start with the POPPY project
witnesses. What academic evidence in the Home Office review led them to
believe that they would be safe in welcoming the review&#146;s
proposals for the new offence of controlling for gain, and the closure
orders in respect of the safety and health of women&#151;usually
women; vulnerable women&#151;in the sex industry?</div>
<a name="09012774000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frances
Brodrick:</b></i> We work with large numbers of women who
have been exploited in the worst possible ways, controlled and
prostituted by their traffickers. They come to us and tell us about the
types of exploitation and abuse they have suffered at the hands of
their punters. Sometimes, men who buy sex do not know, for various
different reasons, that they are buying sex off a woman who is being
controlled, but sometimes they do, and it gives them an enormous amount
of power over women. We have heard horrific stories about how women
have been exploited and abused, and they are powerless to do anything
about it. The measure not only says very clearly to punters that they
need to take responsibility for the sex trade and for buying sex off
women, but provides for legislation and enables women to come forward
to testify against punters.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000387"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I understand that, but there may be alternatives
that do it better. My question is, what is the academic
evidence&#151;either from the Home Office review or elsewhere, if it
is not there&#151;that underpins your view that the legislation will
be the best way to improve the situation generally, and particularly
for your clients?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="09012774000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Denise
Marshall:</b></i> In terms of academics, the situation is
quite difficult, because one academic will say that prostitution is
empowering and the best way to move it forward is to legalise it, but
another academic will tell you that 85 per cent. of women in
prostitution are there against their will. So those on each side of the
fence use whichever academic research suits them
best.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000388"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I accept that, but the separate question about
what improves the safety and emotional and physical health of women is
more amenable to comparative study than the more political question
about whether it is generally exploitative or empowering. I absolutely
understand that different academics have different views.</div>
<a name="09012774000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Denise
Marshall:</b></i> Unfortunately, that impacts on the daily
life of women with whom we work. I have a quote from a POPPY service
user. We talked to her about prostitution, and she said,
&#147;Let&#146;s say if I don&#146;t feed you, you&#146;re
going to die. If men don&#146;t pay for this, prostitution will
die.&#148; And she will not be in the situation. There is no demand;
there is no supply, and her situation will not occur. You have to have
the resources. There is no point in doing this if you do not have the
resources to help women get out, or the resources for trafficked women.
It is quite clear to me that this is the start of ending prostitution,
which means violence against women.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000389"></a>Dr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000390"></a>Dr.

policy? That is my last question.</div>
<a name="09012774000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Kinnell:</b></i> We are dismayed by the lack of evidence that
the demand review appears to have consulted. The Home Office
commissioned a literature review of academic work on demand, and we
were told that it would inform the demand review, but the literature
review has not yet been published. My briefing is a little sketchy on
the issue, but the references in the demand review are to Home Office
documents and to the POPPY project&#146;s &#147;Big Brothel&#148;
report. I would say that the strongest evidence around the relationship
between safety and the legislation surrounding the sex industry is that
of over 100 sex workers who have been killed since 1990, 84 per cent.
were street workers, whereas the proportions of street workers versus
off-street workers in the industry are probably the other way
round&#151;80 per cent. indoor and 20 per cent. street. That
vulnerability of street workers does not seem to be falling, even
though the numbers of actual street workers are falling, which takes us
back to the very inadequate evidence base on which this whole subject
is being discussed.</div>
<a name="09012774000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">An earlier
question was about the extent of drug use. We are frequently told that
the vast majority of sex workers are dependent on class A drugs, which
is true as far as street work is concerned, but with
reservations&#151;when you are running a project that provides a drug
service you are likely to see sex workers who are drug users, so the
level may not be as high as is sometimes thought. Certainly, I have
been working with sex workers for more than 20 years and it is my
experience that the extent of drug use among street women has gone up a
lot in the last 10 years. As far as indoor work is concerned, there is
no such connection, and it is entirely false and misleading to say
so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div><a name="09012774000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no evidence that says that the vast majority of women involved in
the sex industry were coerced into it or coerced at an early age, or
came into it at an early age. There is none whatsoever. There are small
projects that have been based on, say, women who became involved in the
sex industry under the age of 18, which have remarkably shown a very
high percentage who came into the industry under the age of 18. But
they are small, localised studies and they cannot be generalised to the
whole population of sex workers in the country.</div>
<a name="09012774000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> Just on the figures, I think that Hilary has
indicated how any evidence that the Government have produced to back up
the legislation has actually been discredited or is completely false.
They are ignoring evidence that would actually prove the opposite. The
New Zealand experience is that there has been an increase in the number
of women coming forward to report violence. I think when you look at
what measures are needed to make women safer in prostitution they are
very similar to&#151;not disconnected completely from&#151;whatever
women generally need to be safe from rape and other violence. The
conviction rate, for all women, of reported rapes is an appalling 6 per
cent. and there is evidence to show what could be done to improve that
conviction rate: investigate offences thoroughly; improve
women&#146;s ability to come forward and report rape; deal with the
way that women face character assassination in court. Those are the
measures that should be addressed by the Government if they are serious
about dealing with women&#146;s
safety.</div><a name="09012774000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to comment on what the POPPY project said about the idea of
getting rid of prostitution. We would like to get rid of prostitution,
but we know that it cannot be done until we have abolished
women&#146;s poverty and dealt with the exploitative situations for
women working in every other industry, when women&#146;s wages are so
low. Women&#146;s average wage at this moment in time ranges between
&#163;5 and &#163;11 an hour. If you are a mother you get less
money; if you are an immigrant woman you get less money. Until those
economic conditions are dealt with and women can support their families
in other jobs, women will be forced into
prostitution.</div><a name="09012774000217"></a>

reality?</div><a name="09012774000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Hilary
Kinnell:</b></i> I think that the impact will be almost
entirely detrimental. The only element of them that the UK network
would support is removal of the term &#147;common prostitute&#148;
from the statute book, which is an entirely symbolic move. The
provisions relating to street work rehearse all the things that we have
already had, such as targeting the clients and enforced reform of sex
workers.</div>
<a name="09012774000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">About 10
years ago, street sex workers started to be given ASBOs. We were told
that that provided an opportunity to engage, provide services, address
offending behaviour and all the rest of it. As has been said by
others&#151;and remarkably by both Niki and the representatives of
the POPPY project&#151;resources are needed. There is no provision
for any resources to address those issues.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div><a name="09012774000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as indoor work is concerned, particularly the orders for closure of
brothels or premises in which it is suspected that somebody may be
controlled for gain, the Bill is utterly disastrous. It will
destabilise indoor working situations for a vast number of sex
workers&#151;both men and women. Looking at the fine detail and the
accompanying schedule, the Home Secretary will be able to give the
police the power to raid premises under almost any circumstances that
he or she likes.</div>
<a name="09012774000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Control for
gain is a terribly indistinct definition, which applies both to the
premises and to paying for the services of somebody who is controlled
for gain. We fear that the police will be required to target such a
wide range of individual clients and premises that places in which
there is abuse, exploitation and coercion and clients who are violent
and destructive will simply be lost in the mass. In my experience,
police officers who are tasked with investigating serious crimes
against sex workers do their damnedest to carry out such work, and they
are inhibited all the time by the law itself because it inhibits people
from coming forward to give evidence. It also makes sex workers more
vulnerable in the first place. I&#151;and also the
network&#151;cannot see how these provisions will do anything to
improve any of those
things.</div><a name="09012774000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000394"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000395"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Do so very quickly. I know that Mr.
Brokenshire wishes to put a question. Should he put the question, and
then you make a
comment?</div><a name="09012774000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000396"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:</b> May we finish that point? The impact of the
legislation is possibly the most worrying
thing.</div><a name="09012774000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000397"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have seven minutes. I am
concerned.</div><a name="09012774000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Niki
Adams:</b></i> I will be quick. Concretely, it will force
women out of premises on to the streets, where it is more dangerous.
Women will be forced to work alone. That is already happening in Soho,
where receptionists are being threatened with controlling charges. The
change in soliciting for the purposes of prostitution will increase
arrests. It makes it easier for the police to arrest women on the
street because in order to prove persistence, they have only to prove
that it took place a couple of times over a period of three months,
which is very different from what happens at the moment.</div>
<a name="09012774000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Imprisonment
will increase because of the closure orders, the imprisonment aspect of
the compulsory rehabilitation, the number of arrests of women on the
street and the controlling convictions. It will prevent women from
coming forward. When they criminalised clients in Scotland, attacks
against sex workers really soared. It will prevent women getting out of
prostitution because they will have a criminal record, it will
institutionalise women in prostitution, and it will divert
prosecutions.</div>
<a name="09012774000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hilary&#146;s
point is very important. She says that it will divert police time and
resources away from prosecuting rape and other violence to prosecuting
consenting sex. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>As a result, the prosecutions will increase because there is the big
motivation of profiteering by the police, the CPS, the Home Office and
the Inland Revenue, which all get a cut of the earnings under the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012774000398"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="09012774000399"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I want to move on to clause 25 and
the Bill&#146;s proposed changes to the regulation of lap-dancing and
sex-encounter venues. I understand that you, Ms LevÃªque, do not
believe that the provisions go far enough; perhaps you would explain
why.</div><a name="09012774000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sandrine
Le</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">v</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Ãª</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">que:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i>We welcome the commitment behind the reforms. There is a clear
consensus that the law needs to be changed, and for that reason it is
important that the reforms are as robust as possible. We are concerned
that the reforms are undermined by two key flaws. First, the clause is
optional, which will create a postcode lottery in which local people in
some areas will be empowered to have a say in licensing processes and
to bring up gender equality in those processes, while those in other
areas will not. That sends out a mixed message on the gender equality
duty. On the one hand, all local authorities are required to promote
gender equality in everything they do, but on the other, a major piece
of legislation, the Licensing Act 2003, prevents them from doing that
when it comes to licensing. We have a real opportunity here to put that
right and strengthen the gender equality duty by allowing all local
authorities to license lap-dancing clubs as sex-encounter venues and
make that universal.</div>
<a name="09012774000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
reforms currently exempt premises where lap dancing happens less than
once a month, which creates a major loophole for venues that hold
monthly events of that kind and are catered for by a growing number of
agencies. They also reinforce a current loophole relating to temporary
event notices, which are used by many pubs and bars to obtain 12
permits a year for stripping or lap-dancing events. Those permits can
only be opposed by a police authority on the grounds of crime and
disorder. They cannot be opposed by a council or anyone wishing to have
their say. There will always be a loophole that will not be touched by
these reforms.</div>
<a name="09012774000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
massive public support for the reforms from a broad coalition,
including women&#146;s organisations, councils, the Equality and
Human Rights Commission and the Local Government Association&#151;you
know who supports this. It is therefore important that they deliver on
social justice and equality, and to do that, the reforms need to be
universal and ensure that all sex-encounter activities are regulated,
regardless of how frequently those activities are
happening.</div><a name="09012774000237"></a>

Brokenshire:</b> I have one very quick question for Ms Evans
on the issue of the foreign orders for sex offenders, particularly the
foreign travel orders. What impact will changing the age from 16 to 18
have, why is that important in your view, and do you believe that that
increase to five years is
appropriate?</div><a name="09012774000238"></a>

Evans:</b></i> We think that it is important that all
legislation relating to sex offences and children involved in sex
offending should be consistent with the reforms that have been
introduced, which essentially define exploitative offences against
children so that they apply to those up to the age of 18, and children
below the age of 18 should not be penalised for that
involvement.</div><a name="09012774000240"></a>

unlikely to be violent towards sex workers. There are a small
proportion who are and who seem to believe that paying for sex somehow
entitles them to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>violent and abusive, but the vast majority of violence and abuse comes
from people who are not paying or refuse to pay. A lot of violence
comes from people who think that, because someone has been paid by
others, they are entitled to attack them. The idea that paying for sex
is intrinsically abusive has completely blinded people who care very
much about the welfare of women to the real abuse that is going on and
to understanding why that happens and under what circumstances. There
are perfectly straightforward measures that can be taken to prevent it
happening.</div><a name="09012774000244"></a>
