Chair:</b> I welcome all hon. Members to the third sitting of
the Bribery Bill Committee. In a way, perhaps I am pleased that I was
not in the Chair on Tuesday afternoon. I understand that my co-Chair,
Joan Walley, achieved a baptism of fire and the Committee sat very
late. I did warn the Committee that it might sit late  and my
instinct was correct, but I am sure that in the short sitting this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000147"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman nearly missed the
opportunity. I say to members of the Committee that I am liable to move
very quickly and if I had put the Question, he would have missed the
opportunity, but I am very reasonable and helpful at this stage of the
morning.</div><a name="10031837000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000148"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hate to remind you, Sir Nicholas, but there
was one time in the distant past when I did miss the vote, so I am
grateful for your patience this
morning.</div><a name="10031837000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come to clause 11, which deals with penalties, and let us understand
the real impact of bribery and corruption. The Joint Committee on the
draft Bribery Bill records that the World Bank estimates that some
$1 trillion-worth of bribes are paid each year. That
translates into a 10 per cent. increase in the cost of doing
business globally and a 25 per cent. increase in the cost of
procurement contracts in the developing world. We face an uphill
struggle to combat the global tendency towards bribery in its many
forms, yet this country and this Parliament have a proud tradition of
spearheading global change to combat morally corrupt practices, which
is what the Bill is all
about.</div><a name="10031837000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
despite the apparent blanket of potential criminal sanction,
prosecutions for bribery and corruption are a rare beast in the English
courts system. In evidence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>to the Select Committee on Public Administration for the report entitled
&#147;Propriety and Peerages&#148;, Christopher Sallon, QC,
commented:</div><a name="10031837000117"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
average, 21 people were prosecuted in each year between 1993 and 2003
under the Prevention of Corruption Acts...By comparison on average,
some 23,000 defendants were prosecuted each year for fraud between 1997
and 2001. Though these figures may not be entirely accurate, it is
clear that there is a considerable difference between those prosecuted
for public sector corruption and those prosecuted for private sector
fraud.&#148;</div><a name="10031837000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we examine prosecutions for overseas corruption, we see that the
figures become even sparser. It was only  last year that we saw
the first conviction, and even then, that was a situation in which the
company had given itself
up.</div><a name="10031837000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
average, 21 people were prosecuted a year, but the Office for National
Statistics records that, in 2009, 2.15 million businesses
were registered for VAT and/or pay-as-you-earn&#151;the most reliable
way of assessing the number of businesses in the UK. One wonders,
therefore, how far apart the prosecution numbers are from the incidence
of bribery. That gives us some idea of the potential scope of the Bill
and its penalty provisions, and of the importance we must attach to
them. That businesses could be fined an unlimited amount and people
could be imprisoned for a maximum of 10 years is a very serious issue,
but something about the figures seems not to add up, especially when
set against the Government&#146;s assessment in the partial impact
assessment for the Bill that the new legislation will result in
only  1.3 more convictions per annum, which we calculate will
increase the current average annual prosecution rate of 21 to 22.3.
That is a spectacularly unambitious target, or perhaps unrealistic,
given the figures I have mentioned, so can the Minister provide the
Committee with an estimate of the cost of the extra 1.3 prosecutions,
bearing in mind the 12-year process that the Bill has gone through and
the innumerable consultation rounds that have been
undertaken?</div><a name="10031837000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
other factors are disconcerting. One is the apparent lack of passion on
the Government&#146;s part regarding the compliance monitoring that
will occur. Thirteen years having been wasted bringing the Bill to
Committee, it now seems that the Bill has become an end in itself,
which is certainly not the case for the Conservative party. We see the
Bill as a starting point, albeit one that we want to get right. The
topsy-turvy world of the Government&#146;s legislative policy is once
again exposed and is indicative of a regime that has run out of
puff.</div>
<a name="10031837000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
factor is that business is being offered limited guidance only on how
to comply with the new law, and that includes penalties. We debated the
point on guidance in relation to clause 9 and raised our concerns then.
Frankly, those concerns continue, despite the Government&#146;s
pulling from their hat a rather inadequate rabbit in the shape of the
letter put before the Committee during the Tuesday afternoon sitting.
In the Under-Secretary&#146;s own words, it is a letter</div>
<a name="10031837000118"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that gives a
draft outline of the guidance that might form part of the guidance
available under clause 9.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Bribery Public Bill Committee, </i>16 March 2010; c.
64-5.]</div><a name="10031837000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
not the sort of concrete direction that business is desperately crying
out for. In reviewing the penalty structure, we seem not to have taken
into account two  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>consequences of the Bill: the exclusion of a company caught under the
Bill from involvement in procurement in the EU; and the far-reaching
powers of sanction under the Proceeds of Crime Act
2002.</div><a name="10031837000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031837000149"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Before my hon. Friend
moves on to those two aspects, does he agree with me that another issue
on which clarification would be useful is precisely how the fine regime
will be implemented? The indication is that there will be a fine
without limit for companies under the provision. I am sure it would be
helpful for companies to understand how such a fine would be
calculated.</div>
<a name="10031837000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000150"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. I am
going to discuss how those penalty provisions tie in with other penalty
provisions, which I think will create a problem. My hon. Friend makes
the basic point that the penalty provisions in the Bill will themselves
need guidance and clear direction, and I thank him for making that
important point.</div>
<a name="10031837000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to
EU procurement, what is proposed in the Bill will give the UK among the
strictest bribery laws in the world. Consequently, we have been told
that there is a real danger that UK business could be put at a
competitive disadvantage compared with international businesses whose
domestic bribery laws will be less strict than our own. How do the
Government intend to put pressure on other countries to follow
suit&#151;not only to strengthen their own bribery legislation but to
initiate prosecutions? The EU procurement directive appears to be very
rigid. Any company found to have been involved in instances of bribery
must be permanently disqualified from the procurement process. Article
45 of the directive requires the mandatory exclusion of suppliers for
public procurement contracts for services, supplies and works. Hon.
Members will be able to see the problem with that. On the one hand, UK
companies will be subject to the strictest bribery laws to be found
anywhere in the world, with very strong penalties attached. On the
other hand, any company caught by these laws could be prevented from
applying for procurement contracts in the EU.</div>
<a name="10031837000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies are
understandably very nervous about the huge impact of falling foul of
the regulations&#151;concerns that are compounded by the fact that
many of the Bill&#146;s provisions remain unclear and are reliant on
guidance that has yet to appear. Will the Under-Secretary give the
Committee details of the discussions that the Government have had with
EU officials to determine what effect, if any, an offence under clause
7 will have under the directive? On Second Reading, the Secretary of
State noted that the Government were giving active consideration to
whether a conviction for the corporate offence of failure to prevent
bribery under clause 7 would require mandatory exclusion under the
directive. We deserve an answer to that issue now, so that business
knows where it
stands.</div><a name="10031837000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Government conceded, this is an extremely complex situation and by
no means a straightforward issue. However, there are obvious
differences of opinion among EU member states on how some aspects of
the directive are to be applied. The concern at the moment is that the
Government&#146;s apparent failure to rectify the issue will
seriously disadvantage British business. The International Chamber of
Commerce has&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div><a name="10031837000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000151"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is going just a little
wide of the clause. I counsel him to bring his remarks back to the
subject of
penalties.</div><a name="10031837000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000152"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The point I am making, Sir Nicholas, is that the
penalties that exist under the EU directives may be additional to the
penalties that exist under the Bill. The penalties in the Bill have to
be looked at in the context of penalties that exist in other
jurisdictions.</div><a name="10031837000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
move on to POCA, an issue on which I touched on Second Reading, when I
asked the Secretary of State whether the Government appreciated that
the sentencing guidelines conflict in some ways with other sentencing
powers, particularly in the 2002 Act. Businesses say that people might
not come forward because, once they have been convicted under this Act,
they might be liable to prosecution and penalties under other Acts. The
Secretary of State said he would look at that. Will the Under-Secretary
tell us whether the Government have indeed taken the opportunity to
consider that
point?</div><a name="10031837000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
of course accept the morally defensible position that those convicted
of a criminal offence who have received proceeds in a criminal way have
to pay them back, but we are not convinced that the interplay between
the statutes is sufficiently clearly stated. For instance, one thinks
of the small company&#151;a frequent example&#151;that falls foul
of a clause 7 offence and the requirement to have adequate procedures
in place to prevent bribery. I gave the example on Tuesday of a small
family-run medical equipment company supplying a foreign state for the
first time and being required to pay a fine to release the machines
from the customs officer. We have already explored the possible
circumstance where the business may fall foul of the legislation as a
consequence of inexperience or naivety.</div>
<a name="10031837000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern
is that the small business may not only be liable for an unlimited fine
under the Bill, but required to pay back all funds received as a
consequence of the facilitation payment made for the medical equipment
at the border. In essence, the company would be being penalised twice.
There seems no provision to say that the penalty charged in one
instance shall not be duplicated under other legislation. I suspect
that such dual financial demands on the company would often prove too
much for it to continue. With that could go jobs and tax revenue, at a
time when the country is in economic turmoil, and in a case where the
fine may be appropriate but the busting of the company totally
inappropriate.</div>
<a name="10031837000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
businesses we have spoken to are worried that prosecution under the
Bill will not be the end of the matter. They are concerned that further
action may be taken against companies under the proceeds of crime
legislation. The International Chamber of Commerce drew parallels with
the situation in the USA. The original purpose of POCA was to prevent
criminals enjoying the proceeds of activities, the same underlying
purpose as the USA&#146;s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act&#151;RICO&#151;passed originally as an anti-mafia
measure. Now RICO is often used in aggressive commercial litigation and
by administrative authorities in furtherance of their policies. The ICC
fears that POCA may have the same potential in the UK.</div>
<a name="10031837000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue
came up in relation to BAE Systems. I will not go into the present
court case but simply highlight the widely known fact that one of the
key problems in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>reaching a settlement was the difficulty in finding a penalty that would
not breach the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the USA, or stop BAE
bidding for contracts under EU law. As a result, negotiations dragged
on for months and a deal was only narrowly secured&#151;and now even
that is being tested.</div>
<a name="10031837000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
one of outcomes. Do we want more successful prosecutions? The
Government, with their 1.3 additional proposed prosecutions, are
presumably saying no. We say that we want more efficient prosecutions
and a legal framework that business understands and can work with, and
that will involve having a system that encourages self-reporting and
plea bargaining. The Under-Secretary must recognise that not only do we
not have such a system at the moment, but this penalty clause leaves
serious questions about whether we can move towards a better
plea-bargaining situation. Will the Under-Secretary give
non-governmental organisations and businesses an indication of the
Government&#146;s policy on the
issue?</div><a name="10031837000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031837000153"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): Does the fine regime relate to
the level of bribe, the level of the contract involved or the level of
turnover of the company? Those are relevant factors. One can break a
company or fine it for a relatively minor
offence.</div><a name="10031837000038"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000154"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point but I do not
know the answer. I ask the Under-Secretary to address that in her
remarks.</div>
<a name="10031837000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">To what
extent will civil rather than criminal remedies be used? Does the
Under-Secretary think that the existing legal framework supports the
desired use of plea bargaining? Does she think that other laws will
hold up deals being made? We are enacting serious criminal legislation
that, if it is to work properly, will require a regulatory framework
involving an understanding of the commercial world in which some of the
decisions will be made. Do we have that understanding from the
Government? I am not entirely
sure.</div><a name="10031837000123"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="10031837000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031837000155"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): Will the
Under-Secretary say a word or two about self-cleansing? There is
concern about the extent of the Serious Fraud Office&#146;s approach
of persuading companies to have internal audit, to co-operate with the
authorities and to confess if they discover bribery. That should be
encouraged, but the interaction of the clause with public contracts
regulations and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 might make that more
difficult. Will she give a perspective on how we can encourage
companies to clean up their acts if, for example, a new management
discovers that there had been dubious practices? Will the effect of the
clause be that, if a prosecution goes ahead, that company will not be
able to tender for public contracts and will be put in a position of
risk? The Joint Committee report states that Jeremy Cole of Lovells
said that a
company</div><a name="10031837000119"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
have no incentive to undertake internal audit and co-operate with the
authorities. On the contrary, it may be encouraged to conceal the
offence...corruption will be driven underground, when preventing
corruption is best achieved by bringing it out into the
open.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div><a name="10031837000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000156"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> To extend that point, the Joint Committee report
also makes it clear that there is concern that self-reporting of any
bribery within a company would be non-existent because of the
automaticity of the penalty that my hon. Friend
describes.</div><a name="10031837000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000157"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Exactly. We have already discussed the range of
situations at the minor end of the scale on which there will be
prosecutorial discretion. I wonder whether the Under-Secretary feels
that, in these cases, the authorities might say, &#147;Look, you have
had internal audit and you have reached the decision to self-report so,
in those circumstances, we think it is right to exercise the discretion
and we&#146;ll go for civil recovery,&#148; instead of going down
the criminal route and ending up with the penalties described in the
clause.</div><a name="10031837000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031837000158"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I apologise to the hon. Member
for Huntingdon for slipping out of the room for a few minutes during
his speech, but my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
has filled me in on what he said. However, the point that I want to
address is one that he made when I was still present, and it was also
made by the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire.</div><a name="10031837000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not understand the problem that the Conservatives seem to have with
the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the point of which is to strip
criminals of the gains that they have made from crime, which is a
perfectly appropriate approach for such economic crimes. They are
precisely the sorts of crime that the Act ought to be aimed at, instead
of dealing just with the proceeds of drug dealing, for example. The
fines agreed in recent cases are low compared with the size of the
deals involved. For example, in the BAE case to which the hon. Member
for Huntingdon referred, we were talking about a $250 million fine in
the US and &#163;30 million in the UK, which sounds a lot, but not
compared with the deals. The al-Yamamah deal was worth somewhere in the
region of &#163;40 billion, and even the Tanzanian one was &#163;25
million. Given the scale involved, it is quite appropriate for
prosecutors to have proceeds of crime legislation available to
them.</div><a name="10031837000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point&#151;this is somewhat contrary to the position of the hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire &#151;is that I hope that
we can look forward to an increase in penalties as a result of the
Bill? One of the existing problems is not the maximums, but the way in
which they are dealt with in the sentencing guidelines, because
prosecutors find that that limits the payments that can be required
from offending companies. The Secretary of State said on Second Reading
that he would look at the issue, so I hope that the Under-Secretary can
confirm that that is the case and that the sentencing guidelines for
this new offence will be more robust than those for existing
offences.</div><a name="10031837000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031837000159"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I have two points to make. One of
my fears about what might happen with this Bill relates to the way in
which the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 is being abused. As one of my
constituents is finding, it is being used for fishing trips to catch
people who are, at the very most, marginally involved in what might
eventually be considered a serious crime. We need to make sure that the
Bill does not go down that path as that would be unfair and a
retrograde step. I want to ask the Under-Secretary some questions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>about how she thinks that this will fit in at an international level and
to pick up some of the points about us not having a level playing
field.</div><a name="10031837000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
issues come out of the OECD commentary, the first of which is the
question of corporate liability. The latest edition of the commentary
says that 24 of the  36 signatories to the convention are yet
to implement a mechanism on corporate liability, so we are already at a
disadvantage there. However, when it comes to setting the fine, the
commentary identifies three groups of countries that take completely
different approaches. One group fixes the penalty well below the
€500,000 mark. Clearly the commentary and the convention do not
see that as a particularly advantageous way of implementing this sort
of legislation, as it says that that is inadequate to deal with
corruption, particularly among multinational companies.</div>
<a name="10031837000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the second
group of countries, which includes some of our major European
allies&#151;Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and
Italy&#151;there is a maximum penalty of around €1 million.
There is some doubt as to where Japan fits in, but it does not seem to
have the unlimited penalty that is envisaged by this Bill. The
commentary says that there are several jurisdictions in which there is
an unlimited amount, but unfortunately it does not name them all,
although Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland take such an approach. It
therefore seems that there is a very unlevel playing field. What
assessment has been done of how the UK fits into that? What plan does
the Under-Secretary foresee going forward under the aegis of the OECD
to bring everyone to the same level so that there is not an unlevel
playing
field?</div><a name="10031837000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also like to pick up the question about the proportionality of
these penalties. It is clear that there needs to be strong guidance on
the basis on which the penalties will be levied. If they are to be
based on a percentage of turnover, there is an argument that that would
be fairer, in terms of the mix of large companies and small and
medium-sized enterprises, than an approach that would be
disproportionate, particularly for SMEs that are trying to do business
overseas and are much more vulnerable to the sort of activity that we
have been
discussing.</div><a name="10031837000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000160"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Claire
Ward):</b> It is good to have you back in the Chair, Sir
Nicholas. I hope that we will have a more conducive sitting this
morning.</div><a name="10031837000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
listened to the hon. Member for Huntingdon with interest. Businesses
might want to consider carefully what he said, which was that he wanted
more prosecutions. That is not the Government&#146;s policy, because
if the Bill works correctly, it will act as an enormous deterrent to
ensure that companies do not engage in bribery and that they have in
place adequate procedures to ensure that they, or those who act on
their behalf, do not do so.</div>
<a name="10031837000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
we do not see a rapid increase in the number of prosecutions, but there
will be circumstances in which it will be appropriate for full
prosecution and a trial to take place. However, we also want to
encourage companies to self-refer by contacting the prosecuting
authorities and discussing circumstances in which they have found that
bribery might have taken place. In those circumstances, it might be
more appropriate for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>company to plead guilty, because it has self-referred and wishes to
clear up the problems it has found within the organisation. The
authorities could deal with that more appropriately in ways other than
a full prosecution, perhaps even through fines or civil recovery
procedures.
</div><a name="10031837000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies
will feel satisfied that the purpose of the legislation is to prevent
bribery, but if it does take place, we will deal with it appropriately.
The Bill is not intended simply to drag as many companies as possible
through the courts, and I think that companies will be worried by what
the hon. Member for Huntingdon has suggested.</div>
<a name="10031850000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000161"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> As the Under-Secretary knows, I support the idea of
self-cleansing and persuading companies to clean up their acts, and I
want new managements to be able to do that. What is the interaction
between the Bill and public contracts regulations? If a company that
self-reports will subsequently be unable to get a public contract, that
will be quite an obstacle. Am I right in thinking that the approach
that the Serious Fraud Office has outlined of trying to encourage
self-reporting would mean that, in many cases, civil recovery could
take place and there would be no need for a formal conviction that
would bring in the question of public contracts
regulations?</div><a name="10031850000002"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000162"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I shall come back to article 45 directions, but I
simply say that that will, of course, depend upon the circumstances of
businesses, what has happened, how they found out about it, whether
they self-referred and whether they were willing to hold their hands up
and say, &#147;It shouldn&#146;t have happened and we want to deal
with it and co-operate with the authorities.&#148; That is a sensible
way to proceed for businesses, but they will be concerned about
the position that the hon. Member for Huntingdon is taking on behalf of
the Conservative party.</div>
<a name="10031837000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000163"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I really have to address this point because I
think that the Minister cannot have heard half of what I have said in
Committee. We have been talking about the need for better guidance and
to encourage people to come forward, as my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire said. Of course, the approach is about not
only this Bill, and prosecutions and penalties; we are saying that it
is about much more than that. However, the Under-Secretary must
appreciate that the level of prosecutions has been very low at a time
when a huge amount of fraud has been reported by outside organisations
and the OECD and others have been saying that we have not been cracking
down on bribery as we should have been.</div>
<a name="10031837000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000164"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The hon. Gentleman will, no doubt, wish to refer to
the appropriate point in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, where he will find that he
said in his opening remarks that he wanted more prosecutions. If that
is the simple outcome that he wants from the Bill, he fails to see the
complexity of the issue and the wider point of how we want the Bill to
prevent bribery in the first place. The most important aspect of clause
7 is the encouragement for companies to have adequate
procedures.</div><a name="10031837000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
estimate that the number of prosecutions of commercial organisations
will be 1.3 per year, but that figure refers to contested cases under
clause 7. We are therefore estimating that there might be one
additional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>contested Serious Fraud Office prosecution of a commercial organisation
per year, and one additional contested Crown Prosecution Service
prosecution every three years. However, our policy is designed to limit
the number of prosecutions because there are other ways of dealing with
the problem and the main purpose of the Bill is to stop bribery from
taking place in the first instance, which is something with which I
hope the hon. Gentleman will
agree.</div><a name="10031837000124"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10031837000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
11 sets out the penalties for the offences. In the case of the two
general offences and the offence  of bribery of a foreign
public official, the maximum penalty following conviction on indictment
is 10 years&#146; imprisonment or an unlimited fine. That compares
with the existing maximum prison term of seven years. The increase to
10 years reflects the seriousness with which the Government view the
offences, and we make no apology for stating yet again that we see
bribery as a serious offence. Through the Bill, we are setting a high
threshold that we hope companies can meet to ensure that they are not
engaged in
bribery.</div><a name="10031837000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
maximum penalty for a corporate offence will be an unlimited fine. In
the normal and proper way, the appropriate fine in any individual case
will be determined by the sentencing
court.</div><a name="10031837000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000165"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Will the Under-Secretary give
way?</div><a name="10031837000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000166"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I might be about to deal with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, but I will give
way.</div><a name="10031837000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000167"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> If the Under-Secretary was about to elucidate her
point, I shall let her do that and intervene later, if she will allow
me. As she might be anticipating, I want to explore a point raised by
my hon. Friend the Member for Poole. On what basis might a fine be
calculated, because I can think of at least three different
bases?</div><a name="10031837000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000168"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> As our response to the report by the Joint Committee
explained, when assessing the level of all
fines,</div><a name="10031837000120"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including
those for existing corporate offences, the courts are required by law
to ensure that the amount imposed reflects the seriousness of the
offence and the circumstances of the case, including the known
financial circumstances of the
offender.&#148;</div><a name="10031837000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the concern raised by Conservative
Members.</div><a name="10031837000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000169"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I understand that. However, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Poole suggested, there seem to be three possible
bases&#151;the size of the company, the size of the deal, and the
scale of the wrongdoing&#151;that could lead to completely different
conclusions. It might be helpful if the Government gave some indication
as to which of the three they believe to be
pre-eminent.</div><a name="10031837000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we dealing with a large company that is carrying out a small deal, by
its standards, but there is substantial wrongdoing, what level of fine
should the court be considering? Alternatively, if a small company is
carrying out, by its standards, a big deal and there is minimal
wrongdoing, what standards should the court apply? Those are three
different things.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div><a name="10031837000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000170"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> They are, but it is not for the Government to try to
tie the hands of the sentencing court. The court will make a
determination after considering the seriousness of the offence, the
nature of the business and its assets. At a specific level, the
determination is  a matter for a court, not the Government. If
there is a desire for guidance further to assist the courts to
determine what fines are appropriate, we will consider asking the new
sentencing council to draw up suitable
guidelines.</div>
<a name="10031837000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000171"></a>John
Howell:</b> The Under-Secretary makes a powerful argument,
from her point of view, but does she accept that the Government have a
duty to say that the system used&#151;whatever it is&#151;should be
proportionate and reasonable? Surely they are the guiding principles of
that system, so will she write that into the
Bill?</div><a name="10031837000068"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000172"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> They are not something we can write into the Bill.
No amendment of that nature has been tabled by the hon. Gentleman or
his colleagues. However, those are issues that the court will consider
when taking account of the seriousness of the offence and deciding what
is
reasonable.</div><a name="10031837000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000173"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Henley has just
made an important point, as he did when he said that this proposal has
to be put in the context of what other countries do. The
Under-Secretary says that the matter should be left to our courts, but
the fines imposed by American courts are huge compared with those set
by this country&#146;s judges and courts. There has to be some
international balancing, so I am not sure whether she can say that the
matter should be left to our
courts.</div><a name="10031837000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000174"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I think that it should be left to the courts. The
Criminal Justice Act 2003 sets out the issues a court must consider
when sentencing. The hon. Gentleman has referred throughout our debates
to what the Americans do and the practice in other parts of the world,
but I want to make it absolutely clear that we are setting a high
standard with the Bribery Bill. It is a gold standard, and the Bill is
recognised by the OECD as being of a higher standard. The fact that
other countries do something different or less
acceptable&#151;perhaps by allowing facilitation payments&#151;does
not mean that we endorse them. We are setting a higher standard, and we
think that the rest of the world will in due course follow the higher
standards that this country is setting to ensure that we stamp out
bribery and
corruption.</div><a name="10031837000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000175"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Under-Secretary has entirely missed the
point that my hon. Friends the Members for Rugby and Kenilworth and for
Henley and I are making. We are saying that in jurisdictions such as
the United States, the penalties are much more stringent than those in
this country. The Under-Secretary has tried to turn that on its head by
claiming that penalties are tougher here, but that is not the case.
Other parts of the world are more stringent, and my hon. Friends and I
are asking how we can leave it to the courts to make the assessment
when the issue needs to be looked at
internationally.</div><a name="10031837000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000176"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Because when our courts are sentencing, they do not
think, &#147;What do the Americans do?&#148; They look at
guidelines, legislation and what is expected in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>this country. We are setting a high standard by stating that the fine
can be unlimited, and its level will be appropriate to the
circumstances of the
case.</div><a name="10031837000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000177"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Does not the Under-Secretary appreciate that to
deal with international bribery, when the crime is unlikely to take
place in this country, we have to look at the issue on an international
basis?</div><a name="10031837000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000178"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The hon. Gentleman cannot make comparisons between
the American system and
ours.</div><a name="10031837000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000179"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Why
not?</div><a name="10031837000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000180"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Because the cases that go before the American courts
are of a different nature from those that go before ours. They are
different because the American system has a body that exempts certain
types of cases from ever reaching the courts and the Americans have a
different system of plea
bargaining.</div><a name="10031837000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000181"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Under-Secretary again totally misrepresents
the facts. We have only ever had two prosecutions for overseas bribery
in this country; America had 40 last
year.</div><a name="10031837000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000182"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Which is the very reason why&#151;I am sorry, Sir
Nicholas, that we are straying slightly away from the clause&#151;we
are introducing the clause 6 offence. We want to make it easier to deal
with cases involving the bribery of a foreign public official, instead
of relying on existing legislation, which has not been as effective as
we would have liked. That is the precise reason why we want the clause
6 offence. The hon. Gentleman is not really making the point that he
thinks he is
making.</div><a name="10031837000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000183"></a>John
Howell</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="10031837000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000184"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I shall give way one more time before dealing with
the
matter.</div><a name="10031837000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000185"></a>John
Howell:</b> I thank the Under-Secretary for giving way again;
she is being very generous with her time. Are there not two issues
involved? Once the Bill is passed, the courts will deal with these
matters under UK law according to its provisions. However, the Bill
derives a lot of its impetus from the OECD and an international
arrangement. I find dealing with the OECD conventions difficult,
although I have had some experience of doing so. However, that
international dimension needs to be taken into account when framing the
Bill in the first place.</div>
<a name="10031837000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000186"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> It would be fair to say that in comparison with
other OECD countries, we have dramatically increased the number of live
criminal investigations over the past two years. As a result of
dedicated police resources, we now have more than 20 live cases. Our
foreign bribery investigations have resulted in two non-criminal fines,
two criminal convictions and an ongoing prosecution, which puts the UK
ahead of the OECD trend on legal proceedings. We already have quite a
good reputation, and we are looking to enhance our reputation as a
result of what we will be capable of under the
Bill.</div><a name="10031837000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman refers to the international context. We are trying to
raise the threshold of what is acceptable behaviour by
companies&#151;domestically or abroad&#151;to prevent bribery from
taking place. Our requirements will be at a higher level than those of
many other  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>OECD countries, so it would not be appropriate to make direct
comparisons with them. We think that we will be the leaders as a result
of the Bill, not the followers of the rest of the OECD
countries.</div><a name="10031837000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me deal with other issues that hon. Members have raised. The clause
provides for lower maximum penalties to apply following summary
conviction in a magistrates court. In such cases, the maximum sentence
for clause 1, 2 and 6 offences will be a 12-month sentence and/or a
&#163;5,000 fine, or &#163;1,000 in Scotland. The maximum jail term
will increase from six months in England and Wales once the
custody-plus provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 are brought
into
force.</div><a name="10031837000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon asked about the article 45 directive. We are
aware that that is a serious issue and that companies are keen to know
what will happen. We are working on this complex issue in relation to
clause 7, and we hope to be able to reach a view on it shortly.
However, I can assure hon. Members that the Government&#146;s
position will be clear before any of the offences are brought into
force.</div>
<a name="10031837000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000187"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Under-Secretary gives the same response that
the Secretary of State gave on Second Reading. Are we to infer that
there has been no change in position and no further contact since
Second Reading? Given that the Bill is going through Parliament, one
would have thought that that would have been a priority for the
Government, so will the Under-Secretary tell us what has happened since
Second Reading?</div>
<a name="10031837000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000188"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that there
has been no action since Second Reading. The matter is under detailed
consideration, but it involves complex issues surrounding the
possibility of companies being debarred permanently as a result of the
implementation of article 45 with regard to clause 7 offences. That is
why we are giving the matter serious consideration, and we will come to
a view on it as soon as we
can.</div><a name="10031837000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000189"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The hon. Lady says that discussions are continuing.
Are they internal discussions in government, or are they being held

countries?</div><a name="10031837000125"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

get the decision
right.</div><a name="10031837000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000193"></a>David
Howarth:</b><b class="B"> </b>Thank you for the introduction,
Sir Nicholas; I am not sure that I deserve
it.</div><a name="10031837000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
started debating the clause during our consideration of clause 10, so I
shall not spend a great deal of time repeating what was said then and
will just set out the problem. Clause 13 creates a statutory defence
for  the intelligence services and the armed forces when, in
the course of their functions, it is necessary for them to violate
either clause 1 or clause 2&#151;in other words, to give a bribe or
to receive a bribe. Interestingly, as the Under-Secretary said in our
debate on clause 10, clause 13 does not exempt the
intelligence services or the armed forces from clause 6, which deals
with the offence of bribing a foreign official. When there is an
overlap, and both a clause 1 crime and a clause 6 crime have been
committed, the clause 6 rule takes precedence, so the extent of clause
13 is limited to private sector bribery by the British intelligence
services or the British armed
forces.</div><a name="10031837000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
basic stance is that the clause should not be in the Bill, which we
shall discuss during the stand part debate. However, I am open to
persuasion that it is possible to narrow the scope of the defence to
make it more satisfactory. Three groups of amendments have been tabled
to achieve that, the first of which is about the intelligence services.
The defence relates to the functions of the intelligence services, but
the provision dealing with them shows that they have three functions.
One is in regard to national security, which would be perfectly
relevant to clause 13 if it were to be kept in the Bill. The second
function relates to the national economic interest, and the third is
concerned with the detection of
crime.</div><a name="10031837000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government will have to concede that the third element&#151;the
detection of crime&#151;should not be in the Bill. In the Lords, they
agreed that law enforcement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>agencies should not be covered by the clause so, by implication, they
conceded that point. I shall be interested to hear what the
Under-Secretary says about how the Bill will be made consistent,
because the law enforcement functions of the intelligence services seem
to be covered, but not the law enforcement functions of the police and
the normal law enforcement
agencies.</div><a name="10031837000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
23, 24 and 20 focus on the national economic interest. It is not
legitimate for that function to attract the same protection as national
security. The problem is not theoretical. The Committee will recall the
al-Yamamah case, when the director of the Serious Fraud Office called
off the investigation in controversial circumstances. When the papers
came out from the court cases surrounding that issue, it became clear
that the Prime Minister of the day, Mr. Blair, was
originally most concerned about national economic issues, such as the
economic benefit to be gained from selling more fighter aircraft to
Saudi Arabia. He had to be told, in quite straightforward terms, by the
then Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, that such considerations were
not appropriate under international law, because the OECD convention on
bribery rules out the use of economic considerations when deciding
whether a prosecution should be brought, or their use as part of the
national regime controlling
corruption.</div><a name="10031837000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that exchange between the Attorney-General and Prime Minister of the
time, it is clear that if the Bill allows national economic
considerations to be a defence in any way, even under the limited
circumstances of the clause, we will be in violation of our
international obligations under the OECD convention. Apart from that,
it would be wrong for such a defence to apply to the non-national
security functions of the intelligence
services.</div><a name="10031837000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments attempt to deal with the issue in two ways. One approach, in
amendment 20, is to say that the defence applies if national security
reasons are engaged. There might be additional reasons for which the
actions of the intelligence services were engaged, but they would have
to include national security. The approach in amendments 23 and 24 goes
one step further and is more in line with our international
obligations. The amendments would effectively rule out cases in which
national economic considerations were involved. This serious issue
involves our international obligations, so I will be interested to hear
what the Government envisage as the way
forward.</div><a name="10031837000106"></a>

Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="10031837000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally,
we are more concerned that the question of authorisation is dealt with,
rather than the amendments, which would restrict the scope of the
circumstances in which the security services could pay bribes to cases
involving national security or the prevention and detection of serious
crime. It is hard to foresee the circumstances in which such cases
would arise, but I understand how frustrating it would be if the
security services did not have such powers when they were needed, even
if an appropriate authorisation process was
available.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000197"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> In the modern world, to what extent does my hon.
Friend think that economic considerations and national security
considerations can be closely intertwined, such as with energy
security?</div><a name="10031837000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031837000198"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> In practice, those considerations are clearly
intertwined, which is why I had problems thinking of circumstances in
which we should have particular carve-outs. Binding people&#146;s
hands in such a way would be inappropriate, and the question is whether
such actions should be allowed in the first place. That is a valid
argument, and it might be the motivation behind the
amendments.</div>
