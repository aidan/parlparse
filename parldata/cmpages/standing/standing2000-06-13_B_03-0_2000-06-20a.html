<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara, you and others will have read in the weekend press that there is a question about the legality of one or two issues in the Bill, particularly the proposal that recruiting should be on a 50:50 basis. My party wants the police to be more equally represented, but a query has arisen on whether the Bill will be legal in terms of European legislation. It is incumbent on the Minister to say whether it is likely to be in line with the European convention on human rights.

<P>
On the front page of the Bill the Secretary of State says that, in his opinion, it is compatible with the convention rights. It would be welcome if the Minister would confirm that it will not infringe European law, or, as he is not a lawyer, if he would obtain the opinion of the Law Officers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit Öpik </B>(Montgomeryshire): rose-

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> This is a point of order and I do not know whether I can give way.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Only to the Chairman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It is important that our proceedings are not a charade that will become an embarrassment to the House. Either the Minister should give the Committee a definitive response to the allegation or we should adjourn until the Law Officers can advise him that the Bill will be legal and will not give rise to a series of cases being brought at an early stage as the Bill becomes an Act and is implemented. We do not want to go through the trauma-

<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead) rose-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Only the Chairman can intervene on a point of order. I think that I have heard enough.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have finished.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was being patient to enable the hon. Gentleman to pursue his point fully. I shall point out two things. First, the Bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights, which is a Council of European convention, not a European Union convention. Secondly, this is not a point of order, it is a matter for debate. Does the Minister wish to respond?

<P>
<B>Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram) I understand the direction that the hon. Gentleman is taking and I should like to assist him, but I am not sure whether this is further to his point of order.</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should clarify that I have ruled that this is not a point of order, but is a matter for debate. I am inviting the Minister to respond on those terms.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are conscious of the basis on which the hon. Gentleman raises this issue. He has read the speculation contained in press articles-I do not know whether he has seen anything further-and I shall respond to the points raised. Your comments will be welcome, Mr. O'Hara, as to whether this is an appropriate subject for debate and whether this is an appropriate time to discuss it. We are aware that a draft directive on employment is being considered. The United Kingdom Government are seeking an exception in negotiations with our European Union partners, which would enable a 50:50 recruitment programme to achieve a police service representative of the community in Northern Ireland. We will expand on that in detail when we debate that part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is a useful response from the Minister, but I have ruled that this is not a point of order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) has moved amendment No. 111 and spoken to amendment Nos. 112, 113 and 114. Within that group we still desire to speak to amendments Nos. 120 to 125.

<P>
I need not say much about amendment No. 120. In it, we seek to curtail the choice that the Secretary of State will have in relation to this part of the Bill, by substituting the word ``shall'' for the word ``may''. I am not sure whether the Minister has responded on that general point, but this matter will arise from time to time. It is a matter of concern that a Bill that deals with law and order is so vague as consistently to give the Secretary of State the opportunity to make up his own mind, rather than firmly enshrining the matter in law-in this case, in relation to the removal of members from office during a period of developed government. Many of us look forward to a time of devolved government, when a person in that body, not the Secretary of State, will have responsibility for appointing people to, and removing them from, office. It makes sense to have firm and specific criteria in relation to how and when that should be done. I press the Minister to give more than a passing thought to whether ``may'' should be replaced with ``shall''. As the Minister will recognise, a provision that is vague and open to interpretation is also open to misinterpretation, which is undesirable.

<P>
Amendment No. 121 concerns a matter that is something of a problem for those of us who believe that a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence should be removed. The Bill is not specific enough. As in other parts of the Bill, we should ensure that the person to be removed is a person who has been
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at any time convicted in Northern Ireland or elsewhere of an offence and has had passed on him a sentence of imprisonment (whether suspended or not);'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It has been suggested that that is far too stringent a proposal, which may lead to young people who admit to offences in their youth being, so to speak, damned for the rest of their lives. Many of us believe that once young people reach 18 years of age-the age of discretion, at which they can vote, serve in the armed forces or be sent to prison for an offence-they should be subject to such judgment. The youth offenders to whom we have heard reference would not fall within that category, so that would not be a good argument for rejecting the amendment. We should like the Bill to ensure that those who have been involved in breaking the law cannot be placed in charge of, or given responsibility for, policing in Northern Ireland.

<P>
There are 1.7 million people in Northern Ireland, and those who have been involved in terrorism represent a minute percentage of the population as a whole. I know from experience that many people from both traditions would be willing to serve on a new Policing Board. It would be wrong, purely for political reasons-bad political reasons-to draft the Bill loosely.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Those who have less than 100 per cent. genuine interest in the future of Northern Ireland might nominate people who give the greatest offence to the rest of society. It would not matter whether republican or loyalist terrorists were involved-both would seek to exploit the situation if the opportunity presented itself. They offend and cause suspicion among the majority of people in both traditions in Northern Ireland.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Although I accept that some people may seek to exploit the situation that the hon. Gentleman described, does he agree that the debate is complicated by the likelihood that many of the people who would be excluded could perform a useful, practical function in the service and on the Policing Board?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am sure that the drunken surgeon who is prevented from carrying out brain surgery could have performed a wonderful service to society if he had not become a drunk. When I hear the arguments of some Committee members, I wonder whether drunken brain surgeons have operated on them-[
Interruption.] It is all very well to be liberal and a reformer-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are having a serious debate, and the hon. Gentleman's speech should not be interrupted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I did not think that I would create such competition among Committee members, who are doubtless seeking to establish which of them has undergone brain surgery.

<P>
It is all very well to be generous and liberal-the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) is undoubtedly both-but policing and law and order also has a serious side. I wish that I could persuade the Committee members to look beyond Northern Ireland-perhaps we should consider some of the policing issues that are raised by events that we have witnessed on our television screens during the past few days and weeks.

<P>
Should we take risks with the policing arrangements for the next decade or two in Northern Ireland? We are moving into a difficult period-many people have lost their confidence in the democratic process. They have made many concessions to bring erstwhile terrorists and the acolytes of terrorists into the democratic process, but they do not want to move beyond that point. Our society has a great need for reassurance. It embarrasses me, as a supporter of the current political process, to have to say that the terrorists have yet to disarm a single bullet or a single ounce of semtex, or prove to society that a single dump has been secured by Mr. Ahtisaari or Mr. Ramaphosa. That is the reality with which I must live, rather than the vague prospect that, if we merely interweave a little loose liberalism into the Bill, there will be a Damascus road conversion, and everyone will come on-side to meet their obligations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be under the misapprehension that my proposal is the soft option. Surely the sophisticated approach is to acknowledge that some people should be redeemed from the exclusion that he describes. That is not woolly liberalism, but the kind of forgiveness that we have discussed in Committee in the past. Anyone with genuine religious convictions-regardless of which side of the religious divide they are on in Northern Ireland-should take seriously the question of forgiveness, rather than regarding such comments as trite. In a debate such as this, we need to adopt that more sophisticated approach.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am afraid that it is exceedingly difficult to be sophisticated in the way in which the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire describes, given the prospect that a number of terrorist organisations may return to violence. Indeed, some have yet to depart from it. Unlike others, I shall not be tempted into the world of theology, except to say that, as has been noted, forgiveness is largely dependent on contrition. Forgiveness is not a one-way street.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): We should leave aside theological debate and recognise the practical reality that a Policing Board that contains former terrorists is unlikely to command cross-community support and confidence. The presence of such former terrorists would defeat the Bill's purpose and undermine confidence in the new Policing Board.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right-that is the point that I am trying to make. At the moment, it appears to be difficult for some people to accept as genuine the differing political views of others. If we must overcome such prejudices, it is all the more essential to overcome the sort of prejudice that I admit that I would have against the inclusion of erstwhile terrorists on the Policing Board.

<P>
I need to say little about amendment No. 123. We have already admitted that there is a drafting error in part II and that we should be more stringent when appointing members of the board. The Minister should tell the Committee whether the Government's objective is further political negotiation and accommodation. If so, the Minister should admit that that gainsays the details of the Belfast agreement and is unfair to those who are in a minority here, because we do not have equal authority as we would have in proper political negotiations. However, if he believes that that will enhance law and order in Northern Ireland, I would be interested to hear his constructive argument.

<P>
Last weekend, I met three journalists who write for newspapers in the Irish Republic. They wanted to discuss the Bill and I asked them what Pat Byrne, Commissioner of the Garda Siochana, would say if he was presented with the Bill and told that it was the basis on which he was to run the Garda Siochana. I did not receive an answer and the journalists almost fell off their seats laughing. No part of the United Kingdom or Ireland, other than Northern Ireland, would be presented with such a Bill and told that it covers law and order. It is not about law and order. Sadly for some, I shall repeat that again and again. It is not about law and order. It imposes political accommodation on the greater number of people, to their disadvantage, and facilitates terrorism. That is the reality.

<P>
Amendment No. 124 refers to the length of time for which people should be excluded from membership of the board. Paragraph 10(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person removed from office under paragraph 9(1) is disqualified for membership of the Board until the date of the dissolution of the Assembly next following his removal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is nonsense. The conditions attached to membership of the board are very liberal and if someone infringes the conditions a month before the Assembly is due to be re-elected, he can be reappointed within a month. How can the Minister justify that? Given the liberal conditions, if someone manages to get himself disqualified as a member of the board, he should stay disqualified. How is it in the interests of society to find a way of bringing back on to the board someone who has demonstrated by his behaviour or actions that he is not worthy to be on it?

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 125 would bring this part of the Bill into line with the part of the Bill that deals with disqualification in relation to district policing partnerships. If the Minister rejects the amendment, he will be telling me that he is prepared to have at the highest level-on the Policing Board-people who would not be able to qualify as members of district policing partnerships, at a much lower district council level. The only consistency seems to lie in the fact that this provision is to do not with policing, but with providing yet another stepping stone for erstwhile terrorists to be placed in authority over the police.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 120 to 125 are important. If they are rejected, it will show that the Government do not want the Bill to provide consistency across the whole administration of policing in Northern Ireland. I hope that the Minister will take time to give specific reasons why he wants to preside over a mish-mash of legislation that is inconsistent from top to bottom, does nothing to reassure the greater number of people in Northern Ireland, and undermines the confidence of those people in the type of law and order that we are to have for decades to come. On his shoulders rests the responsibility of telling us whether the Government are, through the Bill, abandoning Northern Ireland to the mafia sub-culture that, although it has been there for 30 years, is beginning to make its presence more obvious in terms of pure criminality than ever before.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have had a long and important debate, in which several fundamental issues are at stake. I suspect that it is not yet over, because the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) will not be satisfied with my explanation.

<P>
The debate has highlighted the clear water between those who seek vision and those who want caution and safeguards. Opposition Members' arguments for the amendments were based on the premise that while a change in attitude has progressively taken place, it has not yet gone far enough to justify the provisions of the Bill. Some would even say-taking an absolutist approach and applying it rigidly-that they do not want to do anything at this stage further to encourage that change. Their argument could be that they do not see enough evidence of real change and therefore do not want the Bill to deal with certain key issues involved in progress in Northern Ireland. To sum up that view, it is that the Bill goes too far-it makes too many concessions to unreconstructed terrorists-and that because evildoers have not changed, we should not do anything to encourage them to take positive steps.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) quoted Yeats, who wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Too long a sacrifice<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Can make a stone of the heart.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sums up his view in a poetic and graphic manner.

<P>
The Opposition amendments on disqualification would tie the Secretary of State's hands. The Government have sought to find a mechanism that will allow for inclusiveness, especially with regard to democratically elected representatives, and uphold the strong principle that those who are not committed to non-violence should have no part to play in the administration of the new policing structures.

<P>
The position that was adopted by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh is the reverse of that which I have described. His view is that changes cannot occur without a fundamental change in the attitudes and actions of the Government and of others across the board. I was struck by his exchange during our previous sitting with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and by their respective career paths. My hon. Friend said that we should appreciate the opportunities, or lack of them, that the young people in his part of the community have. That gave a reason, but not a justification, for the fact that some choose a path of violence. If one understood, but did not accept, their view, one might take a different approach and avoid repeating previous mistakes. I have some sympathy with that approach. It is axiomatic that the more that we understand the reason for conflict, the greater will be our ability to avoid it in future. That involves not condoning violence but putting it in context.

<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, who is not currently in his place, took a similar but more cautious view-some might call it romantic-of the human condition. I understand the direction from which he comes. All Committee members and all reasonable people share the vision of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh about the ultimate objective, namely, a better and more normal society in Northern Ireland. However, the questions are, how do we get there, and how do we reconcile those views?

<P>
The Government have to absorb the diametrically opposed positions in this context and find a way through this very difficult maze. By and large, the Bill will do that. I am reminded of Edmund Burke's response, when he was asked whether he led public opinion or followed it. He said, ``I meet it on the way.'' In many ways, that could apply to the Bill's development. Our approach involves starting from the framework that was provided by Patten, which states that when a democratic mandate has been given to a party, that should be respected and responded to. The route to entry is through the ballot box-no true democrat would deny that. However, the process should be subject to regular scrutiny, and those who use the ballot box as an entry into democratic society must at all times adhere to the high standards that are set by democracy.

<P>
It is the power of argument that should prevail, not the argument of power. That is why paragraphs 4 and 9 contain the new condition, which does not apply to members of the Police Authority, that all members of the new policing board, whether political or independent, will have to pass a test of upholding the principles of non-violence and of democratic and exclusively peaceful means. If they do not, the Secretary of State will be able to remove them.

<P>
There are other safeguards. To serve on the board, independent members who are appointed by the Secretary of State will be subject to character tests, based on high standards of probity and integrity. By its very nature, that requires examination of the past and present activities of those who wish to serve on the board as independents. There is nothing new in that, and it is a sensible approach, given the power and responsibility of the new body.

<P>
The amendments would place additional constraints on the Secretary of State's capacity to change the face of policing in Northern Ireland that are neither necessary nor proportionate. Although the Government want inclusiveness, the provision will require board members to conform to the law-abiding ethos of a normal society, and I have highlighted some safeguards that seek to achieve that.

<P>
Different justifications were given for the amendments, but I am regarding them as probing amendments, because the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) suggested as much. I am assuming that they are intended to discover what is in the Government's mind and where we are coming from, and I believe that the Bill can withstand such examination. However, the Bill is not cast in stone. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said that he will keep returning to his mantra, and I shall return to mine. I repeat that, as we have already shown, we are prepared to listen, fine tune and take on board strong and reasoned arguments that will enhance this new-and, we hope, long-lasting-concept.

<P>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is not in his place, and I acknowledge the amendments that he tabled and the arguments that he advanced. In respect of paragraph 9, which will apply during devolved government, and paragraph 4, which will apply during suspension of devolved government, amendments Nos. 141 and 142-for which he argued in the previous sitting-would enable removal from the board of a person with a criminal record only where the offence was committed while serving on the board. Clearly, such a provision would not cater for circumstances in which an independent has not disclosed a criminal record prior to appointment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman would agree that we need to provide for that. Although past character will be examined, there will obviously be occasions when certain matters may not come to light. The Secretary of State and those who carry out functions on his behalf will be expected to examine the past of those who seek to serve, but the onus will be on applicants to be up front and honest about relevant matters.

<P>
I have reflected on amendments Nos. 141 and 142-

<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If I may, I should like to finish this point. I have reflected on the amendments and concluded that the provision should be clarified for the benefit of the board and district policing partnerships. Therefore, I have tabled amendments to schedule 3, and I will table amendments to schedule 1 on Report. They will deal with the concern raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, while still enabling the Secretary of State, or the board or a council-under schedule 1 and schedule 3 respectively-to remove an independent who has failed to disclose a conviction. I hope that Committee members will accept that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> When the Minister says that, during suspension of devolved government, applicants to the board will be asked whether they have a criminal record, does he mean that those who answer yes will not be appointed, or will they be appointed even through they committed a criminal offence in the past? If the latter is the case, why are our amendments being rejected?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was about to discuss the main thrust of the amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman and his colleague, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Flexibility must be built into the provision because, by definition, it could apply to those who committed the criminal offence of failing to disclose a traffic violation. The hon. Gentleman's absolutist position and the way in which the amendments are drafted could result in the removal of such people, but I do not believe that that is his objective. [
Interruption.] The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone can respond when I have finished, but that is my interpretation.

<P>
The Secretary of State will carry out character tests on everyone who applies to be a member of any board. He will have to ensure that they meet the highest standards of probity and integrity and they will be asked probing questions about their past.

<P>

<P>
If we moved from a devolved to a non-devolved situation with loss of independents, and members who had served as political members applied to serve as independents on the non-devolved board, the same examination would be carried out. Under the devolved structure, the 10 political members would be appointed by another process, although the conditions in the schedule covering a commitment to non-violence and the other criteria on convictions and so on would apply. If something new came to light, the Secretary of State would have to take that fully into account. Many belts and braces exist to try to ensure that there is maximum scrutiny and discretion in making judgments, because the situation is unique in the United Kingdom. There is no question about that and it runs through everything that the Government have tried to do in Northern Ireland.

<P>
I said earlier that we have not had many friends beside us as we have tried to push forward the underlying principles of the Good Friday agreement. There was bipartisan support for it, but-it is usually a big but-there are divisions and some people say that we are going beyond the normal standards that apply in the remainder of the United Kingdom. We accept that, but Northern Ireland is different. [
Interruption.] I know that the hon. Gentleman does not agree with me, but Northern Ireland is different from the remainder of the United Kingdom by the nature of the pressure sustained-

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That reveals our difficulty with the Government. They say that Northern Ireland is abnormal, so it should remain abnormal, despite the wishes of the majority of people to be as normal as Finchley or the Minister's constituency of East Kilbride. The opportunity to be normal is being denied by the Government's perversity and the Minister must recognise that. Legislation in a democracy should not be based on the lowest common denominator. He should try to raise the standards and ethos to those that are more common throughout the kingdom.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is going beyond an intervention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I did not use the word ``abnormal''. I said that Northern Ireland was unique and different in many ways. I do not need a Good Friday agreement for my constituency and any divisions do not manifest themselves in the level of violence that we have seen during the past 30 years from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland. Anyone who tries to claim that Northern Ireland is as British as Finchley is, with all due respect to a former Prime Minister, fundamentally wrong.

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does my right hon. Friend the Minister remember the words of the Hunt report of 1969 in that context? It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The most striking difference between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the police forces elsewhere in the United Kingdom is that it fulfils a military as well as a civilian role.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That expresses very well the difference between policing in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There is no question about that. In carrying out its difficult task, the RUC is unique among police services in the United Kingdom in one simple respect-its officers carry side arms. The police do not do that in my constituency; they do not need to do so. It is wrong to claim that Northern Ireland is exactly the same as the rest of the United Kingdom.

<P>
We are seeking to normalise Northern Ireland society, as the Good Friday agreement set out to do. It was the people of Northern Ireland-not the Governments, although they played a major role-who had the democratic responsibility for taking matters further and defined the means by which that should be done. That was the reason for the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, from which sprang the Patten report and the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Savidge </B>(Aberdeen, North): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made precisely the same point in response to me last Thursday? He said that we would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not be able to show consistency between many things that happen in Northern Ireland, and  what happens in the rest of the United Kingdom.-[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 15 June 2000; c. 47.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I try to remember all the interventions, but we could certainly clarify my hon. Friend's point by checking the record.

<P>
I have explained our approach to amendments Nos. 141 and 142 in terms of the way in which we hope to amend the Bill to take on board some of the arguments that have been advanced.

<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone are all, in various ways, aimed at tightening up the Bill's provisions. However, they are unnecessary in the light of the safeguards that are already in place. It is important to understand that the measure has a significant new dimension. Political members or independents who are not committed to non-violent, democratic and peaceful means can be removed. That does not apply to the existing Police Authority. By that logic it is not right to create obstacles to participation by any individual elected Assembly Members on the board. That is in line with what was envisaged by the Good Friday agreement and the Patten report.

<P>
Several amendments-for example, amendments Nos. 112, 120, 159 and 122-are aimed at removing the Secretary of State's discretion. As the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) anticipated last Thursday, I intend to resist them. The hon. Gentleman is not always right, but he was on that occasion. In relation to removal for a criminal offence, I can envisage circumstances in which the Secretary of State would not think it appropriate to remove someone for, say, a traffic violation. Flexibility must therefore be built into the application of the provisions.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 114 and 121 would require the Secretary of State to remove individuals convicted of sentences of imprisonment, whether suspended or not. However, they would not leave him the option to remove from a body with the significant powers of the Policing Board someone who, for example, assaults a police officer but does not receive a custodial sentence, whether suspended or not. In one sense, the amendments seek to place very tight restrictions on the way in which the Secretary of State can operate. He has to apply high standards and take into the account the various strains and pressures that can arise in terms of a particular appointment.

<P>
Amendment No. 111 would put into the Bill statutory criteria for the disqualification of independents from the Policing Board. Again that is not necessary. The Secretary of State will conduct character checks, as he does for a range of public appointments, including appointments to the Police Authority and the office of police ombudsman. The provision is not contained in other legislation and is not needed in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): That is a helpful point. The Minister is right. It is not spelt out elsewhere in United Kingdom legislation who is disqualified from serving. However, if somebody with a serious criminal record were appointed elsewhere in the UK, it would be thought quite extraordinary.

<P>
Do I take it from the Minister's comment that, while flexibility may be built into the system, the Secretary of State will nevertheless apply similar criteria when appointing members to those that apply elsewhere in the United Kingdom?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The answer is yes, particularly because of the sensitivity of the appointments and the greater probability that people who have been involved in actions that would not be found in the rest of United Kingdom, such as paramilitary or terrorist activities, may seek appointment to the board. All that must be examined in full, but it is not simply in the rest of the United Kingdom that the measure sought by the amendments does not apply: it also does not apply in Northern Ireland in the Police Authority or the office of police ombudsman, because the Secretary of State applies high standards of examination in those cases. Previous Secretaries of State have done so and there is no reason to believe that future Secretaries of State would apply different criteria.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Where the Minister finds it convenient to argue normality, he does it quite well. How would what he has just said to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) apply in the case of Gerry Kelly, a convicted murderer, who killed somebody as he escaped from the Maze, went on the run for a number of years and was then brought back and given a token sentence? Is there any way to prevent the Gerry Kellys of this world, now that they are elected as IRA members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, from being members of the Policing Board? That is the question that the Minister must address. He can talk around what happens elsewhere, but he must address the issue of who will be on the board. Can Gerry Kelly be a member?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall not personalise it, but any member of Sinn Fein could be on the Policing Board.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> He can then. Say it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that I have just said it. I am being heckled now. I have said that is the case. That is the way in which the Bill has been drafted.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman is asking me to consider that and its implications. I tried to do that in my reply on Second Reading to the right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. MacKay), when I asked him to consider the logic of the position adopted by his party. To take it to its logical conclusion, if it is deemed wrong for someone who has an electoral mandate through the ballot box to serve on the Policing Board, he should not serve in a democratic forum at all. That is the hard logic. I know that there are people who take that view, but if that view pertained, it would not be possible to build on this relatively peaceful environment. We must move forward carefully, recognising that the uniqueness of Northern Ireland creates different conditions from those that apply elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone has bravely accepted them as new concepts with which to move forward, standing by his right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), who has tried to bring his party into this new political climate with all the threats and challenges, but also opportunities, that it offers.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not want to keep imposing on the Minister, but is not the logic of what he says that every Member elected to this House is eligible to sit on the various security Committees that attach to the responsibilities of the House? Has it not also been the case that a considerable number of hon. Members have not been considered suitable or discreet enough to sit on those Committees? Let the Minister be consistent in his argument. This has nothing to do with people's democratic rights; it has to do with their aptitude and suitability in relation to matters concerning the safety and security of the nation, or part of the nation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Forgive me, Mr. O'Hara, if I dwell on this matter for a moment. I suspect that I might be moving into territory that is outwith my remit. Membership of the Committees is determined by the whole House. Recommendations are made, and it is then up to right hon. and hon. Members to accept, reject or amend them. It is not just a case of someone, somewhere, deciding that a recommendation should not be accepted; it would be decided by the whole House.

<P>
The Assembly, however, has been structured on the basis of the wishes of the local political parties. The parties decided the way forward, and have allowed, by means of the d'Hondt principle, the election of members of the party to which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone referred, when he suggested that members of the IRA might be serving as elected members. That is a strong charge, and I do not want to go down that route. However, those decisions are not made by the Government but by the political parties in Northern Ireland. The Bill draws on the structure that applies in the Assembly to create the 10 elected members. Judgments can be made by that body itself, on a cross-community basis, if it so wishes. The power for judgments to be made on these difficult matters resides in several different areas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): I note the exchanges about normality, abnormality and difference. I shall not enter that debate. Difference is wonderfully powerful if it is recognised and built on.

<P>
If the amendments tabled in the names of the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone were adopted, an anomalous situation would be created. I do not want to personalise this, so I shall allude to the hypothetical person as ``me''. In such a situation, I, as a Member of the Assembly, could become Minister of Justice, while at the same time not being able to serve on the Policing Board. Would not that be a remarkable, anomalous situation? I see the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is becoming agitated. I hope that-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is intervening on the Minister. He should not now address his remarks to another member of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We touched upon the futuristic possibility-which anyone who wants fundamental change in Northern Ireland would call desirable probability-of the eventual transfer of all the matters that we are discussing here to a devolved Administration, including the appointment of a Minister for Justice. It would be wrong for me to be so prescriptive as to say what could or could not apply in that future scenario. However, from the way in which the question has been articulated now, the answer could well be ``yes'', on the basis of the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone, but we are not talking about where we are going in terms of that transfer of power. Another examinatory body is considering the criminal justice system, and criminal justice matters could be transferred to the Assembly sooner than people suspect and policing might be dealt with later. However, those are matters for future debate.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 160 and 161 seek to add to the schedule provisions that require disqualification or removal from office of members of the board who are associated with a body that has not begun to decommission. These amendments, like several others, do not meet the inclusivity test. The Bill recognises the right of elected representatives of whatever party to sit on the board, and we have already had several exchanges on that. Decommissioning is undoubtedly important, but it should be dealt with in its own right. The linkages that Opposition Members have sought to develop have applied in other aspects of the Government's programme of assisting change in Northern Ireland. There is a fundamental difference between us on that programme, but we share the clear objective of decommissioning, which is a separate test of the situation in Northern Ireland.

<P>
There is a need to establish a Policing Board that is inclusive and forward looking and for appropriate safeguards to ensure a high standard of board members. Transgressions or wrongdoings can be dealt with under the current arrangements. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will ask leave to withdraw the amendment and not press amendments Nos. 112 to 114, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124 and 125. I ask the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) not to press amendments Nos. 159, 160 and 161. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is not in his place, but I am sure that he will read the record of our discussions and that he will understand the way in which I have tried to deal with the amendments that he tabled.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is necessarily absent to attend a sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee and has tendered an apology, so he is not merely absent from his place.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I rise briefly to respond to the Minister's invitation. I shall not press the amendments that I have tabled, but, with respect, I do not express that intention because he has utterly overwhelmed me or convinced me that he is right and we are wrong. I do not mind if the record contains my words, as I use them intentionally. There is a view in parliamentary circles that if one wishes to return to a matter on Report, such reconsideration can be facilitated by a withdrawal of amendments at the Committee stage. It is in that spirit that I shall not press amendments Nos. 159, 160 and 161. I think that that is an exhaustive list of the amendments that I have tabled and which have been selected for debate in this group.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's motivation and his reason for adopting that approach, but it would be helpful to hear some further explanation. How would the amendments move the process forward, and how do they pass the test of inclusivity and encourage a different and better society in Northern Ireland? That is the test that the Government are seeking to apply as we construct the measure. It falls on the shoulders of Opposition Members who support the principle of bipartisanship to apply such a test, which they applied when in government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I am taking advantage of a procedural opportunity by withdrawing the amendments-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman's amendments have not been moved and so the technical position is that they do not need to be withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. O'Hara, but my eyes are not moving quickly enough over the various pages of the Hansard record of our previous sitting. I believe that I did move the amendments, making it necessary for me to withdraw them.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The only amendment moved formally is amendment No. 111.

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I always accept your rulings, Mr. O'Hara, and am grateful because I might not find my way through the proceedings by myself. I am tempted to respond to the Minister but I am sure, Mr. O'Hara, that you would not let me return substantively to my earlier speech.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am not for one moment quarrelling with my hon. Friend, but I suggest an abbreviated answer to the Minister's question. Opposition Members still fear that the tactical use of the ballot box is a reality in Northern Ireland. Our amendments seek to eliminate scope for such a use.

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I do not dissent from that enlightening approach; I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for intervening.

<P>
I have reached a point at which my intentions are in danger of being diverted. I sought simply to withdraw the amendments, which you suggested was not necessary, Mr. O'Hara. I therefore content myself with giving notice that we will return to the arguments.

<P>
I understand the arguments about inclusivity. The Minister will remember that we did not vote against his Bill, although we preferred our amendment on Second Reading. As I said to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, there is not a chasm between us. We want to be helpful although, perhaps unlike the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris), with whom I had an exchange during our previous sitting, we cannot put ourselves in a position of saying that we see and hear no evil. We are not content with the lack of progress on decommissioning. We realise that we have marked out more uncompromising ground than the Minister. I understand his position-I am in opposition and am able to be more uncompromising. I have detained the Committee long enough. There is much to be done today. I do not wish amendments Nos. 159, 160 or 161 to be put to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It is disappointing that the Minister rejected our amendments out of hand. We have two possibilities. A board could be elected during direct rule, which is likely to come about again. When applications are received for such a board, the Secretary of State will not undo the Bill. He is not required to reject a person who has been convicted of an offence that carried a prison sentence or suspended sentence-that option has been rejected. Clearly, in such a situation, applications will come from terrorists, from Sinn Fein and from other organisations that have a shady past. It seems only sensible that the Secretary of State should be able to reject such people. That would be eminently reasonable. I do not understand why the Minister rejects that option.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We have to realise that some people who apply for the board could have committed the foulest terrorist acts. I do not doubt that some people might change their ways, repent and decide to give up terrorism-perhaps for good-but we have to live with the consequences of our past. It is not unreasonable that people who have been convicted of terrorist offences and sent to prison are refused membership of the board. That is only right. People who are appointed to the board and who commit a criminal offence can be taken off it. It is illogical not to refuse a person entrance to the board if he has committed a criminal offence. I understand the Government's reasoning. The problem is being covered up under the guise of a new beginning and new future for Northern Ireland, but we should have what would be reasonable and expected in the rest of the United Kingdom.

<P>
The Minister has given some ground. He said that those people who apply to be on the board during direct rule will be asked questions about their past, such as whether they have committed criminal offences or been in custody or jail. But the Secretary of State will be under no obligation to reject them on that basis. That opens the door to people who have committed the foulest offences. In the case of a devolved government, political members of the board will be elected from Members of the Assembly. We must acknowledge that people with a shady past might be elected to the Assembly. Its Members take an oath to eschew violence. If their past reveals that they have received a prison or suspended sentence, it is reasonable that they should be refused membership of the board.

<P>
I am disappointed that the Minister will not accept the amendments. They are completely right and just. I realise that he is rejecting them because of political considerations, but we do not accept the stupid notion that Northern Ireland is different from the rest of the UK. There is absolutely no difference between people in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Had people on the mainland experienced what people in Northern Ireland have been put through by terrorists, I believe that few of them would suggest that those who have committed the foulest crimes should be on any type of police authority. We must remember the victims of terrorism and those who have been left to grieve the loss of their loved ones. What will they think when they see a police board that includes people who have a violent past and who might have murdered or been the cause of the murders of their loved ones? Therefore, I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to accept these perfectly reasonable amendments, which should apply in any normal democratic society.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstood my explanation entirely, although I understand that he comes to the debate from a different direction. I know that he is not a supporter of the Good Friday agreement, that he does not believe in the concept of inclusivity and that he does not agree with the precepts laid down in the agreement. He rejects the view of the majority of people in Northern Ireland, who voted for the agreement, but that is his democratic entitlement. However, will he accept that the Government must respond to that democratic wish as constructively and imaginatively as we possibly can to move the process forward? He has got it wrong when he says that the Secretary of State would not have the power to refuse applicants who want to become independent members of the board if they have a particular past. The Secretary of State does have that power. He can consider the past record of applicants, who will have to explain why they want to become members of the board and say what previous activities they have been involved in. That judgment has been applied to a range of appointments by previous Secretaries of State, and there is no reason to call into question the integrity of the current Secretary of State or of future Secretaries of State in exercising that qualitative judgment. I understand that the hon. Gentleman might have some great conspiracy theory in mind and believe that the measure is a sop to, or appeasement of, terrorism. I reject that entirely because all Secretaries of State have been only too mindful of the evils of terrorism and paramilitarism, which they have been committed to tackling. We have wholly condemned the perpetrators of violence.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the issue of victims. I have another responsibility as Minister for victims, and the Government inherited a blank sheet in tackling that issue. We have moved forward and tried to tackle that very sensitive and difficult issue in various ways, not just in terms of money. I do not accept the criticism that some Secretaries of State were not mindful of the pressures and traumas suffered by victims. We are only too conscious of that suffering, and are always looking for ways in which those who have suffered trauma can be supported more effectively. I know that the hon. Gentleman, who represents Omagh, went through a very difficult time two years ago when that terrible tragedy occurred. There is no doubt that those victims are seen as people.

<P>
However, we must try to move forward on all fronts, and I regret that the hon. Gentleman articulates the view that says, ``Do not make any movement until I am proven wrong, and I will never accept another person's point of view because I believe that all their views are wholly unreasonable.'' The hon. Gentleman fails the test of inclusivity because he does not accept the view of the majority of people in Northern Ireland, so I do not accept the charge that he levelled against us for rejecting the amendments. We have considered how normal practice should apply. I remind the hon. Gentleman that there is an additional provision in schedule 1 relating to those seeking membership of the board, and that independent or elected members must satisfy the criterion of being wholly committed to non-violent and democratic means. That approach is consistent with what the hon. Gentleman wants and the Secretary of State will maintain it rigorously. However, the matter rests not only with the Secretary of State but with the democratic Assembly, which has a responsibility in considering whom to appoint. Parties, too, are involved in that responsibility. It rests with the people of Northern Ireland, as much as with the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister advances a convincing argument, in limbo. He does not back it up with facts about what is really happening now in Northern Ireland. He talks about opportunity. I am one of those who vigorously support the concept of creating opportunity in Northern Ireland. The Minister, in answering questions, tends to compare the attitude of my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone to the agreement with my attitude. That does not come into the argument in the context of law and order and the interest of the greater number of people in Northern Ireland.

<P>
The Minister could have enhanced his argument if he had explained what attitude he or the Secretary of State would take to the political members of the board if there were no disarmament of a single bullet or ounce of Semtex. The people of Northern Ireland voted in the referendum on the agreement for the removal of illegal organisations, guns and explosives from the equation, yet the Minister talks for hour after hour about law and order without dealing specifically with those issues. Nor does he suggest when the Secretary of State will make a judgment on the early May commitment by the IRA to seal and make secure their arms in a limited number of dumps. He alludes sympathetically to the victims, but he has given no indication of how he will deal with that issue.

<P>
It is all very well to express sympathy, but the Minister's party has been in government for several years and he has spoken of its awareness. Let us hear what progress has been made in the case, for example, of policemen's wives who were widowed in the mid-1970s and have had to live in penury ever since. I would be more convinced if I heard something positive about that. Let the Minister explain why the promises of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about the disqualification of Sinn Fein-IRA have not been implemented or realistically tackled. They fall back on the ambiguous utterances of a politically pliant Chief Constable, who will not give a straightforward-

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): What?

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall be delighted to give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wants to defend the Chief Constable, but we all know that there is evidence-perhaps not the sort of evidence that can be used in court, but evidence none the less-that Mr. McCoy was killed with the acquiescence of senior members of Sinn Fein-IRA. It is not conducive to confidence being established within our society, yet the Chief Constable still gives ambiguous answers when asked to speak on that subject.

<P>
I do not expect the Chief Constable to undermine his case in court, if he ever gets the perpetrators of Mr. McCoy's murder to court. I am well aware of the sensitiveness of the matter, yet, as we move forward to the referendum, he and the Secretary of State have a responsibility to the ordinary members of society in Northern Ireland that has not been fulfilled either in the letter or the spirit of the Prime Minister's agreement.

<P>
Given the probing nature of our amendments, the Minister has done nothing to reassure me or my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone. The single most important factor that should be predominant in the Minister's mind is that the Bill should be about law and order and the safety of our society. He has failed to convince us that the Bill is not an extension of the negotiating process that was brought to a conclusion on 22 May 1998. That is unsatisfactory.

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am not clear what point the hon. Gentleman is trying to make.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I, too, find it difficult to divide my attention on the matter. For the Under-Secretary's benefit, I shall repeat what I said.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Even if the hon. Gentleman repeats what he said, I shall still not understand what he wants. Can he put it differently?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Understanding and sympathy are two entirely different things. I doubt that the hon. Gentleman fails to understand the point, but I am certain that he will be unsympathetic to it. That is what disappoints me.

<P>
Because of political considerations, Ministers are incapable of looking at how society in Northern Ireland will fare with law and order over the next decade. So long as the Under-Secretary avoids making substantive points, and so long as he avoids giving examples of what the Bill will mean to society in Northern Ireland, my party will oppose it. He does not have a mandate, any more than Patten had a mandate, to divert and destroy the principles that were established in the Belfast agreement. That is what he is doing now. We shall debate the Bill again on Report, with the opportunity to propose further amendments to expose the Government's motivation. In withdrawing amendment No. 111, I look forward to the Minister being able, at some stage, to justify the Bill and say what it will do for law and order in Northern Ireland, for safety and security there, how it will deal with criminality, and how it will provide the police with the means-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I intervene to assist the hon. Gentleman. He said that he may withdraw the amendment. This may be an appropriate time for me to give hon. Members some procedural advice on this complicated group of amendments. The Committee is technically debating only amendment No. 111, which was moved by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. As members of the Committee know, other amendments are grouped with the lead amendment at the discretion of the Chairman. Those other amendments are debated at the same time as the lead amendment.

<P>
It is not uncommon for amendments in a group to refer to later parts of the Bill than the lead amendment. No other amendment than the one formally before the Committee is dealt with until that lead amendment is dealt with. As I explained to the hon. Member for Solihull, who is not in his place at the moment, the only amendment that can be withdrawn is the one that has been moved. If an hon. Member is minded not to press the other amendments in the group, they are simply not moved: the question of withdrawing them does not arise.

<P>
The more complex matter is when to move formally amendments in the group that amend later parts of the Bill. Those amendments can be proposed only when the Committee is debating those later provisions. If the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone wants to move other amendments in the group, he should say so before he resumes his seat.

<P>
I can offer the Committee more help. For example, no amendment in this group except the lead amendment can be dealt with now because they would amend later parts of the Bill; they will be dealt with after subsequent amendments. For example, amendments Nos. 112 to 114 cannot be moved formally until we have dealt with amendment No. 153A. Government amendments Nos. 134 and 135, which have already been debated, will be reached after the debate on amendment No. 117, as will amendments Nos. 120 to 122. The same applies to amendment No. 142, tabled by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, who is now back in his place; and amendment No. 141 arises after amendment No. 153A. Finally, after the debate on amendment No. 136, amendments Nos. 123 to 125 can be moved formally.

<P>
I have tried to be helpful, because it is a complex set of amendments. Members of the Committee might like to be thinking in the course of subsequent debates whether and when they wish to move grouped amendments. I invite Mr. Maginnis to conclude his remarks.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful for that advice, Mr. O'Hara, although I admit that I am not sure I absorbed the detail of it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. All that the hon. Gentleman needs to remember is that if he is minded to move formally any of the amendments in the group he should make that clear to me before he sits down so that I can ensure that he is invited to move them formally at the right time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Again, I am grateful. I noticed that the Minister blanched at the prospect of our having another bite at the cherry. His inability to deal with the practicalities of policing is a disadvantage to all of us. I suspect that we shall not press any more of our group of amendments, which are probing amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Am I supposed to say something?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The technical situation is that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone intends to seek leave to withdraw the amendment. Before he does so, I invite the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to speak.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I have nothing to say. I apologise if this is slightly out of order; as you know, Mr. O'Hara, I was in the Welsh Grand Committee briefly, but I do not intend to proceed further, on the basis of what the Minister said in my absence-or what I sense he may have said.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 153A, in page 37, line 9, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(11) A quorum for appointments to the offices at (10) above shall be 8 or two thirds of the members of the Board, whichever is greater.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: Government amendments Nos. 137 and 138.

<P>
No. 100, in page 42, line 41, after ``(4)'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or a decision is to be taken on holding an inquiry under section 56'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 181, in page 42, line 41, leave out ``12'' and insert ``two-thirds of its members.''.

<P>
No. 64, in page 43, line 1, leave out sub-paragraph (4).

<P>
No. 182, in page 43, line 5, leave out ``12'' and insert ``two thirds of the''.

<P>
Hon. Members may wonder about the reason for numbering the amendment 153A. Numbers 152 to 163 were inadvertently used twice. It seemed simplest to give the second instance of each number the suffix A.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The amendment concerns the size of a quorum of the board. Our proposal is that a quorum for making appointments to the offices of chairman and vice-chairman should be eight, or two thirds of the members of the board, whichever is greater. That would allow a quorum of between eight and 12. The importance of preventing a meeting attended by a small number of people from appointing the chairman and vice-chairman is obvious. I do not want to hold up the Committee's work on this point. The Minister will understand the figures in the amendment. I hope that he is sympathetic.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will help us, as we have some difficulties and I want to be clear on the matter. What does he mean by a quorum? He gives two options for the majority-more than eight or two thirds. What is his reason for that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I would have thought that I would not have to explain to our teacher colleague what constitutes a quorum. I am not sure of the hon. Gentleman's motivation, but I suspect that the question has been asked tongue in cheek. The figures varies between eight and a possible 12 because the board might have no more than nine people on it during a suspension of devolved government. That is an inadequate number. No fewer than eight should be present to appoint a chairman or vice-chairman. There should be a breadth of choice. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is nodding his approval, which I acknowledge.

<P>
Eight is an inadequate number when there is a full board of 19 members. There should be 12. If there are 15 members, the quorum should be 10, and so on. The mathematics are not difficult. The problem is getting breadth into the said quorum so that the choice of who should be chairman or vice-chairman is properly debated.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. We have the same understanding of a quorum. However, the decision of the quorate group would be based on a simple majority.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not in any way dissent. Majorities are not relevant to this issue. We are merely trying to ensure that there is breadth, depth and objectivity when the board chooses the chairman or vice-chairman.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's case. We tabled amendments Nos. 100, 181 and 182. Their consequences would be twofold. The first relates to the issues described by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Paragraph 17(4) requires 12 members to agree to an inquiry. That requirement is excessive. A more workable alternative would be to require a fixed quorum and the approval of two thirds of those voting. That is what the three amendments seek.

<P>
The purpose of the board is to hold the police to account. It will not be able to carry out that function if the legislation makes it difficult for it to hold inquiries. The amendment will not necessarily make it easy to call an inquiry, given the board's political nature and the array of people who will comprise the independent membership. The figures that we are suggesting are reasonable. The principle is the same as the one that has just been described, and I do not want to repeat it.

<P>
I seek clarification from the Minister on a concern regarding Government amendment No. 137, which will replace a one-third proportion of board members with a figure of seven members. A proportion would be sensible in this instance, for the same reason that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone suggested that the depth and objectivity of the board would be served best by having proportions, with the number of members involved changing according to the size of the board. I am worried by the introduction of a specific number-the proportion required for an agreement would vary as the size of the board varied. I hope that the Minister will explain why the Government wish to make that change.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The specific figure in our amendment was the bottom figure at which it would be sensible to apply the two-thirds criterion. I cannot remember whether we have clarified whether the board has a minimum number of members. The Minister might help me on that point. I think that we have established a minimum number of 14 members. Two thirds of 14 is nine to the nearest whole number, if what I am told is correct. My figure of eight would have been more generous than I had intended it to be. I am considering the board and asking what the lowest number of members is that could represent breadth and objectivity. That is why I specified the figure of eight members. If I am wrong on that point, I am prepared to be appropriately humble.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Government amendment No. 137 would put a minimum figure on the size of the board. We have already approved a Government amendment to make 14 the minimum permitted number of board members. Including a figure of seven as proposed by the amendment, would require a 50 per cent. quorum. I look forward to hearing the Minister clarifying the matter. It is not a big deal, but it would be useful for the issue to be properly understood, not least because it could be raised in any fractious board meetings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The amendment is practical and is based on common sense, and I endorse the comments made by the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for Montgomeryshire. As I tried to say during discussion of an earlier amendment, the key point is retaining credibility of the board and confidence in it. We must endeavour to ensure that decisions cannot be made in strange circumstances by a limited clique of board members, as such an ability could undermine the credibility of the board and confidence in it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> My questions about the need for a quorum are relevant to amendment No. 64, whose purpose is to ensure that the Patten report is implemented faithfully and in full. Patten stressed the importance of the Policing Board's ability to conduct inquiries to follow up reports made by the Chief Constable. The Bill paralyses the heart of Patten's recommendations on ensuring an accountable police service. Patten stressed that the ability to initiate inquiries should be subject only to the same restrictions as those placed on the board's ability to require reports.

<P>
If we are to deal in Patten, we must listen carefully to what he says about this crucial matter. He referred in detail to national security and sensitive personnel matters, but he did not sanction any additional limitation on the power to follow up inquiries through specified and special voting restrictions. As it stands, paragraph 17(4) of the schedule provides that an inquiry cannot be initiated unless 12 members of the board, present and voting, agree. My understanding is that that is a weighted majority and that the provision specifies the weight of agreement that is required to initiate an inquiry.

<P>
Amendment No. 64 would remove that special voting requirement. We must all make up our minds on what the provision seeks to achieve. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response, to which I shall listen carefully, to find out whether he will remove the weighted majority vote. If he does not do so, he will be pursuing a line that is contrary to Patten's recommendations and to the observations that I had hoped would prevail.

<P>
The requirement means, for example, that the 10 political members of the board who are democratically elected cannot initiate an inquiry. That might be no big deal, but from where I sit in the Assembly, it looks highly unlikely that the political parties will achieve sufficient agreement to proceed solely on the basis of their own opinions.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
To proceed with this provision would be undesirable and contrary to Patten. It is also unnecessary. The Policing Board will contain 10 elected representatives, divided between Unionism and nationalism. As things stand, that will be three from the Ulster Unionist party, three from the Social Democratic and Labour party, two from the Democratic Unionist party and two from Sinn Fein. To elicit the support of those four parties on such an issue would be an unlikely diplomatic victory, but as I said, paranoia runs through the Bill. A Policing Board will be set up, but it will be weighted in such a way as to cause difficulties. The paranoia revolves around those figures, because even if the 10 elected representatives can agree, which I do not imagine is remotely possible, they would still have to nobble another two, three or four people, depending on the type of voting. In such circumstances, nine people will essentially be appointed by the Secretary of State. Is there such a lack of confidence in the Secretary of State's judgment in making those appointments that it is necessary to impose a weighted majority or a weighted voting system?

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that he is being somewhat gloomy about the prospects of achieving cross-party agreement, as the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs has often been able to achieve a very broad consensus about which inquiries should be conducted? There is ample precedent right across the political spectrum that agreement can be reached in relation to inquiries.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I note the hon. Gentleman's point, in which there is much merit. He might also remember that the same Select Committee failed to reach a consensus on what the name of the new policing service should be. I simply remind him of that as an illustration of the sort of difficulties with which we shall have to deal.

<P>
The prospect of inquiries being initiated for mischievous or partisan reasons is minimal. I ask hon. Members to think again about the number structure and to ask how manipulation could take place. That demonstrates the importance of getting definitions right, which is crucial at this stage. I asked the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone whether he envisaged a simple majority. That is a simple but loaded question. What is a simple majority? Is it different from an absolute majority? Is an absolute majority tied to a quorum? Does a simple majority involve a majority of the quorate body? Insufficient thought has gone into that matter. If a quorum is relevant, Committee members must decide whether a simple majority of the quorum or an absolute majority of the committee should be involved. Will the simple majority be a majority of those who are present and voting or of the total membership of the committee? Problems may arise in that context.

<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire suggested a quorum of nine. As the Liberal Democrat amendments suggest, the majority of a quorum of nine is five. That makes my point. The proposal is more loaded, and the subject is more difficult, than is suggested in these simple-some might call them simplistic-amendments. We must get this matter right.

<P>
For the reasons that I gave earlier, a simple majority should be sufficient to initiate an inquiry. Despite all the deviousness that all of us could bring to our command, and the inspiration that might come from serving on the board, I cannot foresee circumstances in which the arrangement will come about. The situation might be more complicated than the arrangement that is associated with the Liberal Democrat amendments. We need clarity in this context. Is a simple majority involved? If so, a simple majority of what? Or will an absolute majority be involved, and if so, of what?

<P>
<B>Mr. O¨pik:</B> For clarification, the size of the majority will vary with the size of the board under our amendments, although it would be nine if the board contained 14 members. That does not detract from the concerns that the hon. Gentleman rightly raised. Does having a proportion rather than an absolute number allay some of his fears?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. As this debate progresses, we will realise that mathematical exactitude is incapable of solving this problem, because it is not a mathematical problem. It involves an inability to face up to the fact that, in this context, people are either doing the job properly or they are not.

<P>
A mathematical formula was proposed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who is numerate-he has been known to prove that round many a table, and I do not refer to dinner tables. Even with his precision and mathematical ability, his proposals did not contain constant factors. We also witnessed the attempts of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to grapple with the problem. I, too, have grappled with it and calculated the permutations-when it comes to permutations, I have some experience-but still I face this problem.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> As a fellow school teacher, I wonder whether I might make a pedantic mathematical point. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone suggested that a quorum of two thirds of 19 would be 12. According to my understanding of mathematics, it would be 13, and I suspect that the same would apply in law. However, a previous amendment set the lowest level of membership for the board at 14, in which case, the quorum would be 10. I cannot therefore understand why the amendments refers to the figure of eight.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for making my point so adequately. If all the great minds of our generation cannot even get the sums right, how will we incorporate the basic concept of Patten, in terms of a mathematical formula? In my view, it is not possible, and in those circumstances we must revert to Patten's recommendations.

<P>
I do not want the new Policing Board to become a forum for witch hunts. I want it to get on with its work, and carry out its functions in the way that Patten envisaged. Nor do I want inquiries to be unavailable, in effect, to the Policing Board. Again, I know something about inquiries. I do not want to dredge up the past, but we all remember inquiries such as those into the death of Sam Devenney, and the Stalker affair. Any hon. Member of this Parliament who read the reports would recognise where I am coming from on this issue.

<P>
However, the inquiries that have not been conducted are also important. One such is pending in respect of Mr. Hamill, a young man from Portadown. The coroner, John Lecky, made public the fact that two witnesses could not attend the inquest because they were afraid of what might happen to them. In simple terms, that stinks to high heaven, and affects policing in a big way. When it blows-as it will blow- many will look again at this innocuous amendment and say, ``Perhaps Patten was right. Perhaps we should not place weighted majorities in the way of inquiries.''

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I agree that it is very important that the Policing Board has powers to initiate inquiries. However, does my hon. Friend agree that, according to paragraph 6.22 of the Patten report, there could be a limitation of the board's power to conduct an inquiry? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if there is a disagreement between the Board and the Chief Constable over whether it is appropriate for a report to be provided on a particular matter, it should be for the Chief Constable to refer the question to the Secretary of State for a decision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Patten himself therefore suggests that certain sorts of inquiry could give rise to problems, and would not be completely untrammelled.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> That is a valid point. I think that Patten dealt with it when he said that the only limitation that should be placed on the board should be on its ability to require reports, but that he recognised that reports could and would also be made through other agencies, such as the police ombudsman.

<P>
The Hamill case has been with us for some time-I am not sure for how many years. It is not that the allegations are not known. The Government know them. If they do not, they are living in cloud cuckoo land. The Irish Government know them. I know them, and I do not take things lightly: I put things to the test. Yet there has not been an inquiry. Why? Because there is no process through which to have one; there is no policing board. If that case had arisen when the Policing Board existed and there was a weighted majority, as the Bill specifies, could an inquiry have been conducted into that case? If there is a weighted majority of 12, would an inquiry have been initiated into the killing of that young man, Hamill? The answer is contained in the figures.

<P>
I do not want to labour the point. I have made it as often as I can and I keep making it. However, I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that the weighted majority vote, required to initiate an inquiry, will be removed in favour of a simple majority. If he will give me that assurance, we can start the real debate about how we circumvent a weighted majority that is a quorum.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not intend to get involved in the details of what constitutes two thirds, having, as I recollect, failed my maths O-level. Numeracy may not be my strongest point, so I shall confine myself to the principles.

<P>
I find myself broadly in agreement with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and with the Government amendments. The only hon. Member with whom I broadly disagree is the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, who I think is worrying about a principle that has applied to virtually every organisation in which I have participated. First, one establishes a quorum that is a reasonable figure for the transaction of business; secondly, if important decisions must be taken, one requires a certain number of people to be present, or a higher level of voting. While I shall listen carefully to what the Minister says about the Opposition amendments, and he may be able to convince me, the principle behind the Government amendments seems wholly unexceptionable.

<P>
The Minister has cottoned on to the need for some alterations, which again reinforces the point that there is merit in having quorums. On that basis, having listened with great care to what the Minister has said, and without getting involved in the figures, I shall sit down.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> It may amaze the Committee to know that I have an A-level in mathematics, but I shall certainly not get involved in this debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I remember when a previous Prime Minister was taken to task because he would not say how many O-levels he had, but I do not want to enter into that debate.

<P>
Some serious matters have been raised and I shall deal with the concluding comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh. I do not want to diminish the seriousness of the allegations surrounding the tragic death of Robert Hamill, but the Secretary of State has not ruled out an inquiry and is currently examining the matter.

<P>
People have been unwilling to give evidence and the question arises of whether they would be prepared to do so under different circumstances if threats against them were removed. That question must be answered. We are all aware that many people in Northern Ireland have not been brought to justice because fear of giving evidence permeates the criminal justice process. We may try to protect people who are asked to participate in the criminal justice system, but it is difficult to convince them of the merits of coming forward, giving evidence and bringing about a change in society when the threats against them are dangerous and potent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I totally agree with the Minister that nothing is more awful than someone who has committed a heinous crime not being behind bars because of threats against witnesses, but we must be careful about specifying the source of those threats.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not intend to go down that road and I do not believe that my hon. Friend wants me to, because it is not for the Committee to examine such allegations. They are subject to tight scrutiny and the Government are acting as they always do when such charges are made.

<P>
I turn to the arguments underlying the amendments. They refer not to mathematics, but to simple arithmetic. My explanation may add to the confusion instead of providing clarity, but I shall do my best.

<P>
Government amendment No. 137 was designed to clarify a small matter of confusion. During consultation with various parties, it became clear that paragraph 17(1) was causing confusion in determining one third of 19 members. To remove that confusion, the amendment sets the figure at 7, which is what it would effectively have been under the original drafting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The amendment has the added effect that if total membership of the board is under 19 because a full complement has not been appointed, seven will guarantee a reasonable number of people at meetings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was going to mention that. Without the amendment, one third would be a sliding scale and could become a very small number. Seven is an absolute number and is right for a total of 19 members, but is equally right for 14. A lower number could result in very small meetings. I hope that the Committee will accept that our amendment is reasonable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The Government amendment says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>leave out `one third of the number of members' and insert `seven'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that mean seven of the members present and voting or seven members of the whole committee?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Perhaps I can answer that question shortly. I hope that advice will be winging its way to me.

<P>
Government amendment No. 138 remedies an oversight in the drafting of paragraph 17(2), which states that the quorum for a meeting of the board at which a chairman is to be appointed will be 12. I am grateful to the Police Authority for pointing out an inconsistency in that that applies only to part III of the schedule-in other words, where there is an appointment during devolution. It should also apply under part II, and the amendment will give effect to that.

<P>
In relation to amendments Nos. 153A and 181, the provision making it possible to vary the potential membership of the direct rule board between 14 and 19 could mean that 12 of 14 members could be required to attend for the appointment of the chairman. That is too high a proportion. If three members did not turn up to the meeting, or boycotted it, no selection could take place. That would be wholly wrong. I accept the principle of amendments Nos. 153A and 181, and shall return to the matter on Report. Given that, I hope that hon. Members will not press them to a vote.

<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 100, 182 and 64. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire seeks to reduce the majority for a decision on an inquiry from 12 to nine. Amendment No. 100 would introduce the casting vote arrangement from paragraph 17(3). That would be logical if the number required for decisions on inquiries under amendment No. 101 were to be reduced from 12 to nine. However, I am not convinced that a majority of the committee on such an issue should be thus reduced to a minority.

<P>
The power of calling for inquiries, which was described in paragraph 6.23 of the Patten report, is regarded by the Government as extreme. We therefore think it appropriate to ensure that the board is clearly agreed on its use before embarking on a major inquiry with far-reaching powers. We should establish the principle that before an inquiry of such an extreme nature is undertaken-the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh referred to two examples, and could have referred to others from the past 30 years-a majority of the board has taken a view as to the way forward.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading, with reference to the inquiry power, that he accepted that the Bill as drafted probably went
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>too far in the limitations  on the policing board in exercising that power.-[Official Report, 6 June 2000; Vol. 351, c. 182.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> In essence, the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and I have been saying that the provision is too severe. If the Minister will revisit it to relax the requirement, that would go a long way towards resolving the issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are trying to be helpful.

<P>
To return to the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh, paragraph 17(1) stipulates the quorum for the board. If the Government amendment is accepted, it will be seven present and voting members. That is the general rule, to which the Bill contains two exceptions in relation to the appointment of a chairman and to inquiries.

<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
