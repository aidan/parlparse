<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000352"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have a few announcements to make. Hon. Members
may wish to remove their jackets. As long as I am in the Chair, that
will be in order, but I cannot speak for my co-Chairman, who will be
joining you next week. Will members of the Committee and others in the
room please ensure that their mobile phones, pagers and other
electronic devices are switched off during our proceedings&#151;by
&#147;off&#148;, I mean off? The Committee may wish to be reminded
of the money resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which
are available in the
room.</div><a name="0806047000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind members of the Committee that adequate notice must be given of
amendments. As a general rule, Mr. Hood and I will not be
calling starred amendments; neither do we intend to call amendments
that are not signed by members of the Committee, because we would
presume that they would not be moved. I mention that now because a
number of amendments have already been tabled by hon. Members who are
not members of the Committee. If members of the Committee wish to pick
them up, they will need to add their names to them so that they can
appear on the amendment paper for the next
sitting.</div><a name="0806047000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also remind
hon. Members about the procedure at the start of today&#146;s
sitting. The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme
motion, on which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then
proceed to a motion to report written evidence before starting the
clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill. I hope that everything is
clear.</div><a name="0806047000016"></a>

June.</div><a name="0806047000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale, as I will welcome
Mr. Hood when he joins us for this important Committee. The
Bill has received its Second Reading and certain clauses have been
debated on the Floor of the House. It has been subjected to
consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny, and it has attracted great
attention from the Science and Technology Committee. We are fortunate
that members of the Committee have extensive knowledge and expertise in
respect of the Bill. I welcome, in particular, the presence of the hon.
Members for Salisbury and for Oxford, West and Abingdon, and my hon.
Friends the Members for Bolton, South-East, for Brighton, Kemptown and
for Norwich, North, who served on the Science and Technology Committee.
Indeed, the hon. Member for Salisbury and my hon. Friend the Member for
Norwich, North also served on the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee.
Their wisdom and expertise will benefit our consideration of the
Bill.</div><a name="0806047000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also joined by my hon. Friends the Members for Warrington, North,
for Calder Valley, for Crawley, for Cardiff, North and my right hon.
Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. They are all
experienced parliamentarians with a great interest in such matters and
various views on the subjects that we shall be discussing. I welcome
the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness, who has so far led his team in
adopting a considered, thoughtful and diligent approach to this
important Bill. I am grateful for the way in which he and his
colleagues will bring great expertise to our proceedings and will
continue to debate matters that we know are of
importance.</div><a name="0806047000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury, my
hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green, and the hon. Member
for Rugby and Kenilworth will not have much work to do and that we
shall proceed in an orderly, timely fashion. I am sure that you intend
to make sure that we do so, Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="0806047000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">When my hon.
Friend the Member for Norwich, North was referring to his considerable
knowledge of science during the debates on the Floor of the House, he
said that he knew &#147;science backwards&#148;. That caused
considerable discussion among journalists who asked whether there was
any other way to consider science. The Bill regulates important areas
of research science that are of crucial importance to our
communities.</div><a name="0806047000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure
the Committee that we do not intend to start at the back and work
forward. We shall start at clause 1 and work logically through the
Bill. Our proceedings will be challenging and I am confident that the
excellent debates that took place on the Floor of House will continue
in Committee and that, at the end of our deliberations, we will have a
Bill that is worthy of the House. I commend the motion to the
Committee.</div><a name="0806047000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806047000354"></a><b class="B">Mark
Simmonds</b> (Boston and Skegness) (Con): I join the Minister
in saying how pleased I am to see you in the Chair, Mr.
Gale. I look forward to working under your guidance and that of Mr Hood
during the passage of this Bill. You will be aware of the view of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>Opposition that this Bill deserves completely free votes, and therefore
there will be free votes for Conservative Members in all Divisions in
Committee. It is a shame that the Government do not have the same
policy.</div> <a name="0806047000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
the points that the Minister made about the very thorough and detailed
pre-legislative scrutiny that took place prior to the introduction of
this Bill. There was full debate and discussion, and many hon. Members
who took part in that scrutiny are members of the Public Bill
Committee, which is to be welcomed. We all look forward to benefiting
from their expertise and experience in this area.</div>
<a name="0806047000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I thank the Minister for her
kind remarks? I have been impressed by her detailed knowledge and
understanding of these very complex issues, both ethically and
scientifically. I hope that we can continue the constructive dialogue
that we have had so far to ensure that the Bill is as good as it can
be. When it passes into law, I hope that it will have as good a
reputation as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and that
it lasts as long as that Act, if not longer, despite many fast-moving
scientific discoveries and
advances.</div><a name="0806047000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome to the Committee my hon. Friends the Members for Rugby and
Kenilworth, for Hemel Hempstead, for Salisbury, and for South-West
Devon, who will make their own points in their individual ways. Of
course, we have a very wide range of opinions on this side of the
Committee, which will become evident as the Bill progresses. I would
finally like to say that there are a large number of issues in the Bill
that were not debated on the Floor if the House and I hope we will
discuss them in Committee. I have no problem with the programme
motion.</div>
<a name="0806047000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806047000355"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): I join those
who have already spoken in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr.
Gale. It has been about 18 months since I last served on a Public Bill
Committee, but that was under your chairmanship and I, at least, had a
good time, even if I cannot speak for
you.</div><a name="0806047000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo the
comments that have been made about the scrutiny that has been
undertaken. The Government must be commended for issuing a consultation
paper, a White Paper and a draft Bill. Throughout that process they
made a number of changes, following the scrutiny by the Science and
Technology Committee, which was initiated under the chairmanship of the
hon. Member for Norwich, North, who chaired the big inquiry of 2005. I
pay tribute to his work and that of the hon. Members for Bolton,
South-East, for Salisbury and for Brighton, Kemptown, who are all
veterans of that Committee and subsequent inquiries. While there was
not always unanimity on that Committee, it is the case that in the
first inquiry, all of us present who served on that Committee took a
common view and we have lasted the course by seeing it through to this
stage.</div><a name="0806047000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness said, there will be free votes on this
side of the Committee. Although the Liberal Democrats generally have
policies in support of scientific progress in this area, there are
different views from mine, as is exemplified by my hon. Friend the
Member for Southport, who will seek to catch your eye, Mr.
Gale, or kick me when he disagrees with
anything.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="0806047000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806047000356"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tom Clarke</b> (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (Lab): In
view of what both Opposition spokesmen have said, I would like to make
it clear that when I accepted the invitation of the Government Whips to
serve on the Committee, they had the full knowledge that I did not
support the Bill on Second Reading. They know that I intend to vote in
accordance with the merits of the arguments as I see
them.</div>
<a name="0806047000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000357"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I welcome that, and I think it is good that at
least one person on the Government side of the Committee has different
views from the Government line. I hope that we will not be dividing in
Committee, but that we have the opportunity for Divisions on Report.
Having Divisions in Committee, with just a few of us here, would not
give scope for the free votes that we would want to have.</div>
<a name="0806047000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Southport and the hon. Members for Boston and
Skegness and for Hemel Hempstead made excellent speeches during earlier
stages of the Bill&#146;s passage. I pay tribute to them and hope
that all members of the Committee, including those who do not speak
from the Front Bench, will play as full a part as I expect that they
will. I hope we will be able to make good progress, because it would be
a tragedy if we had to rush any new clauses and amendments towards the
end of our
proceedings.</div><a name="0806047000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000358"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we proceed, may I indicate that when the
Programming Sub-Committee met last night, we discussed the possibility
of needing more time. I think that hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee have broadly agreed that that is unlikely to be necessary,
but I have indicated that, as far as the Chair is concerned, I would be
willing to sit on a Tuesday evening, in addition to Tuesday morning and
afternoon, should that become necessary. If that were to happen, I
would expect negotiation through the usual channels to ensure that both
members of the Committee and, more significantly, the staff of the
House, have adequate notice so that they can adjust their
diaries.</div>

receives will be made available in the room. I know that one has been

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000362"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Clause 1 concerns the meaning of
&#147;embryo&#148; and &#147;gamete&#148;. I have tabled the
amendments&#151;I acknowledge that they are probing
amendments&#151;as an attempt to extract from the Government the
logic behind the changes to the 1990 Act and to determine whether this
is merely to do with scientific advancement, or whether there is
something more fundamental behind the changes proposed. The amendments
would bring the wording of the provisions back in line with that in the
1990 Act, which essentially says that there is not a true embryo unless
the embryo has been fertilised. The amendments would make the
definition clearer than what is proposed in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806047000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I run through the differences between the amendments, I would ask the
Minister about the fact that changes due to scientific
advancement&#151;for example, clone embryos and licensed hybrids,
which are based on the court judgement that was made&#151;are allowed
under the wording of the 1990 Act. If those have been allowed under the
wording of the 1990 Act, why is there a necessity to change that Act in
the way proposed in the
Bill?</div><a name="0806047000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 17 addresses the fact that there is no definition of fertilisation
anywhere else in the Bill. It would be helpful to understand why that
is the
case.</div><a name="0806047000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806047000363"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): I dread making this
intervention, but whenever I see the word &#147;zygote&#148;, I
always think that it is a single cell. I do not want to get into
arguments meaning that a later process is rolled out of order because
of some &#147;Oxford English Dictionary&#148; definition. Would the
hon. Gentleman like to say where the two-cell zygote comes from? Two
cells are never a zygote; one cell is a zygote. The hon. Gentleman was
once a zygote; that was when he was a single cell with everything else
to do in terms of multiplying and so
on.</div><a name="0806047000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000364"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> As indeed was the hon. Gentleman. That was why I
said that these were probing amendments. I am attempting to draw from
the Government exactly why these changes to the 1990 Act have been put
in the Bill. I do not think that there is a definition of fertilisation
elsewhere in the Bill, so it would be helpful if the Minister would
establish why that was the
case.</div><a name="0806047000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">With amendment
No. 18, we want to understand about

<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>Parliament on behalf of the BMA or the ethics committee, except where
stated.</div><a name="0806047000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group of
probing amendments is useful because it gives the Government the
opportunity to clarify why they have chosen such a formula for the
definitions. I would note, however, that they are clearly probing
amendments, because without the deletion of the proposed new subsection
(1)(b) in subsection (2), one would still include an egg that was in
the process of fertilisation in the definition of
&#147;embryo&#148;.</div><a name="0806047000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that there has always been some doubt about whether an
egg in the process of fertilisation would be covered by the 1990 Act.
The provisions would put it beyond doubt that it would. The alternative
would be that an embryo was not created until the process of
fertilisation was complete. I would be grateful if the Government could
explain, for reasons of clarity, why they have gone for the suggestion
that an egg</div><a name="0806047000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the
process of fertilisation or...undergoing any other process capable
of resulting in an
embryo&#148;</div><a name="0806047000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">is the chosen
option.</div><a name="0806047000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern with the Government&#146;s formulation is that some work is
being done on eggs. Eggs are extremely fascinating cells from a
scientific point of view, and a lot of insights into fertility and
basic biology are made by studying eggs. It is quite possible that,
during the study of eggs, an egg might spontaneously divide through the
process of parthenogenesis. Although the resulting entity does not
develop much further, it is a dividing egg. For example, activating an
egg either by the application of some compounds, or by providing an
electric charge, can result in parthenogenesis. I would be grateful if
the Minister could clarify whether such an egg undergoing
parthenogenetic division&#151;without the addition of sperm and in
its haploid state&#151;would still be an embryo for that
purpose.</div><a name="0806047000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is the
case, it means for researchers something that was raised in the House
of Lords regarding a potential offence. Any researcher working on eggs
without a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority, as they are permitted to do under regulations passed almost
immediately after the 1990 Act, would run the risk of finding that they
had created something defined under the Bill as an embryo if a
parthenogenetically dividing egg&#151;after just one
division&#151;was considered to be one. Without a licence,
researchers would be committing an offence, albeit inadvertently and
with no intention of creating an embryo, and although something had
been created that clearly could not develop beyond its initial
division, because it had only half the chromosomes. No one is
suggesting that a parthenogenetically dividing egg in vitro could
develop significantly
far.</div><a name="0806047000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The worry is that
if one creates an accidental &#147;embryo&#148;&#151;under the
definition proposed&#151;one finds that one is liable to prosecution,
or that one would need a licence for all work in case an embryo was
created. That would defeat the purpose of much of the appropriate
deregulation that was created after the 1990 Act to allow gametes to be
studied in isolation without a process of fertilisation or
cloning&#151;clearly that would require a licence. I would be
grateful if the Minister could offer any reassurance or provide her
understanding about whether people currently working 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>in egg research without a licence for embryos would have to go through
the expensive and over-regulatory process of having to get a
licence.</div><a name="0806047000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
whether the hon. Member for Norwich, North has a good point about
amendment No. 17, but as I say, it is a probing amendment. My other
point is about amendments Nos. 18 and 19. The question of whether the
Government were being helpful or unhelpful by defining eggs
as</div><a name="0806047000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including cells of the
female germ line at any stage of
maturity&#148;</div><a name="0806047000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">was
explored thoroughly in the Lords. I came to the view, which was shared
by people from the science community, that the formulation given by the
Government was helpful for a number of reasons, but mainly because if
that was not in the definition of eggs, the permitted eggs and
permitted sperm approach taken in clause 3 would not, without major
amendment, allow in vitro maturation of gametes to be used in the
creation of embryos. Sometimes, particularly with young children whose
fertility is being preserved prior to chemotherapy, a biopsy would be
taken of spermatogonal or ovarian tissue, and gametes would hopefully
be derived from those gonadal stem cells in vitro. They would not be
stem cell derived gametes; they would be gonadally derived. Without
specifying that, it is extremely difficult to construct legislation
that allows such a thing. I was reassured by debates in the Lords that
the Government are doing the right thing with this definition, although
there were a number of concerns. I hope that the Government will
confirm that their approach is right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000366"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The drafting and the consultation about
updating the legislation worked from the 1990 Act. During the passage
through Parliament of the Bill that became that Act, the point at which
the regulation of a human embryo should begin was discussed
extensively. As a result, the Act provides that it should begin at the
initiation of the process of fertilisation, rather than at the point at
which the embryo reaches two cells.</div>
<a name="0806047000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the point raised by
the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness about the definition of
fertilisation, the 1990 Act did not seek to define fertilisation. It
was felt that that was a common term used in biology and that the HFEA
should make a decision about the term and what it meant within
legislation. As he pointed out in his opening remarks on the probing
amendments, that Act has stood us in good stead and works. That is a
specific answer. We sought to ensure that we were maintaining the
position by keeping the wording that an embryo includes</div>
<a name="0806047000061"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an egg that is in the process of
fertilisation&#148;.</div>
<a name="0806047000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Science and Technology
Committee stated in its 2005 report &#147;Human Reproductive
Technologies and the Law&#148; that the definition of an embryo
should be changed to begin only at the two-cell stage. That was based
on concerns that research might be restricted into the treatment of
mitochondrial diseases. Those concerns have been met in the Bill, first
through the definition of &#147;embryo&#148;, as it now includes
any human embryo created by any process, not just fertilisation, and,
secondly, by removing the prohibition on the genetic modification of an
embryo for research. Mitochondrial disease research has already been
licensed by the HFEA and the changes in the Bill
bring  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>further clarification on that matter. That answers the point with regard
to legal cases.</div><a name="0806047000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seek
to put the position beyond doubt by ensuring that it is reflected in
legislation, rather than dealt with by reference to a court judgment. I
appreciate that these are probing amendments, but they would reverse
the position outlined in the 1990 Act, so that, for the purposes of the
legislation, an embryo would not come into existence until the two-cell
stage&#151;the point at which the nucleus of an embryo fully forms
for the first time. They would, in effect, remove single-cell embryos
from regulation, meaning that the creation, keeping, storage and use of
single-cell embryos would fall outside the law.</div>
<a name="0806047000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Research on
single-cell embryos could then be undertaken without a licence,
provided the cell did not divide, and it has clearly been the view of
Parliament that we cannot allow the creation, keeping, storage and use
of single-cell embryos to fall outside the law. These embryos should be
regulated in the same way as embryos at the two-cell stage or later.
The Government&#146;s position is therefore that the existing
principle, which remains unchanged since it was formed in 1990, should
be upheld.</div> <a name="0806047000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definitions of &#147;egg&#148; and &#147;sperm&#148; in clause
1 are of equal importance to the Bill and to the HFEA, because terms
such as &#147;gamete&#148;, &#147;sperm&#148; and
&#147;egg&#148; are vital in setting out the authority&#146;s
regulatory remit. While we are often clear about what these terms mean
from a biological point of view, definitions can be interpreted
differently in the context of legislation. These definitions are
designed to set out an effective remit for the authority, clearly
indicating what biological material it regulates. How are we to make
sure that biological definitions can be interpreted through a
regulatory framework? That has always been the challenge. It was the
challenge faced by the Committee that considered the 1990 Bill, and, as
the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the resulting Act has stood us in good
stead.</div><a name="0806047000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definitions
of the terms &#147;gamete&#148;, &#147;sperm&#148; and
&#147;egg&#148; were drafted to include cells of the germ line at
any stage of maturity, and it should be noted that the wording of this
provision follows the precedent of section 3A of the 1990 Act, which
was inserted by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and
ensured that female germ line cells taken from an embryo or foetus
could not be used in treatment.</div>
<a name="0806047000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
drafted to include germ line cells to ensure that the storage and use
of ovarian tissue containing immature egg cells to create embryos is
regulated by the HFEA and that, following maturation in the laboratory,
any egg produced can be used in treatment. It also sets out a
prohibition on placing anything other than a permitted egg, sperm or
embryo into a woman, and so it is important that the definition of
&#147;gamete&#148; includes immature cells of the female germ line.
This ensures that the use of in vitro maturation within the context of
assisted conception treatment is regulated and permitted. I am sure the
hon. Gentleman understands that this is particularly important for
women who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy and will lose
their future fertility. Freezing mature eggs is difficult and often
unsuccessful, whereas freezing ovarian tissue containing immature eggs
is much more reliable.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="0806047000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The legislation that deals with
these difficult and complex areas needs to be as clear as possible to
ensure that the legality of complex reproductive medicine is equally
clear. The clause as it stands ensures clarity around the regulation
and use of single human embryos and immature eggs and sperm, making it
clear that single-cell embryos fall within the authority&#146;s remit
and that immature gametes may be matured in the laboratory and used in
treatment.</div><a name="0806047000325"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="0806047000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the amendments were made, clarity would be lost and single-cell embryos
would fall outside regulation. The law would, at best, become uncertain
and, at worst, prohibit the use of immature eggs and sperm in
reproductive therapies. In trying to address what were the difficult
challenges in 1990, the Government have listened very closely to the
evidence presented and to debates about the Bill in another place. We
have proposed the wording as it stands. I assure the hon. Gentleman
that the Government seek to continue to regulate and enforce according
to the principles of the 1990 Act, which I know that he and many of his
hon. Friends support. I hope that he accepts that his probing amendment
has secured comments on the record for clarity and that he will
withdraw it at as suitable
time.</div><a name="0806047000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000367"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I would be grateful if the Minister would address
herself to the point that I raised about her expectations of the impact
of the new wording on people who are researching eggs, but not putting
them through a process of cloning or fertilisation. In their research,
an egg may start to divide as a consequence of manipulation that is
done for perfectly legitimate scientific reasons&#151;not as the
deliberate end point of the research, but just as a happenstance. The
1990 Act stated:</div><a name="0806047000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;embryo
means a live human embryo where fertilisation is complete,
and...references to an embryo include an egg in the process of
fertilisation&#148;.</div><a name="0806047000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that. It has been transferred to the Bill, but the new Bill
also states that</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#147;references to an embryo
include an egg&#148;</div><a name="0806047000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">not just
in the process of fertilisation,
but</div><a name="0806047000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;undergoing any other
process capable of resulting in an
embryo.&#148;</div><a name="0806047000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government had the option of stating that references to an embryo would
include an egg that had undergone any other process capable of
resulting in an embryo and, indeed, of considering a one-cell embryo to
be an embryo, thus avoiding the worry about the distinction between
one-cell and two-cell embryos. I accept the Minister&#146;s view that
one-cell embryos have to be included in regulation, but the wording
&#147;has undergone&#148; would enable research that does not
intend to produce an embryo to continue without a licence when it is
looking at the properties of an egg. I wonder whether the Government
considered using the wording, &#147;has undergone any other process
resulting in an embryo&#148;, rather than</div>
<a name="0806047000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is undergoing any other process
capable of resulting in an
embryo&#148;.</div><a name="0806047000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition used is going to make things wider. At the moment, there is
no defence for people researching eggs when there might be division.
What is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>Minister&#146;s response to the point I raised originally? Secondly,
did she consider the slightly narrower definition that, I think, would
still tick all the boxes that she quite rightly feels ought to be
ticked to ensure that regulation is
accurate?</div><a name="0806047000075"></a>

Primarolo:</b> The issue that the hon. Gentleman raises is not
a new problem with regard to the interpretation of the regulations.
Clearly, an embryo outside the body is subject to regulation. However,
he touches on a practical issue for researchers and regulatory
authorities regarding of the purpose of research. I said that when an
egg is developing into an embryo, either a licence would be needed, or
the egg would need to be destroyed. That is the position.</div>
<a name="0806047000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s second question, that matter was carefully
considered. At every point, the struggle&#151;if I may put it like
that&#151;in drafting legislation is to come up with definitions that
clearly define regulation and therefore make the legality of the
regulation work. The Government settled where they did on that basis.
During the debates on the Floor of the House we found, as I am sure we
will find time and time again as the Bill progresses, that there were
very fine judgments and difficulties when going from biological
definitions and trying to permit scientific development and then
putting that into legislation so that it is capable of
regulation.</div>
<a name="0806047000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000369"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for addressing those
points, and I beg the forgiveness of the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness for responding to the Minister&#146;s comments before he
finishes the debate. On the second point, the Minister is clearly
saying that all options were considered and that this one was decided
on for good reasons. One must accept that at this stage. I was
interested to hear that the practical issue for researchers working on
eggs could be dealt with in one of two ways. First, she said that that
could be licensed. Obviously that would be possible, although it would
be a burden if the intention of the research was not to produce an
embryo or something capable of resulting in an embryo.</div>
<a name="0806047000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister&#146;s other
option was that the egg would be destroyed. Perhaps she cannot give me
more detail now, but if she could clarify what she means by that in a
letter, I would be grateful. Is she saying that if this was unlicensed
work, but the researcher noticed that an egg was dividing on its own,
as long as that egg was destroyed, there would be no question of the
researcher having to get a retrospective licence or being prosecuted?
That would be a significant reassurance for researchers, some of whom
have contacted me to raise their concerns. I ask her to confirm that
now, or to offer useful clarification in a letter to me and other
members of the
Committee.</div><a name="0806047000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000370"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> As I said at the beginning, these are probing
amendments. I thank the Minister for her thorough and detailed response
and her clear answers both to the amendments and to the comments made
by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. It was never the
intention of the amendment to remove research on single-cell embryos
from the law. We were looking for greater clarity, not a loss of
clarity. Of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>course, I accept the prohibitions that are set out and detailed in this
part of the Bill. I also accept the challenges that the Minister
highlighted of translating biological definitions into legislative
drafting and structure. It is always a challenging journey to do that,
and that will be a common theme as we go through the Committee stage.
It is a challenging juxtaposition to get those two things right. With
those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

Chairman:</b> Those who have served on Committees under my
chairmanship before know that I take a fairly relaxed view of stand
part debates and breadth of discussion. It is often helpful for the
Committee to have a broad-ranging debate on a first set of amendments
as it tends to set the discussion in context. However, I am not
prepared to permit two stand part debates, one at the beginning and one
at the end. Inevitably, in this context, with a fairly narrowly drawn
clause, we have already had a fairly broad debate so I suspect that I
may be minded to consider that a stand-part debate is not necessary. It
is only fair that I should tell the Committee that
now.</div><a name="0806047000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000372"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I just have a brief question for the Minister
about the definition of nuclear DNA. Why does the clause not include a
definition of mitochondrial DNA, which is obviously different from
nuclear DNA?</div>
<a name="0806047000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000373"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The clause specifically deals only with nuclear
DNA, and it was required only to ensure that the new definition in
section 2 of the 1990 Act actually clarified the term
&#147;nuclear&#148; to include the pronucleus of an embryo. That
was specifically what we were trying to do here. We did not go on to
define &#147;mitochondrial&#148; for the same reason that I gave
the hon. Gentleman with regard to the definition of fertilisation in
terms of where it was anchored in 1990. There is an accepted standard
biological term in the case of &#147;fertilisation&#148;, as there
also is in the case of &#147;mitochondrial&#148; and therefore it
was considered not to be
necessary.</div><a name="0806047000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806047000374"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Gary Streeter</b> (South-West Devon) (Con): The Minister says
that the Bill deals only with nuclear DNA, but proposed new section
3ZA(2) and (3) refer to &#147;nuclear or mitochondrial DNA.&#148;
Surely that would warrant a definition.</div>
<a name="0806047000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000375"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The answer that I just gave to the hon. Member
for Boston and Skegness was that we did not define
&#147;fertilisation&#148; because it was not necessary to have a
definition, since there was a clear biological meaning for HFEA to
interpret. The same is true of &#147;mitochondrial.&#148; What was
necessary was to clarify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>DNA to include the pronucleus, and that is why clause 2 is here. The
biological definition of &#147;mitochondrial&#148; stands in the
same way as that of
&#147;fertilisation&#148;.</div>
<a name="0806047000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000376"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am intrigued by this because later on in the
Bill we are going to be discussing allowing mitochondrial DNA to be
implanted to stop mitochondrial disease, but prohibiting nuclear DNA
from being manipulated to stop nuclear DNA diseases being transferred.
There is a distinct difference between the two kinds of DNA, depending
on where they are located within the cell. That is why I am intrigued
as to why there is no distinct definition between the
two.</div>
<a name="0806047000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000377"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> And the answer I am giving is that, where a
definition is contentious, where it is challenged, as it was between
&#147;nuclear&#148; and &#147;pronuclear&#148;, it is necessary
to define. Where it is not, as with &#147;fertilisation&#148; and
&#147;mitochondrial&#148;, it is not necessary because the
biological terms stand. It is not that the Bill is silent on this: it
is anchored by the clear understanding.</div>

provided the 1990 Act as amended by the regulations&#151;I think that
they were the European tissue directive regulations. The regulations
inserted the reference to &#147;non-medical fertility

Simmonds:</b> May I say one final thing on clause 2? I am
trying to draw information. Unusually, I am not particularly happy with
the Minister&#146;s response. I understand about the broader
definition. As I said before, that will be one of the main challenges
and themes running through the Bill. However, there are distinct
differences between mitochondrial DNA, nuclear and pro-nuclear DNA. I
think it would be sensible if the relevant individuals went back and
gave some thought to whether that distinction needs to be made clear in
the Bill.</div><a name="0806047000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000388"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in
clause 3, page 3, line 7, at
the end insert</div> <a name="08060431000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;except
when the egg has in prescribed circumstances undergone a prescribed

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000389"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 2, in
clause 3, page 3, leave out lines 19 to
24.</div><a name="0806047000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 33, in

&#145;gametes&#146;, insert &#145;including the
mitochondria,&#146;.</div><a name="0806047000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000390"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Clause 3 deals with prohibitions in connection
with embryos. Amendment No. 1 relates to the transfer of some serious
and life-threatening diseases through the mitochondrial part of the
cell&#151;the outside part, surrounding the nucleus&#151;which can
be translated through generations. I am supportive of mitochondrial
research, which could make a significant contribution to
eradicating&#151;certainly reducing the incidence of&#151;some
serious diseases that are passed on through the generations. The
amendment would place a reference to mitochondrial transplant in the
Bill, rather than in a regulation-making power. Such a serious area of
medical research clearly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>throws up, as other parts of the Bill do, important moral and ethical
issues, which Parliament needs to debate
thoroughly.</div><a name="0806047000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">You may or
may not be aware, Mr. Gale, that there are no mitochondria
in sperm. Scientists are working to remove the nucleus of a cell of a
woman with a mitochondrial disease, place the cytoplasm of a healthy
woman&#146;s egg in there, and then fertilise it. Once normal
mitochondria are established, future generations will also have normal
mitochondria. The controversial part of this is that the resulting
child will have 99.5 per cent. of the mother&#146;s genetic material,
100 per cent. of the father&#146;s genetic material and clearly 0.5
per cent. from a third party, although the DNA in the
mitochondria&#151;this is the part that I think is very
significant&#151;carries no information that defines any human
attributes.</div><a name="0806047000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
Professor Turnbull at Newcastle university has carried out under
licence a process whereby an ovum from a woman with a mitochondrial
disease has been fertilised by her partner&#146;s sperm. As soon as
the first cell is formed, it contains two pronuclei, one from the woman
and one from the partner, containing 100 per cent. of his
DNA and 99.95 per cent. of hers. However, at the moment, the licence
from the HFEA does not allow this embryo to be implanted in the woman.
I think that this needs to be changed in the actual Bill rather than
through regulation-making
powers.</div><a name="0806047000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 2
removes the regulation-making power, which would be superfluous if the
reference was included in the Bill.</div>
<a name="0806047000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
33 is a consequential amendment that, if mitochondria donation is
permitted under amendment No. 1, ensures that consent is received from
a person whose mitochondria are used in treatment. Mitochondria are
tiny parts of the gamete, so it is important that the Bill refers not
just to whole gametes but also to parts of gametes, and it is
absolutely important that consent remains a fundamental cornerstone of
the Bill and this particular part of the
Bill.</div><a name="0806047000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000391"></a>Robert
Key:</b> I think I am right in saying that I am the only
Back-Bench member of this Committee who is a veteran of the 1990
Standing Committee&#151;although I am delighted to acknowledge the
Minister as another veteran of that Bill. The amendment raises issues
that are absolutely fundamental to this Bill. I entirely support what
my hon. Friend has been saying about this specific issue. However, it
raises the more fundamental issue of the purpose of the legislation and
the process by which we need to consider it.</div>
<a name="0806047000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the 1990 Act, we tried to set
out the broad framework and established the HFEA as the body of
specialists charged with carrying out the wishes of Parliament. That
was one reason why the HFEA was never designed to be made up of people
who were, on the one hand, very pro-science and pro the processes
involved, and on the other hand, deeply philosophically and ethically
opposed to it. That was not the function of the HFEA.</div>
<a name="0806047000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of the legislation now
before us, the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee of both Houses, on
which I and others here sat, was equally clear that Parliament&#146;s
role was to establish the broad legislative framework, and the moral
and ethical dimensions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>within which regulations should be made, by those who best knew what was
happening. One of the problems from 1990 onwards&#151;it was
inevitable and it was forecast&#151;was that science would always be
ahead of Parliament. Parliament&#146;s duty was to ensure that the
Government of the day could take account of improvements in medical
science and technology, of movements in public attitude and in the
scientific approach to the moral and ethical issues. It was to ensure
that the regulatory body made the final judgment on individual cases
and applications for research projects and clinical trials. That is
what we are up against here.</div>
<a name="0806047000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since I, along with the
pre-legislative joint Committee, recommended this procedure, I would
prefer to see this particular clause stand as it is, and certainly not
see it removed. That does not devalue what my hon. Friend the Member
for Boston and Skegness has said. He is absolutely right. However, it
does mean that we should not tinker with the fundamental principle that
it is for Parliament to set the broad parameters and for the regulatory
authority to decide the
detail.</div><a name="0806047000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806047000392"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): The business end of this group
of amendments relates to subsection (5), which is related in turn to
subsection (6), which repeals a section of the Human Reproductive
Cloning Act 2001&#151;which, I believe, is repealed in full elsewhere
in this piece of legislation. There are some anxieties about doing
that, but there is a desirable goal to be achieved, namely, preventing
the transmission of serious mitochondrial disease. I support attempts
to achieve that. The problem is that there are many ways to do it.
</div><a name="0806047000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pre-screening
is one way with which we are familiar. However, if we look at nuclear
transfer, which appears to be the object of the regulations mentioned
in the Bill, there are different ways in which that may be done. There
is the simple case of transferring one person&#146;s egg into another
person&#146;s cytoplasm. There is also the transferring of a
fertilised embryo into the cytoplasm of a third person. That creates
some concerns. Lord Walton announced in the House of Lords that
researchers at Newcastle university had found successful ways of doing
that, and he pointed it out as something else that was new and which
could be authorised by the legislation and subsequent
regulations.</div><a name="0806047000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an
inescapable fact that some mitochondrial diseases are not a product of
diseased mitochondria per se, but have an origin in the nucleus of the
cell itself. That is an indisputable scientific fact, and I do not
think there is any argument about it. It would follow from that,
necessarily, that regulations are therefore capable of prescribing in
this particular case manipulation of the nucleus of human cells or some
form of connected engineering. The Minister can contradict me on that,
but it seems to me a fairly transparent reading of the legislation as
it stands before us. It does not seem to be the
case&#151;particularly as we have not repealed the Human Reproductive
Cloning Act 2001&#151;that there is a loophole whereby cloning can
also be authorised.</div>
<a name="0806047000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are genuine ethical
concerns here. I am concerned that this is, in a sense, carte blanche.
It is an opportunity for a number of things to happen, some of which we
will be comfortable with, and some of which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>we will not. Lord Walton, in the House of Lords, said that he thought
this probably was encompassed by the legislation. However, in a less
than complimentary article in <i class="I">Nature</i>, Dr. Chinnery, who
conducted the research to which Lord Walton referred,
said:</div><a name="0806047000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
wouldn't feel comfortable doing it [in patients] now for a number of
reasons ... There are a number of scientific, legal and ethical
issues&#151;we've got to engage in a debate to ensure that society
feels this is the right thing for us to
do.&#148;</div><a name="0806047000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who is going to
engage in the debate? It seems to me that if we leave the clause as it
stands, the debate is only going to be had in the HFEA and nowhere
else.</div><a name="0806047000122"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000393"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that there has been
some debate on this in recent years? There was debate both outside and
inside Parliament, on the White Paper and on the draft Bill. Under the
Bill as proposed, there would have to be further debate in Parliament
and outside when regulations were brought allowing the manipulation of
eggs or embryos to tackle the problem of mitochondrial disease. There
has been a lot of debate, and there is plenty of scope for
more.</div><a name="0806047000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000394"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I would be much relieved if I thought the fine
detail of this were going to be examined by elected Members, but I do
not think that that is the case. I think it is more likely to be the
object of appreciable debate in the HFEA and nowhere else. It will
simply happen. Even so, it is clear that we must know what we are doing
and what the Bill encompasses. Matters are as simple as
that.</div><a name="0806047000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="0806047000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The broad clause
prescribes circumstances and processes for which regulations may
provide. I am unhappy about such an approach. Had we moved amendment
No. 21, I would have drawn attention to that. Elsewhere in the
provisions that we have dealt with so far, clause 1(5) allows the
Secretary of State to redefine key terms such as &#147;gamete&#148;
and &#147;embryo&#148;. There are genuine anxieties about that. If
fundamental concepts of legislation can be redefined on the hoof,
concern will be expressed. We must be fairly clear about what is
happening. It is not as though any of the learned papers that I have
read so far about the provisions establishes a clear, moral consensus.
That does not exist. We have blank cheque legislation. I used that
expression on Second Reading, and do not repent doing
so.</div><a name="0806047000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
more positive way in which to express matters is used by advocates of
the Bill as it stands. They talk of future-proofing legislation.
Future-proofing is a more positive way in which to describe what I
referred to as blank cheque legislation. It is fine. I am all for
future-proofing legislation. I do not have a fundamental difficulty
with the concept per se, as long as we future-proof against a set of
principles and moral ideas that we all clearly understand and we know
where they are
heading.</div><a name="0806047000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">If Lord
Walton, who is from the university of Newcastle, sees no problem with
something with which someone who undertakes research can see scientific
and moral difficulties, then transparently, evidently and empirically
that consensus does not exist. I know the Government&#146;s
intentions because they have outlined them on many occasions. They have
said that they do not want to provide a loophole for reproductive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>cloning. That is entirely fine, and I dare say that they do not want
genetic manipulation to take place either as a way to deal with
mitochondrial diseases, but that is not what the Bill says. The
Government&#146;s intentions and their legislation are two different
things. I am therefore genuinely concerned. In a sense, amendment No. 2
would strike out such matters, but it would also strike out laudable
attempts to address mitochondrial disease where the cause is the
mitochondria per se. People might be unhappy about that. I ask the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness to correct me if I have not understood
the amendment properly. I do not think that the Committee would be
comfortable with such a dramatic outcome.</div>
<a name="0806047000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000395"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I just wish to assist the hon. Gentleman and
clarify the intentions of amendment No. 2. It would strike out the
Secretary of State&#146;s regulation-making power because the
decision to allow the mitochondrial research would be inserted into the
Bill. As a result, lines 19 to 24 of clause 3 on page 3 of the Bill
would become
superfluous.</div><a name="0806047000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000396"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I am comforted by that explanation and anything that
would make the Government&#146;s intentions more clear in the Bill
and leaves discretion where it should be. A clear moral consensus about
what may or may not be done would make me feel more comfortable about
the Bill as a whole. However, if we look at it from the point of view
of the parliamentary draftsman, we must say that it leaves the door
wide open to all sorts of things that the Committee has not even
envisaged.</div><a name="0806047000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000397"></a>Mr.
Streeter:</b> I am delighted to serve in Committee under your
chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I rise to support the last two
speakers. Whereas the Bill takes great pains&#151;to the credit of
the draftsman&#151;to prescribe and regulate tightly activities that
may or may not take place, we find suddenly in subsection (5), the
subject of amendment No. 2, which I support, that the Government may
make regulations in the future to deal with something that is not
permitted under the Bill at present. To correct the hon. Member for
Southport, I must say that the regulations would be made not by the
HFEA but by the
Government.</div><a name="0806047000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000398"></a>Robert
Key:</b> By
Parliament.</div><a name="0806047000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000399"></a>Mr.
Streeter:</b> The regulations would be made by the Government
tabling a statutory instrument before Parliament. We know the extent of
scrutiny that that can involve&#151;perhaps 90 minutes of debate
which, first and foremost, would be within the Government themselves.
There would then no doubt be a short debate in Parliament.</div>
<a name="0806047000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask
the Minister whether the wording of subsection (5) is as tightly drawn
as it might be. Reading with my legal eyes on, I agree that it could
well become a loophole in the hands of future
Governments&#151;obviously not in those of this Government, who are
sensible, moderate and regulatory and who we are thrilled are in place
at the moment. We could even have a coalition Government; the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon could be the Secretary of State
for Health. We do not know what might happen in future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="0806047000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is capable of a wide
interpretation and I will explain why. If we read it as it might be
drafted without its sub-definitions:</div>
<a name="0806047000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regulations may provide
that&#151;</div><a name="0806047000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) an egg
can be a permitted egg,
or</div><a name="0806047000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) an embryo can be
a permitted embryo,</div><a name="0806047000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">even though
the egg or embryo has had applied to
it&#151;&#148;</div><a name="0806047000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;in
circumstances set out by regulation, a process also set out by
regulation, which is&#151;</div>
<a name="0806047000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;designed to prevent the
transmission of serious mitochondrial disease.&#148;</div>
<a name="0806047000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Control over the process and
circumstances is entirely in the hands of the people who write the
regulations. As I understand, that could be far wider than the issue
that my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness referred to,
which is at the back at the Government&#146;s mind. That is the
process by which we take a little bit from one egg, mainly the
mother&#146;s, and make an egg which is free from genetic diseases.
Who could argue with the desire behind that? However, in my opinion the
wording of the clause goes far beyond that. As technology develops, it
could allow regulations to be made that take us well beyond that in
terms of circumstances and processes that regulate what egg and what
embryo.</div> <a name="0806047000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Government will look again at that point. Many people are concerned
that new section 3ZA(5) is a loophole, probably unintended, but a
loophole nonetheless. It could end in permitting the kind of
reproductive cloning or genetic manipulation that the Government have
rightly set their face against. I hope that when the Minister responds,
she will not brush such concerns aside as they are held by a number of
people. The point is more about drafting than ethics or science. The
drafting of subsection (5) must be looked at
again.</div>
<a name="0806047000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000400"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I rise to support the Bill as drafted and to
follow up the point made by the hon. Member for Salisbury. I am
delighted to see the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Boston
and Skegness. They press for a more permissive approach on the question
of permitted embryos than the Government envisage. The idea behind them
is that we should not need further regulations, and that there is
enough information to show the likelihood that the technique will be
both effective and safe enough to trial under informed consent. In
addition, we have enough confidence in the regulator to ensure that
those two provisions are policed with regard to effectiveness, safety
and consent, so that we do not need Parliament to approve specific
regulations. Those arrangements could be designed by the
HFEA.</div> <a name="0806047000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have great
sympathy with that approach. I have always pressed for a more
permissive approach, given that we have an authority that everyone says
is wonderful and adept at making the regulations. I know that the
approach proposed by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness was
proposed in the House of Lords by Lord Walton, who has connections with
Newcastle university where much of this work is being done by Doug
Turnbull&#146;s group. Although I have a huge amount of sympathy with
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach, one would have to have
regulations to prescribe and circumscribe what we want. In the end, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>I can see no other way than to provide for the regulations,
although I have sympathy with what he is doing. It is important that
the House indicates very clearly that we want to be able to translate
research&#151;which is currently permitted in this area&#151;into
the clinic, and that we signal very strongly that we are minded not to
oppose the concept of regulations, but to ensure that further scrutiny
is of the regulations, not the principle. I am glad to see that there
appears to be widespread support from all sides of the House for this
sort of approach. I hope in the separate clause stand part debate to
identify another area where we need to ensure that research that does
not come under mitochondrial disease can be translated from the clinic
to clinical therapies for patients.</div>
<a name="0806047000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Southport was not really supporting the approach I just set out. He was
arguing that we cannot simply leave it to regulations, because
regulations would be a simple one and a half hour debate in both Houses
under the affirmative procedure, as set out later on in the Bill.
Clearly, whenever we agree to a regulation-making power, we limit the
amount of amendments that can be made to the regulations. So I hope
that the Government would agree, insofar as they can for this
Government&#151;because it may not be in the time scale of this
current Government&#151;that if they do propose to introduce these
regulations, they will produce them in draft for consultation. After
that, the regulations could be reconsidered and brought back again
without having to be formally withdrawn. That would be considered quite
a big step in this place: one rarely sees regulations that are laid in
draft withdrawn, so I hope that the Government will take a consultative
approach to the drafting of the regulations.</div>
<a name="0806047000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would say again to my hon.
Friend the Member for Southport that there was considerable debate
about this during the consultation period, considerable debate around
this in the White Paper, and considerable debate on the draft Bill. It
was considered by a Joint Select Committee of both Houses and I think
there has been plenty of public, as well as parliamentary,
debate.</div>
<a name="0806047000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000401"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> The point that I made that my hon. Friend has not
addressed was in connection with the different ways in which one could
tackle mitochondrial disease, either by doing something with the
nucleus or by cell transfer. One represents a clear step in the
direction of genetic engineering; the other, one could argue, does not
to the same extent. My hon. Friend may not see that distinction, but
other people do. If there is that kind of moral divide&#151;it is a
significant moral divide, though it may not be significant for
everybody&#151;would it not be more appropriate not to regulate but
to tighten the legislation sufficiently to circumscribe what the
legislation intends to facilitate?</div>
<a name="0806047000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000402"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I accept that point and I wanted to come on to it,
along with the point made by the hon. Member for South-West Devon,
because there is a small problem&#151;which I admit I did not notice
during the Bill&#146;s passage through the Lords&#151;with the
phrasing of subsection (5). I just wanted to finish the point that I
was making on the amendments more broadly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div><a name="0806047000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mitochondrial
DNA, which causes some mitochondrial disease, represents about 0.5 per
cent. of the genes that humans have. The DNA in the mitochondria do not
code for any human attributes. These are genes that have been preserved
through evolution from bacterial inclusions in cells, and therefore are
common across many species, though they will differ between
species.</div> <a name="0806047000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, if one accepts that it is possible to change the DNA in
mitochondria without its being considered germ-line gene therapy or
germ-line gene engineering, because we restrict that to nuclear DNA,
then I would argue that it is probably not appropriate to have the same
consent arrangements for donors of mitochondria as for donors of
nuclear DNA. So I question whether amendment No. 33, even within the
construct that the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness has put, is
appropriate, because it gives a status to the mitochondria in respect
of consent that they do not deserve because they do not pass on
recognisable human attributes, which is the basis for the very strong
consenting arrangements that the Minister has
proposed.</div><a name="0806047000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful if the Minister could clarify that, as at the moment it is not
clear whether there is, or needs to be, any difference in the consent
arrangements for the donor of mitochondrial DNA. Clearly donors must
consent to the donating of the tissue, but it is not clear whether that
is done under the strong and strict consent arrangements that exist
under the Human Tissue Act 2004, or whether the Government envisage
going further and introducing regulations to raise the status of that
donation. I am not convinced that we need to raise the status, as it is
a tissue donation. I would not want it to be seen as a donation of a
genetic attribute, as that would make it more difficult for us to
defend what the Government are doing, with my support, in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806047000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="0806047000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">As this has been
raised, it is appropriate to speak about subsection (6). However, we
will come that in the next debate, so I will not mention it now. On the
issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Southport and the hon.
Member for South-West Devon, there may be a problem. I have seen a
document from Human Genetics Alert&#151;an organisation with which I
generally disagree in principle and in practice&#151;that points out
this issue. Some mitochondrial diseases, including serious ones, are
transmitted by nuclear DNA coding for some of the proteins in the
mitochondria. The argument would be that the current wording of
subsection (5) would permit in the regulations a process by which the
egg or embryo could have nuclear transfer as the prescribed process, or
at least gene transfer into the nucleus designed to prevent the
transmission of serious mitochondrial disease. The Government have
already said that that is not their intention and I do not believe that
it is the intention of the researchers working on this in Newcastle
university and elsewhere. They have made that absolutely clear. I do
not believe that any Government would produce regulations permitting
that, or that the HFEA, even if it could, would issue a licence for it.
However, if that is the case, perhaps the Government would consider
making that clear in subsection (5) of proposed new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>section 3ZA, which sets out what the regulations may provide. They might
for example, at the end of the section</div>
<a name="0806047000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;even though the egg or embryo has
had applied to it in prescribed circumstances a prescribed process
designed to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial
disease&#148;</div><a name="0806047000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">add
&#147;transmitted by DNA in the mitochondria&#148;.</div>
<a name="0806047000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, the two hon. Members
who spoke before have raised a valid and fair point and I would be
grateful if the Minister could address that in her
response.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000403"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> This has been an interesting debate. There have
been quite a few misunderstandings about the intention of the clause,
which I hope that I can clarify.</div>
<a name="0806047000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mitochondrial diseases are a
collection of life-threatening conditions caused by mutations in the
small amount of DNA found in the mitochondria. The mutations affect
children and cause illnesses and other conditions such as fatal liver
failure, stroke-like episodes, blindness, profound muscular weakness
and diabetes. Research is currently being carried out under an HFEA
licence to look at ways to avoid mitochondrial diseases.</div>
<a name="0806047000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recognition of the severity
of those conditions and the potential of this research to provide an
effective treatment, the Bill provides, through a regulation-making
power, for eggs or embryos that have had applied to them a specific
process to avoid serious mitochondrial diseases to be considered as
&#147;permitted&#148; and therefore used in treatment. The
particular process and the particular circumstances in which it would
be appropriate would be detailed in the regulations, and I want to come
back specifically to how we would proceed with such regulations. First,
I shall deal quickly with the
amendments.</div><a name="0806047000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 1 adds the words &#147;or life-threatening&#148;, so that the
technique could be used to treat serious or life-threatening
conditions. I say very gently to the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness that, as I currently see it, that does not add anything to the
Bill, which already allows for serious conditions, and clearly,
life-threatening conditions are serious. The amendment seems
unnecessary at that level, but it would also limit the way that the
technique could be applied by restricting it to eggs only. That would
mean that, if should it transpire, following research, that the best
way to avoid serious mitochondrial disease would be through modifying
recently fertilised eggs&#151; which would therefore, according to
the definition in the Bill, be embryos&#151;it would not be
possible.</div><a name="0806047000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
regulating power were removed, there would be no flexibility to return
to it in future. I want to be absolutely clear that the Bill provides
limited powers for secondary legislation to ensure that the definitions
of gamete and embryo are clear, and strictly limited powers to allow
for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases at the embryonic stage.
They are all affirmative resolutions by both Houses. There has clearly
been some comment about what would precede the debates in both the
Houses, and I shall come to that shortly.</div>
<a name="0806047000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 3 would amend new
schedule 3ZA by including in the types of treatment for which
counselling must be offered a specific reference to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>mitochondria. That would ensure that counselling was afforded if
mitochondria of gametes were used in the treatment services rather than
the gametes themselves. The amendment is not necessary because even if
mitochondria were extracted from the egg, the egg would still have to
be used for the purposes of these provisions, and the couple receiving
the treatment would still be offered counselling. There is no need to
add an additional provision.</div>
<a name="0806047000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the relating power included
in clause
3&#151;</div><a name="0806047000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000404"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Can the Minister clarify that there would not need
to be counselling of the person providing the mitochondria in such a
process, but just the couple having the
child?</div><a name="0806047000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000405"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> At this stage I am referring just to the
couple. I am coming on to the regulation-making power, what it can do,
how we would proceed, the sort of questions that may be raised, and why
it is not currently possible to put that into the Bill because of the
process of the research.</div>
<a name="0806047000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulation-making power in
the clause is to make secondary legislation, and it is about helping
couples to conceive a child without a serious medical condition. It is
not about reproductive cloning on which the Government are absolutely
clear and committed to a ban. The Bill makes crystal clear the
definitions of what is a permitted embryo and therefore what can be
placed into a woman.</div>
<a name="0806047000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">To date, research is looking at
transferring genetic material from a recently fertilised egg from the
couple seeking treatment into a donor egg with the genetic material
removed. That does not involve somatic cell material. It is not
anticipated that it would. The commitment to the ban on reproductive
cloning and oversight of the technique as a whole would be ensured by
setting out the specific process in regulations, and those regulations
would be subject to the affirmative
procedure.</div><a name="0806047000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000406"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Will the right hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="0806047000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000407"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman be a little patient? He
raised a lot of important issues in respect of how we will proceed with
the regulations, and I intend to answer them.</div>
<a name="0806047000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not clear whether the
research will demonstrate more success with eggs or embryos, hence the
matter of whether it is specifically in the Bill. Although to date it
focuses on very recently fertilised eggs, which under the Bill&#146;s
definition would be an embryo, we cannot rule out the possibility that
eggs may offer the most successful treatment. It is therefore essential
that the possibilities are not limited and that all treatment options
are left open by ensuring that the prescribed process could be either
for eggs or embryos.</div><a name="0806047000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, details relating to the circumstances of mitochondrial
donation can be provided for under the regulations as and when they are
drafted and consulted on&#151;both points made by the hon. Members
for South-West Devon, for Southport and for Oxford, West and Abingdon.
That would include consideration of whether all the donor information
would apply to the mitochondrial donors. There is also scope to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>amend specifically the relevant consent provisions through the
regulations. In addition, separately from the regulations, it would be
standard practice in a clinic that any person donating eggs or material
used to create an embryo, such as cells, would provide consent and be
given the opportunity for
counselling.</div><a name="0806047000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the point made by the hon. Member for Salisbury about the importance
that Parliament sets on broad parameters and the way that we have
proceeded in all the debates since 1990, the first step would be to
prepare draft regulations for consultation. Because of the issues that
will be raised, a full consultation would be undertaken in much the
same way as we have done in respect of many aspects of the
Bill.</div><a name="0806047000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The results of
the consultation would be considered. Amended drafts would be made
available, if necessary for further consultation before matters came to
this House and the other place for debate and affirmative resolution.
Because there are so many questions that we cannot yet answer, the Bill
provides for the principle, but not the means&#151;the regulations.
They can be drafted only when the research is at a more advanced stage.
That satisfies the dual principles that Parliament seeks to achieve. We
want to approve&#151;and rightly so&#151;the specific details of
the techniques prescribed in the
regulations.</div><a name="0806047000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulating power would allow for consideration and consultation. It
would be necessary to gather the views of the public, ethicists and
relevant stakeholders on the appropriateness of using donor eggs for
that specific process. That would need to be considered at that stage.
The Bill provides the flexibility for further consideration by the
public and Parliament, and for the specific details of the techniques
to be specified in regulations. More importantly, the Bill allows that
once the safety of the technique is established and not before. The
provisions of the Bill will provide opportunities for couples to have a
child safe in the knowledge that they will not suffer from serious
mitochondrial conditions that may affect their families. That is
precisely the intent. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for
Boston and Skegness will reflect on the fact that his amendments would
weaken the intent and curtail the debate so that it can be held at the
appropriate time, when we have more accurate indications of the science
and what we might be agreeing
to.</div><a name="0806047000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="0806047000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000408"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> The Minister used the phrase &#147;crystal
clear&#148;. My point is that it is not crystal clear from the
phrasing of the Bill that interference with somatic cells of the
nucleus is prohibited. In fact, as the Bill is written, it is allowed.
She has said that regulation will preclude that, but regulation is not
legislation, and she might not be the regulator in the future. Would
she confirm that? I know what the Government&#146;s intentions are
and I know what the regulations are likely to address if she is the
Minister, but the Bill as it stands allows what I said, even though it
does not want to do
so.</div><a name="0806047000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point
that I want to make, briefly, is about the scope of regulation, which
the Minister has not really responded to. We are debating a Bill about
human fertilisation and we are allowing &#147;embryo&#148;, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>&#147;egg&#148;, &#147;sperm&#148; and &#147;gametes&#148;
to be redefined by regulation. If the hon. Member for Norwich, North
were here and we had a terrorism Bill with a clause saying that
&#147;terrorism&#148; could be redefined by regulation at a date
subsequent to the passing of the Bill, he would be frankly appalled.
There is an issue about the range of regulation, and also about what
regulation can do and what it
does.</div><a name="0806047000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000409"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I said to the hon. Gentleman that I did not
agree with his interpretation. More people take my view than take his.
This is precisely the type of debate that has taken place since the
1980s about interpretations of what is possible and of the law. I
believe that the fears that he holds will not come to pass, and I am
convinced that the Bill protects that. I am grateful for what he says
about what he believes will be done if I am the Minister&#151;that
would be the case&#151;but I have absolute confidence that every
parliamentarian in the House, whoever happened to be the Minister at
the relevant time, would ensure that the scrutiny of the proposals was
commensurate with the clear wishes of the
House.</div><a name="0806047000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000410"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="0806047000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000411"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Just a minute, please. The clear wish of the
House&#151;in the past, now and in the future&#151;is for the
issues to be scrutinised thoroughly. The reverse would be true if we
tried to put an incomplete definition in the Bill that did not stand
the test of time because it was drafted before the knowledge was
available.</div><a name="0806047000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000412"></a>Dr.
Harris</b>
<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div><a name="0806047000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000413"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I give way, once more, to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="0806047000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000414"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way to
Opposition spokespeople who are probing her. I am grateful for her
answer, which is clear as far as it goes. I raised a specific point
that was made more generally by two other members of the Committee.
Even if she proposes to do nothing about it, will she accept the
principle of what regulations could provide, even if that is not her
intention or, in her judgment, the intention of any future Minister? Is
it her view that the provisions might permit a process designed to
prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial disease transmitted
by nuclear DNA, not just by mitochondrial DNA? If she accepts that that
is possible, and that people might therefore think that it is possible
in the future by regulation, does she see any merit in having a look at
that before Report to determine whether&#151;very carefully and so as
not to preclude any scientific advance&#151;the provision could be
narrowed sufficiently to make it absolutely clear to those who worry
about a slippery slope and over-permissive legislation regarding
genetic alteration that there may be scope to narrow things
somewhat?</div><a name="0806047000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000415"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> To answer the point about redefining or adding,
which was raised by the hon. Member for Southport: no. It is simply
incorrect to assert that they can be redefined by secondary
legislation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="0806047000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Oxford, West
and Abingdon is theoretically correct, and if he can think of a better
way of doing that, that is fine. However, nobody has so far managed to
do so&#151;including him, during pre-legislative scrutiny.</div>
<a name="0806047000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have stated
clearly that there should be a prohibition of genetic modification such
as the Bill provides, so it is, frankly, dangerous for the hon.
Gentleman to move into the sphere of what might theoretically be
possible, even though it is prohibited, because he undermines the
principles in the Bill to which he is
committed.</div><a name="0806047000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think we
have had a very interesting debate. This is a very difficult
area&#151;there are not many simple areas in the Bill&#151;but I
hope that the thoroughness of the consultation and the extensive
contributions that have been made to the process satisfy members of the
Committee that the Bill is as accurate and as well crafted as possible,
and that there is therefore no reason not to proceed with the
arrangements in the clause. When the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness replies, I sincerely hope that he will consider withdrawing
his amendment, at least to allow further reflection, rather than
pressing it to a
Division.</div><a name="0806047000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000416"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I thank the Minister for responding to my point. I
appreciate it when she addresses a point that I raise. I accept that
there is a risk of being over-prescriptive for fear of something that
is theoretically possible. She knows that I want to see something that
allows Parliament to have confidence in regulation, but that is not
over-regulatory as far as scientists, researchers and clinicians are
concerned. I want something that allows this country to be seen as a
properly regulated, ethical place in which to do research, but a place
that allows research to go on.</div>
<a name="0806047000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I confess that I did not spot
this issue in the pre-legislative scrutiny period. I do not find it
easy to acknowledge that it was pointed out to me by Human Genetics
Alert, an organisation that, I think, gets it wrong a lot of the time
and interprets incorrectly some of the proposals that we are
addressing. The Minister has accepted that there is a point here. I
have not thought about what the drafting would be, but I think that she
has given an invitation to others to look at whether there can be
drafting that makes it very clear that we are not envisaging the
alteration of nuclear DNA. She mentioned that the Bill provides for a
ban on the alteration of nuclear DNA, which is found in proposed new
section 3ZA(4), which
states:</div><a name="0806047000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
embryo is a permitted embryo if...no nuclear or mitochondrial DNA
of any cell of the embryo has been altered&#148;.
</div><a name="0806047000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">That situation is altered, as
far as mitochondrial DNA is concerned, under subsection (5), or at
least that is the intention. In other words, the ban that rightly
exists on nuclear DNA alteration is in the same terms as the ban on
mitochondrial DNA alteration, which subsection (5) overturns subject to
regulations.</div><a name="0806047000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
am reassured&#151;the Minister knows I am reassured&#151;of the
Government&#146;s intention on the existing ban, other people may
consider that this provision does allow regulations to make provision
on that. While I accept the Minister&#146;s sincerity, and indeed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>her judgment, if it is possible for this to be dealt with at a later
stage, I think that we
should.</div><a name="0806047000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000417"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is
absolutely the Government&#146;s intention to ban this? I understand
the point that he is making. Although I am utterly convinced that this
work has been done, I will do all I can in this process as the
Minister&#151;including reflecting on the point he has made&#151;to
ensure that what I am saying is absolutely correct and there are no
lacunae or any way that the situation could be
undermined.</div>
<a name="0806047000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000418"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I absolutely accept the Minister&#146;s position
and that she does not envisage any alteration to nuclear DNA being
permitted under regulations. I also said that I agreed with her
judgment that no other Government would permit this. Such interventions
show her to be the thoughtful and helpful Minister who she is. It is
extremely valuable that she has given us the opportunity to think
further about whether action might be necessary&#151;I accept that
she does not say that it is necessary to do something&#151;and, if it
is judged necessary, whether it can be done without being
over-restrictive.</div><a name="0806047000185"></a>

Simmonds:</b> I thank the Minister for her helpful responses
to a debate that was stimulated by a series of amendments that I
tabled. I would just like to pick up one or two of the points that have
been made by hon. Members.</div>
<a name="0806047000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Salisbury was absolutely right to set out that Parliament must decide
the principles, but the HFEA must be allowed to regulate. I think that
the job for us in Parliament, as members of this Committee, is to
establish where the balance between those two particular principles
lies. The Minister certainly put my mind at rest with regard to the
regulatory powers and the fact that they will be published in draft for
consultation, although I share the concern of the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon, in that I cannot think of any draft
regulations that have been altered as a consequence of such
consultation during my time in Parliament. If the Minister and her
officials could give an example of when that has happened, I would be
grateful.</div><a name="0806047000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000420"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> As a former Treasury Minister, I can assure the
hon. Gentleman that that was the case for Finance Bills. We got to the
point where something like more than half of a Finance Bill had been
consulted on by being published in draft, amended, brought back and
consulted on. The House does that, and there has been very full
consultation in this area.</div>
<a name="0806047000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000421"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am sure that the Minister will be aware that
that is not the same as altering regulatory powers and draft
regulations. Indeed, the Government have problems with the current
Finance Bill. I think the concern that I share with the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon is that there needs to be a genuine
consultation, not just&#151;I do not want to go down this road too
far&#151;a sham consultation, as we have in some circumstances. The
consultation needs to be genuine because this is a very significant and
important area.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="0806047000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought that it was clear from
the Bill that nuclear DNA would be prohibited. Following the exchange
that hon. Members have had with the Minister, I am now not so sure, so
I am pleased that she is going to reflect on that because I would
otherwise be uncomfortable with the situation. There is a big
distinction between nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA. As I have said,
I am comfortable with mitochondrial DNA, and we need to send a message
to encourage that particular research.</div>
<a name="0806047000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Devon was absolutely right to talk about the possibility of
loose language in the clause, so I hope that the Minister said will
reflect on that. Concern about reproductive cloning was also
highlighted, and if I have time, I would like to discuss that when we
consider the next amendment. However, I think the Minister has put on
the record some extremely helpful foundations as to why this clause is
phrased as it is and why there needs to be a regulatory
power.</div> <a name="0806047000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
reasons why the 1990 Act has lasted for so long is because intermittent
regulations have been put down to update it to catch up with scientific
advancements. If we all want the Bill to have longevity after it comes
out of Parliament, we will have to allow regulatory powers in certain
areas. However, it needs to be clear what Parliament will and will not
allow. I certainly have concerns, which were highlighted by the hon.
Member for Southport, about the possible change to the definition of
gametes and embryos. However, on the basis of the Minister&#146;s
helpful reply and the fact that she is prepared to reflect on hon.
Members&#146; comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

why the exact wording that was set out in the Human Reproductive
Cloning Act 2001 is not in the Bill. I do not necessarily subscribe to
this view, but there is genuine concern that the Bill might leave a
door open to enable cloning to take place. Ministers have said in
Committee and elsewhere that the Bill completely supersedes the 2001
Act. Why are the Act&#146;s exact provisions not in the Bill? My
amendment would put the wording of the Act into the Bill. It is
absolutely essential that Parliament sends a message that we do not
approve of reproductive cloning and that it needs to be outlawed and
prohibited
completely.</div><a name="0806047000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000423"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness for tabling the amendment because it gives us an opportunity
to discuss this issue. The repeal of the Human Reproductive Cloning Act
2001 has been raised by several members of the public, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>mainly&#151;perhaps exclusively&#151;by those who are opposed to
many measures that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990
permitted and that this Bill will continue to permit. It is important
that they are reassured that the repeal of the 2001 Act in no way
permits reproductive
cloning.</div><a name="0806047000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding&#151;the Minister will obviously go into this in
detail&#151;is that there is a new helpful structure in clause 3.
That is a clever way of dealing with things because it specifies that
the only thing that can be implanted is a permitted embryo, and that a
permitted embryo can be created only from a permitted sperm and a
permitted egg, and defines that in the Bill. Therefore, nothing else,
clearly including a cloned embryo&#151;that is not a permitted embryo
because it has not been created by the fertilisation of a permitted egg
by a permitted sperm&#151;is going to be implanted. It is incredibly
important for that provision to be set out clearly, which the Bill
does. It is a red herring for people to suggest that a repeal of the
Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 somehow allows reproductive
cloning.</div> <a name="0806047000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
unfair to argue that treating mitochondrial disease by cytoplasmic or
mitochondrial transplant is in any way cloning. It is not: cloning
involves the nuclear transfer of a nucleus, not cytoplasm. It is thus a
complete misreading and an incorrect interpretation of this Bill to
suggest that treatment of mitochondrial disease is somehow reproductive
cloning. Certainly, the 2001 Act would not need to be repealed to allow
what we discussed earlier. It is being repealed because it is
inconsistent with the regime that the Government have set up.</div>
<a name="0806047000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is duplication in the
penalties applied, because there are penalties that exist around this
area anyway, without needing the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 to
lock people up and throw away the key. The important point must be made
that the HFEA would not license anything like this, even if there were
not a ban in primary legislation. I did not think the 2001 Act was
necessary in practice, even it was felt necessary politically, and I do
not think that there are any scientists or researchers in this country
who would dream of implanting a cloned embryo. Anyone around the world
who says they are seeking to do it&#151;whether they are maverick
scientists seeking publicity for other purposes or fantasist cults in
Canada&#151;should not be taken seriously because the technology is
nowhere near there, and they would not be able to succeed even if they
were serious. We should not be panicked by the prospect of reproductive
cloning.</div>
<a name="0806047000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000424"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that the technology is not
yet there. Is he insinuating that if it were there, we would need to
have a rethink? Is his annoyance and repugnance of the technology based
on something else&#151;morality, ethics, or
whatever?</div><a name="0806047000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000425"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a good question that was
covered in the report by the Committee that he chaired. I do not have
the report to hand but, if I remember correctly, there were several
grounds for arguing for a ban. One reason was ethical, another was that
the practice was not possible, and another that even if it were
possible, it would not be safe and could never be done ethically.
Informed consent would not be given for something that was not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>required or necessary and did not have sufficient justification. His
report laid down a challenge to politicians to come up with strong,
ethical arguments against the practice&#151;now is not the time to do
that but there are many&#151;in case there came a point where, under
another jurisdiction, it was shown to be safe and effective. I do not
think that we will ever get to that stage and there are good ethical
arguments against it, but I will not hold up the Committee by going
into them. However, the hon. Gentleman raises the good point that when
we talk about a ban on reproductive cloning, we must consider all the
reasons why that is not a good idea.</div>
<a name="0806047000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000426"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The 1990 Act set out to regulate the creation,
keeping and use of embryos outside of the human body, both for
treatment purposes and for research. The Act referred only to the
creation of human embryos by fertilisation&#151;embryos created using
an egg and a sperm. We have already touched on that debate this
morning. Since then, technology advanced to the point at which it could
be possible to create embryos by other means, namely cloning. That led
the Government to introduce the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001,
which made it an offence to place in a woman an embryo created by a
process other than fertilisation. This takes us back to the key debate
about fertilisation in clause 1.</div>
<a name="0806047000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reviewing the 1990 Act, the
Government had to take account of emerging technologies that could be
used to create embryos and that could go further than just reproductive
cloning. Modern science can be used to create gametes using adult or
embryonic stem cells&#151;so-called artificial gametes&#151;and the
technology exists to genetically modify those gametes, which, when
used, would create an embryo containing germ line genetic
modifications.</div><a name="0806047000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
will permit the creation, keeping and use of genetically modified
embryos for research purposes only under licence, and it will enable
research on artificial gametes, subject to regulation. However, the
Government do not intend that such embryos and gametes should be used
in treatment. For that reason, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon pointed out, the Bill introduces the concept of permitted
sperm, permitted eggs and permitted embryos. Permitted sperm and eggs
are the only gametes that may be used in reproductive treatments such
as artificial insemination or in vitro
fertilisation.</div><a name="0806047000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be
permitted, a sperm must have come from the testes of a man, and an egg
from the ovaries of a woman. Additionally, the gametes must not have
been genetically modified in any way. It follows that a permitted
embryo is an embryo that may be created only by the fertilisation of a
permitted egg with a permitted sperm. In essence, that means that no
embryo may be used in treatment unless it is created using natural
unmodified gametes and by fertilisation. As the hon. Gentleman says, it
is quite clear how we have approached this subject. I hesitate to say
this but I will: I cannot see how that can be interpreted in any other
way.</div> <a name="0806047000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand why
hon. Members and people outside the House would be wedded to the
wording of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001, as it has served us well. I also
understand their concerns that the Bill will repeal that legislation.
However, it does not just repeal it; it replaces it with much fuller
protection. The Bill prohibits not only the use of cloned human embryos
in treatment, but the use of genetically modified embryos and
genetically modified gametes. It will prevent the use of artificial
gametes and, until regulations permit, it will prohibit the use of
embryos altered to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial
disease.</div><a name="0806047000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would, by reinstating the wording of the Human Reproductive Cloning Act
2001, make no difference to the Bill. As drafted, the Bill clearly bans
reproductive cloning. To put it in simple and direct terms, the
amendment would add nothing to the purpose of the prohibition, nor
would it add to the fact that cloning is an offence and not
allowed.</div><a name="0806047000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000427"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I understand what the Minister says. She was
right to highlight the permitted sperm, the permitted eggs and the
permitted embryo, and the prohibition of cloning because of those
categories. However, what was in the 2001 Act but is not in the Bill is
the offence. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon was correct when he said that the offence is covered by other
legislation. Will the right hon. Lady explain where the offence is
covered, because is not covered by the Bill? It is the main difference
between the 2001 Act and clause
3(6).</div><a name="0806047000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000428"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The offence is covered elsewhere and I referred
to it earlier this morning. Forgive me, I cannot find the reference
now, although, as if by magic, I have now found it. It is section 41 of
the 1990 Act, as amended. The offence is the same, and the penalty is
10 years in prison. If that is the problem that the hon. Gentleman
seeks clarification on, I shall be happy to give him and all members of
the Committee a fuller explanation in a letter to make it absolutely
clear that the offence is the same and the penalty is 10 years in
prison.</div>
<a name="0806047000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000429"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I understand that section 41 appears in the 1990
Act. If that is the case, why did the provision need to be replicated
in the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001? Why is it therefore not set
out in the 2008 Bill when the 2001 Act was preceded by the 1990
Act?</div><a name="0806047000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000430"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> We are becoming a bit techie about how x become
a Bill and how the Bill that we are discussing is an amendment to an
existing Act. I am happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with such
information. The Bill is an amendment to the 1990 Act, which is from
where the references, as amended, come. I fear that I am not helping
him by giving a particularly clear explanation of the interaction
between the 1990 Act and the Bill, so I am happy to write to him. If he
is still troubled, he will have an opportunity to refer to that. I
assure him that the provision is in place.</div>
<a name="0806047000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000431"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response.
I look forward to receiving her correspondence as soon as possible to
clarify the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>matter. It is essential that Parliament sends out a clear message that
reproductive cloning should be prohibited in totality. On that basis, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0806047000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000432"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
said earlier that he wished to raise other matters. I hope that he will
make sure that they are other matters as the clause has been discussed
fairly fully
already.</div><a name="0806047000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="0806047000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="0806047000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000433"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is not my intention to cover the issues we have
just debated. I want to raise the issue of the use of stem cell-derived
gametes or in vitro-derived gametes, also called&#151;I think
misleadingly&#151;artificial gametes in treatment.</div>
<a name="0806047000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be clear that the clause
as drafted precludes, by primary legislation, the use of in
vitro-derived or stem-cell derived gametes in treatment. That has
serious implications which this House needs to debate, and I ask the
Government&#151;and, indeed, the Conservative Front Bench
spokesman&#151;to consider whether there is a good enough reason for
not allowing some form of regulation-making power to deal with the
concerns and enable this research to proceed without the prospect of
being banned in primary legislation and never put into the clinic. Such
a power would improve the potential treatment prospects of thousands of
patients who suffer from
infertility.</div><a name="0806047000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
talking about the prospects of stem cell therapies I am always very
careful not to claim that this will inevitably lead to treatments or,
indeed, that we can expect cures. What I say is that the hope is that
the research will deliver insights into causes, new ways of testing and
new treatments, and might provide for cures. In this case, however, I
think that one can be confident that if the research works, there is
very little left to do other than run a clinical
trial.</div><a name="0806047000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
thousands of patients who suffer from the inability of their gonads to
make gametes, whether sperm or eggs, and new technology offers the
promise that such infertility can be treated by the generation of new
gametes from stem cells&#151;I am talking about adult stem cell
technology. It could be done in other ways, but the leading technology
in animal models is adult stem cell technology, so it is not as
controversial as other measures such as the embryonic stem cell
technologies envisaged elsewhere in the Bill. Nor does it involve the
creation of embryos other than those created for the purpose of
producing children, which is what the 1990 Act was all about. I would
argue that this is less contentious even than the regulation-making
power that we have just discussed, which allows for cytoplasmic
transfer, genetic contributions from three parents and other such
issues which, as the Committee knows, I support, but which, I accept
can be considered
controversial.</div><a name="0806047000218"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000434"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> Just to show that this is not science fiction,
will the hon. Gentleman cite the people doing this kind of work, where
it has got to, and how long it has been going
on?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="0806047000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000435"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am happy to do so, and will come to that in a
moment. This stem cell technology has made progress in animal models,
and in laboratory studies of human cells, in generating gamete
precursor cells from bone marrow cells. Bone marrow cells are taken,
and gamete precursor cells have been shown to be derived both in animal
models and in humans. I am somewhat restricted from going into further
detail because I have not seen a recent publication on the human work,
and I am reluctant to quote only from <i class="I">New Scientist</i>, unpublished
work and the work of researchers.</div>
<a name="0806047000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do know that there are
several leading groups working in this area. In the UK we have
Professor Karim Nyernya, who may be known to members of the Committee.
He has come to this country because of the legislative support that
exists for this sort of research. He has derived sperm from mouse stem
cells and has used it to fertilise mouse eggs, and has previously
derived early-stage sperm cells, I am told, from human bone marrow.
Research in this field is progressing rapidly, and the intention of his
research is to look at the possibility of attempting to restore
fertility in young men who have undergone chemotherapy. The Bill as
drafted effectively places a ban&#151;it would require a whole new
Bill to overturn it&#151;on ever using the product of such research
to actually treat patients, despite it permitting explicitly the use of
gametes that have been grown and matured from gamete stem cells derived
from the testes and ovaries, and despite it containing a
regulation-making power to allow the use of embryos created from eggs
which have been manipulated by cytoplasmic transfer to treat
mitochondrial disease.</div>
<a name="0806047000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000436"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> First, will the hon. Gentleman tell the
Committee how many scientists in this country are currently involved in
such research? Secondly&#151;I suspect that he plans to address this
point&#151;it is theoretically possible to turn an adult skin stem
cell into a gamete: one could turn a male adult skin cell into an egg
or a female adult skin cell into a sperm. It is theoretically possible,
therefore, to produce from stem cells a genetic offspring of one
person. I would feel extremely uncomfortably about going down that
route.
</div><a name="0806047000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000437"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
and shall talk in a moment about how that can be precluded using
primary legislation and the provision of regulation-making powers. If
he is satisfied that it can be so dealt with, I hope that he will
accept that we are in exactly the same position&#151;arguably it is a
better position&#151;as with the mitochondrial disease
regulation-making powers, which might not be as tight as we would
want.</div><a name="0806047000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled a
starred amendment that was not selected, but which was debated in the
other place. It can be seen unselected on the amendment paper today, on
the Order Paper in the Lords and in the House of Lords <i class="I">Hansard.
</i>The amendment would have provided</div>
<a name="0806047000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that&#151;</div><a name="0806047000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
an egg can be a permitted egg,
or</div><a name="0806047000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) a sperm can be a
permitted sperm, even though the egg or sperm has been developed from
one or more human cells in a prescribed process designed to treat
infertility.&#148;</div><a name="0806047000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
reassurance, therefore, is that it would be designed to treat
infertility, and I do not think that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>use of one person to provide both egg and sperm could be described as
treating infertility. Even if the regulation-making power only went
that far, it could not
permit&#151;</div><a name="0806047000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000438"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon.
Gentleman, but I cannot have private conversations taking place in the
Committee Room. Benches are provided outside for that
purpose.</div><a name="0806047000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000439"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Even if the provision only went that far, I do not
see how any Government could make regulations allowing the sort of
thing to which the hon. Gentleman drew attention. Neither do I see how
the HFEA could license such a thing. It licenses the treatment of
infertility and only allows the use of embryos in such treatment when
that is the best way of doing it. The way to treat male infertility is
not through the creation of eggs, but through the creation or donation
of sperm. I do not think that clinicians would want to go through such
a process when the easiest way to treat a man who has his own sperm is
not to give him an egg but to provide an egg donor. Similarly, the
easiest way to treat a woman who has eggs is not to provide sperm, but
to provide a sperm
donor.</div><a name="0806047000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
after the concerns just raised by the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness were raised in the other place by the noble Earl Howe and
others, an amendment was considered there, which specified that the
regulations envisaged &#147;must&#148;&#151;not
&#147;may&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0806047000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide
that any sperm be developed from one or more cells of a genetic male
and any egg be derived from one or more cells of a genetic
female&#148;.</div><a name="0806047000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">That deals with
the problem. In Committee in the other place, the Minister and the
noble Earl Howe specified that in theory it might be possible to create
both an egg and sperm from a male adult stem cell. It is much harder to
see how a sperm could be derived from a female cell, because those do
not have the essential Y chromosome. As I say, the regulation-making
power that I envisage would clearly specify that regulations would
proscribe that.</div><a name="0806047000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Safety
is clearly a concern, as has been mentioned by others, and is catered
for in the proposal that I would like the Committee or the Government
to consider. If the technology works and has matured, it should be up
to Parliament to decide whether it is safe enough for the HFEA to
consider licensing it. If Parliament decides that it is not safe enough
to allow the HFEA to consider licensing something, Parliament would not
draft, confirm or pass the
regulations.</div><a name="0806047000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
application would have to be licensed by the HFEA, which Parliament has
set up to judge the safety of individual applications of reproductive
technology that fall within the law, so there is a second
lock.</div><a name="0806047000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The HFEA is
particularly focused on safety, as is the individual clinician, given
the need to take account of the welfare of any child that may result
from fertility treatment&#151;we have had extensive debates on that
and know how important Parliament considers it to be.</div>
<a name="0806047000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we do not allow even a
regulation-making power, UK researchers such as the one I
mentioned&#151;members of the Committee have received letters and a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>briefing from the head of the research department, Professor Michael
Whitaker, the dean of development of the faculty of medical sciences at
Newcastle university expressing his concern about the failure of the
Bill to consider that&#151;will pursue research projects to develop
treatments for fertility that are illegal under primary legislation,
and that would require another Bill in 10 or, judging by precedent, 20
years. That has consequences for future patients, but how would it be
possible to obtain funding for research and to safeguard the careers of
researchers if research funders know that that research is directed
toward a treatment that is banned by primary legislation? It does not
make sense, given what we said about mitochondrial disease. Can we
claim to be an attractive country to researchers on adult as well as
embryonic stem cells when we close down the possibilities of such
therapies?</div> <a name="0806047000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard
earlier this year of the difficulty that many cancer patients have in
getting fertility treatment, whether that is safeguarding their
fertility through the freezing of sperm, eggs and embryos, which is not
necessarily known to work long term, and accessing such treatment on
the NHS. The technology provides the only chance for patients who have
not had sperm or eggs frozen before their treatment&#151;there are
tens of thousands of such patients&#151;to have their own children,
even before we consider the problem of the shortage of donor gametes.
In response to the failure of the NHS to preserve the fertility of
cancer patients, the Department of Health spokesman said in
December:</div><a name="0806047000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recognise how important it is for cancer patients to be assured that
all possible steps will be taken to preserve their ability to have
children&#148;.</div><a name="0806047000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am suggesting
that there is a solution for those for whom preservation by gamete
storage simply comes too late.</div>
<a name="0806047000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">My proposal has the support of a
number of organisations that represent patients&#151;they want the
clause to be amended. Infertility Network UK supports the proposal,
recognising that the HFEA must ensure safety, effectiveness and ethical
approval, as does Progress Educational
Trust.</div>
<a name="0806047000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Patient organisations are not
the only ones to urge a change to the measure. When the Government
issued their consultation&#151;it is important to recognise that they
did so&#151;they asked whether there should a regulation-making
power. In response, the BMA
said:</div><a name="0806047000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The BMA
agrees that the use of artificial gametes in treatment should be
prohibited for the time being. Aside from safety issues, the ethical
implications of the use in treatment of artificial gametes have yet to
be fully explored. The inclusion of a regulation-making power, however,
would be an appropriate way of &#145;future proofing&#146; the
legislation. In view of the likely sensitivities around this
issue...we hope that these regulations will be required to go
through the affirmative procedure so that there is proper scrutiny by
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="0806047000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The British
Fertility Society, which represents fertility clinicians, would go
further than my proposal. It said:</div>
<a name="0806047000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is the majority view
of the BFS that primary legislation is not necessary to ensure good
clinical practice. The BFS expects that existing clinical governance
regulations and the regulations under the EU Tissues and Cells
directive will mean that there is no
requirement&#148;</div><a name="0806047000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">even</div>
<a name="0806047000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for additional regulation on this
issue&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div><a name="0806047000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that the Bill should provide for that.

pm</div> <a name="0806047000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">When asked,
scientific organisations have expressed support, which is not
surprising because they are all charged with ensuring that it is
possible to translate research into the clinic. In response to the
consultation, the MRC said:</div>
<a name="0806047000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We agree that there
should be inbuilt flexibility to allow the use of artificial gametes if

proposition</div><a name="0806047000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the use
of artificial gametes in assisted reproduction treatment should not be
permitted but that the HFE Act should contain a regulation-making power
giving Parliament more flexibility to allow the use of artificial
gametes in future should it wish to do
so&#148;,</div><a name="0806047000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">the Academy of
Medical Sciences said:</div>
<a name="0806047000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Agreed, but it is
important that research on artificial gametes is
permitted&#148;.</div><a name="0806047000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Norwich, North, will remember, the Royal Society expressed a
view in its evidence to the Science and Technology Committee inquiry
into human reproductive technologies in 2004&#151;nearly four years
ago. It said:</div>
<a name="0806047000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At present, it is too
early to say whether so-called &#145;synthetic&#146; eggs and sperm
obtained by the in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem
cells&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0806047000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">or adult
stem cells&#151;</div><a name="0806047000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
provide an alternative source of functionally normal gametes. Clearly,
further developments in this area need to be followed closely. However,
we do not feel at this time that these recent developments raise any
additional ethical or scientific issues that are not adequately
addressed in the existing
legislation&#148;.</div><a name="0806047000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a situation in which patients want a regulation-making power and
scientists back it, and because the procedure is possible as a result
of adult stem cell research, it is less ethically difficult than many
of the issues that we have debated in the Bill, so on what basis do the
Government want to oppose this proposal? They have said that they are
concerned about the possible eventual derivation of an egg from a
man&#146;s stem cell, and I accept that the concern has been raised
elsewhere, but it can be addressed by specifying that regulations can
prevent such a procedure.</div>
<a name="0806047000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last part of the jigsaw is
whether a regulation-making power that prevents the derivation of sperm
from anything other than male genetic cells and the derivation of eggs
from anything other than female genetic cells raises issues of
discrimination.</div>
<a name="0806047000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000440"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> My hon. Friend read a quote that mentioned gametes
developed from embryonic stem cells. Clearly, there is a difference
between ensuring fertility by making up for what the gonads do not
produce. In the case of gametes from embryonic stem cells, the
paternity or maternity of the child produced would go back to somebody
who was unborn. Does my hon. Friend see a moral difference there? Would
he wish that to be embodied in regulations?</div>
<a name="0806047000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000441"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Clearly, there is a difference. That is why
regulations can make it clear, and the House would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>have the opportunity to say, that only adult stem cell technologies
would be allowed, or that induced pluripotent stem cell technologies
would be allowed if they come to fruition. One could argue that one
could clone an embryo, derive stem cells from it and then derive
gametes from them, and they would be genetically identical because one
was using a cloned embryo of the person whose somatic cell was
used&#151;from the patient who is infertile. However, if that could
be done through adult stem cell technology, the structure of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 would require it to be done
without the derivation of embryos and it would require the HFEA to ask
questions about that. Scientists and clinicians will take the path of
least regulatory and scientific resistance because they want to bring
their research to fruition.</div>
<a name="0806047000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000442"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> Is not the real difficulty in such
research&#151;the hon. Gentleman will know that I am in favour of
research if it will lead to something&#151;that we start with a
diploid cell and end up with a haploid cell? How do we get rid of the
extra chromosomes? How are they selected? What kind of gamete would it
be? It would have only half the chromosomes that are present in the
adult cell, so there will be a big difference in the genetic
material.</div><a name="0806047000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000443"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Given the time, I do not want to go into the
science of
this&#151;</div><a name="0806047000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000444"></a>Mr.
Streeter:</b> Please.</div>
<a name="0806047000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000445"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> All right. I have in my hand a scientific
background briefing paper from the University of Newcastle that
explains exactly how the process would work. The point is that one
derives a gamete precursor, which goes through the usual process of
myosis to produce the immature gamete that would be used. I have to
tell the hon. Member for Norwich, North that the same issue exists to a
certain extent in relation to the clause&#146;s reference to a
permitted egg. As we know from our earlier discussion, a permitted egg
is cells of the female germ line at any stage of maturity. At what
point eggs go through myosis to halve the number of chromosomes is a
contentious issue because they are frozen mid-myosis throughout most of
a woman&#146;s life until ovulation of that particular egg. I do not
really want to go into the matter&#151;I have been drawn into
it.</div><a name="0806047000253"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000446"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> The point is that there are difficulties. It is
not just around the
corner.</div><a name="0806047000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000447"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position
that there are difficulties and it is not just around the corner. Those
difficulties are what the research is dealing with. He says the process
is not just around the corner and I accept that, but the Government
have not made the argument&#151;I do not believe that the
Conservative party have made the argument either&#151;that it is not
necessary because it is 10 or 20 years off.</div>
<a name="0806047000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The judgment of scientists,
including the Hinxton group, which was a set of scientists brought
together to analyse the state of the research through peer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>review&#151;a process that I know the hon. Gentleman respects and
acknowledges&#151;is that they think the process would be ready for
the clinic in five to 10 years. I do not think that we will have
another Bill; I suspect that many of us hope that there will not be
another Bill in that time frame and I do not think that we can expect a
future Government to bring back a Bill.</div>
<a name="0806047000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention, I hope he accepts that it would be
better to have a regulation-making power that provides for the process
if it is needed. If it is not needed, because the research does not
work, we are in exactly the same position as with mitochondrial
donation, where regulations were not brought forward. It is important
to show researchers and funders that we do not have a ban in primary
legislation, especially an irrational one, that is not based on
legitimate concerns because they are dealt with in the
regulations.</div><a name="0806047000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I just
want to explain where we are with the issue of discrimination. When it
was raised by Lord Patel in the House of Lords on Report on 15 January
2008, with the provision that regulations must provide, for example,
that sperm are developed from genetic male cells, this was welcomed by
Baroness Jay and also welcomed by Earl Howe, who said</div>
<a name="0806047000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The noble Lord, Lord
Patel, has made a powerful case and I support
him.&#148;</div><a name="0806047000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was because the
concern he had raised in Committee had been addressed. Baroness Royall,
the Minister, said in response to the specific
amendment:</div><a name="0806047000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I realise that
the scope of this amendment is not as wide as the one moved in
Committee&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0806047000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">including
the provision that sperm is only from male cells and eggs from female
cells&#151;</div><a name="0806047000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and that
many concerns have been removed.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 15 January 2008; Vol. 697, c.
1200-01.]</div><a name="0806047000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
she raised an important point about whether there is a problem with
discrimination law, which is what I want the Government to address in
their reply, because her concern was that it would be discriminatory
not to allow same-sex couples to use the technology to create children
using their combined genetic material, and whether it would be
proportionate to prevent them from benefiting from the treatment in the
future.</div> <a name="0806047000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
the Minister to set out whether that is her view&#151;that is, the
legal advice she has had. I think it is highly arguable that there
would not be a legitimate purpose in that indirect discrimination, but
it would be entirely proportionate to insist that infertile or same-sex
couples treat their infertility through gamete donation&#151;that is
the option available to them; it is not closed down. It is thus
entirely proportionate to say that the process should be providing for
specific male germ cells from male cells and that it is not, in fact,
discriminatory. I question whether that is the case and I have seen no
information about the matter from the
Government.</div><a name="0806047000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s position has evolved and I would like them in their
response to explain the basis for their evolving position. I have
already set out the question raised in the 2005 consultation,
that</div><a name="0806047000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Government proposes that the use of artificial gametes in assisted
reproduction treatment should not be permitted but that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>the HFE Act should contain a regulation making power giving Parliament
more flexibility to allow the use of artificial gametes in future
should it wish to do
so.&#148;.</div><a name="0806047000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000448"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Is my hon. Friend arguing that legislation or
regulations should allow for us to address cases where there is
infertility or does he think that they should be allowed in cases where
people are not biologically infertile but may not wish to go through
the normal processes that human beings go through for
reproduction?</div>
<a name="0806047000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000449"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have been listening carefully to the
argument of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and it seems
to me that 98 per cent. of what he has said so far is covered by clause
3(2). He is now beginning to move into entirely different
areas.</div><a name="0806047000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000450"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I shall just clarify matters, for the assistance
of the Committee. The proposal is that there could be a
regulation-making power to allow the definition of the term
&#147;permitted eggs&#148; to be wider than is provided for in
subsections (2) and (5). The latter defines permitted sperm as only
those that</div> <a name="0806047000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have been
produced by or extracted from the testes of a man&#148;.</div>
<a name="0806047000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to argue in this stand part debate
that that is not a wide enough definition to look after the interests
of scientists working in the field of stem cell-derived gametes, or of
patients who could benefit from a wider definition.</div>
<a name="0806047000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the last part of my speech I
am trying to deal with the point that was raised in another
place&#151;this has been the only opportunity to do so: that is the
argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Southport about whether the
provision would allow same-sex couples to reproduce using their own
gametes. I say no, because the amendment proposed on Report and Third
Reading in the House of Lords clearly said that regulations must
provide that sperm could come only from male cells, and eggs could come
only from female cells. Something else that was discussed in the House
of Lords, which I urge the Committee to consider, is the fact that the
intention is to treat infertility, and the HFEA would regulate
that.</div> <a name="0806047000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Government explain the basis on which, in the White Paper, they changed
their view on the provision? The White Paper
stated:</div><a name="0806047000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government has considered whether such a ban on the use of artificial
gametes should be capable of being removed through secondary
legislation ...This would provide a ready mechanism to alter the law if
safety concerns were allayed in future. The Government has decided, on
balance, not to recommend such a power, proposing instead that this
would be a matter requiring primary
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="0806047000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the Government did that on the basis of a response to the consultation
from people who opposed all the other things, such as hybrid embryos,
that the Government have decided to stick with, and mitochondrial
transplantation. I urge the Minister, even if her reply is not a
positive one, to set out her advice on whether a regulation-making
power such as I have described would be discriminatory against same-sex
couples.</div> <a name="0806047000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
president of the Liberal Democrat campaign for lesbian and gay equality
and I serve on the Joint Committee on Human Rights and have discussed
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>issue with several human rights specialists. They cannot see how a
regulation-making power to prohibit the derivation of an egg from a
male cell or a sperm from a female cell could possibly be
discriminatory under the Human Rights Act 1989. I urge the Minister to
consider that carefully, and I also urge the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness to consider it, because I know that he wants to support
researchers such as those at Newcastle, and does not want unreasonably
to close down the potential for therapies for infertile
people.</div><a name="0806047000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806047000451"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The Bill introduces the concept of permitted
gametes and embryos. That is to distinguish between those that are
created and used in the course of research and those that are created
and used in the course of someone&#146;s treatment. Although it is
possible to create embryos and gametes in several ways, some of which
are necessary and desirable for research purposes, only those embryos
that are created by fertilisation and those gametes that are produced
by and extracted from testes and ovaries are allowed to be used in
treatment. The Bill defines those as &#147;permitted&#148;. That is
crucial, both in the 1990 Act and in the amendments to it in the Bill.
It raises enough issues in itself.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="0806047000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
major challenges that we as parliamentarians encounter in Committee and
that we encountered in all the pre-scrutiny consideration of the Bill
and on the Floor of the House is to study the scientific evidence and
try to work our way through the possibilities&#151;where the
scientific development will take us and thus how we should legislate.
Sometimes it is not possible for us to answer all the questions, and in
those circumstances and at that point in time we back away.</div>
<a name="0806047000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is currently research into
in vitro maturation and in vitro growth of gametes. That involves
taking immature eggs or sperm and maturing them in vitro. That would
allow eggs to be matured from ovarian
tissue.</div><a name="0806047000274"></a>
