<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairmen and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that we may reach during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following Order, namely: Clauses 1 and 2, Schedule 1, Clause 3, New Clauses, New Schedules, Clause 4, Schedules 2 and 3, Clause 5.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This order of consideration will be for the convenience of the Committee and is the logical order in which to consider the Bill. Clauses 1 and 2 and schedule 1 comprise the meat of the Bill. Clause 1 specifies the general purposes for which regulations may be made under clause 2. Clause 2 confers regulation-making powers on the Secretary of State and sets out how regulations should be made. Schedule 1 is a detailed and exclusive list of the purposes for which regulations may be made. I hope that members of the Committee will agree that it is, therefore, logical to consider those three provisions in the suggested sequence.
<P>
It is appropriate to consider any new clauses after clause 3, rather than after having debated all the clauses, because clauses 4 and 5 deal simply with technicalities such as consequential amendments, repeals and commencement. It is, therefore, sensible that we consider any further substantive provisions that may be tabled before we consider the Bill's consequences for other enactments and its commencement. I hope that that is agreeable and finds favour with the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Ainger </B>(West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. There ia a very noisy intrusion to my left. I wonder whether anything can be done about it so that we can hear what is going on in the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the officials have noted what the hon. Gentleman has said.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>General purpose and definitions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, leave out `any' and insert `significant'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 2, in page 1, line 12, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b) above, ``significant'' means that which the Secretary of State may by order decide.
<P>
 (1B) No order shall be made under subsection (1A) above unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 3, in page 1, line 20, leave out `any' and insert `significant'.
<P>
No. 4, in page 1, line 25, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2) above, ``significant'' means that which the Secretary of State may by order decide.
<P>
 `(2B) No order shall be made under subsection (2A) above unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I will try to speak over the ambient environmental noise pollution at the other end of the Room. I have come late to the Committee and I should say how delighted I am that you are in the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. You will remember&#151;possibly even less fondly than me&#151;that the last time I was on a Committee that you chaired we considered the now legendary Minimum Wage Bill. Some of our sittings went on all night and, indeed, one went on for 25 hours. I am happy to reassure you and the Committee that Conservative Members see no necessity for this Bill to take up a similar amount of time. I am sure that both sides of the Committee will welcome that.
<P>
Similarly, I want to make it clear at the outset that Conservative Members accept the principle that, to some extent, existing laws on pollution prevention and control could do with tidying up. Similarly, we accept that it is sensible to do that in a way that implements the relevant European directive, because this is one area in which cross-border co-operation and rules are essential.
<P>
The aim of the amendments is to rein back the Secretary of State's powers and, in a wider sense, to defend Parliament's right to make laws and control the Executive. The Minister will be aware of the history of the Bill's progress through another place. Because of energetic representations by many of their lordships, the Bill progressed from an atrocious first draft, to a fairly bad version, to what we have before us today. It is still unacceptable in many of its details, but at least it is in a state in which it can be improved by relatively modest amendments of the type that we have tabled. Although Conservative Members accept the Bill's underlying principles, we do not want the importance of those principles to mean that we casually toss away some of our parliamentary privileges and give too much power to the Executive, in the shape of the Secretary of State. We want balance, fairness and a clear system of regulation. While I am aware that the Minister has good intentions, our amendments would make the Bill more practical and less anti-democratic.
<P>
When the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation reported to the other place, it made one of its most far-reaching and hard attacks on a Government Bill. It said that the Bill, as it was then drafted, was a ``skeleton'' Bill and therefore completely inappropriate for the delegation of secondary powers. Those strong words were used because the Bill is essentially about delegating secondary powers in important areas of regulation. That demonstrates the state that the Bill was in in its early form. Progress was made in the other place and I am glad that the Government retreated in certain areas. The amendments would encourage the Government further down that path of virtue.
<P>
During the debate in the other place, Lord Dixon-Smith quoted from the Select Committee's report, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the House shares our concern''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Committee shares it&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it will no doubt wish to consider whether the Bill can be saved by amendments which specify with more precision the ambit of the legislation and the criteria to be taken into account in making regulations.''&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 15 February 1999; Vol 597, c. 466]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That lies at the heart of the amendments. They would restrict the ambit of the Secretary of State by making the Bill's language more precise and less all embracing.
<P>
It would be churlish not to welcome the Government's retreat so far, and I do so, but more is needed. Clause 1 would be radically improved if the Government accepted the amendments, which would limit the scope of the wording of the Bill. Clause 1(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``activities which are capable of causing any environmental pollution.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``Any environmental pollution'' is an absurdly wide definition. Almost any human activity can cause environmental pollution&#151;for example, breathing out. Many entirely innocent&#151;indeed, necessary&#151;industrial and personal activities can cause environmental pollution. Surely the Government cannot intend that those activities should be regulated by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that some chemicals that occur naturally in the atmosphere, such as radon and naturally occurring dioxin, are regarded as pollutants?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend&#151;she makes a valid point. Not only industrial processes and simple personal activities but substances that occur naturally in the environment could be regarded as polluting. I know that some Ministers want to take upon themselves responsibilities that are perhaps beyond their ken, but for any Secretary of State to attempt to regulate the natural world in such detail would be both hubristic and futile.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister does not wish to go as far down that route as the Bill currently does. That is why we have proposed inserting the word ``significant'', so that there can be an injection of common sense into the debate and so that the regulations, when they are eventually put in place, will not be overbearing.
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister, could give some reassurances that the use of the Bill will not be overbearing and all embracing. I am aware that, at various stages of the Bill's progress through the House of Lords, the Government promised various consultation documents and increased consultation with the wide range of interest groups that will be involved in the practical application of the new regulations. Consultation documents issued at this stage are not enough. He will be aware that many businesses, especially small businesses, are genuinely fearful of the long-term effects of the regulations, even though they accept the principle and much of the thinking behind them. They would wish for some reassurances.
<P>
The amendments are intended as a means of avoiding the age-old problem of gold-plating. We all know the background&#151;directives are often written in an aspirational way and conscientious British officials are trained and encouraged to attempt to cover all bases. Occasionally, they do so by producing regulations that are not practical. I am afraid that that is what has happened in this case.
<P>
I would not go as far as some of my right hon. and noble Friends in assuming that Ministers had somehow been conned by their officials' telling them that putting regulations into secondary legislation and not putting anything into the Bill would be much easier. I have greater respect for the intellectual calibre of the ministerial team than to think that and I know that they would not be conned by such an approach. I also have greater respect for the officials at the Department&#151;they would not have suggested that. Nevertheless, the effect is much as if they had done. The powers that the Minister seeks would represent a gold-plating of the existing directive.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Teresa Gorman </B>(Billericay): Before my hon. Friend leaves that point, does he also accept that the people in industry who are often alleged to be at the production end of pollutants have an equal respect for their clients and customers? They have no wish to poison them in any way. Behind much of the Bill is the thought that the activities of industry and ordinary people have somehow to be curbed. Is it not true that, in this country, we already have extensive health and safety legislation and regulation and a high standard of control of substances likely to have an impact on human health? A clause that will allow officials an almost totally free hand to decide what is harmful is a ludicrous overstatement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend has a valid point. To deal with small businesses first, I note that they are often run by people in the same communities in which they live. They will therefore be unlikely to want to cause long-term environmental damage to that community. They are aware that they must observe regulations. As we know, many small businesses regard themselves&#151;rightly&#151;as being over-regulated. It is incumbent on the Government&#151;and it fits in with rhetoric coming from the Department of Trade and Industry about cutting red tape&#151;not to introduce new regulations that cause unnecessary damage to perfectly innocent small, or indeed, large businesses. My hon. Friend made a powerful point about that.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other issue that the clause covers, perhaps more covertly, and with which this group of amendments deals, is the debate about best available technology not entailing excessive costs&#151;BATNEEC&#151;versus best available techniques, or BAT. I know that many Labour Members are concerned about that. Behind the jargon lie a real difficulty and genuine fears on the part of many businesses. Since the Environmental Protection Act 1990, they have observed the BATNEEC principle, which has served well, partly because it is balanced. Businesses are encouraged to fight pollution with the best available technology, but the essential second part is that that should not entail excessive cost. The application of the directive via the Bill allows the continental version&#151;best available technology&#151;to be introduced. That is a profound change in the law.
<P>
I was fascinated by a discussion yesterday in a Room on this Corridor with the Minister's colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, about how the Government regard the difference between the two concepts. He said that there was no practical difference between them. However, after researching this group of amendments, I am rather disturbed by that response.
<P>
While it is true that the definition of best available techniques in the directive contains a reference to cost, it is nothing like as clear cut as the British principle of not entailing excessive cost, which has served us over the past decade. Moreover, that reference is included only in an annexe, so it is clearly not a central part of the thinking behind the measure. The annexe merely states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Considerations to be taken into account generally or in specific cases when determining best available techniques, as defined in Article 2(11), bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and the principles of precaution and prevention''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that is a much weaker formulation than the simple ``not entailing excessive costs''. Businesses genuinely fear that by slipping from one to the other, as the Government are with this clause, and by not including such a stipulation in the Bill, we may be introducing a new concept into our pollution control law that will be damaging to business. Replacing the word ``any'' with ``significant'' would deal with that problem simply and practically.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will discuss what he understands to be the difference between BATNEEC and BAT. I hope that my worries about it are a result of me being new to the subject and that there is indeed no difference. From my reading of the provisions, however, there appears to be a genuine difference. I should be grateful if the Minister would set my mind at rest on that.
<P>
So far I have dealt with amendments Nos. 1 and 3. Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 would enable parliamentary control over the process to be maintained, which is an issue that was at the heart of much of the debate on the Bill in another place, and rightly so. The Minister will recognise the importance of that, not merely in theory but in practice. The theory is clear: if the Executive try to arrogate power to themselves, the central purpose of this place is to ensure that that is done with some control from the legislature. The problem is that, as originally drafted, the Bill went much too far in favour of the Executive. We are simply trying to insert Parliament into the process at every stage. That is theoretically right. I am sure that the Minister will agree, as he will have the interests of Parliament at heart and will not want to appear to be part of an Executive who are riding roughshod over Parliament. However, there will also be an effect in the real world outside this place.
<P>
The Minister will know that forcing businesses to operate under conditions of great uncertainty in the legislative framework will not contribute to best environmental practice. The more worried industry and businesses are that some sort of arbitrary new regulation will be put on them, the more likely they are to be tempted to cut corners. Jokes tend to emerge in this rarefied world, and a parody of BATNEEC has appeared, called CATNIP&#151;the cheapest available technology not involving prosecution. Neither the Minister nor I would wish firms, whether big or small, to think that working out what they can get away with is a sensible way of proceeding. If that happens, the good intentions behind the directive&#151;clearing up and making tidier our system of pollution control&#151;will have failed. I submit that the more parliamentary control there is over every single regulation that will emerge as a result of the Bill, the more confident business can be that it will not have unacceptable, unworkable and impractical regulations dumped on it from a great height. In the long run, working in that way will not only be in the interests of parliamentary control of the Executive, but will encourage in businesses the frame of mind whereby they are willing to accept positively environmental regulation and welcome it as an essential part of their progress, rather than thinking of it as just one more onerous burden.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gorman:</B> I draw my hon. Friends and the Committee's attention to the fact that if regulations become over-intrusive, they can counteract the very purpose of the Bill.
<P>
The Conservative Government introduced the landfill tax, for example&#151;although the clause does not deal with that specifically&#151;with a view to trying to make landfill more environmentally friendly by creating a fund that could be used for environmental purposes. However, it has led to a massive increase in fly dumping. My hon. Friend mentioned CATNIP&#151;in fact, the National Farmers Union has produced evidence of 60,000 instances of fly dumping in the countryside. That is what happens if we over-regulate, even with the best will in the world. I do not yet know of examples involving the type of pollutants that we are discussing, but I think that they will turn up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Like her, I have had that example brought to my attention by farmers in my constituency who are the victims of fly dumping. Like my hon. Friend, they argue that it is the result of over-regulation.
<P>
Clearly, the Minister should aim for a balance. We all want regulations that protect the environment, but if industry feels that they are in some way illegitimate, people at the fringes will be more likely to get around them. Amendment Nos. 2 and 4 are designed to introduce a level of parliamentary protection against that situation.
<P>
The basic question relates to the legitimacy of the regulations. Many noble Lords in the other place said that they feared that the Bill would result in Executive government by Executive decree. Some of them, with the great sense of history that occurs naturally in the other place, started talking about the Stuarts. They said that we had a period of government of the type that I described under Charles I. I want to absolve the Minister from any suggestion that he has Stuart tendencies, as some people think. Everything that I know about the right hon. Gentleman and his history suggests that that would be a vile slur on his reputation. Some Conservative Members wold not regard it as a slur, but I know that he would. We therefore seek&#151;particularly in this group of amendments&#151;to relieve the Minister of the burden of being accused of trying to implement measures through an Executive who are overreaching themselves. The Government have gone in the direction that we would like to an extent, and in this group of amendments we are encouraging them to go further. I hope that the Minister can accept that changing the wording would make the clause more practical and reassure business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has considered that significant problems might arise as a result of trying to define ``significant''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Clearly, there will be problems. That is why, in an attempt to be helpful, we have left it to the Minister to define ``significant''. Frankly, I would rather have a Secretary of State define ``significant'' and, if necessary, defend his definition in Parliament, the courts or elsewhere than have him define ``any''. Whatever the problems of defining ``significant'', more problems will arise from giving the Secretary of State the power to designate not only anything that causes environmental pollution but anything&#151;I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) to the wording of the clause&#151;that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``capable of causing any environmental pollution''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Everything that we do 24 hours a day is capable of causing environmental pollution. There can seldom have been a Bill that gave a Secretary of State more power to control the minutiae of people's lives than this Bill, and that did so by regulation. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that there will be problems, but we will store up more if the Bill is left in its original form.
<P>
I accept the Minister's good faith in this matter. I am sure that he would not want to be seen to represent an overbearing Executive. With that in mind, I hope that the Government will accept the amendments.

<P>

<B>Ms Joan Walley </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, North): May I say how much I welcome the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship on this most important Committee, Mr. Atkinson? I do not intend to speak at great length, but I want to make a brief point about the amendment and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so.
<P>
On the amendments, which the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green), who leads for the Opposition, has tabled, I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment to take on board my concerns. We should not take up the suggestion of referring to ``significant harm'' and ``significant environmental pollution''. I am pleased with what we have in the Bill.
<P>
I ask my right hon. Friend for clarification on one issue, which arises from the way in which the Bill, quite rightly, streamlines existing regulations for fear of double regulation. I refer to a situation that could arise if we are not clear what we mean by harm that arises from significant environmental pollution. At present, some processes are regulated under the local authority part of the authorisations. There is a blurred area in the new provisions regarding authorisation through the Environment Agency under schedule 1. Where harm arises from new responsibilities in respect of noise pollution, it may be that the particular part of the harm did not arise from the actual process, but was part of the problems that residents in nearby localities were experiencing. I should like to ensure that there will not be any continuing problems because local authorities no longer have responsibilities for dealing with aspects of harm that might otherwise have accrued.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I appreciate that this is a complex and detailed area. However, I should like my right hon. Friend the Minister to confirm that if the levels of harm are dealt with under the new procedures that the Bill introduces, there will be a catch-all provision that covers residents who are experiencing problems, which they would normally expect their local authorities to regulate. I will be happy to give my right hon. Friend more information on specific points in the course of proceedings, but my central concern is about the problems of significant environmental pollution and the way in which we subsequently define ``harm''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady (Altrincham and Sale, West):</B> I apologise to you, Mr. Atkinson, and to the Minister for having missed his opening remarks. Ironically, that was the result of a possibly misguided attempt at pollution prevention and control in respect of the new bus lane on the M4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): Did the hon. Gentleman come in on the bus?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> No, sadly I did not. Had I been on the bus, I would not have been delayed. However, I was in the unfortunate position of having to resort to private transport, having left the House fairly late last night. Usually I use public transport, but today I was sitting with many other motorists in the two remaining lanes that are allowed for private motorists. Ironically, a measure that is intended to reduce pollution, encourage public transport use and reduce dependence on the private motor care tends to cause long queues of stationary traffic pumping out additional pollution.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford referred to definitions of best available techniques and other terms of art that are currently used in the environmental world. The question arises of what is the best available technique and what is the best reasonable technique. As my hon. Friend suggested, in different circumstances, for different businesses, different levels of regulation and endeavour to improve environmental performance could be deemed reasonable. As with all other aspects of Government regulation that touch on business, we have a duty to consider the effect that the regulations may have on the small business sector. Specifically, we should consider not only whether a new regulation may be reasonable to the man on the Clapham omnibus&#151;or the omnibus on the M4&#151;but whether it is reasonable for people who are running businesses at the margins of profitability, for whom any new regulation could create an unreasonable and unsustainable burden.
<P>
The Government are engaged in a process of regulation&#151;some regulations stem from European Union directives and some from their ambitions to raise minimum employment rights. One of the great dangers posed by the Government to themselves and, more significantly from my perspective, to the business community&#151;especially the small business community&#151;stems from their failure to understand that that is an aggregate process. I would like to impress upon them that, even when considering what may seem an eminently reasonable clause and Bill, which will allow the Secretary of State to set out orders in line with the EU directive before us, they must have regard for the enormous burden of additional regulation and cost already placed on business in this country. That burden weighs especially heavily on the small business sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Harry Barnes </B>(North-East Derbyshire): Has the hon. Gentleman thought of the benefits that could come to small businesses in specific instances? I have a problem in the Killamarsh area, which is under tremendous pressure. A large plant called Sarp is engaged in pollution. In that area, a host of small businesses have problems because of the activities of their neighbour. Action that can be taken to control those activities will be of considerable benefit to the operation of those businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a valid point. In certain circumstances, regulations and changes of attitude and approach may improve the situation for small businesses. In many instances, they may even create commercial opportunities for them. A lively business sector is engaged in tackling environmental pollution and problems. The hon. Gentleman has a valid point, but it does not detract from the overall thrust of my argument&#151;as the aggregate level of regulation and control is increased, the cost burden on business is increased. More often than not, that cost burden weighs more heavily on small businesses, especially on micro-businesses and those starting up, which will be the medium and large businesses of the future.
<P>
A serious concern for policy makers, which the Government should take seriously, is that that aggregate burden is progressively increasing the costs on small, medium and large businesses. As the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) suggested, in isolated instances there might be an argument for regulation because of the undoubted benefits in controlling pollution or for other reasons. In some circumstances, benefits may be brought to small businesses. However, the aggregate effect across the economy will be damaging.
<P>
I do not say for a moment that the Government should say that because regulation is damaging business there should be no regulation. The Minister should not say that the only way for the economy to continue to thrive is to allow businesses to pollute at will without considering the cost or what measures of mitigation may be taken. That would be wrong. It is appropriate to consider the powerful case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, which is embodied in the amendments, that the onus should be on the Government to demonstrate that there is a need for regulation. In relation to amendments Nos. 1 and 9 especially, the question of the definition of significant harm is appropriate.
<P>
We can all conceive of circumstances in which almost any commercial activity, however legitimate or appropriate, may give rise to a danger of some environmental damage. The Government's publishing of regulations, which gives rise to the emanation of a vast tonnage of paper from Westminster and Whitehall, in itself causes environmental harm and, possibly, significant pollution. The rate at which the Government are regulating business makes them one of the fastest growing sources of pollution in the United Kingdom.
<P>
Under such circumstances, for Ministers to seek to take power to respond to any activity&#151;the Bill will, in effect, give such an open-ended power&#151;is wrong. Such power endangers government and the wise regulation over which I know the Minister wants to preside. If he has the wisdom, as I believe he will, to accept that greater constraint on the regulation-making powers is appropriate, and good discipline for Ministers, not only hon. Members on&#151;I hope&#151;both sides of the Committee, but the business community will breathe a sigh of relief. Such acceptance would mark an explicit recognition not only that open-ended powers are generally wrong, but that the Government must find a balance between the desirable outcomes that they are undoubtedly pursuing through the legislation, and the cost that arises from such regulatory activity. In this context, additional restraint on the powers of the Executive is especially important. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford so wisely said, Parliament should have an opportunity to approve regulations.
<P>
As Members of Parliament, we receive representations from local businesses on concerns about other pieces of&#151;supposed&#151;environmental legislation. I am thinking in particular about the climate change levy. I shall not, of course, go into detail about that; it is a different piece of legislation, although it illustrates the point about necessary democratic control.
<P>
I do not doubt for a moment that Ministers have a laudable objective in moving down this route, but I am concerned about open-ended powers which, if implemented, will create an inevitable tendency to regulate&#151;whether due to Ministers' legislative or regulatory agenda in the United Kingdom, or proposals originating in Brussels. Whatever the initial perceived need for the regulation of business to achieve these ends, it will not stop, whether at one, 10 or 50 regulations. It will be the beginning of a process which, as it continues, will move further and further away from not only the Government's claimed democratic mandate but the democratic process in this Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): I understand the hon. Gentleman's reasonable point about not burdening people too much, but to give a flavour of the day-to-day practical conditions that he thinks might provide the right balance, will he say what sort of pollution businesses, particularly the small businesses about which he is concerned, should be able to get away with? Our concern, which is shared by his hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, is that using the word ``significant'' instead of ``any'' will result in some pollution; what pollution is acceptable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, although his intervention probably related more to my remarks on amendments Nos. 1 and 9 than to amendments Nos. 3 and 10, to which I was speaking when he intervened. He makes a reasonable point, and I am grateful that he accepts the reasonableness of my case. Not only did he answer his own question, the amendments answer it: the level of pollution that is intolerable is a significant level.
<P>
When we legislate, we are of course not going to set out every minute detail of the regulations that Ministers may or may not be permitted to introduce; nor are we in a position to do so. What we can do&#151;and what we are here to do today&#151;is set a framework and parameters within which Ministers may operate. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington suggested in an earlier intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, there are inevitable difficulties of definition in any legal document or piece of legislation. As my hon. Friend said, introducing a statute that gives powers to regulate in connection with any pollution gives rise to exactly the same difficulties of definition as would a statute that referred to significant levels of pollution.
<P>
No reasonable person would ever imagine that the use of the word ``any'' in the context of pollution would mean that, if a single sound was heard by someone not directly engaged in the business in question, there had been pollution. Nevertheless, on a strict dictionary definition, that scenario would clearly fall within the position that I presume the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) seeks to defend. To replace ``any'' with ``significant'' shifts the parameters of both the debate and the powers that the Minister and his colleagues&#151;and his successors&#151;may be able to use. It does so inappropriately and, indeed, unnecessarily.
<P>
Those of our constituents who are engaged in business and in trying, with varying degrees of success, to earn a living have a right to expect that when we legislate, we do not prejudice their livelihoods without a real need to do so. If the Committee waves through clause 1 as it stands, Ministers will have the most sweeping powers to make regulations where there is any pollution. That does not really take account of the needs involved in regulating environmental pollution and malpractice. It provides for unintended and unnessary conflict. It makes it more likely&#151;perhaps inevitable&#151;that less reasonable Ministers than the Minister for the Environment will in future seek to regulate the minimal level of pollution that is inevitable in the pursuance of any commercial activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the definition of pollution in the Bill refers to that which does harm? The single noise to which he referred would not necessarily be regarded as harmful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> the hon. Gentleman makes a most helpful point. He leads us to a further point of definition, which I had not intended to raise. What is ``harm?'' I have the privilege of representing a constituency that is adjacent to the estate of Manchester airport and it doubtless gains considerable benefit from the presence of the airport. However, I have a constant dialogue with constituents who contend that they suffer harm. I shall not burden the hon. Gentleman with the geography of my constituency. Although it is close to a major airport, it has until recently suffered no nuisance as a result of aircraft overflying it. The definition of what constitutes harm will be very different for my constituents compared with people who live on one of the flight paths in the immediate vicinity of Heathrow airport in Hounslow, Putney or Twickenham.
<P>
That highlights the danger in the Bill to which the hon. Member for Bedford draws the Committee's attention. A person who is used to a certain level of harm or nuisance may find the claim of someone who lives in different circumstances and who suffers a lesser nuisance frivolous&#151;it may seem to him that that person suffers no harm at all. A constituent of mine who lives in Bowdon, where people are not used to aircraft noise, might suddenly find that he can hear aircraft coming over once or twice a week when he is in his garden. He might feel very real harm. He believed that he had a right to expect an environment without noise pollution or other environmental pollution from aircraft. When he encounters some relatively low level of nuisance, he feels that he has suffered harm&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying into territory that is covered by amendments Nos. 9 and 10. I remind the Committee that we are talking about the term ``significant''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am most grateful, Mr. Atkinson. I was merely trying to respond to the entirely sensible question that was put to me. [Interruption.] I shall ignore the mutterings of the Government Whip.
<P>
I had dealt with significant pollution and sought to move on to the parliamentary approval of regulation, which is covered by amendments Nos. 3 and 10 and to which I shall seek to return briefly.
<P>
Hon. Members who have regular contact with and a duty to serve and represent interests in their constituencies&#151;in this instance, I refer to businesses, whose livelihoods may be endangered by proposed regulations&#151;provide the democratic check on Ministers' powers that is necessary to ensure discipline in regulatory powers. It is to the benefit of Ministers, in terms of the discipline on them and of the contraints on parliamentary time, that it should be relatively difficult to propose new regulations, which can have a negative impact on business, cost jobs, deprive people of their livelihoods and have unintended consequences that cause damage equal to or greater than the good that regulations seek to achieve. For that reason, I very much hope that the Minister will acknowledge that there is value in regulations being the subject of parliamentary approval, as the amendments suggest.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gorman:</B> The two little words in the amendment go to the heart of the differences that the Bill will introduce unless it is amended.
<P>
We are debating the additional powers that the Bill will give Ministers. The current position&#151;the best available technology not entailing excessive cost&#151;would be protected by changing ``any'' harm to ``significant'' harm. If a proposal entails excessive cost it might put a company and those whose livelihoods depend on it out of business. We are not being pedantic in the amendment, the aim of which will be extremely significant in the practical application of the Bill.
<P>
We already have good and adequate environmental legislation&#151;the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Despite the example cited by the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire, there have been few examples of the legislation proving inadequate to deal with pollutants in the soil, water, and air. Regulations are implemented daily. Our standards, especially in agriculture, have risen and are now far better than those in continental competitor countries.
<P>
The Bill implements a European directive. I have asked Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament many times about the significance of directives. I have been told categorically and on time without number that the directives are meant to be advisory or to represent best practice and that they do not have to be implemented formally, which we seek to do. As a result, other parts of the European Union, with which we are in competition, take directives on board as advice. Will the Minister give us his views on that? We burden our industries with excessive regulation that is not required of our European competitors. That is often reflected in complaints from the farming industry, especially about the way in which our animals are looked after and the use of certain pesticides. We have a good record, but that little word seeks to burden business with a new and excessive level of regulation.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although we cannot quote the numbers of businesses that disappear from the scene every time we over-regulate, or the numbers of people who lose their jobs, we know that those things happen. It is part of the Government's duty to protect those businesses. It is no good our complaining of job losses and the need to find work for people when we are making it increasingly difficult for people to retain their businesses. Politicians sometimes take the attitude that the business world is trying to cause heedless damage to its employees and customers, or allowing damage to occur. That is ludicrous. When danger and damage are pointed out to businesses, they have a vested interest in countering it. Fly-by-night operators and sharks will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) said, try to find a way round it, and it is part of the duty of Government to try to prevent that. Whenever unnecessary powers and regulations are introduced it contributes to the problem.
<P>
I urge the Minister, in considering this change of wording, to treat it not as a bit of nitpicking or pedantry, but an attempt to modify the over-regulatory attitude that pervades the entire Bill, removing the ``not entailing excessive cost'' aspect of the best available techniques and giving the Secretary of State tremendous powers to decide on issues that were formerly mitigated by reasonable behaviour and common sense. One can envisage a group of environmental officers sitting round their table in the morning discussing an issue in some small business&#151;which may be struggling to keep going&#151;and trying to decide whether a complaint, or something that they have discovered in their inspection of the factory, is doing any harm to anybody, anything or any part of the environment. One can imagine them going on through the night argy-bargying about it. In the end, the easiest thing for them to say will be, ``Well, of course, there is some harm with everything that we do, so scrub it out: go down there, tell him he has got to stop doing it, and that will be the end of it.''
<P>
The inhumanity of that is not reflected in Government statistics of how many businesses have gone down the pan. Indeed, we do not usually hear those statistics: we always get the good news about jobs being created. Every single day, small firms reach the end of their tether. Having been pushed that extra mile, inch, yard or foot, they are gone. Perhaps most Members of Parliament do not worry much about that, but those of us who have come up through the business world into politics know that there is a point at which a firm will say, ``I am packing up. I will have to go somewhere else to carry out my business in an environment that is less condemnatory.'' In that context and in that spirit, I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brake:</B> The hon. Lady said earlier that in her view directives were best practice. However, the bringing-into-effect section of the directive that we are discussing clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Member States shall adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears to contradict what the hon. Lady said.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gorman:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman made that point, because it has jogged my memory. I have asked people in the administrative bodies of the European Union about this and they have told me that the terms on which a directive should be adopted depend on how the wording of the legislation is translated into different European languages. That is well worth considering. Our interpretation, or even translation, of the wording of an original directive may lead us to believe that it is obligatory and arbitrary and that we must carry it out to the letter of our translation of its wording. That is the explanation that has been given to me on more than one occasion by those whom I have consulted and I ask the Minister to take that on board when he gives us his views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Given the fears that have been expressed by some members of the Committee, I am pleased that it is possible to solve noise pollution problems without the integrated pollution prevention and control directive, simply by reference to more commonsensical ways of dealing with excessive noise in the Room.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Ashford on his promotion to the environment portfolio. He will unquestionably find it extremely interesting and stimulating, and I am sure that he will do well at it. He will certainly have a great deal of time to do so. I also congratulate him on the speed with which he has got himself briefed. It is a complicated and technical subject and he has made a good start. I look forward to having some sensible debates with him.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman accepts the Bill's general principles and the need for proper environmental regulation, although we may differ in a moment about exactly how that is done. Having said that, I do not believe that he has the wholehearted support of hon. Members sitting behind him. It is always entertaining to hear the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) giving us her novel interpretations, whether of the science of climate change or the nature of European directives. I assure her that there is no question but that European directives are legally binding. We have been in the European Union for 26 years and I am astonished that that point has apparently not yet been fully accepted. Member states are, of course, legally obliged to implement directives and can be prosecuted and fined as a result of infraction proceedings in the European Court of Justice if they do not do so. All member states have suffered that indignity and its consequences, including this country&#151;several times&#151;under the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am sure that the Minister would accept that while directives are obligatory, member states almost invariably have considerable latitude in the way in which they can implement them. The amendments would bring the Government closer to the minimum standard that is required, rather than that which is allowed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Of course, European directives like UK legislation sometimes allow a degree of discretion. However, there is no question but that most directive provisions are mandatory. Although genuine disputes sometimes arise about the exact operation of such provisions, regarding the extent of their application, they must be implemented in full.
<P>
The directive requires a range of industrial installations to be regulated by a system of integrated pollution control. Permit conditions must be based on the use of best available techniques. I shall turn in a moment to the issue of best available techniques as opposed to BATNEEC, although they are similar concepts in part I of the 1990 Act. I hope that there can be no further question that this action must be taken by the UK and that the directive must be implemented by 30 October.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford referred briefly to the findings of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation in another place. We shall come to that at a later stage, so I shall make no more than a brief reference in return. The hon. Gentleman quoted from the Select Committee's first report, which he is perfectly entitled to do, but the Committee considered the Bill again and concluded in its second report, that it was satisfied that what had been excessively wide powers were now adequately circumscribed. It is important to put that on the record. As I said, we will be considering the flexibility of the regulations and the degree of parliamentary control later.
<P>
I shall talk about BATNEEC and the other point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) raised later, but I want to deal with the amendments now. They would restrict the scope of regulations made under the clause to dealing with significant pollution and would add&#151;although rather less was said about this&#151;a statutory instrument procedure by which Parliament would establish what was to be regarded as significant. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington put his finger on it when he said that there would be serious problems in trying to define what was meant by significant. The hon. Member for Ashford rather dodged the issue by saying that that was a matter for Parliament or for the Secretary of State; with respect, if the Opposition table an amendment, they ought to have some idea of how it can be practically operated. It is a difficult issue, but I look forward to hearing their further ideas on it.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the thoughts behind the amendments. Clearly, no Government&#151;certainly not this one would wish to place a burden of regulation on buisnesses that cause insignificant pollution. The implication of rejecting the word ``significant'', which I am going to do, does not mean that we favour the regulation of processes that cause insignificant environmental pollution and I shall explain why. Indeed, I am sure that I will be able to persuade hon. Members that that will not happen if the word significant is rejected.
<P>
The problem with the amendments is that the test of significance is subjective. How do the Opposition propose that it should be defined in a statutory instrument? We are not talking about people having a view on it; it must be defined in a parliamentary document. In addition, the amendments would create a wholly unnecessary additional parliamentary stage before regulations dealing with the control of pollution could reach the statute book. To put it crudely, it would scupper the parliamentary process and overload it for no real purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Is it not the case that that which is significant now and which might be defined in a statutory instrument, might in years to come prove to be much more or much less significant, and that changes would therefore have to be made year after year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is a fair point. Significance is assessed by value judgments, which are made appropriately at a certain time and can change over time.
<P>
I am trying to be as fair as I can, but it is simply not clear how the Secretary of State would go about deciding by order what constituted significant pollution. Do the Opposition have in mind orders that establish, pollutant by pollutant, which substances are to be regarded as a sufficient environment threat to warrant regulation? Just think what would happen if we had to establish for every pollutant what was meant by a significant degree of pollution. It is mind-boggling to imagine everything that would be involved in regulating in that way. Perhaps we are supposed to make orders that establish which activities are potentially significant before we make another set of regulations to control them. It is absurd that a party that is concerned to reduce regulations and minimise bureaucratic procedures is piling Pelion on Ossa.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Either way, the amendments result in a pretty clumsy bureaucratic and wholly unnecessary two-stage procedure. That said, I have some sympathy with the fair point that the Opposition have raised, and I want to say how it can be dealt with. We have a perfectly adequate way in the Bill as it stands of ensuring that regulatory burdens are appropriate. Clause 2(4) provides for extremely extensive consultation with stakeholders before any regulations are made. We must consult the relevant agency&#151;the Environment Agency&#151;and local government. We must also consult industry, agricultural and small business interests&#151;that is specifically stated&#151;and any other appropriate bodies or persons. Once we have consulted, we are bound by our own strict procedures&#151;I emphasise this&#151;to conduct a rigorous regulatory impact statement before any regulations are made.
<P>
The Conservative party prides itself on being concerned to minimise regulations. It had an orgy of deregulation when it was in power. We have supported deregulation where appropriate, but we believe that it is right to have better regulation. We should have regulation where it is appropriate, and deregulation where provisions are unnecessary and excessive.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I would hate to challenge the Minister, but I was a member of the Select Committee on Deregulation, and to say that we were overworked is an exaggeration that borders on the unparly. The Government were in no rush to deregulate. In fact, most of the measures that came before us were left over from before the general election. That Committee is currently considering a measure for casinos, which was left over from before the election. If the right hon. Gentleman is trying to claim that his Government are a deregulatory Government, there is no evidence for that in the deregulatory measures that have come before the House of Commons.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was not claiming that; I was saying rather the reverse. We do not, in principle, favour deregulation as such. I said that we favoured deregulation where appropriate. Where regulations are unnecessary, excessive or improperly burdensome, we favour modifying or withdrawing them. However, we also believe that regulation properly has a place. It is all a question of balance, as the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West said. We may differ about where the balance is struck, but my point was that I thought that the Opposition accepted that we should not unreasonably introduce unnecessary bureaucratic procedures. They are suggesting a two-stage, excessive, bureaucratic procedure to decide&#151;perhaps even pollutant by pollutant&#151;what is significant. That is still arbitrary. They then suggest a further procedure to decide how to regulate something once we have decided whether it is significant. That is absurd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I have listened with care and interest to the case that the Minister makes. However, I am still at a loss to understand his objection to including the term ``significant''. If he refers to the directive and the general principles governing the basic obligations of the operator, he will find that article 3(a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all the appropriate preventative measures'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that article 3(b) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no significant pollution is caused''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The directive puts a burden of definition of what is significant; all we are seeking to do is to ensure that that is included in United Kingdom legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My point is that we accept that regulation should be only of processes causing significant environmental harm. We do not support the idea or believe that the legisaltion will lead to regulation of environmental processes causing insignificant harm. My problem is that to put a provision into the legislation in the form suggested by the Opposition would lead to absurd bureaucratic results. As I have said, it would lead to a two-stage procedure that would undoubtedly be excessive. There would also be problems with how to define significance, who would define it, and the basis for such decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The legislation is intended to bring into effect a directive, which relies on the definition of the term ``significant''. Is there not a danger that, if we do not incorporate such a definition, there could be a legal challenge against the Government's actions on the basis that they would not have implemented what the directive sought to do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do not believe that that would be so. In this country, as in other European Union member states in the past decade, there has already been significant pollution regulation. That will not be altered and it is not necessary to include such provisions in the Bill. We have suffered no challenge from Brussels on the application of the 1990 Act&#151;we have not been required to write in any such wording. In drawing up our legislation, of course we liaise carefully with Brussells to ensure that what we do is consistent. The hon. Gentleman cannot dodge what I am saying. How does one define what is meant by ``significant''? Does he really want an extraordinarily cumbersome and bureaucratic procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Ashford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister keeps repeating, ``How does one define significance?''. It must be defined because the term is in the directive. He seems to be saying, ``The matter is difficult to define, but please leave it to us to do under some catch-all clause rather than by putting a definition on the face of the Bill.'' That does not solve the problem of definition, which we all admit exists&#151;he is simply saying that it is safer to solve the problem behind closed doors inside Government, rather than by letting Parliament have a say. That is not a democratic way to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> There may be some misunderstanding about the directive. It proposes that there should be a case-by-case assessment of what is significant, which is exactly what happens in this country and which, in a common-sense way of doing things, is bound to happen in any country. The hon. Gentleman is right&#151;a view must be taken on what is significant, and that view is taken by the regulatory authority in the light of full and extensive consultations. It would be nonsense either to write into legislation a general definition of the term applying to the whole range of pollutants, or to define it to apply to each individual pollutant.
<P>
No valuable purpose would be served by adding to the rigorous safeguards on regulatory impact assessment, and the Prime Minister takes a close personal interest in ensuring that our approach is rigorous. We take burdens on business extremely seriously. We will impose burdens only where they are justified, and the ``better government'' White Paper introduced a forward look at regulations so that a close eye can be kept on the overall burden.
<P>
Nothing would be achieved by adding to the safeguards a requirement to make statutory instruments to deal with pollution in two stages. That would simply delay necessary measures. Let us consider what parliamentary debates would be held under a two-stage system. If hon. Members were presented with orders seeking to establish whether a pollutant was significant enough to warrant control, I suspect that they would have little option other than to shrug their shoulders and say, ``That substance could be a problem because any substance could be a problem in the wrong place, but we want to know how the Government will regulate it.'' If they were presented with regulations to establish whether polluting activities were significant enough to warrant regulation, I again suspect that their response would be to say, ``Of course they are, but the way in which they are regulated must be sensible and proportionate.'' That is already guaranteed through the regulatory system and the Environment Agency. It is far better, therefore, to introduce regulations as a complete package rather than under an elongated, two-stage procedure. The Bill proposes a complete package, which allows Parliament to hold a meaningful debate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that part of the debate about pollution control is the understanding of science? One side of the argument believes in controls that are so strong that no pollutant exists, and the other side assesses the risk and is prepared to accept a level of pollutants. That is where the debate in Parliament would lie. Given the right hon. Gentleman's well-known concerns, it is highly possible that his Department would set controls that, despite the consultation process, would lead industry to question whether it could produce its products at a price that made them marketable and safe for the environment. That is why we believe&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady is making a very long intervention.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall draw it swiftly to a close. That is the basis on which we are looking for more opportunities for debate in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I understand the hon. Lady's point, but there is a great deal of difference between wanting more debate on the general application of regulatory principles&#151;Bills provide such an opportunity, although perhaps we need further debate and I am all in favour of that&#151;and Parliament having to determine whether each pollutant or each set of pollutants is significant. It would not be practicable or workable for Parliament to strike a balance between ensuring that environmental pollution is minimised and that products can be produced at a marketable cost while at the same time ensuring that people are properly protected. I presume that the idea is a debating point rather than a serious point. We have to put matters&#151;as the previous Government did&#151;to the Environment Agency which is at arm's length from the Government. It has 9,500 employees, almost all of whom deal with various aspects of pollution. They are spread throughout the country and regularly inspect installations and reach judgments in the light of the general principles that Parliament has laid down. One cannot insert greater direct parliamentary control over each of those judgments than we have at present; that would be nonsense.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> One of the debates in which constituency Members of Parliament get involved, is when businesses tell the Environment Agency, for which they have great respect, ``Your target is not feasible. Our science tells us that you can set the control at a different level.'' That is why there is a debate. If the Environment Agency and the Department ride roughshod over industry, the issue will come straight back to Parliament and will be raised in other forums. Surely it is better to ensure that we have a properly structured system of debate and discussion so that everybody owns the decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I completely agree with the general principle of the hon. Lady's remarks. That is why, before regulations are made under clause 2(4), extensive consultations must take place, including with small business interests. During those consultations, it is for small businesses to raise issues with their Members of Parliament and to bring them to the parliamentary forum if they wish. However, I cannot believe that the Opposition are seriously suggesting that we should require that to happen on every occasion, willy-nilly. That would be an absurd and completely unworkable system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I cannot believe what the Minister has just said. He said that small businesses could raise problems with their Members of Parliament, but the whole thrust of his argument is that Members of Parliament should have no input. There is no point in our constituents talking to us because he is trying to write us out of the equation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not go on like that. He is being a little perverse; I was not saying that at all. I am dealing with what the hon. Gentleman wants to do because that is the subject of our rather wide-ranging discussions.

<B>The Chairman:</B> I am beginning to lose track.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am trying not to lose track. The basic proposition that we are being invited to support is that there should be a definition of significant pollution, although nobody on the Opposition Benches can provide one that will feature in a statutory instrument. Secondly, we are being asked to support a detailed, two-stage, cumbersome parliamentary procedure that would apply to every single pollutant or to each main set of pollutants.
<P>
In most cases, people do not challenge the ceilings that are set, and there are doubts only in some cases. Of course, there is a question of science and of judgment. In such cases, however, the consultation process will enable the matter to go wider. If it is raised with Members of Parliament, they can write to Ministers who will I hope, like myself, meet the small businesses or Members of Parliament who have concerns to discuss the matter further. Where the regulations bite in an unreasonable or improper way, a parliamentary channel exists to deal with the matter. To deal with it in the cumbersome and excessive way proposed in the amendment is simply not practicable.

The word ``any'' will be exploited by pressure groups that peddle cod science to bring about situations with which the Minister, even with his sensible judgment on many issues, would find it difficult to cope. I wish to raise one example: the dreaded dioxin. Dioxins in minute quantities are present in the atmosphere, do now harm and are part of industrial processes, including that of incineration to deal with the problem of domestic waste. The Minister has taken great interest in that matter and has sensibly said that incineration must be a part of our dealing with such material. It is almost&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order, I remind the hon. Lady that she is making an intervention and not a speech.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gorman:</B> My intervention is on how the Minister will deal with a case presented by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth or one of the other practitioners of cod science involving an up-to-date, significant incineration process, which produces minute quantities of dioxin because it is almost impossible to fail to do so. Members of those groups may tell him that the word ``any harm'' include harmful dioxins. They will tell him that he must decide whether to close down all the incinerators on that basis, because he will be enabled to do that. The inclusion of ``serious'' or ``significant'' would allow him to choose not to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gorman:</B> Will he give his view on how he would deal with such a situation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Lady is not easily stopped. The matter is not closely related to the debate, but having been asked a direct question I shall give an answer. Under the directive that became operative, I think, on 1 December 1996&#151;under the previous Administration&#151;there is a new standard for dioxins. Their levels should not exceed 1 nanogram per cubic metre, an exceedingly small quantity&#151;no more than 1 billionth part of a cubic metre. That is how incinerators are regulated. The answer to the hon. Lady's question is that a range of directives and Acts of Parliament, such as the excellent Environmental Protection Act 1990, govern those processes. They are complementary and mutually reinforcing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr Meacher:</B> I was about to come to the hon. Gentleman's questions so perhaps I could start before he intervenes without knowing what I am going to say. I hope that he accepts the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire. Small businesses are not just victims&#151;they also gain from proper regulation of their neighbours. There is a significant market in environmental technology mainly provided by small businesses that find an innovative niche and develop it. That world market is worth &#163;250 billion and is growing fast. Small businesses have a real interest in the issue, and both sides of the question must be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman really need to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I wanted to put on the record that I accepted that point. I would ask the Minister to recognise the significant concern that some small businesses stand to gain but that others stand to lose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I agree with that, of course. The integrated pollution prevention and control directive, in its transposition into the legislation, is concerned with the approximately 7,000 large installations. I maintain what I said on Second Reading. I cannot say that none of the 170,000 members of the Federation of Small Businesses will be affected by the legislation, but the number that will be is extremely small. The measure is not aimed at small businesses.
<P>
I hope that I have said enough on the question of balance: balance must be struck. The only difference between the Government and the Opposition is that we believe that that has to be done through the regulatory system based on the judgments of the Environment Agency and criteria and principles laid down by Parliament.
<P>
On democratic control, I shall not go into the climate control levy, which was mentioned earlier, because it is covered by the Finance Bill. In fact, it proves the opposite point&#151;there has been extensive discussion about it, which the Government have entered into genuinely and openly.
<P>
The 1990 Act is a very good Act that was passed by the previous Administration. It allows any process to be prescribed for regulation by negative resolution, and requires efforts to render any polluting substances harmless. Section 7(2)(a)(ii) states the objectives of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``rendering harmless any other substances which might cause harm''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is extremely wide, but I am not aware of any objections that it has been used to persecute small businesses or anyone else. It is covered by the regulatory processes and administered in a sensible and balanced way.
<P>
The hon. Members for Altrincham and Sale, West and for Billericay made a point about gold-plating. I would argue that exactly the opposite is the case. As we have repeatedly made clear, the purpose of the Bill is to allow coherent implementation of the IPPC directive. Industry would suffer extra costs if we had to continue with two separate pollution control systems. The change from BATNEEC to BAT for non-IPPC installations does not mean extra cost and gold-plating, but rather sets a level playing field for the UK industry&#151;and the UK industry has welcomed that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West mentioned proper parliamentary control. We have ensured a proper degree of parliamentary control and the second report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation accepted that. The regulations will be subject to affirmative procedure when they are first made and for certain important amendments thereafter. The Select Commitee thought that that was adequate when it considered the Government's amendments to the Bill.
<P>
I turn to BATNEEC. It is wrong&#151;I am sure that it is the result of a misunderstanding&#151;to suggest that the directive's term ``best available techniques'' has less regard for cost-effectiveness than the UK term ``best available technology not entailing excessive cost''. I point out that the previous Government&#151;I am trying to praise them for this&#151;negotiated the directive. If they accepted BAT, Conservative Members should presumably stick with that now. The directive would not be accepted if a member state such as the UK were strongly opposed. Article 2/11 of the directive states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```available' techniques shall mean those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those words are from the main body of the directive, not the annexe. Before the hon. Member for Ashford reaches for his papers, the annexe reinforces the message, and he was right to quote from it, but the words are also in the directive.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Drew </B>(Stroud): Does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the problems with BATNEEC was the time scale? The firms with which I had dealings, which were being asked to improve their pollution control, could always argue that the techniques were not affordable at the time present time, whereas if we introduced BAT one would hope that we would be giving a clearer definition of the need for action now, providing, as my right hon. Friend rightly said, that the qualification of the ability to put it into practice is understood.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is a fair point. I would argue that BATNEEC was a cost-effective concept, although it was not as clearly defined as BAT is now. My hon. Friend is saying that BAT may clarify matters helpfully for industry; I hope that that is correct.
<P>
I repeat to the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) that if we do not implement the directive in legally identical terms, we could be subject to infraction proceedings, so we do not have an alternative. I am not, however, just resting my argument on Europe. I would be very concerned if the cost effectiveness of BATNEEC were not carried through to BAT.
<P>
I am not sure that any hon. Member suggested that we should use BAT for the installations that are covered by the directive and retain BATNEEC for the rest&#151;perhaps I should not argue against that, since no one suggested it. I hope that it is widely accepted that it would certainly lead to confusion and additional burdens. Using a different concept from that used by the rest of Europe would present all those who had to work with the regulatory system, including industry, with a headache and a consent question about how or whether the two differ&#151;a lawyer's paradise. However, there seems to be no pressure to do that.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The right hon. Gentleman regularly says that industry agrees with this. When I used to work for the Chemical Industries Association, we were negotiating BATNEEC. Could the Minister&#151;this is a genuine request for clarification&#151;give us some idea of the UK chemical industry's view on this legislation and say whether the European industry is happy with the terms of the directive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall answer that question about the chemical industry at a later stage. I am not aware that the industry has rejected the IPPC directive. It is of course concerned about the application of IPC to its installations and the same will apply to IPPC, which adds noise, vibration, use of resources and waste to the IPC's consideration of environmental pollution, but I do not believe that it has in principle rejected the IPPC directive. Perhaps the hon. Lady was helping that industry to lobby the Government when that directive was being prepared in the mid-1990s.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Well, it should have done&#151;[Interruption.] Perhaps the hon. Lady did not do so. It would certainly have lobbied the Government about the principles that it thought should be contained in the draft directive, and I am sure that the Government would have taken its thoughts on board.
<P>
I have been handed an answer even more quickly than I had anticipated, so I shall transmit the message to the hon. Member for Beckenham. The CIA&#151;I emphasise for the benefit of my hon. Friends that that stands for the Chemical Industries Association&#151;is perfectly happy with the directive and the way in which it is being implemented. We have a regular dialogue with it and two CIA members sit on an informal Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions sounding board. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am glad that I worked not for MI5 but for the CIA. The right hon. Gentleman said that the chemical industry was happy with the directive as it stands, but I understand that the directive uses the word ``significant'', not ``any''; that is the Opposition's point. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us whether the CIA is happy with the terms of the Bill, as opposed to the directive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is what I was just saying. I dealt with the point about the transposition of the word ``significant'' in reply to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West. I said that the directive allows for a case-by-case assessment of what ``significant'' means. Although the word is used, it relates to a different concept and is employed in a different manner and for a different purpose than that which the Opposition suggest.
<P>
I turn to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North&#151;it is always important to get the constituency right; people never do in the case of Oldham. The answer to the technical point that she raised is that noise will be regulated by a permit issued under the new system if it arises from the installation. Otherwise, it will be covered by the statutory nuisance provision of part III of the 1990 Act. Local authorities will be closely involved when the Environment Agency deals with noise under a permit. There is no question of any noise going unregulated. The provisions are drawn up so as to ensure that there is shoulder-to-shoulder consistency&#151;no overlap, but no gaps either.
<P>
<B>Ms Walley:</B> As my right hon. Friend says, this is a technical point. He referred to schedule 2, and to the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The schedule contains the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``under regulations under section 2 of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which insert a new provision into the 1999 Act. Will he confirm that that will not preclude action under part III of the Act in respect of noise or other activities that were previously a statutory nuisance, but which may not necessarily be in future? That is a technical point, and I am grateful for my right hon. Friend's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am grateful that I can give my hon. Friend the answer: yes.
<P>
I want to conclude what has been a balanced and thoughtful debate, which has raised some of the key issues in the Bill. I hope that I have made it clear that the amendments are unnecessary and, indeed, counterproductive. Without repeating arguments that I have discussed extensively, I urge the hon. Member for Ashford and the Opposition to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank the right Hon. Gentleman for his comprehensive reply to the debate and for his kind words at the start of his speech. I am not sure whether that set a precedent&#151;within about 15 minutes he was saying that he hoped that Opposition Members would not be continuing in the same vein. Perhaps we will.
<P>
I am also grateful for the Minister's confirmation that the Government do not, in principle, regard deregulation as desirable. That is a significant statement, which I look forward to relaying to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>
The bulk of the Minister's reply was about the term ``significant''. I will come to that in a minute. First, I want briefly to say something about the Minister's attitude to the question of whether there is enough parliamentary control. He seemed to hint at one stage that the Government might introduce proposals in that regard, and I hope that that is so. I was, however, concerned that he described the extra parliamentary scrutiny that the Opposition propose as ``an unnecessary bureaucratic stage'' in the process of approval, which would overload Parliament. It seems to me that a central job of Parliament is to check whether the Executive's positions are good or bad for the people of the country. If that is so, Parliament cannot be overloaded in its job. I am chary of the concept of unnecessary parliamentary intervention in the regulatory process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> On a point of clarity, I would welcome my hon. Friend's agreement that what Governments do is bureaucratic by definition; what Parliament does is democratic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend puts the point more eloquently than I do, and I am grateful to him for doing so.
<P>
I said in my opening remarks that the Minister had not fallen into the trap set by officials mentioned in debates in the other place. I am more doubtful of that now that I have heard him speak. The basis of his argument seemed to be that definition was too difficult, so the measure should be left all-embracing, with regulators solving the problems. I ask him to reflect&#151;that seems a dangerous path to tread. One of the great old-fashioned slogans of the Conservative party is that we should trust the people; the Minister's response seems to be that we should trust the regulators. As a way of getting a message across and, in the long run, of making what Governments do acceptable, trusting the people through their representatives in Parliament is a better method than acting through the regulators.
<P>
The Minister mentioned the increased consultation with outside bodies forced on the Government by criticisms in another place. That has now been introduced to the process and welcomed by industry, small businesses, farmers and others. However, consultation cannot be a substitute for proper parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
As I have said, the bulk of the Minister's remarks concerned the question of whether it was possible to define the word ``significant'' in individual cases. Clearly, trying to draft regulations across a Committee is not a sensible way in which to proceed, and I am sure that he did not wish to do that.
<P>
In what might have been a genuine misunderstanding, the Minister said that the burden of our amendment would be to ensure that Parliament would have to decide on the question of significance in each case. Our amendment would not achieve that. For an individual case, it would have to be decided whether likely pollution would be significant and, in the vast bulk of cases. the answer would be no, meaning that that case would not come under the scope of the amendment. The amendment would reduce the amount of paperwork and bureaucracy, to which the Minister rightly objects&#151;and on a parliamentary basis. The Minister will be more aware than me of concepts such as critical load and critical level that may be used&#151;and are used&#151;to apply general principles to questions of whether pollution is significant.
<P>
I put to him that the question of the involvement of Parliament is not as impossible as he makes out. If it was anything other than impossible&#151;even if it was very difficult&#151;it would be worth doing in comparison with giving a Secretary of State all-embracing powers, as the Bill would.
<P>
I shall make one final detailed point about the great BATNEEC debate, partly in the interest of self-education. In the past 24 hours, I have read in the explanatory notes accompanying the Bill that the concepts of BATNEEC and BAT were similar, and in the report of debates in the House of Lords that, in Lord Whitty's description, they were ``broadly similar''. A Minister has informed me that they were exactly the same. Some of my confusion may be due to inexperience, but, generally, it is not clear whether the two things are the same. Replacing one set of concepts with the other may not achieve exactly the same result. I accept the Minister's point that the phrase that I quoted appears in the annexe and the main text of the directive, but, even so, my principal point still holds. The wording about loading costs on to industry is rather weaker under the BAT definition than under BATNEEC. BAT may be a preferable definition, but I am not wholly convinced that the two concepts are exactly the same.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some important and central issues have been raised. The Minister has not entirely reasssured me, so it may be necessary to return to this matter at a later stage of the House's consideration of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on to amendment No. 5, I should point out to the Committee that, in my normal liberal-minded way, I allowed a wide-ranging debate on the first group of amendments to be considered under clause 1. In future, I shall not be so liberal. I ask Committee members to stick to the scope of the amendments and to remember that interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 22, after `noise', insert `light'.
<P>
Thank you, Mr. Atkinson, for your generosity in allowing the previous debate, which covered an important topic, to range so widely. I am sure that you and the committee will be relieved to know that, although amendment No. 5 also raises an important point, it need not detain the Committee for anything like as long. It is a probing amendment, but the thinking behind it is that the Bill should be as clear as possible.
<P>
In the light of the previous debate, it may seem paradoxical that we should wish to add to the Bill, but we are working on the principle that the Bill should be clear and comprehensive. Given that clause 1(2) outlines the areas of pollution that should be included within the scope of the regulations, such a list should be clear and comprehensive, which is why the amendment suggests adding ``light'' pollution. The Minister will be aware that that is an especially important issue in the countryside. Hon. Members who were not brought up in the country, but who now represent rural constituencies, may have had a similar experience to mine when, for the first time at night, I walked out of the Conservative office, which is in a village, I found that it was pitch black. My murmurings that that might be slightly unsafe elicited the instant response, ``This is how we like it in the country.'' I have learned from that.
<P>
Light pollution is a serious issue, and we are probing why it has not been included in the Bill. Clearly, the definition of pollution is important, as the previous debate showed. The definitions in the clause should therefore be clear and comprehensive. The Bill includes more processes and installations than were previously covered by UK legislation, and more factors that should be considered when permitting activities. It is better to have a longer list in the Bill than to have uncertainty later. The amendment seeks to probe the exact wording of the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Perhaps I may begin by taking the liberty of encouraging you, Mr. Atkinson, to be as liberal as you wish?
<P>
I support amendment No. 5, tabled by the official Opposition. I am anticipating an intervention by the hon. Member for Billericay, because light also occurs in nature, when supplied by the sun or the stars. However, light is a source of pollution, and we have probably all had letters from constituents complaining about other people's security lights, or about floodlighting at sports grounds. The amendment is sensible, and if the Minister does not intend to support it, will he tell us the reasons why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I should like to explore this matter a little. Does the Minister think that the amendment is necessary, in the light of second paragrah (a) in clause 1(2), which includes the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any other kind of release of energy''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would presumably include light in some of its forms. I think that the Minister indicated assent. If so, why is it necessary specifically to enumerate the other forms of energy release, such as sound and vibration?
<P>
Secondly, I note the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford about stepping out of the Conservative party office in Ashford, which neither I nor Labour Members have had the privilege of doing. I grew up in the suburbs and now represent a suburban constituency, in which there are two vistas that I find appealing from the few high vantage points. One is the view across the Cheshire plain to the south. The other is the view of Manchester to the north, especially at night when the city is lit up by the street lights. It is possible that I may even be able to see as far as Oldham, West.
<P>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said that we have all encountered complaints about security lighting. However, the most significant form of light pollution surely comes from street lighting, whether on motorways or streets in urban and suburban areas. I would welcome the Minister's precise comments as to the point at which such light pollution becomes acceptable.
<P>
What measures under the Bill does the Minister foresee local authorities and the Highways Agency having to take to mitigate such light pollution, perhaps by shading all street lights to prevent extraneous light from illuminating areas other than those intended? What cost does he envisage being imposed on local authorities and the Highways Agency as a result of those important measures of mitigation that the Government would presumably require through regulation?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall try to be brief in speaking in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford.
<P>
It is interesting that light is not included in the provision. Perhaps it was not in the original directive, which the Bill simply mirrors. However, it is unusual for the British system not to gold-plate matters. I should be interested to know why light was not included in the clause. Like my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, my postbage regularly contains many queries on not only the pollution caused by street lighting, but the safety aspect. The police frequently call for increased street lighting to help protect people from the street crime to which too many of them are exposed.
<P>
There is also the issue of the lighting of football pitches, tennis courts and other sporting venues, to which reference was briefly made. Lighting technology has advanced dramatically. The huge floodlights at a football match that one used to be able to see from a distance are no longer necesssary. Lighting can now be much more controlled. However, when football stadiums and other sporting facilities are redeveloped, we appear not to be encouraging higher quality lighting.
<P>
In my previous constituency, there is a strong lobby, which I support, for a new road along the south coast. However, many people objected to the road because the Highways Agency requires modern roudabouts to be lit, even though many long-established roundabouts are unlit. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford noted, there is not the same desire for lighting in the countryside as there is in towns. Although modern safety standards require roundabouts and other junctions to be lit, the need for such lighting in the countryside is not as great, other than on motorways. There is a conflict between the need for safety and people's desire to live in a darker, friendlier environment. People in the countryside do not want higher levels of lighting spoiling what they regard as its traditional ambience.
<P>
The matter is one of resolving conflicts. Will the Minister say why light is not included in the clause? What are the parameters of the conflicts between the Highways Agency and Departments that are concerned with pollution? It would be useful to know how Government policy on this issue is developing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In one sentence, may I correct a comment made by the hon. Member for Ashford at the end of the previous debate? According to the hon. Gentleman, neither I nor the Government believe that deregulation is desirable, but the record will show that I did not say that. I said that we would not aim for deregulation for its own sake. Where appropriate&#151;where regulation is excessive or unreasonable&#151;we aim for deregulation, but, where appropriate, we also aim for better regulation. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would accept what I said, rather than putting words into my mouth.
<P>
Amendment No. 5 seems to have arisen from an extraordinary episode on Second Reading, when the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) intervened during my speech with irresponsible, knockabout comments on a Bill whose prime purpose is to implement a European directive that was agreed enthusiastically by his then boss. He is entitled, subsequently, to take his own view. Many of his comments were wrong-headed and obstructive, but he asked why light pollution was not included.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Light pollution could be covered by the regulations made under the Bill because, as has already been quoted, subsection (2) defines pollution as including:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``pollution caused by noise, heat or vibrations or any other kind of release of energy''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West rightly said, light is a form of energy. I am asked why in that case it is not mentioned specifically in the Bill. There is no particular reason why it is not, other than that some forms of energy, such as noise, heat and vibration, are mentioned in the IPCC directive. We have simply transposed those terms into the Bill for clarity, but we have no objection to light being taken aboard too. To that extent, the amendment is otiose. However, listening to what hon. Members have said, I realise that they are concerned about light in a wider sense, and I shall briefly comment on some of their arguments.
<P>
Most people would not consider industrial light pollution as being in the same category as noise pollution or vibration, waste, use of raw materials and energy efficiency, the prime matters that the Bill seeks to address. Of more than 2,000 organisations consulted about the draft pollution prevention and control regulations, only one mentioned light pollution. To pick up what was said in the debate on amendment No. 1, I am sure that regulations on light pollution from factories would not pass the test of significance for which hon. Members were arguing in the previous debate. It would have been interesting to see how they would have tried to reconcile their arguments, had amendment No. 5 been taken with the previous group&#151;I say that rhetorically.
<P>
That is not to demean the issue. Light pollution is a serious problem in some contexts and measures and on-going initiatives are in place to deal with it. I shall mention a few.
<P>
Controls already exist over lighting schemes for developments that require planning permission from the local planning authority. Authorities have the power to control lighting schemes associated with new developments and can impose restrictions on the positioning and height of lighting columns and the spread of light. In addition, the Government produce advice on good lighting practice. For example, my Department, with the Countryside Commission, published a guide entitled ``Lighting in the Countryside: Towards Good Practice''. It is a tool for professionals, lighting manufacturers and members of the public on the actions that they can take to mitigate the intrusive effects of lighting schemes.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Walley:</B> I apologise to my right hon. Friend for not having taken part in the debate. Will he clarify how the advice that he gives to local authorities relates to requirements in respect of energy efficiency? There is a circle to be squared and sometimes the most effective lighting is not the most energy efficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. Under the Bill and following the directive, energy efficiency will primarily be the responsibility of the Environment Agency. However, my hon. Friend is right that lighting developments can have an impact on energy efficiency. That is one of the issues that local authorities will have to take into account as a result of the Bill. Although it is primarily a matter for the Environment Agency, local authorities will have to take it on board in considering how they regulate light.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I want to pursue the point about street lighting. The Minister spoke about the detail of guidelines and regulations and about the height of columns in new developments. Is he saying that the Government have no intention of using these powers more generally to regulate light pollution coming from street lighting, or is he saying that they do intend to do that? Can he shed&#151;dare I say&#151;some light on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is our intention to take further action. I was just coming to the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
The biggest source of light pollution is not individual buildings but street and road lighting, which cause a nuisance in some cases. However, we are taking action. Road lighting is needed on some roads in the interests of safety, so we must strike a balance. We said in our White Paper on integrated transport that, where lighting is essential, it should be designed in such a way that nuisance is reduced and the effect on the night sky in the countryside is minimised. It is a difficult balance to strike, but those are the principles on which we wish to operate.
<P>
I wish to pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West about Manchester, an area of the country in which the hon. Gentleman and I share an interest. The Highways Agency is doing much to improve matters. For example, new lighting for the M62 has reduced intrusion into the night landscape where the motorway crosses the high Pennines over Saddleworth moor. The lamps direct most of the light downwards on to the motorway, making the road itself bright, but produce a more natural colour and bring about a dramatic darkening of the night sky. I have witnessed exactly that myself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am pleased to hear about the progress in that area. However, I ask the Minister to consider whether these provisions should apply only to new schemes&#151;whether that is new lighting or the replacement of lighting, as in the case mentioned&#151;or whether there should be legislation to require new and better technology to be used where there is existing lighting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We certainly intend to apply these new principles to existing lighting provision, where appropriate, but of course a cost is attached to that. In recent years, there has been more concern about light pollution. It is a genuine issue in the countryside, and we must deal with it. There has been increasing clutter and pollution of various kinds, and light is certainly one of them. We are drafting our rural White Paper and I would be surprised if it did not refer to that. Having said that, what the Opposition seek is already covered. I hope that they will withdraw their amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am happy to accept the assurance that the Minister gave at the start of his speech about the Government's attitude to deregulation, not least because, when he restated his position, he confirmed that there is a genuine difference between us in that regard. Deregulation where necessary has always been a recipe for no deregulation at all, as I am afraid is proving to be the case here.
<P>
The Minister made some rather unkind remarks about my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire, which is unfortunate. My hon. Friend represents a rural constituency where light pollution is a big issue. I am sure that my hon. Friend was speaking on behalf of many of his constituents when he raised the issue on Second Reading.
<P>
The Minister said that it would have been interesting to see how Opposition Members would have argued the point if the amendment had been discussed with the previous group. It seems to me that the amendments are perfectly coherent when considered together, as we want the Bill to have as much clarity and practical effect as possible. That was the purpose of the previous group of amendments and it is one of the purposes of this amendment.
<P>
The Minister rightly admitted that light pollution is an important issue for a large and increasing number of people. In relation to the M62, he pointed out that technological change means that light need not cause significant pollution. That is a welcome development, which illustrates perhaps that we should target significant pollution instead of catching all pollution.
<P>
The central point was that light is an energy emission and is therefore covered by the Bill. However, the same argument would apply to heat. The argument against including light in the Bill is therefore not strong. If the amendment were accepted, the profile of light pollution as a serious issue that affects many millions of people would be raised. It would therefore be desirable to accept the amendment, although I appreciate the Minister's argument for not doing so. I invite my hon. Friends, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and&#151;given the new fashion, even on the Government Back Benches, for free thinking&#151;Labour Members who are feeling brave to support the amendment.

<P>
I have high hopes for the amendment, as we may be able to tease out some support from the Minister. He is more likely to accept this amendment than others tabled by the Opposition.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to prevent another unnecessary burden being put on some farmers. The Minister will know about the current plight of the British farming industry and would not want to be responsible for such a burden, which I am sure is inadvertent. The wording that might cause problems to farmers must now be amended. I am sure that the National Farmers Union and other bodies will have lobbied the Minister, as well as Opposition Members, on the need to accept the amendment.
<P>
The problem is that the definition of environmental pollution in the clause states&#151;
