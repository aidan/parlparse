<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310133000417"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>I welcome the Ministers and members of
the Committee to our final evidence session. There is much detail to be
discussed and many questions that hon. Members might wish to put to
Ministers. For my convenience, and that of those who will read the
report, it might be useful to adopt a thematic approach so that Members
can come in on those, rather than trying to hop, skip and jump around
the Bill&#146;s many provisions. I am, of course, in the hands of
Members.</div>
<a name="090310133000007"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
340340</b><a name="090310133000418"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): I
welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Humble, and we look forward
to your firm but fair leadership&#151;that mix of sagacity and
benevolence for which you are
famous.</div><a name="090310133000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
contrast, I will now turn to the Ministers. The Bill was described in
one of our evidence sessions last week as a &#147;bureaucratic
muddle&#148; and a &#147;mixed bag&#148; by employer
representatives, and I am sure that those words are still ringing in
the ears of Ministers. Professor Alan Tuckett from the National
Institute of Adult Continuing Education described it as &#147;a
missed opportunity.&#148; At a time when employers and education
providers must be deregulated in order to respond effectively to the
economic crisis, does not the Bill simply tie their hands? When people
are coming out with such robust and clear criticisms, do Ministers
ignore them or take stock of them and respond? Does replacing the
Learning and Skills Council with three bodies really improve the
capacity of employers and employees to survive the economic
downturn?</div><a name="090310133000009"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="090310133000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I would like to take the opportunity to
welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Humble, and look forward to
serving under your chairmanship over the next few
weeks.</div><a name="090310133000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to John&#146;s question, what is ringing in my ears is the
endorsement of the vast majority of witnesses for the measures we are
taking in the Bill. It is possible to pick out one or two isolated
quotes about specific elements of the Bill that people might not agree
with, but that would be an unfair reflection of the substance of what
witnesses told us last week about this set of measures, and there are
many of them.</div>
<a name="090310133000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of whether we should be doing this at this point in the
economic cycle and with the recession, I am sure that Si&#244;n will
want to comment on the aspects relating to skills. As far as the
14-to-19 phase is concerned, we passed the Education and Skills Act
2008 in order to raise the participation age, and if we are to make
that a reality for 17-year-olds by 2013, as the legislation sets 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>out, we have to act now to build the capacity of local authorities to do
so. Therefore, those who oppose the Bill on the grounds that the timing
is wrong essentially oppose the change that was agreed by Parliament
last year.</div>
<a name="090310133000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the timetable for doing this, the Committee will know that there are
currently shadow arrangements between local authorities and learning
and skills council staff, that the academic year starting this
September is a transition year and that in April 2010 the legal
responsibility will go over to local authorities. They will then be
able to commission the services at the same time as running Connexions,
which will be transferred by the Bill, as John knows. They will then
have the tools at their disposal to commission the sort of learning
that will engage every young person in their area so that that policy
is a success. Having moved from the break in education from 16 to 19,
it makes sense to have an infrastructure that reflects that. You need
something that brokers the arrangements for local authorities so that
further education colleges in particular are not having multiple
conversations because the vast majority of them are commissioned from
several local authority areas. That is why the Young People&#146;s
Learning Agency is necessary, as well as for the transfer of academy
functions. In order to drive the growth in apprenticeship places
forward, and to have a discrete agency focusing on adult skills, there
is great merit in setting up the Skills Funding Agency.</div>
<a name="090310133000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> It is a great pleasure it is to serve under
you, Mrs Humble; I echo the comments about your sagacity and all your
other qualities.</div>
<a name="090310133000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is now the
right time to move towards a more flexible, responsive and
employer-responsive skill system? The answer is yes, obviously. A lot
of what we and the Learning and Skills Council have managed to do in
the last six months or so in response to the recession is precisely the
kind of thing that the Skills Funding Agency will do more and more of,
and be better and better at. It will be slimmer, more streamlined,
faster and more responsive to things such as introducing
&#163;350 million-worth of flexibilities into Train to
Gain, the integration of employment and skills, and the discrete work
that we have been doing with, for example, car manufacturers in the
north-east.</div>
<a name="090310133000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Far from
being against the grain of the reforms, all of those are entirely in
line with the direction of travel of the SFA. The Learning and Skills
Council has done an outstandingly good job, but a different job is
needed next. The job of the LSC was to drive up participation and
success in a skills system which was sadly lacking. It has achieved
that with a great increase in success rates and at levels 2 and 3 in
respect of the skills system.</div>
<a name="090310133000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we need
to do next is to make the skills system more specifically and directly
responsive to employers and learners. The SFA will do that through its
customer-facing outward-looking gateways: Train to Gain, the National
Apprenticeship Service, the adult advancement and careers service,
skills accounts and the National Employer Service. It is about making
the system respond more directly and quickly to the needs of individual
learners and businesses. I commend it to
everybody.</div><a name="090310133000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
341</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000419"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I want to be helpful to Ministers, because that is
the right thing to do. Perhaps I can give them a bit of guidance on why
people feel that this is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>bureaucratic muddle. The relationship between the NAS and the SFA is
unclear. The NAS cannot specify standards. As you know, that is the job
of the SFA; clauses 21 to 30 detail that, despite the fact that the NAS
will be dealing with everything else on apprenticeships. The NAS
reports to both Government Departments and must develop
apprenticeships, as the Minister suggested, in conjunction with local
education authorities, which will decide the type and amount. There is
very little on an explicit role for employers or providers, and the
entitlement to apprenticeships is not matched by any major plans for
implementation.</div>
<a name="090310133000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
surprising that in the Committee evidence sessions, the transition from
the LSC was described as being likely to be &#147;messy and
complicated&#148;. While I acknowledge that Ministers have had
discussions with countless employers, I wonder whether they appreciate
that the CBI was, at best, lukewarm and the British Chambers of
Commerce was hostile. Does that not cause immense concerns? What about
those relationships and lines of accountability? They are all over the
place and so immensely unclear. We can barely understand them; what
chance has anybody else
got?</div><a name="090310133000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> To start with the relationship between the SFA
and the NAS, it may be the case that it has not yet been widely
understood. It was only relatively recently promulgated in any detail,
and that is perhaps one of the reasons for that, but it is not
complicated or
ambiguous.</div><a name="090310133000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me explain. The chief executive of Skills Funding is the accounting
officer and is, in statutory terms, responsible for apprenticeships and
the NAS. In practice, the chief executive of Skills Funding will
delegate all practical functions relating to apprentices to the chief
executive of the NAS, who will have a statutory accounting reporting
responsibility to the chief executive of Skills Funding, but will also
have management reporting responsibilities to the two Secretaries of
State of the two Departments. I do not think that that is terribly
complicated or at all
ambiguous.</div><a name="090310133000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
was the next thing that you
asked?</div><a name="090310133000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
342</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000420"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b><b class="B"> </b>I talked about a series of bureaucratic
elements, but let us deal with the one that you raise, Si&#244;n.
Perhaps I can ask my third question on sector skills councils on the
back of that, because you make much mention of them in the
Bill&#146;s explanatory
notes.</div><a name="090310133000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
real issue is that by, in your words, having a line of accountability
to two Departments, there is an implicit lack of clarity. What if the
Departments have different perspectives or take different policy
positions? That is immensely confused, is it not? I find it very hard
to be tough on the Minister as he is such a charming chap, but Keith
Marshall from the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils&#151;the
Minister was here and heard his evidence just as clearly as I
did&#151;complained that there is not enough detail in the Bill on
the role of sector skills councils in statutory terms. There is very
little legislative mention of their role. Indeed, Keith Marshall argued
that the involvement of LEAs actually weakens the role of sector skills
councils&#151;the voice of employers&#151;in the system. It seems
to me that, contrary to the Government&#146;s intentions, which I am
prepared to accept are noble and virtuous, the Bill will result in
confusion, lack of clarity, potentially conflicting reporting lines and
a diminished role for sector skills councils.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div><a name="090310133000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> If I can just respond to those two points, and
I think that Jim would then like to answer some of John&#146;s points
in his opening question. I do not think that the dual reporting of the
NAS chief executive to the two Secretaries of State is inherently
impossible or dreadfully convoluted. The apprenticeship system
comprises two components, one of which falls under the remit of, and is
funded by, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, while the
other component falls under the remit of, and is funded by, the
Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. The components are
obviously split by age and have separate concerns, which is why they
are covered by separate Departments. Apprenticeships are extremely
important and form a central plank of what both Departments are trying
to achieve. As such, we think the dual reporting function to be right
and perfectly
coherent.</div><a name="090310133000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
sector skills councils, it is true that they are not writ large on the
face of the Bill, but that should not leave anybody in any doubt that
they remain at the heart of the system. Part of the Bill refers to the
specification of apprenticeship standards for England, to which sector
skills councils are central. The councils will be responsible for
producing apprenticeship frameworks. That is not in any doubt. It is,
and will remain, the case. As I say, they may not be writ large on the
face of the Bill, because we did not feel that they needed to be, but
nobody should be in any doubt that they are central to the
system.</div><a name="090310133000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> To follow on from that last point, I refer
the Committee to paragraphs 48 and 49 of the explanatory notes, which
explain how the frameworks will work. The Bill sets out the frameworks
and, in describing how they will operate, paragraph 48
says:</div><a name="090310133000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
clauses set out the procedures for the issue of apprenticeship
frameworks, which will be developed by employers, Standard Setting
Bodies and Sector Skills Councils according to the specification of
apprenticeship standards in England and
Wales.&#148;</div><a name="090310133000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
49
says:</div><a name="090310133000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsection
(2)<i class="I"> </i>provides that there is to be only one person authorised to
issue frameworks for a particular apprenticeship sector. The intention
is that, in England, frameworks will be issued by Sector Skills
Councils working in partnership with Standard Setting
Bodies.&#148;</div><a name="090310133000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
could not be any clearer about the pivotal role that sector skills
councils will play in England without unnecessarily fettering them with
legislation. I do not think that they would welcome it hugely if we
started to legislate about how they should
be.</div><a name="090310133000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will make two other points. On there being lines of reporting to two
Secretaries of State, that is simply a function of the 16-to-19
apprenticeships and the adult apprenticeships. The slight majority of
the NAS budget will come from the DCSF. It is right that the chief
executive of the NAS should report to the Secretary of State for
Children, Schools and Families in exchange for that
money.</div><a name="090310133000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the reason why it is right for the NAS to be nested inside the Skills
Funding Agency is that they are both employer-facing bodies. It is
critical that they develop relationships with employers across that
function. They must be able to broker apprenticeship places with
employers at national, regional and local levels. They must also
respond to the skills needs of
employers.</div><a name="090310133000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is entirely coherent to me that there should be an employer-focused
body in the form of the SFA, working under DIUS, that responds to
skills needs and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>demands of adult learners, with that discrete adult focus, and an
apprenticeship body that straddles the two
Departments.</div><a name="090310133000033"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
343</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000421"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> So you contest that our expert witness, who
represented the sector skills councils, was wrong about two things:
first, when he complained that the involvement of LEAs would complicate
the process as far as sector skills councils were concerned, and
secondly, when he explicitly said that one of the advantages of the LSC
was that he dealt with a single body. Sector skills councils will now
have to deal with more bodies, which will confuse and complicate their
role and make it more bureaucratic. We want to be clear about this. We
have already gathered that the Ministers think that the British
Chambers of Commerce was wrong when it represented business. Was the
Alliance of Sector Skills Councils wrong
too?</div><a name="090310133000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Sector skills councils currently deal with
the Learning and Skills Council, but they also deal with my Department
in diploma development. They have several types of relationships in
terms of qualification development. As Si&#244;n and I have set out,
it is clear that the LSC will have a discrete and clear relationship
with the NAS, alongside the sector bodies, in delivering apprenticeship
frameworks in
England.</div><a name="090310133000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> I think that they were a bit miffed and a bit
worried that they were not put more clearly in the Bill. That is why I
am happy to make it clear now that although we did not feel the need to
put sector skills councils in large letters on the face of the Bill,
they are central to the system not just now, but in the
future.</div><a name="090310133000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310133000422"></a>The
Chairman:</b> For the convenience of the Committee, I will say
which hon. Members have indicated that they wish to be called: Stephen
Williams, Nick Gibb, David Laws, Alison Seabeck and Graham Stuart. I
shall call them in that order. If other hon. Members wish to ask
questions, they should indicate that to
me.</div><a name="090310133000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
344</b><a name="090310133000423"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): I have served under your

Humble, and I look forward to serving under you in this more formal
setting.</div><a name="090310133000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will pursue the point of structures, which John Hayes began with. The
Bill will abolish the LSC, but create the YPLA, the SFA and the NAS.
What simpler structures did you consider and why did you rule them
out?</div>
<a name="090310133000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> The only other option given serious
consideration&#151;Si&#244;n will forgive me for responding to
this, because I was around when these debates were taking
place&#151;was whether we had a discrete NAS outside the Skills
Funding Agency. There is merit in having sharply focused separate
bodies, but you do not want them to proliferate out of control. Where
you can see synergy between the functions that could be performed by
what would otherwise be separate bodies, it makes sense to bring them
together. Undoubtedly, in presentational terms, it might have been
easier to have a separate NAS with dual accountability to the
Secretaries of State, and we could all have explained that clearly.
However, in practice, given the relationship with employers that would
be common across the SFA and the NAS, potentially creating more of a
single conversation with employers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>meant that it was worth trying to bring them together to create that
coherence, rather than just making it easier for us to design the
infrastructure.</div><a name="090310133000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
345</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000424"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I can see that there is some logic in a
separation at 19, partly because of the change in the machinery of
government&#151;the two Secretaries of State&#151;and the creation
of the 14-to-19 stage and diplomas. The role of further education
colleges is changing; they help to deliver apprenticeships and other
adult learning courses, and will increasingly be the vehicle for the

Knight:</b></i> Again, we are back to the same discussions
about to what extent bringing them together adds value and to what
extent keeping them separate adds value. The break-up of the LSC into
its three functions, plus the formation of the separate NAS, is quite a
significant shift. Through the Bill, we also split the Qualifications
and Curriculum Authority into the Qualifications and Curriculum
Development Agency and Ofqual. If, at the same time, we had taken the
higher education funding agency and merged it with the SFA, that would
have created a lot of churn all at once. There is merit in proceeding
in the orderly way that we are at the moment.</div>

which I am not equipped to go into in detail, which says that further

are structured and governed very differently? Therefore, although there
are precedents for putting them together, there is a coherent and
cogent argument for keeping them apart.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
348</b><a name="090310133000427"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Can I
ask a couple of quick questions about academies and the YPLA, and then
move on to Ofqual? The letter from Mike Butler of the Independent
Academies Association says in its opening paragraph:</div>
<a name="090310133000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
appears with every consultation, each missive and even new legislation
from the DCSF, there comes further erosion of the independent status of
Academies.&#148;</div><a name="090310133000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
you comment on that? Why was the YPLA chosen to administer the growing
number of academies, given that the YPLA was set up to deal with
16-to-19 funding, yet academies go from 11 to 16 or 18, or even from 3
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>18? It seems an odd body to choose to administer academies. Was it just
an afterthought&#151;it had to be put somewhere so let us put it in
the
YPLA?</div><a name="090310133000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> No. Let me deal with the two. In respect of
the charge in the letter that we are watering things down and reducing
independence, I disagree strongly and I think that the vast majority of
sponsors and principals of academies would also disagree. That was
reflected in the evidence we received from Dan Moynihan and Liz Reid. I
know that unfortunately you had to join a Westminster Hall debate and
were not able to attend that session. I am sure that in the assiduous
way you work, you will have read <i class="I">Hansard </i>and been frustrated at
the lack of quotes you can knock back at me. We have good support for
the moves that we are taking in legislation around behaviour
partnerships, children&#146;s trusts and the YPLA
functions.</div>
<a name="090310133000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
surprised by the letter from Mike Butler because his predecessor as
chair of the IAA had also written to me
saying:</div><a name="090310133000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
IAA...welcome the plans to establish the YPLA and its proposed
role in the administration and support of open

Moynihan
said:</div><a name="090310133000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;With
the growth in the number of academies it seems reasonable to consider a
dedicated support agency for open academies in order to provide first
line
support.&#148;</div><a name="090310133000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
asked whether she was happy that academies would be administered by the
YPLA, Liz Reid
said:</div><a name="090310133000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
makes absolute sense and, as the academies programme continues to grow,
it would be anomalous and unusual for a Department of State to take
direct responsibility for a very large number of
schools.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

</i>3 March 2009; c. 44,
Q109.]</div><a name="090310133000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with all of those comments. By the time the YPLA is properly up
and running, there will be at least 300 academies on our current
projections. I do not think it right that they should be run directly
from my office. It would make us by far the largest education authority
in the country. I already have to deal with a lot of issues in respect
of open academies, and I do not think that is the best strategic use of
a Minister&#146;s and senior officials&#146; time.</div>
<a name="090310133000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to
whether the YPLA is the right body to which to make that transfer, if
you want to manage so many schools at arm&#146;s length, we currently
have somewhere around 20 officials in the Department who are working
just on the funding of open academies&#151;the funding agreements and
so on. The YPLA is principally a funding agency. On the work that we
would transfer over, transfer is probably the wrong word to use in
legal terms because the YPLA would be acting as an agent of the
Secretary of State. So I use the word &#147;transfer&#148; not in
the legal sense of the word but for clarity&#146;s sake. The majority
of officials working on the functions that will move over deal with
funding. The YPLA is principally a funding agency and, therefore, it
seemed to make sense.</div>
<a name="090310133000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
other work in respect of open academies, the YPLA by definition will
have a strong presence regionally, and we want those who are doing
that  work and providing intelligence on how academies are
performing back to the Secretary of State also to have a strong
regional presence. So there seemed to be a really good fit, and a much
better fit than anything else on  the
landscape.</div>

349</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000428"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> We can pursue that as we reach those clauses. Before
we move on to Ofqual, I want to ask about the concern academies have
over discrimination&#151;the funding of the system now, with the LSC
funding coming back to the local authorities. Learning and skills
councils are worried that there will be discrimination against
academies in terms of establishing sixth forms or establishing
academies with sixth forms. Can you comment on that fear and assure
them that there will not be that
discrimination?</div><a name="090310133000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I can assure you, the Committee and the
academies movement that that discrimination will not exist. The
Department will retain the functions for starting new academies. As we
reported in oral questions, since the DCSF was formed we have opened
just over 100 new academies. Those functions will be retained, as will
the functions for closing academies, were that ever to be necessary.
The decisions about whether there is post-16 provision are made on the
basis of feasibility, and the funding agreement is then signed. Those
functions will be retained by the Secretary of State and not
transferred to the YPLA.</div>
<a name="090310133000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the relationship with local authorities, what we do at the moment will
not change. We have discussions with local authorities about the
academies that we agree with will be opened in their areas, and discuss
there and then post-16 provision and how it fits with current provision
on the ground. That would
continue.</div><a name="090310133000059"></a>

the people she had in mind was Professor Timms from Durham university,
who has shown, for example, that students who achieved an E in A-level

you think that there was grade inflation in that period? Secondly,
given that the QCA was divided into two parts, a QCA part and a
regulatory part on different floors of the building&#151;with a
Chinese wall&#151;why did the regulatory part fail to maintain
standards over that period? Was it because you and your ministerial

the context changes over time. I do not

352</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000431"></a>Mr.

grade inflation and you have almost admitted that in your response to
me by saying that exams change over a period and are more accessible
now than 10, 15, 20 or 30 years ago. Therefore, you are saying almost
by definition that there has been grade inflation or an easing of the
rigour of those exams in order to bring in a
wider&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> You cannot have it
both ways. You cannot say that there has been wider access to GCSEs and

maintained.</div><a name="090310133000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

353</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000432"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It is not if you look at the exam scripts. You can
examine how general standards have fallen. A lot of experts, such as
Professor Timms, have said that an E in 1998 is worth a B today. Why
has the QCA allowed that to
happen?</div><a name="090310133000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> Because the examinations are different,
which was the point I was making. It is not a tick-box exercise; you
cannot take one exam from one period and one from another, tick a box
and then say that that applies, because there are so many aspects to
it. Ofqual&#146;s role will be to look at that, and it will use
experts from different countries to come to those conclusions. It is
not as simplistic
as&#151;</div><a name="090310133000072"></a>

355</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000434"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> But the QCA was divided into two departments. Why
was the regulatory bit not doing exactly this kind of rigorous work? Is
it because you as Ministers were telling it not
to?</div><a name="090310133000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

not.</div><a name="090310133000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Can I come in on that? Having been a Minister
a little longer, the accusation of interfering with them might be
levelled at me. That is certainly not the case. I am sure that the
Committee would agree that there is a role for Ministers in agreeing
the content of programmes of study so that, for example, we can ensure
that the holocaust, the slave trade and the world wars are covered in
the history curriculum. I was party to some of the discussions on the
new programmes of study that are being introduced in the GCSE to make
sure that the content reflects our culture, our society and the things
we hold dear.</div>
<a name="090310133000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond that,
we leave it up to the experts to develop those programmes of study, the
awarding bodies to develop the general qualifications and the regulator
to regulate them. The QCA&#146;s regulatory role has been done pretty
well by and large, but there is merit in having independence from
Government. The QCA is just a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>non-departmental public body and Ofqual would be a non-ministerial
department. The public can see that the regulator is completely
separate from Government. There is no question that there has been any
kind of interference through the NDPB
route.</div><a name="090310133000078"></a>

terms of the regulatory function that was carried out, but we have to
satisfy the public debate and try to move on from the nonsense about
dumbing down which plagues young people every summer. They are proud of
their achievements at GCSE and A-level, which are undermined by a
public debate that struggles to get away from saying that standards
have fallen. Thanks to the best learning environments and more of the

risen.</div><a name="090310133000080"></a>

<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Okay, I accept that&#151;that is
my view. I do not believe you are interfering in the regulatory side of
the QCA. It would not allow it. We have had discussions with the
regulatory side of the QCA and they made it very clear what Ministers
could and could not do, but what will change in terms of methodology
when Ofqual is established? Will this be just a PR exercise to assure
the public of something, because if the methodology is not changed the
same thing will happen with a 1998 E grade becoming a B? Why will that
not continue for the next 10 years if nothing is going to change in
terms of the methodology? That  is my

its qualifications standards

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
359</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000439"></a>Mr.

exams change over a period? There is a quote from Kathleen
Tattersall<i class="I"> </i>saying that with all the modernisation and these
other changes, it is almost impossible to compare one type of exam with
another. Given her comment and your comments about why it is perfectly
acceptable for an E grade in 1998 to be a B grade in 2004, why will
that process not continue, even though Ofqual has these new powers to
order the exam boards
around?</div><a name="090310133000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim

is acceptable for a B and an E to be equivalent. The clue is in the
name. The &#147;general&#148; in the general certificate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>of secondary education is there because these are qualifications which,
unlike the O-levels I took when I was at school, are there to assess
the academic performance of the full range of ability. You will get
some easy questions, which are easy to quote at the Dispatch Box and
make everybody laugh, but they are there to assess whether someone is
at an E or an F. There are also questions that are really tough, which
are there to assess whether someone is at an A or an A*. That is the
dishonesty in this debate, and the suggestion that easy questions are
plucked out of thin air. That is to misunderstand completely the
general nature of general qualifications.</div>

360</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000440"></a>Mr.

a B.</div>
<a name="090310133000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I
want to move on, and I have a final couple of questions. What are you
doing to ensure that the board members of Ofqual are independent, not
just of ministerial interference and Government but, more importantly,
of people who might benefit from a downgrading of the exams, for
example professors of education who train teachers, as well as
teachers, head teachers and former head teachers, who want to
demonstrate that standards have not fallen, and whose career might
benefit from that? How will you ensure that board members do not have
that conflict of interest, while retaining
expertise?</div><a name="090310133000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> It would not be in anybody&#146;s
interests for Ofqual to have board members who were not independent or
who were not seen to be independent. The normal rules for public sector
appointments apply, and the process of appointment will be regulated by
the Office of the Public Sector Standards Commissioner. It will be key
to Ofqual&#146;s credibility to ensure that, as I say, those board
members are not just independent but are seen to be
independent.</div>

the Minister.</div>
<a name="090310133000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
put one final question to either Minister. The international general
certificate of secondary education is interested, as the Minister for
Schools and Learners was just saying, in all-ability exams. As he
knows, of course, the IGCSE is a GCSE; it is an all-ability exam.
However, he refuses to fund it in state schools. Surely, if he wants to
decrease the apartheid between the independent and state sectors he
will allow this all-ability exam to be taught in schools in the state
sector that want to use
it.</div><a name="090310133000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I am not going to start to regulate what
independent schools can and cannot do in respect of the awards that
they put their pupils in for. Unless I were to do that, the inference
of the approach that you are setting out is that we will always be led
by independent schools: if I am not going to tell them what to do, they
will go off in a particular direction and go for the pre-U, the IGCSE,
the AQA Bac, or whatever latest wheeze comes out of the awarding
bodies. Then, to prevent an &#147;apartheid&#148;, I have to
follow, regarding the exams that the vast majority of pupils in this
country take in maintained schools.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div><a name="090310133000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you have
an assumption that everything that the independent school sector does
is always, by definition, going to be right, you might want to do that.
There are great strengths in the independent sector&#151;and I am
very keen on strong partnerships between state-maintained schools and
the independent sector&#151;but that does not mean that independent
schools have a veto on wisdom.</div>
<a name="090310133000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our job is
to ensure that the general qualifications that are taken at 16 and 18
are fit for purpose. We continue to look carefully at that, across the
range of subjects. Occasionally, there is a need to challenge the
people who work with us on developing the exams, in the QCA, or there
is a need for regulators to challenge how well they are working at the
other end, in respect of individual subjects. However, that does not
mean that we rush off to do something else.</div>
<a name="090310133000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have set
up a process for qualifications. If the IGCSE, as an international
qualification, wants to go through the process of, first, conforming to
the national curriculum and, secondly, satisfying the process in
respect of whether or not it is funded, then it will be funded. That is
a transparent process. However, I reject the notion that we should
always be led by a sector over which we have no regulatory
control.</div>

Humble.</div><a name="090310133000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Picking
up Jim&#146;s last answer, I must say that I thought it was probably
his least convincing one. Surely the issue with IGCSEs is not whether
the Government are going to oblige the maintained sector to use them
but whether they will enable it to use those qualifications if it
chooses to do so, which is a very different
thing.</div><a name="090310133000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> In terms of the process that it has gone
through, is the IGCSE as an international qualification, subject by
subject, conforming to the national curriculum? As I understand it, the
IGCSE that is most popular with independent schools is maths, which
does not have a non-calculator paper, so all the assessment is done
using a calculator. We have decided that to test mental arithmetic and
get people to really understand the processes they go through in maths,
it is appropriate to have a non-calculator paper so that there is not
conformity. Obviously, if the two awarding bodies that do IGCSEs want
to make some changes&#151;I think that the Cambridge board is
developing something called the CIE&#151;and come up with something
that conforms, they can go through that process. That is up to those
awarding
bodies.</div><a name="090310133000100"></a>

which the Secretary of State might choose to specify</div>

McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I certainly agree that Shakespeare is
an important part of our history, and I would be deeply concerned if
his works were not part of our general qualifications. That is one
example. To give you some comfort, the Secretary of State has said
publicly that he will put a memorandum of understanding in place with
Ofqual setting out a clear process to ensure that we do not compromise
the independence of the regulator, which might be a

state that Ofqual&#146;s

372</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000455"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> But why not allow it to be the true standards
regulator, as the Government have at times presented it? The other day
in the House, Ed Balls said that Ministers will not have to get
bothered to intervene in the national debate that we have every August
and September, because Ofqual will be able to make definitive judgments
about what has happened to standards. Yet you are stopping it from
being a body that can monitor education standards as a whole. That
seems
unbelievable.</div><a name="090310133000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> We are using the qualifications system
as a method of regulating standards across qualifications. We use
Ofsted as the mechanism for regulating and inspecting what happens in
schools. If we introduced a wider remit for Ofqual, we would risk
blurring the edges with
Ofsted.</div><a name="090310133000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim

well as the school-by-school and institution-by-institution reports,
Ofsted does inspections over a series of institutions looking at how
they deliver English or citizenship, for
example.</div><a name="090310133000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
373</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000456"></a>Mr.

on what has happened to educational standards over long periods in a
way that would allow it to participate in the annual debate about
dumbing
down.</div><a name="090310133000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> When you look at the chief inspector&#146;s
annual report and some of the thematic studies, you will see that it
makes some of those judgments. The dumbing down nonsense that we get
every summer is about whether or not qualifications have become easier.
That is what Ofqual was set up explicitly to
address.</div>
<a name="090310133000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
374</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000457"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> If that is true, why does paragraph 250
of the Select Committee report state that the  Government have
failed through these changes to address the issue of standards? It
says:</div><a name="090310133000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the context of the current testing system, with its ever-changing
curriculum and endless test reforms, no regulator, however independent,
can assure assessment standards as they are not capable of accurate
measurement using the data
available.&#148;</div><a name="090310133000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to recommend that the Government allow for standardised sample
testing for monitoring purposes, for example by Ofqual. First, do you
accept the criticism that simply looking at qualifications gives rise
to that problem? Secondly, is there any reason why Ofqual, as you have
established it, should not do that sample
testing?</div><a name="090310133000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
375</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000458"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Look at the latter bit of it. It makes a serious
point about people&#146;s inability to be sure that the results from
qualifications tell us something about standards. We carry on having
this debate because the majority of people in this country believe the
concerns that are reflected in the
report.</div><a name="090310133000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I am not sure that they do. As Ministers, we
want to decide whether it is appropriate to hold standardised sampling
tests whereby the same test is taken every year by different cohorts of
children.</div><a name="090310133000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
376</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000459"></a>Mr.

are you
not?</div><a name="090310133000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Let me just finish making the point. I do not
know whether it does, but in its independence, Ofqual might want to do
that to satisfy its functions. However, you must bear in mind the
burden that that would place on schools. We participate in the
programme for international student assessment, the progress in
international reading literacy study and the trends in international
mathematics and science study, which are international comparison
studies. Those studies perform a similar function in benchmarking how
we are doing in the subjects that they assess. I am not sure whether a
sufficient amount would be gained by doing the standard sampling tests
that the Select Committee
advocates.</div><a name="090310133000136"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
378</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000461"></a>Mr.

time.</div><a name="090310133000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim

those, we have SATs at the end of key stage 2, teacher assessments at
the end of key stages 1 and 3, GCSEs at the end of key stage 4 and
advanced-level qualifications at the end of key stage 5. There is a
debate on whether there is too much or not enough testing, and I think
that we have got the balance about
right.</div><a name="090310133000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

that is the best

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
379</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000462"></a>Mr.

Under clause 229, are you going to expand the powers to search to cover
illegal drugs, alcohol and stolen property, but not hard
pornography?</div><a name="090310133000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> No.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div><a name="090310133000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
383</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000466"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> So you think that head teachers and schoolteachers
should not have the power to search for hard
pornography?</div><a name="090310133000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> It is a choice between not making a
prescriptive list covering absolutely everything that you would not
want schoolchildren to have and a balanced power. We believe that the
additional powers covering drugs, alcohol and stolen goods are
appropriate.</div><a name="090310133000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
384</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000467"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Do you not think that many parents will be shocked
and disturbed? I understand the problem that you are trying to deal
with, but by prescribing those particular areas you are effectively
being explicit about something that most parents would think was
intolerable and that teachers should be able to search for&#151;hard
pornography&#151;and preventing that area from being looked
at.</div><a name="090310133000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>We have data suggesting
that drugs, alcohol and stolen goods are in schools, but we do not at
this stage have evidence that there is a significant problem with hard
pornography being taken into schools. We can extend powers further if a
justifiable need occurs, but at this stage we do not believe that that
is required. We are following the recommendations from Sir Alan
Steer&#146;s report, and we believe that additional powers to search
drugs, alcohol and stolen goods are sufficient at present. That does
not rule out searching for other items in the
future.</div><a name="090310133000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
385</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000468"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Last question. The one area that the unions are
united in their concern about the Bill&#151;or one of the many areas
of concern, I should say, before the Minister looks too happy&#151;is
that of powers in relation to complaints. The unions are worried that
the powers could lead to a big increase in complaints and that they
could be very bureaucratic. In taking the complaints power away from
the Secretary of State, which seems quite sensible, did you consider
any other options? Did you consider leaving the power with local
government, for example, rather than following the necessarily more
onerous ombudsman process, or were there any other options that you
considered that would not lead to the level of concern expressed by the
union
heads?</div><a name="090310133000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> The consultation included the local authority
option. As Clem Henricson told us during her evidence&#151;I have
read other consultation responses, too&#151;there seems to be a
general endorsement of the local government ombudsman as an appropriate
and sufficiently independent body. It is certainly preferable to the
local authority doing it. I completely agree with Clem
Henricson&#146;s assessment, and as parliamentarians we all have some
experience of dealing with ombudsmen and referring constituents&#146;
complaints to them. I am sure we would all agree that they are set up
to do a good
job.</div><a name="090310133000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
386</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000469"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> They do a very good job, but are you not concerned
that schools, anticipating that the ombudsman service may be used
greatly in future, may have to take on a great deal more reporting to
anticipate problems that may arise? That applies not only when an event
occurs and schools have to take action or exclude someone, but also to
cases when in which they see a problem with a pupil building up and
they know that it could end up in a referral to an ombudsman. Is there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>not a danger that, in having a meticulous and bureaucratic process, we
are going to place the type of burden on schools that you heard the
teaching unions are very concerned
about?</div><a name="090310133000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> No, I do not believe that it will add a huge
layer of bureaucracy. I hope that it ensures that schools, governing
bodies and leadership teams have their minds focused on the importance
of the home-school relationship. That is a positive, very good thing,
very much in the spirit of the public service reform paper published by
the Prime Minister today. It needs to be done in such a way. We will
issue guidance to schools about how they should set out a complaints
process and, as long as that process has been properly followed by the
school&#151;in terms of handling a complaint&#151;then they have
nothing to worry about from the local government ombudsman. The
ombudsman is already very experienced in dealing with vexatious
complaints and dismissing them very quickly. The point at which the LGO
becomes exercised and reports against a body, is when schools have not
followed the process that they have agreed they will
follow.</div><a name="090310133000158"></a>

Simon:</b></i> Obviously, there is bound to be a bit of it,
but I hope that we are not going to get into just trading quotes. As
you said, John Lucas, on behalf of the BCC, thought that the system
would be too bureaucratic, but under repeated questioning from me, he
was absolutely unable to give a single piece of evidence to show that
it would, in any way, be more
bureaucratic.</div><a name="090310133000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

not?</div><a name="090310133000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> He said that he would write. If he has
written, I have not seen anything yet, although to be fair to him it
would be a big ask for him to have written by now. He and the BCC are
wrong about this. On the other hand, the CBI said that, regarding the
transition, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>there was no evidence at the moment of a disruption to service. On the
rest of that aspect of the Bill, although I am not going to pretend
that it was a head-over-heels cheerleader for the measures, it
was&#151;and is&#151;not demonstrably opposed to any of the
substantive measures that we are taking. What it has expressed are some
reservations that it might be too bureaucratic. It is not opposed to
any of the things that we are
doing.</div><a name="090310133000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
389</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000472"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> No one, probably, is opposed to the aims. One of
the fears of the Bill is the picture it paints of employer engagement,
apprenticeships for all, and many other aspects. Those are aims that
everyone can buy into. It is when you go into the mechanics of the Bill
that some people worry that there is a mismatch between the
two.</div>
<a name="090310133000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The subject
of employers takes us neatly on to the subject of apprenticeships. Why
did you decide to give this statutory right to apprenticeships? It
sends out a promise of the offer, of two places within a reasonable
travel to work distance, when all previous efforts&#151;and I am sure
that they have been genuine&#151;but every previous Government
announcement about targets has been missed. Therefore, is there not a
danger that you are sending out&#151;cynics would say that you are
trying to capture a headline&#151;a promise that you cannot deliver,
as you do not have the mechanics in place to deliver it. I suppose that
links to the employers&#146; evidence. They believe that the system
will be too bureaucratic. Would you not be wiser to work hard at
establishing the mechanics of delivering more apprenticeships rather
than going for a headline promise that you cannot be sure of
delivering?</div><a name="090310133000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> Jim will talk about the entitlement. However,
as far as employers are concerned, the Bill sets up a much clearer and
simpler system, with two employer gateways&#151;although I do not
like that term&#151;in Train to Gain and the NAS. In the NAS, there
is a newly dedicated group of people whose job is solely to make it
easier for employers to set up and run apprenticeships, and in the new
structure for the apprenticeship system, including the statutory basis
that we are putting it on in the first part of the Bill, we are very
conscious throughout that everything that we are doing will be
smoother, easier and more responsive to employers. When we get into the
detail in the line-by-line consideration of the Bill, I genuinely think
that that is what will emerge and I hope that, as we go through the
Bill, his view might
soften.</div><a name="090310133000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me just say, in response to the point about what he perceives as a gap
between the ambition and the high-level structure on the one hand and
the likely delivery on the other hand, there is a danger that it
appears that way when talking about this Bill, because much of the
detail of the delivery mechanisms is not in the Bill. Indeed, strictly
speaking it does not require primary legislation; we are legislating
because we think that it is so important and because it is such a major
part of the economy, and therefore the very broad structure should be
in the Bill. However, it is a broad structure and much of the detail
will emerge when&#151;Jim wanted to talk about the entitlement, I
think.</div><a name="090310133000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Let me come in on that part of the question,
Graham. First, I want to talk in respect of missing targets and that
aspect of the question. We are on course to meet our target of 130,000
completions by 2010-11. Completions have more than trebled from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>39,000 in 2001-02 to more than 113,000 last year. We have rescued and
expanded apprenticeships since 1997, when only 65,000 people started an
apprenticeship, and 225,000 people started an apprenticeship in
2007-08, which is a record number and an increase of 22 per cent. on
the year before.</div>

390</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000473"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> You have missed the headline targets, have you
not?</div><a name="090310133000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> What the apprenticeship entitlement and the
guarantee that is set out in the Bill will do is so&#151;to describe
it as just trying to grab headlines is very disparaging about the
effect of legislation. To put this duty on the chief executive of the
Skills Funding Agency to deliver through the NAS means that he must
ensure that the huge expansion in funding that we are putting into
apprenticeships, to more than &#163;1 billion during this financial
year, is deployed in such a way that when young people who are suitably
qualified choose two sectors that they want an apprenticeship in within
a reasonable travel time&#151;that will be different according to
which sectors they choose, because if you are in Northamptonshire, for
example, and you want to work in the marine sector, then a reasonable
travel time is different to the reasonable travel time involved if you
wanted to work in the hair and beauty sector&#151;the provision is
there.</div>
<a name="090310133000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of
schemes such as the national apprenticeship vacancy matching service,
which is being established and began operating in January, and the
level of engagement with employers that the chief executive will have
to ensure exists, will provide the supply of places. In particular, the
drive that we now have regarding public sector apprenticeships, which
have lagged behind the private sector historically for some time, will
be critical in delivering that. The fact that we, as a Government, are
legislating for ourselves to deliver something is some guarantee to the
system that we will do
so.</div><a name="090310133000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
391</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000474"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I suppose that is the problem. I think you are
slightly disingenuous in your answer because the Prime Minister has
spoken at various  times of 200,000, 300,000 or 400,000 people
having apprenticeships. The headline figures that he said have not been
met. That is not to disregard the efforts that have been made. No one
would complain about what you are talking of, in terms of trying to
drive new systems with additional funding in order to get more people
into apprenticeships. However, you are talking about a national
apprenticeship service and a Skills Funding Agency that do not yet
exist. These are new institutions that have yet to be established,
while we have a track record of lagging behind the aspiration the
Government have rightly had. I come back to my question. Why lay down
the statutory right when you do not have proven organisations&#151;in
fact, they are all being set up&#151;to deliver it? Is there not a
danger of making a false promise and would that not be a great
shame?</div><a name="090310133000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I know that you were not on the Education and
Skills Bill Committee last year to vote against the raising of the
participation age. But that, in a similar way, set out in legislation
that we were going to do this. There were consequences that we are
legislating on in this Bill, that are required in order to enable us to
achieve that. It is well established that we would set out a duty, such
as the one we are setting out to deliver the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>apprenticeship guarantee in order to reconfigure the system and make
people want to do it. We have already appointed the chief executive of
the NAS. We have already got the national vacancy matching service up
and running. We are on target to deliver 35,000 extra apprenticeship
places in the next year, in large part because of what we are doing in
the public sector and the spending of an extra &#163;140 million.
That is using the existing structures we have in place and
anticipating, subject to parliamentary approval, what will happen in
this
Bill.</div><a name="090310133000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
392</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000475"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> If I may move on to the subject of Ofqual and its
independence. The Ministers were here last week when I questioned an
organisation whose board is appointed by the Secretary of State, whose
chairman is appointed by the Crown and thus effectively the Secretary
of State, who can only be removed by the Secretary of State and who
receives a budget set by the Secretary of State. It is hard to see how
the public are going to view that as entirely independent. While
answering that, would he follow up on earlier questions from my
colleagues about the character of the people on it? It is not about the
process by which they are appointed being relatively independent; it is
about making sure that the educational establishment and spokespeople
for it do not entirely dominate an independent standards body that is
supposed to be there on behalf of the whole
country.</div><a name="090310133000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I come back to the point I made to your
colleague. The independent process is part of it. As I said then, it is
in no one&#146;s interest for Ofqual not to be seen to be
independent.</div>
<a name="090310133000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
393</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000476"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Is it
independent?</div><a name="090310133000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> Of course it is. It is very similar in
its structure to Ofsted, and we consider Ofsted to be independent. We
cite Ofsted and use it as an independent inspector. It is very similar
in the way it has been set up. We will demonstrate that it will be
independent. As in many of these cases, the proof will be when we see
it in
action.</div><a name="090310133000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
394</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000477"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Can I move on neatly to the subject of
accountability to Parliament? As you will have seen, a number of
witnesses expressed concern about the way that Ofqual will be held
accountable by Parliament. I recognise the need not to legislate, to
give duties to Select Committees and so on, but would you spell out
what confidence you can give to those with doubts, about how you feel
it can be made accountable to Parliament and thus bolster its perceived
independence?</div><a name="090310133000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> As Ofqual will be reporting to
Parliament it will be for Parliament to decide the process of how that
reporting mechanism works. I imagine it would be similar to Ofsted, in
that I would expect the Select Committee to play a large part in
similar ways but that will be for Parliament not Ministers to
decide.</div><a name="090310133000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
395</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000478"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I ask one last question? On the topic of
children&#146;s trusts, the Audit Commission report last October said
that</div><a name="090310133000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is little evidence that children&#146;s trusts, as required by the
government, have improved outcomes for children and young people or
delivered better value for money&#148;.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div><a name="090310133000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, it is peculiar,
having had that independent assessment, that Ministers are now deciding
to put them on a statutory footing, without addressing in the Bill any
of the points made in the report, including the fact that
representatives are turning up for the meetings but do not bring
authority or budget with them and that the joint commissioning that
might have been hoped for from children&#146;s trusts is not being
delivered. Will you put our minds at rest and tell us why we should
believe that putting them on a statutory footing will address the
problems that the Audit Commission so clearly
identified?</div><a name="090310133000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> The Audit Commission did that work
between November 2007 and January 2008, so by the time the work was
published a lot of it was out of date. There was a rapidly developing
policy field and a lot of the changes were made in response to
consultation with local authorities on what they wanted to do. The
Audit Commission report also had many very good examples of good
practice around the country&#151;where the mechanism has
delivered&#151;and a statutory footing will enable us to have
consistency across the country. One thing we will put in guidance is
exactly the point that you are making about the accountability of the
representations on the board, and how we gauge
that.</div><a name="090310133000187"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I refer you, Graham, to the evidence given by
Clem Henricson from the Family and Parenting Institute. She was asked a
very similar question about the relationship with the Audit Commission
report and
said:</div><a name="090310133000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
would say that a significant contribution to them not working is that
they have not been implemented in some areas. That was because they
were not put on a statutory footing in the first place.&#148;<i class="I">

396</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000479"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I think that that was a misunderstanding on her
behalf. A statutory footing does not address the problems in the Audit
Commission report. To trade quotes&#151;this is useful for the
record&#151;the National Union of Teachers has expressed some
reservations about making children&#146;s trust boards statutory. It
has reservations
about</div><a name="090310133000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;giving
more power to...unaccountable local
quangos&#148;.</div><a name="090310133000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,

Knight:</b></i> I will remember your response that there has
clearly been a misunderstanding if further quotes come forward. I
always treat with a certain amount of suspicion certain parties in the
House quoting the NUT, with which they would not otherwise agree about
anything. I disagree. It is really important that we have that
co-operation between schools and children&#146;s trust arrangements
if we genuinely are going to join up services for children and
intervene earlier to secure better outcomes for those
children.</div><a name="090310133000191"></a>

397</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000480"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am trying to tease out, as Clem Henricson does
in that quote, in what way a statutory footing will ensure that the
issues raised by the Audit Commission are tackled. That is the key
question. If all the problems could be removed by putting them on a
statutory footing that would be great, and we could have widespread
support for it. But I cannot see the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>connection between making the boards statutory and the problems being
tackled.</div><a name="090310133000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I think that it is also their statutory
responsibilities for the children and young people&#146;s plan. They
will have to produce an annual report and their activities can be
inspected under sections 20 to 22 of the Children Act 2004. By putting
these regulations in place, the children&#146;s trust boards will
become accountable because they will be on a statutory

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. I will start
with a question about the powers of restraint. Two out of three of the
union representatives told us that such powers were unnecessary, that
there is professionalism and good practice. I have looked at the
non-statutory guidance and must admit that it is quite comprehensive.
So why do you need to make this a statutory requirement and put
pressure on people, who will worry that there will be extra
bureaucracy?</div><a name="090310133000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> We are not changing the powers of
restraint. We are putting in the Bill the requirement to record the use
of force in schools. That is just an extension of our partnership with
parents and the wider community. That will not put a huge additional
burden on schools; many schools do it anyway. It is recognition of best
practice, and recognition that school is not separate from parents. We
all have a duty to look after children. I would be unhappy if I thought
that schools were not recording that and not reporting back to
parents.</div>

on Thursday was that Sir Alan had been advised by the Department that
it was not appropriate, which is not quite in line with your earlier
answer on why there was not a more general search. It would be useful
for the Committee to have the details of why the decision on the more
general search was made before we reach that part of the Bill. Would it
be possible to have the details?</div>
<a name="090310133000203"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> As the Committee knows, a statement on
compliance has to be made under section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights
Act 1998 with every piece of legislation. In this regard, it is about
whether it is justifiable and proportionate to have a general search
power. In respect of David&#146;s question about pornography, we
would all have concerns about young people bringing pornography into a
school. They may bring it in on a computer&#151;a laptop, for
example&#151;so do we extend the powers to schools so that they can
search a computer for material? Could we do so in a way that would be
justifiable and proportionate? There are difficult questions around how
you draw the line and make those judgments about proportionality in

407</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000491"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Well, at the moment the Children Act 2004 gives a
clear line of responsibility to the director of children&#146;s
services and the lead member. I do not see that single point of
accountability with the children and young people&#146;s plan. I
would like to push you a bit more. It appears that the responsibility
goes to different people for each section of it. But when the chips are
down, will it not be easier for someone to say, &#147;Oh,
that&#146;s not me, that&#146;s
health&#148;?</div><a name="090310133000218"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> All the partners are accountable for
agreeing and implementing their plan. The individual partners are
responsible and accountable for delivering their part of the plan. That
is why they have to produce an annual report. That annual report will
have to set out how the implementation of the plan has been delivered.
As I said in answer to a previous question, their activities can be
inspected under sections 20 to 22 of the Children Act. If there are any
concerns, there is the eventual power of the Secretary of State to
intervene on a local authority if the plan either does not exist or is
not being implemented properly.</div>

the Children Act was knowing the person who held the position who was

Parliament&#146;s ability to scrutinise the Bill properly. This
Committee has to have proper notice of amendments, so that it can
scrutinise them properly. We do not want to bog the Bill down. Clearly,
if there were things that needed urgent legislation, we would have to

that.</div><a name="090310133000224"></a>

410</b><a name="090310133000494"></a><b class="B">Jeff
Ennis</b> (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab): I suppose I
should welcome you to the Chair, Mrs Humble, seeing as everybody else
has. My first question has been answered. It related to the
accountability of Ofqual, through Parliament. I certainly support the
model that Sarah mentioned of having a similar situation for Ofqual as
we have for Ofsted through the Select Committee. Moving on to an area
that we have not considered yet, the evidence from my old trade union,
the NASUWT, was very negative about the establishment of the Young
People&#146;s Learning Agency. It seemed to say that this is a
wasteful tier of bureaucracy and that the functions of the YPLA could
be subsumed into the responsibilities of the local authority.
Presumably that particular model was looked at before the decision was
taken?</div><a name="090310133000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Yes. Obviously, you do not set up a new
agency without ensuring that it is justified. If you did not have an
agency there and you established sub-regional groupings of local
authorities for post-16 commissioning, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>and that sub-regional grouping could not reach agreement about an aspect
of commissioning, you would still need an external person or body to
intervene&#151;</div><a name="090310133000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Ennis:</b> Or your Department,
Jim.</div><a name="090310133000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> It could be done at a departmental level, but
that would mean expanding Government office functions much further so
that there is knowledge of what is happening on the ground. There are
also funding functions. It could be done in-house, but there would have
to be a large number of people in-house. Should it be done in-house or
at arm&#146;s length? Given the administrative nature of this, it is
desirable to have it at arm&#146;s length and to achieve efficiencies
through that separation. There could be a board that drives
efficiencies in that aspect of the
organisation.</div><a name="090310133000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is disagreement between us and the NASUWT over whether academies should
be independent of local authorities. We would have given in to the
charge of watering down the independence of academies if we had handed
over their performance management and funding to local authorities. We
did not want to do
that.</div><a name="090310133000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
412</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000496"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> That to some extent answers my supplementary
question. It appears that the existence of academies has been a
complicating factor in terms of taking the decision away from local
authorities.</div><a name="090310133000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I have given separate reasons why I feel that
the YPLA is justified. Only one of those relates to academies. When
replying to Nick I set out why I think that it is appropriate to have
300&#151;growing to 400&#151;academies in an organisation that is
at arm&#146;s length from Ministers and Government. I have also said
why the YPLA is the right organisation to do that. Those reasons are
separate from why it is right to set up an agency for the post-16
funding
role.</div><a name="090310133000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
413</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000497"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> In an earlier answer, you mentioned that you would
support greater collaboration between the independent sector and the
state education sector. I have no problems with that. Presumably, that
principle applies to academies being part of clusters of schools within
LEAs.</div><a name="090310133000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> We are saying exactly that in respect of
behaviour partnerships. We think it is equally important that all
academies co-operate with children&#146;s trust arrangements. We see
the importance of partnership. Indeed, in the witness sessions, when
asked how many academies are in behaviour partnerships, Liz Reid
said:</div><a name="090310133000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is the vast majority&#151;94 per cent. is normally quoted. That tells
you a good deal about academies&#146; desire to be part of those
local arrangements...Academies have a large proportion of
vulnerable and disadvantaged children on their rolls. It is in their
interests as well as everybody else&#146;s to be part of those
partnerships.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
414</b><a name="090310133000498"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I believe that
successful head teachers should be respected and slightly feared.
Surely, if a head teacher feels that something is being brought into
his or her school  that threatens its equilibrium, they should
be allowed  to initiate a search. I am still not sure why the
Bill is  so prescriptive over what items a head teacher
may  search for.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div><a name="090310133000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I think that we are going over old
ground here. We want to get a sense of proportion. We certainly do not
think that there should be a general power to search. Who will decide
what is being searched for? We have to avoid making our schools places
in which any child can be searched for anything. You have to have a
proportionate response to concerns. We have evidence to suggest that
drugs, alcohol and stolen goods are in schools and we have included the
recommendation in the Bill. We are not ruling out extending the things
that can be searched for if the circumstances arise. From the advice we
have been given, I do not think that we would be compliant if we gave a
general power to schools to search any child for
anything.</div><a name="090310133000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> With regard to some of the other issues that
have been raised perfectly legitimately, we would expect schools to use
their other powers and their home-school relationships to address
concerns, because no one wants to see pornography, for example, in
schools. If a school believed that someone was bringing in pornography,
we would expect it to act and not to ignore it, but we would expect it
to tackle it in other
ways.</div><a name="090310133000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
415</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000499"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I am sorry if we are going over old ground, but
this is the first chance I have had to go over it. Head teachers should
be allowed to use their professional judgment. They are responsible for
running a school and looking after the youngsters who go to it. I feel
very sympathetic with you as Ministers getting caught up in the Human
Rights Act 1998, but I firmly believe that if a head teacher feels that
a child needs to be searched we should support that head teacher once
that search is initiated and after it has happened. Surely head
teachers are there to run schools, and I am really concerned that your
lawyers at the Ministry have advised you that that might somehow breach
children&#146;s human rights. Perhaps you could explore that a little
more closely with the
Committee.</div><a name="090310133000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> Children have human rights as much as
adults do, and it comes down to the fact of it being proportionate. I
would not welcome a sweeping power to search any child in a
school.</div><a name="090310133000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
416</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000500"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Children do not have human rights as much as
adults do. I tell my children where they are going to school, what time
they are going to bed, when they will do their homework and what they
are having for supper. You just cannot argue that children have the
same human rights as adults do, because their lives tend to be governed
by adults for their own safety and well-being. I am concerned that you
have received advice from your lawyers stating that it is all right to
search for guns, knives or whatever, but that we suddenly get into a
whole area of difficulty with other things, and I cannot understand why
that distinction is being made.</div>
<a name="090310133000239"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> There is a balance to be struck. The reason
why the human rights legislation is there in the first place is to ask
us as parliamentarians and Ministers to pause and check that it is
justifiable to interfere with a student&#146;s rights, such as the
rights of the privacy of the person. If we deem it justifiable,
necessary and proportionate to do so, we will bring forward
legislation, but I share Sarah&#146;s concern about the general stop
and search power. The question of whether the police should have the
power to stop and search on our streets has been much debated in this
House over many years. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>you were to extend stop and search into our schools, you would do so
very deliberately on the basis of real concerns that have been
expressed. Those concerns have not been expressed, so we do not have
the justification to interfere with those rights. If the justification
were made, we would legislate to do
that.</div><a name="090310133000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
417</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000501"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Children are naughty and like to get away with
things, which is good and shows character and spirit. I always assumed,
perhaps wrongly, that if a head teacher thought some mischief was going
on they had the right to intervene and say, &#147;Right, turn out
your pockets and show me what is in your locker.&#148; We have of
course gone beyond that with computers, but if the head teacher
believed that there was some mischief going on with a laptop, for
example, surely they should be allowed to check that out. It does not
have to be pornography; it could be cyberbullying or all sorts of
things that are computer generated. I just feel that we are
constraining teachers from getting to the bottom of things very
quickly.</div><a name="090310133000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> If a head teacher had those concerns, it
would be really important to discuss them with parents. My expectation
is that parents would then carry out those searches on the equipment,
which is probably their
property.</div><a name="090310133000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
418</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000502"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> But we have heard evidence from members of trade
unions suggesting that if they break up a fight between two children
who are beating each other up, nine times out of 10 they will get a
complaint from a parent because their poor child has been discriminated
against by teachers. You are saying parents will act responsibly, but
people have given us evidence suggesting that parents are all too
willing to take their child&#146;s side, regardless of the evidence
that their child had been
misbehaving.</div><a name="090310133000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I think that it is possible completely to
exaggerate parents&#146; willingness to co-operate with schools. Head
teachers can, of course, search with consent. If we try to separate
schools off from home too much, we are going down a very dangerous
path. Children are only in school for 15 per cent. of the time, so we
need a better relationship between home and school. We need schools to
be properly engaged with parents, not only so that children achieve
their full potential&#151;we know that the biggest single determinant
of a child&#146;s success in education is the support that they get
at home&#151;but in respect of behaviour. We are systematically
trying to work through how to engage parents more in those issues, from
the expansion of children&#146;s centres in early years, through into
school with the development of extended services&#151;as I set out in
an oral answer yesterday in the Commons&#151;and then with things
like personal tutors, real-time reporting and the roll-out of home
access.</div><a name="090310133000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the answer is yes to being proportionate in school and giving head
teachers the powers that they are asking for, but also to having
schools work more closely with home. What was apparent when I went to
Alan Steer&#146;s school, when he was head teacher at Seven Kings in
Ilford, was the absolute mutual respect that was shared between pupils
and staff and the really strong relationship that he had with
parents.</div><a name="090310133000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
419</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000503"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Returning to apprenticeships, most of us want to be
clear about the record. I appreciate that Ministers do not like us
using average numbers of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>apprenticeships as a measure of whether the numbers are increasing or
falling, even though that is how such judgments have historically been
made. The latest Learning and Skills Council figures show that there is
a problem with the number of apprenticeship starts. According to those
figures, fewer people are starting apprenticeships than in 2003-04, and
there is certainly a problem with the number of level 3
apprenticeships. We know that there has been a continuing issue about
getting the number of level 3 apprenticeships up to scratch. Is it not
basically confusing to have the Skills Funding Agency as both a
curriculum body that creates apprenticeship standards, and a funding
body? Would it not have been better to leave the responsibility for
establishing the frameworks with the National Apprenticeship Service,
given that it has responsibility for modelling
apprenticeship?</div><a name="090310133000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not understand how this system will work, and nor do employers. You
heard what the employers said about it. There is scepticism about an
entitlement that will not be realised. There is no use in telling me
that I have an entitlement to milk and honey if the honey has run out
and the milk has gone sour. This is creating a false promise&#151;it
cannot be delivered. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and
Holderness said, the Prime Minister has talked on various occasions,
first as Chancellor and now as Prime Minister, about extraordinary
numbers of apprenticeships&#151;300,000, 400,000 and 500,000 are on
record. We will not reach those targets, so what is the entitlement
really about and why is the management of apprenticeships as set out in
the Bill so
convoluted?</div><a name="090310133000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> First, I hope that we are not going to go over
and over the numbers issue. The short answer is no, we have not missed
any headline targets and we are on track to hit or exceed all of our
future targets. John said that we do not like to talk about average
numbers, although that is how numbers were historically recorded. The
truth is that under previous Administrations numbers were barely
recorded or measured at all; indeed they barely existed. Measuring them
using an average is meaningless. Measuring starts is good. Completion
rates have trebled in the past few years&#151;that is where 
the massive success has been. Last year, starts were  225,000,
which was a massive increase on the year before, and the balance
between level 2 and level 3 apprenticeships is determined and driven by
employers, as he knows. The Government do not have a policy on the
proportion of level 3 apprenticeships in relation to level 2
apprenticeships. That is for employers to
determine.</div><a name="090310133000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employer
determination is also the answer to why apprenticeship frameworks will
continue to be determined by sector skills councils rather than the
National Apprenticeship Service. Sector skills councils represent
business and employers. They are coalitions of employer bodies and
direct employers in each sector. They run the apprenticeships, they
know what employers want and need and they set the
frameworks.</div><a name="090310133000249"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
420</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000504"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> With respect, it will be the Skills Funding Agency
that releases specifications for apprenticeships. I am very happy for
sector skills councils to be at the pivot of that process. However, as
I said earlier, the Bill does not mention sector skills councils,
except in a cursory fashion. I acknowledge that the explanatory notes
refer to them. The real point is that the National Apprenticeship
Service will be responsible specifically and explicitly for modelling
the developing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>apprenticeships and the apprenticeship frameworks specified by the SFA.
It would be entirely possible to have a National Apprenticeship Service
with that competence working with sector skills councils, would it
not?</div><a name="090310133000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> It would have been possible. However, my point
remains that under the structure in the Bill, it will be statutory for
the specification of standards to be set by the chief executive of the
Skills Funding Agency. That will give the broadest definition of what
an apprenticeship is and should be. That will be done through wide
consultation with everybody in the sector from businesses to
users.</div><a name="090310133000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is absolutely right that the frameworks should continue to be set by
the business employers who use them. There are currently 180 frameworks
among the sectors. It would be wrong to bring that function into the
NAS. It is much better for the NAS to focus on delivering
apprenticeships and driving up the number and quality of them. It
should be involved in the high-level business of setting the overall
standards and in saying what an apprenticeship is. Determining who
needs to do what should be left to employers in the sector skills
councils. As I have said repeatedly, although the councils may not be
writ large in the Bill, they are writ large at the centre of the skills
system.</div><a name="090310133000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
421</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000505"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> But there is no definition of apprenticeships or
advanced apprenticeships in clauses 1 to 38. Clauses 20 to
25 provide an outline of content specification for apprenticeships, but
there is no example and no draft
specification.</div><a name="090310133000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister knows, clause 15 allows existing vocational standards to
be upgraded to apprenticeships. As we have heard from witnesses and
from elsewhere, that is a worry because the standard of apprenticeships
and the quality of the brand are critical. If we call anything an
apprenticeship to meet the targets and fulfil the entitlement, it will
be extremely damaging to the real apprenticeships that he and I admire
and wish to
grow.</div><a name="090310133000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
is there no specification? Can we expect to see it at least in draft
form in Committee so that we can have a real debate about the quality
and content of
apprenticeships?</div><a name="090310133000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> I am very surprised that the hon. Gentleman
says that there is no definition or specification of an apprenticeship
in the Bill. If you were to summarise clauses 1 to 34, one of the
fundamental things that they do is to define and explain exactly what
an apprenticeship is, how it is to be delivered, who is to deliver it
and in what circumstances it is to be delivered. Obviously, it would be
wrong to put in the Bill the line-by-line detail and substantive
content of what that
means.</div><a name="090310133000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill sets up the processes by which employers will work under the three
structures of the specification. At the highest level, they will work
under the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency. The frameworks
will be made by the sector skills councils and the agreements will be
made between learners and employers. The  Bills sets out
clearly how those different parts of the apprenticeship system work. An
apprenticeship is a relationship between an employer, a learner and a
provider. The Bill sets out how those parts feed in to the process and
at what levels. The process will be different in hundreds if not
thousands of cases.</div>

422</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000506"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> To grow the number of apprenticeships, we need
good, independent advice and we need more young people to hear about
them. So was the Minister surprised when the CBI complained that the
Bill</div>
<a name="090310133000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;did not go far
enough&#148;,</div><a name="090310133000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
terms of the advice that could be offered and that it specifically
complained that providers were not going to be obliged to let people
know about apprenticeships? The CBI said that it was very much left to
their discretion. The suitability of the advice that they gave was very
much in their advisers&#146; hands, rather than there being the open,
free and independent advice that might come from an independent careers
service, of the kind advocated by Conservatives and others.</div>
<a name="090310133000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked
careers advisers about that specifically. You will remember that I
asked Kieran Gordon, the expert witness:</div>
<a name="090310133000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Has
the Bill gone far enough on strengthening the mechanism by which
quality independent advice can be offered to young
people?&#148;</div><a name="090310133000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">He

went on to say that the Bill did not have sufficient

worried that I might say the wrong thing. You might want to recap the
beginning of that question for Jim.</div>
<a name="090310133000263"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Sorry, a call of nature intervened. In
respect of clause 35, the important thing for the Committee to
consider&#151;obviously, we will debate it at more length later in
our proceedings&#151;is how this sits alongside the statutory
guidance that will be issued in respect of the duty to give impartial
advice, which was in the Education and Skills Act 2008. We will be
consulting on that statutory guidance fairly soon. It will ensure that
every young person in school is given advice about what an
apprenticeship is and about the merits of an apprenticeship. In respect
of delivering what we have set out in clause 35, that
ensures that those for whom an apprenticeship is suitable receive more
detailed advice about that apprenticeship, beyond the advice that is
set out in the statutory guidance as regards the 2008
Act.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
423</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000507"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> May I ask just one final question? It is a very
straightforward one, and the Ministers will have the answer to hand.
They will remember&#151;indeed, it will be writ large on their
memory&#151;Andrew Foster&#146;s advice about freeing up further
education colleges from what he described as the &#147;galaxy of
oversight&#148; bodies that regulate, monitor and advise them. We
heard scepticism from the Association of Colleges and particularly from
Graham Moore of the 157 Group about the Bill&#146;s effect in respect
of local education authorities. As a result of the Bill, will that
&#147;galaxy of oversight&#148; be bigger or smaller? Will the 17
bodies that are currently involved, which Andrew Foster mentioned in
his report, be fewer or greater in number as a result of the
legislation?</div><a name="090310133000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

enthusiastic.</div><a name="090310133000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim

<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div><a name="090310133000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> I can only assume that there was some kind of
a misunderstanding. Privately, they have been very enthusiastic and
supportive. I am perfectly confident that, under the new arrangements,
life in a FE college will be simpler, more straightforward and less
complex than now. On the 16-to-19 side, colleges will have one funding
relationship with the lead local authority. On the adult side, they
will have a single account relationship with the SFA, which is novel;
they now have multiple funding conversations with many different parts
of the Learning and Skills Council. Another novel aspect is that they
will have a single accreditation facility with the SFA; currently,
there is a cumbersome, 100-page bureaucratic process that they are
compelled to repeat with the LSC every time a new tranche of funding
becomes available. They will have a single performance framework in the
framework for excellence arrangements. They will have a single data
relationship with all the various agencies that require data from them;
there will be just one relationship. I am in no doubt that, under our
plans, life in an FE college will
be&#151;</div><a name="090310133000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
424</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000508"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> And will the number of bodies involved in
oversight, as identified by the Foster model, be fewer? What is the
number to be: four, three, two, one?</div>
<a name="090310133000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

deal with,
yes.</div><a name="090310133000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

convoluted and complex&#151;we agree with the witnesses; the
Ministers do not&#151;but how much will the change cost or save? I
guess that the ambition is that it will save a lot of
money.</div><a name="090310133000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> The costs are set out in the impact
assessment in the normal way. If I had a copy to hand, I would read out
the relevant
bit.</div><a name="090310133000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
426</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000510"></a>Mr.

it deliver a better service more
cost-effectively?</div><a name="090310133000273"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Yes it will, and most importantly, it will be
responsive to the needs of both learners and employers. The other
strength for FE colleges, beyond what Si&#244;n has set out so
clearly, is that the planned side of their business for 16 to
19-year-olds will give them a certain amount of stability, while the
demand-led side will allow them to innovate in relation to adults. That
will appeal to a sector that has been remarkably successful at
innovating and responding to the changing economic needs of its
areas.</div><a name="090310133000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
427</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000511"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I appreciate the difficulty of answering these
questions on spec, but will the Ministers set out the cost savings in
relation to the change from LSC to all the successor bodies? We would
like to be able to explore that in detail in
Committee.</div><a name="090310133000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> The cost is already set out in the impact
assessment; we have not memorised it. It is on the
record.</div><a name="090310133000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
428</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000512"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> May I point out that I thought that the LSC&#146;s
view was that the change will not save any money at all and that it
will be
cost-neutral?</div><a name="090310133000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Simon:</b></i> This change is not a cost-saving exercise;
that is not why we are making it. In the immediate term, it will be
cost-neutral; in the long term, my expectation is that the new
structures will be more efficient and cost-effective than the
LSC.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div><a name="090310133000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> For clarity&#146;s sake, the administrative
cost of the new system, including staffing and on-costs, will be met,
as Si&#244;n has said, by the LSC&#146;s current staffing budget.
We expect that to be revenue-neutral, but there will be some additional
transitional costs. Savings will be made by operating from a smaller
estate of office premises. For example, by operating at national and
regional level, the SFA will require fewer premises. Furthermore, we
expect to make administrative savings through a centralisation of
functions, including shared support services, the greater use of
technology and perhaps some shared procurement. Sharing will be
facilitated by the fact that the SFA and YPLA head offices will be
located together in Coventry. We also think that there will be
efficiency savings at local authority level, by joining the
commissioning of 16-to-19 education and training with the commissioning
of wider youth services, such as learner
support.</div><a name="090310133000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
429</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000513"></a>Mr.

cost?</div><a name="090310133000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> That is certainly set out in full in the
impact assessment. We can obviously return to that during our
debate.</div><a name="090310133000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
430</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000514"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am sorry to butt in on John Hayes again, but is it
not the case, Minister, that some of the cost savings that you mention
are already embedded in the LSC&#146;s plans for estate
reorganisation, so we are not really comparing the reorganisation per
se with the old
situation?</div><a name="090310133000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

it does not have plans for that

when it is scheduled to be wound up next
year?</div><a name="090310133000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Even if the whole thing is cost-neutral, it
is still right to move the break from 16 to 19, to have a dedicated
adult skills agency, to return 16-to-19 commissioning to local
authorities and to have an agency that will ensure that everything is
coherent for FE colleges, which is what the YPLA will do.</div>

432</b><a name="090310133000516"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Maria Miller</b> (Basingstoke) (Con): There are a number of
important early years provisions in the Bill, and we have not had much
time to talk about them in the earlier evidence sessions, so perhaps I
could turn the Committee&#146;s attention to those provisions now. I
do not think that there has been any conversation about clause 190 and
the early years budgetary framework. When that is in place, do you
expect there to be a level playing field for the cost of delivering
early years&#146; free entitlement for both the maintained sector and
the private, voluntary and independent sector? Do you think that that
budgetary framework should have been in place when the free entitlement
was
introduced?</div><a name="090310133000289"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> We want to get consistency. We are not
going to specify that early years has to be delivered by one sector or
another. We are hoping that that will provide a level playing field
across all providers by giving consistency of
funding.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div><a name="090310133000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
433</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000517"></a>Mrs.

date?</div><a name="090310133000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> The Bill aims to ensure that there is.
I would not like to say that there has or has not been consistency, but
by putting it in one setting and having it in one place, our aim is to
make sure that, even if other providers feel that they have not been as
well serviced&#151;whether or not that is true&#151;we will be able
to demonstrate it under these
proposals.</div><a name="090310133000292"></a>

434</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000518"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The Library&#146;s research paper, which it very
helpfully published alongside the Bill, would tend to suggest that it
is more than just a feeling that certain sectors have not had the same
funding. The Department&#146;s own benchmarking analysis for 2007-08
and 2008-09 clearly pointed out that maintained nurseries have been
receiving &#163;3,800 per pupil per year, whereas the PVI sector has
been receiving around &#163;1,800 per pupil per year. When will the
new legislation and the single funding formula, which is being
developed by local authorities, be in place so that all local
authorities will be able to even out the imbalance of funding that we
appear to have seen to
date?</div><a name="090310133000293"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> Our intention is that our powers will
be used so that, from 2010-11, all local authorities will be required
to introduced a single funding

435</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000519"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Will the Minister look favourably on those local
authorities that try to ensure that the PVI sector, which is already
undergoing quite a lot of difficulty in this economic recession, is not
unfairly penalised in the
meantime?</div><a name="090310133000295"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> A local authority&#146;s
responsibility is to ensure that there is quality provision of early
years settings for the children for whom they are responsible. I would
not expect a local authority to discriminate against, or for, any
particular sector, but to ensure quality of provision.</div>
<a name="090310133000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Important changes were made in either the
last Act or the one before&#151;I think it was in the Education and
Skills Act 2008&#151;to the membership of the schools forum, so that
the PVI sector was represented on the schools forum and its voice could
be heard in making some of those funding
decisions.</div><a name="090310133000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
436</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000520"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Staying with funding for a final question to
Sarah, according to the Department&#146;s impact assessment, funding
could be transferred away from maintained nurseries. Given the current
economic uncertainty that all early years providers face, will she seek
to safeguard the surpluses that, at present, are potentially under
threat from her colleague? Some 71 per cent. of maintained
nurseries have what I think her colleague described as
&#147;excessive surpluses&#148;. Unfortunately, in response to my
question yesterday, Jim implied that those surpluses are by no means
safe. Should maintained nurseries be feeling a little nervous given
that they might see money clawed back at a time when the amount of
money that they receive will drop as
well?</div><a name="090310133000298"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> Maintained settings that are full will
not see any change in funding, but I do not think that that is quite
the point that the hon. Lady is making. We are trying to make sure that
the funding is transparent across settings. I come back to the point 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>that I made before that we are looking for real quality across the
settings. For the first time, we will ask local authorities to base
funding in the maintained sector on participation, rather than on
places, but we are not being prescriptive about where our early years
settings should be. We want quality and transparency in the funding, so
that all participants in that sector feel that there is equity in the
process.</div><a name="090310133000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
437</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000521"></a>Mrs.

field, as soon as possible from
today?</div><a name="090310133000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> Presuming that the legislation goes
through, the regulations will not be in place until 2010-11, which is
when the single funding formula will come into
effect.</div><a name="090310133000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
438</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000522"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Quickly moving on perhaps to progress the
discussions on children&#146;s trust boards, there is a lot of
emphasis in the Bill on structural changes at a time when perhaps
Ofsted and the National Audit Office might have been expecting more
emphasis on the nature of the workings of children&#146;s services,
rather than seeing yet more change. Do you share my concern that, when
the sector has seen so much change over the past 10 years, further
change in the form of making children&#146;s trust boards statutory,
introducing children&#146;s centre advisory boards and putting Sure
Start children&#146;s centres on to a statutory footing, may take
those organisations&#146; eyes off the ball, when they should be
focused on improving the quality of the services provided and
particularly on getting those services to vulnerable
families?</div><a name="090310133000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> This is exactly about improving
services to vulnerable families and all families. A lot of what we are
putting into legislation happens in practice anyway, but it is not
happening across the country. The point of putting it on a statutory
footing is to ensure consistency, so that we are able to deliver the
services that the majority of children, but not all, are getting on a
consistent basis across the whole country. That is why we are doing
it.</div>
<a name="090310133000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
439</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000523"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Okay. So if you are really focused on structural
changes, how will you ensure that the new structures know how to work
together and how to organise local services in a constructive way? You
have not only the organisations that I talked about, but the local
strategic partnerships and local safeguarding boards. We have a lot of
organisations at the moment. When will the Minister make it clear how
all those organisations work together? The evidence that we have had so
far suggests that many of those organisations are not as clear as they
need to
be.</div><a name="090310133000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> The requirement for the
children&#146;s trust boards to prepare and implement the children
and young people&#146;s plan will mean that those organisations will
have to work together. The accountability of having to produce the
annual report that I spoke about earlier will focus the mind, and we
will issue guidance that includes best practice around the country to
help those children&#146;s trusts that have not been operating as
well as they might to see what is happening in other parts of the
country.</div><a name="090310133000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
440</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000524"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> So, to use a colloquial expression, the pecking
order will be determined locally?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div><a name="090310133000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I hope that there is not a pecking
order. The point is for those organisations and agencies to work in
partnership and to share information and work together. They are all
accountable for agreeing and implementing the plan; each one of them is
separately accountable for the delivery of its part of
it.</div>
<a name="090310133000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
441</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000525"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Of course, you run the risk of people not knowing
who is responsible if you do not have a pecking order in
place.</div><a name="090310133000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> That may be your
opinion.</div><a name="090310133000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
442</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000526"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Moving on, children&#146;s centres were set up
in a way that could respond to local needs. Every community that we
represent differs in family and local children&#146;s needs, but two
provisions in the Bill could limit the ability to be responsive to
local needs in the future. I am thinking of the duty to consider
supplying services through a children&#146;s centre by local partners
and the very tight definition of early years services. Are you happy
that the duty to consider providing services through children&#146;s
centres will not lead to those partners dictating what the community
needs, rather than the community being in control of that important
decision-making
process?</div><a name="090310133000310"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> That is why we want to put the advisory
boards on to a statutory footing. Many Sure Start centres do have
advisory boards. This is about ensuring that the advisory board
represents parents in the wider community, so that we can ensure that
the children&#146;s centre provides the services that are
particularly needed in that local
community.</div>
<a name="090310133000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
443</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000527"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> But if the duty is on the local partners, such as
the local primary care trust, to consider providing services through
Sure Start in the first instance, surely that will override any
thoughts from an advisory board. That seems to be taking away from the
important local nature of children&#146;s
centres.</div><a name="090310133000312"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I would argue that providing health
services in a Sure Start children&#146;s centre is an integral part
of the service provided, certainly in the ones that I have
visited.</div>
<a name="090310133000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
444</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000528"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> That is not the point that I am making.
Children&#146;s centres, not the primary care trust, should determine
which services are provided.</div>
<a name="090310133000314"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> But the primary care trust is a
partner&#151;we come back to the children&#146;s trust board and
the children and young people&#146;s plan, which says that those
involved must have regard to the number of children&#146;s centres
that they need to meet the statutory requirement. The whole purpose of
what we are doing with Sure Start children&#146;s centres,
children&#146;s trust boards and the children and young
people&#146;s plan is to join up services to ensure that we achieve
locally what you are referring
to.</div><a name="090310133000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
445</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000529"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Moving on to my other point on the tight
definition of early years, do you share the concern I felt on hearing
that 4Children and Action for Children were worried that the Bill could
limit service delivery in some of their communities? Certainly the Sure
Start children&#146;s centres I have visited that have extended
support for families are very effective. I am sure that the Minister
would not want that to change.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div><a name="090310133000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I do not think that the legislation
changes that. I am sure that when we consider the clauses in detail, we
will enjoy exploring it further. The intention is not to restrict what
happens in children&#146;s centres; the point is to put them on a
statutory footing to ensure that all children have access to the very
good services, which we have both spoken about, that children&#146;s
centres
provide.</div><a name="090310133000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
446</b><i class="I"><b class="B">Mrs. Miller:</b></i> On
inspection and the provisions in the Bill for inspecting
children&#146;s centres, I was somewhat surprised that neither of the
third sector organisations that came to give evidence seems to have
been involved in any discussions about inspection. Given that both
organisations run children&#146;s centres, and given the very limited
number of third sector organisations that provide Sure Start centres in
our communities, I would have thought that such wide-ranging changes to
how the centres are inspected would have been discussed with them. Why
was that not the case?</div>
<a name="090310133000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> We are working with Ofsted on how the
inspection regime will develop. I do not know whether Ofsted has
consulted other providers. I can look into
that.</div>
<a name="090310133000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
447</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000530"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Will the Minister paint a picture of how she
expects the new inspection service to work? As I am sure she is aware,
there are already two different routes through which Ofsted can go into
children&#146;s centres to inspect them: through the child care
facilities or through the early years learning facilities. How does she
expect the new inspection service to work? Obviously, I do not expect
details. Presumably it is in the Bill because a change is needed, but I
am not sure what that change is.</div>
<a name="090310133000320"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> We are still working with Ofsted on how
that is going to work. We certainly want to involve parents in how it
works. We will undertake a pilot of children&#146;s centre
inspections so we that do not duplicate and do not go into two
different areas and conduct multiple inspections. That is the sort of
thing that we will be working with Ofsted on and, hopefully, the answer
will come out of the pilots.</div>
<a name="090310133000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
448</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000531"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> So we are legislating for something, but we are
not yet clear about how it is going to
work.</div><a name="090310133000322"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> We are legislating for the power to
inspect. We will then issue further guidance on how the inspections are
to be carried out.</div>
<a name="090310133000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
449</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000532"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> May I ask about the recording of the use of force in
clause 233? I do not know which Minister will answer this question. The
current guidance on use of force requires detailed records to be kept
for 10 years. Why 10 years? Is that not excessive? Does it not make
this very burdensome and bureaucratic for teachers?</div>
<a name="090310133000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I suppose that the question is, if not
10 years, for how long should we say records should be kept? We have to
find a point at which we say, &#147;This is how long we think these
records should be kept in this school.&#148; There are two issues
here. It is a matter of the school keeping records to monitor trends
over time and of getting the balance right on what that length of time
should
be.</div><a name="090310133000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
450</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000533"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I suspect that the balance is not quite on the side
of anti-bureaucracy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div><a name="090310133000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today&#146;s
White Paper &#147;Working Together, Public Services on your
side&#148;, talks about the new fast-track scheme. I bring it in here
because it is about not disincentivising teachers with the burden of
bureaucracy and so keeping them in the profession. When does the
Minister anticipate the new fast-track teachers starting to work in
schools? Which September will it
be?</div><a name="090310133000327"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Those members of the Committee who were up
earlier enough to watch GMTV at 6.45 am, will have seen Andy Buck, the
head teacher at Jo Richardson academy in Barking, say that one of the
advantages of the six-month scheme is that teachers could start around
March or April. At that time, quite a few teachers leave in order to
start positions elsewhere and the schools are left struggling to
recruit until the following September. We are not tied to September
starts. We want to be able to implement scheme over the next 12 months
or
so.</div><a name="090310133000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
451</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000534"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>Thank you.<b class="B"> </b>Going back to the powers of
search, the wording on what is proportionate in the Education and
Inspections Act 2006 is another disincentive for teachers to use the
powers given by that Act and the Bill. They do not know whether their
action is proportionate. It becomes a minefield that lawyers make lots
of money in, but it is a concern for teachers. Why does the Bill not
redefine that to make it clearer to teachers when they can use the
power, and therefore put the onus not on the teacher to prove that
their action is legal, but on those who claim it is not to prove it?
Why is the burden not shifted away from the
teacher?</div><a name="090310133000329"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> We plan to issue guidance on how the
power should be used, which could cover that point, as well as other
instances. I take the power to search as a power of last resort. I hope
that in many cases teachers and head teachers would not have to resort
to using the power, but could resolve problems using other means at
their disposal.</div>
<a name="090310133000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
452</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000535"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> So will you issue new guidance on the use of
force?</div><a name="090310133000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> On the use of force or the power to
search?</div><a name="090310133000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
453</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000536"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>No, the use of force. This is what I am
talking about. Teachers have to prove or show that they acted lawfully
and to do that they have to show that what they did was proportionate.
That phrasing in section 91(6) of the 2006 Act inhibits teachers from
using force, hence the playground discussion we had in earlier evidence
sessions. That is set out in the use of force guidance.</div>
<a name="090310133000333"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> That is inevitable. If we are
introducing changes to the legislation we would normally introduce new
guidance too.</div>

not the sort of nonsense that is preventing teachers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>from being able to enforce discipline and good behaviour in their

question is on clause 47 and relates, I am afraid, to concerns from
another newspaper, <i class="I">The Times Educational Supplement</i>, which I
think the Minister reads assiduously. A concern has been expressed that
schools could end up paying for the provisions of clause 47
because of the demands on money to fulfil the duties set out in the
clause. Now, local authorities will be responsible for the education of
young offenders. What assurances can the Ministers give schools that
they will not have to contribute to the funding for
that?</div><a name="090310133000340"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

457</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000541"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Just to mop up a couple of points from earlier,
including one from Annette Brooke&#146;s questioning, did I hear you
say that because Ministers are not too sure whether clause 138 provides
a new power, you will let the Committee know about that before the
clause is debated in Committee? Did you give any undertaking to Annette
Brooke that we might see the legal advice that was supplied to Sir Alan
Steer on the general power to search, because it would be useful for
the Committee to see that before dealing with that clause?</div>
<a name="090310133000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">You will be
aware that a couple of amendments have been tabled to clause 229 that
do not give a general power to search, but that would widen the power
to cover items, for example, that threatened potential or imminent harm
to pupils; another Tory amendment refers to items banned by the school.
Presumably you have not taken any legal advice on whether that would be
an acceptable, wider power that would not have the same implications as
a general power. Perhaps you could answer that last question before the
two opening
questions.</div><a name="090310133000344"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim

that we can discuss when we get to the debates on those

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310133000542"></a>Mr.

can.</div><a name="090310133000346"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> I am always keen to respond to your
enthusiasm. As far as the two questions on clause 138 are concerned, I
am happy to try to let you and other members of the Committee know
whether that is a new power. You will not be surprised to hear that we
have no intention of publishing the legal advice, but I tried
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>give a proper explanation in response to Annette&#146;s question, and
no doubt that will be debated further when we get to the relevant
clause.</div><a name="090310133000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
458</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000543"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Sarah, is any legal advice available or has any been
taken on whether something that stands between proscribing individual
items and a general power to search would be acceptable and might be
more sensible in the light of the debate we have had today? You can
take a bottle of Cointreau into a school and it can be searched for,
but a head teacher cannot search for hard porn, which seems rather
odd.</div><a name="090310133000348"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b></i> I am not sure whether we took legal
advice on the hypothetical items you have suggested, but as far as I am
aware we took legal advice on the ones we had specified and on the more
general
power.</div><a name="090310133000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
459</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000544"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> May I ask two quick questions so as to leave time
for Alison to come in? Will academies be exempt from clause 194, which
relates to
complaints?</div><a name="090310133000350"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Did you just say that that was a very general
question about clause
194?</div><a name="090310133000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
460</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000545"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It is a very specific question. Clause
194 deals with the complaints procedure for
schools.</div><a name="090310133000352"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Clause 194, as it is written, does not apply
to academies. Obviously, we have the power set out in clause 207 to
amend the meaning of &#147;qualifying school&#148;, which would
allow us to include academies, should we wish to do
so.</div><a name="090310133000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
461</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000546"></a>Mr.

you cannot go to the local government
ombudsman?</div><a name="090310133000354"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Not as we have set out the provisions.
Obviously, academies have to have a complaints process that they should
set out for
parents.</div><a name="090310133000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
462</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000547"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Why should parents and children at academies have
less protection than children in other schools in relation to the
complaints process that you want to
have?</div><a name="090310133000356"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Certainly, academies need to have a robust
complaints procedure, but whether we should apply those new parental
complaints procedures to academies from the off is essentially down to
the very difficult work that they do. Generally, they are turning
around schools in the most challenging of
circumstances.</div><a name="090310133000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
463</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000548"></a>Mr.

not
academies.</div><a name="090310133000358"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> By and large, it is academies that are
turning around the most challenging schools. The academy projects that
I approve are those where the strongest intervention is needed to turn
around long-standing
problems.</div><a name="090310133000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
464</b><b class="B"><a name="090310133000549"></a>Mr.

of intervention essentially need some sort of exemption from the
complaints process because it might be too
onerous?</div><a name="090310133000360"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> No. If you just give me the opportunity to
develop my point properly, I am saying that we are just setting up the
new parent&#146;s complaints process and we want to allow academies
and us to decide later whether it is appropriate for them to come into
that. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>have left the door open. Most academies have only just been started and,
right now, we want them, first and foremost, to focus on the job at
hand, which is to turn around
standards.</div><a name="090310133000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310133000550"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
465</b><a name="090310133000551"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I have a general
question that picks up on a sweeping statement made in this Committee
that would worry me if I was the parent of a disabled child or young
person. Clare Tickell of Action for Children said that a golden thread
specific to disability is missing throughout the Bill. I would welcome
the Minister&#146;s comments on whether there is ground for those
concerns.</div><a name="090310133000363"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Knight:</b></i> Obviously the Bill is wide-ranging and covers
many areas. So many of its wonderful clauses are about institutional
reorganisation. To have a golden thread running through all of that
relating to children with disabilities would not be easy. The important
question is whether the changes will improve things for children with
special educational needs and disabilities. I am confident that they
will.</div><a name="090310133000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changes to early years, such as making children&#146;s centres
statutory and the proposals on inspection arrangements, are as
important for disabled children as for anybody else. We have an
expectation that Sure Start children&#146;s centres, while a
universal service, focus on families with disadvantages. If you have a
disability, that is a significant disadvantage. You then flow through
to the measures on the regulation of exams, which will ensure that
exams are accessible to people with any disability, and specific
measures on people with learning disabilities and on
transport.</div><a name="090310133000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
overall reason for making the break at 19 and changing commissioning
for 16 to 19 is to extend the opportunities for everyone, including
those with disabilities. It is particularly those with special
educational needs who miss out. The proportion of people with special
educational needs is much higher in pupil referral units and among
those in custody. The changes to pupil referral units and offenders
education will benefit such people in
particular.</div><a name="090310133000366"></a>

chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency  is bound by the
Disability Discrimination Act 2005. Clause 101 puts a duty
