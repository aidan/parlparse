<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 15, line 29, leave out ' 21(6)' and insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(Special provisions relating to child witnesses)(8)'.<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Amendment No. 48, in Clause 21, page 16, line 26, leave out 'must' and insert 'may'.<P>
Amendment No. 49, in Clause 21, page 17, line 4, at end insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'; or<P>
(c) the court considers that it is not in the interests of justice to give such a direction'.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 21 stand part.<P>
Government new clause 3--Special provisions relating to child witnesses.<P>
Government new clause 4--Extension of provisions of section (Special provisions relating to child witnesses) to certain witnesses over 17.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Government amendments would create a new category of witness: those who require special protection. All child witnesses who give evidence in sexual or violent offence cases would be deemed to require special protection, and there would be a high degree of certainty that they would give evidence in a particular way. That would mean that all child witnesses would give their evidence-in-chief by pre-recorded video unless it was not in the interests of justice for the recording to be admitted. Unlike cases of other types of offence in which children give evidence, it would not have to be argued that the measure was necessary to maximise the quality of their evidence.<P>
Child witnesses in violent offence cases would give further evidence by live link if their video evidence-in-chief was admitted. I am sure that the Committee will find that acceptable--the matter has caused anxiety for some time.<P>
When we are ready to implement the measure, children in sexual offence cases will be cross-examined on video pre-trial unless they tell the court that they do not want to be cross-examined until the day of the trial. We are prepared to commit ourselves publicly to that target. However, there are technical and procedural difficulties that agencies will work to overcome.<P>
The Opposition amendments would give judges more discretion to decide when they should make directions that allowed children to give video-recorded evidence-in-chief and further evidence by live link. Those amendments would abolish the presumption that children should be able to give evidence in that way, and would enable the courts to decide not to allow the provisions on the grounds that their use would not be in the interests of justice.<P>
We have listened carefully to the anxieties of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Childline and other children's organisations about the provisions in chapter I of part II of the Bill. They are worried that the Bill weakens the current provision for child witnesses to give video-recorded evidence-in-chief in cases that involve sex and violence. Under Section 32A of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, as amended in 1991, the court is required to admit video evidence-in-chief from children in such cases unless the witness is unavailable for cross-examination, the disclosure of the circumstances of the recording is unsatisfactory or it would not be in the interests of justice to admit the evidence.<P>
Section 32A applies only to sexual and violent offence cases. The Bill extends eligibility for help to give evidence to all child witnesses. When we made the extension, we thought it right to ensure that the court would consider whether the witnesses needed help to improve their evidence. Not all the newly eligible witnesses will need such help. However, the representations that we received convinced me that we need to be sure that we do at least as much as we did previously to give children who are witnesses in sexual and violent offence cases--and thus need special protection--the confidence of knowing that they will have help to give evidence.<P>
The amendments would mean that particularly vulnerable children would have a video recording of their evidence-in-chief admitted, unless it was not in the interests of justice for it to be admitted. The court will not have to consider whether the video will help to maximise the quality of their evidence. That will help practitioners working with children to have confidence that a properly made recording is likely to be admitted, while ensuring that courts can still exclude recordings that are deemed to be prejudicial.<P>
The Bill already reflects our intention that certain particularly vulnerable children should ultimately be kept out of court altogether by finding other ways to put their evidence--tested according to the principles of the adversarial system--before the court. The Government amendments make it clear that children giving evidence in sexual offence cases will be our first priority for the use of this measure. We intend ultimately that all such children will be cross-examined before trial and the proceeding recorded on video, unless they have not already given video-recorded evidence-in-chief, or a child has informed the court that he would prefer to wait for the trail. That reflects the particular vulnerability of child complainants of sexual offences, such as those in child abuse cases, who might need to be kept out of court altogether.<P>
I know that video-recorded cross-examination is a controversial provision. However, after considering it carefully, we see no reason why it could not work in practice as long as it is properly implemented. Judges will retain control of when cross-examination is held and they will have to ensure that the defence has had full prosecution disclosure and is able to cross-examine. Judges will also control cross-examination itself.  The child will be corss-examined by the opposing lawyer and the defendant will be able to see and hear the cross-examination. If there is a problem with the way in which the hearing is conducted, the court will be able to exclude the recording under the provisions in clause 27(4).<P>
I am not unaware of the difficulties that will have to be overcome before the measures can be implemented. We shall need to assess demand carefully; it is not clear what it will be. We shall need to find or equip facilities for these purposes throughout the country. That will require an audit of existing facilities to see where there are gaps. Each case involving such witnesses will need tight management to ensure that delays in disclosure, for example, do not make it impossible to fix a date for the proceeding and to get the necessary participants in the right place, at the right time and on the right day. In many respects, those problems are already wrestled with every day in ensuring that trials go forward. However, the extra variation of holding the cross-examination proceeding in a non-court venue will add to the pressure.<P>
We are prepared to consider setting progressive targets for implementation if that is what it will take. Those are matters for the multi-agency implementation steering group, which is already hard at work on deciding the best approach to take. In anticipation, under clause 62(4), the Bill will give the Secretary of State the flexibility to make different provision for different cases, circumstances or areas as he thinks fit, on the basis of evidence presented to him about existing facilities and on what different areas can cope with.<P>
If the working group decides that the best way to get the measure off the ground is to bring it in first for Crown court cases involving very young witnesses and the most serious sexual abuse, we shall be prepared to consider that as a starting point. If the group recommends that we wait until we are, as it were, ready to go for broke nationwide, we will be prepared to consider that too. We are committed to the ultimate goal--the total application of these measures.<P>
The rest of the amendments simply preserve the position in clause 21 to ensure that children who have made a video recording when they are under 17 can have that video admitted. When a child has started to give evidence-in-chief or to be cross-examined in a particular way, he can finish his evidence in the same way, even if his 17th birthday falls in the middle of that procedure. It will be obvious to the Committee why that might be necessary: it will ensure that children are not confused and do not have to give the same evidence repeatedly.<P>
I still believe that it is helpful to retain a presumption for how child witnesses in cases other than violent or sexual offence cases should give evidence. It helps to create a standard system for how children give evidence. The presumption can be disapplied if the court considers that video evidence-in-chief or live-link evidence will not maximise the quality of the child's evidence. The presumption can also be disapplied if the measures would tend to inhibit the other party's ability to test the child's evidence, or if other measures would be preferable for the child. Of course, it also includes the child giving evidence with no help at all, which may be appropriate for older children in cases that are not especially distressing. We are trying to have a system that measures the importance of the presumption in each case, given the child's circumstances.<P>
We do not believe that there is any need for the court to consider both whether a special measures direction would be in the interests of justice and whether it might tend to inhibit the ability of a party to the case to test the witness's evidence or improve the quality of the witness's evidence. If the court considers the second question, there is no need to consider the first as well, especially given the requirement to consider a jury warning in clause 31.<P>
Many children give evidence-in-chief on video already. The new capital cost of the Bill for the extension of video evidence-in-chief to other children and to certain adult witnesses, which will create a need to obtain more equipment, has been estimated to require up to another £1.5 million a year over the next three years. Video-recorded cross-examination is a new initiative, and costs will depend on the number of witnesses who are eligible for it and on what existing facilities can be used. First estimates are based on the expectation that, initially, some 900 witnesses a year will be involved.<P>
On that basis, we expect that the cost of preparing for, appearing at and reviewing the results of a separate hearing, assuming that the whole process lasts three hours, in terms of time spent by practitioners and the judiciary, would be about £0.6 million a year. We have not yet costed the expense of training practitioners and the police about the effects of the new legislation, the development and publication of guidance on the new arrangements and, possibly, the cost of accommodation hire and appropriately expert technicians. Those costs are likely to be fairly substantial. <P>
We are trying to get the balance right. The whole Committee will agree that these are difficult circumstances for children. Often they are being required to recount harrowing and difficult experiences. We want to create circumstances where they will be comfortable giving evidence and where the level of distress and the number of pressures on the children are kept to a minimum.<P>
I hope that the Committee will agree that the amendments and new clauses are an appropriate and measured response to the problem that we are trying to resolve.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): We are happy to agree that it is important to maintain the practical effect of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which amended the Criminal Justice Act 1988, introduced by the previous Government. We agree, too, with the Minister's sentiment that children should be the main beneficiaries of the special measures. The Government's aim is well intentioned. <P>
At a previous sitting, as the Under-Secretary will recall, there was an exchange between the Minister of State and me in which we speculated on whether it was an advantage or a disadvantage to be a lawyer when trying to grapple with some of the clauses in the Bill. The Minister concluded that it was better not to be a lawyer; the Under-Secretary shares with me the distinction of not being a lawyer, which may be why the Minister has left it to him to deal with the matter.<P>
However, in respect of new clause 3, it is a disadvantage not to be a lawyer when trying to get one's mind round English so impenetrable that I wondered whether it was Greek or Latin; it is a sort of linguistic spaghetti: linguini, perhaps. Whatever it is, it is not easy to understand although it is well intentioned.<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): We think.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I think it is well intentioned, in spite of the silent one's doubts. We understand the Government's motivation in tabling the proposal.<P>
I say, in all sincerity to the Under-Secretary, that this is a late-stage proposal. The Bill has been through the other place; the Committee is at an advanced stage and we are seeking to go further, with rather more speed. The Minister referred to the fact that there had been several representations about what was originally in the Bill. The new clauses are a response to them and I should therefore like to know what representations he has had about the new clauses, especially new clause 3. It would be churlish to ask if anyone has noticed them, as some groups clearly have, but many others in the legal profession who will be affected by the proposals have probably not noticed. That is not a request for consultation, but for something that would greatly benefit the Committee.<P>
Although we shall be able to read at leisure the Hansard report of what the Under-Secretary said when introducing the new clause, I would find it easier to follow in a darkened room with a glass of water and two aspirin tablets. What is needed before Report is a note on the clause. The notes on clauses are well written and have been extremely helpful in getting our minds round the measures, but the new clause is a departure from the original Bill. We do not oppose it, but a note on it would help us to consider whether the Government have got it right. I hope that that is fair and reasonable.<P>
Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 relate to clause 21. As the Government are seeking to remove that clause, we are clearly unlikely to pursue those amendments. The Under-Secretary correctly sensed what lay behind the tabling of the amendments. Amendment No. 48 probes the court's role of discretion--if at all--in the arrangements. The Minister has responded to that by saying that a scheme will be introduced which will provide a clear framework and which will effectively fetter the court's judgment.<P>
Amendment No. 49 seeks to ascertain how the interests of justice will be served and how the court will determine where the balance lies. A written note on the clause would answer that: the Under-Secretary's reaction shows that he is prepared to provide such a note. We wish to examine the matter in the round in order to weigh the need to protect child witnesses and the changes made eight years ago which have already been mentioned. How do we balance protecting vulnerable child witnesses against the interests of justice and the defence? Clearly, that consideration is crucial.<P>
In conclusion, I cannot say that we welcome new clause 3 and completely approve of it. We need time to study what it means before Report. However, we understand why the Government introduced their amendment and generally support the objectives behind it. Therefore, we do not seek to press our argument further, subject to my caveats, which are reflected in our amendments.<P>
Should the Minister consider that the drafting of new clause 3 could be improved, we would not stand in the way of the Government seeking to make such a change on Report. That would continue the good grace shown by the Minister when he accepted my comment. At the moment, new clause 3 is almost impenetrable.<P>
I am calling for greater clarity, as an important matter must be considered. Will Committee members put themselves in the position of a Crown court judge at the plea and directions hearing at the start of the trial? Such a hearing is normally swift. Clear guidance is needed, so that the judge, prosecution and defence counsel can get to grips with the provision. Otherwise, there is a danger that the plea and directions hearing will not be as quick as usual.<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the generally helpful manner in which he expressed reservations about the system.<P>
I do not want to develop the non-lawyer alliance that seems to be developing between us. It is safe to say that, had we been lawyers, we would probably be much wealthier than we are.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is certainly true.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That said, it is not necessarily helpful to extend our dialogue too far.<P>
The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point in relation to the need for notes on the clause. I am more than happy to give an undertaking that such notes will be available before Report.<P>
When I skimmed through new clause 3 while the hon. Gentleman was speaking, I realised that to the untrained eye it may seem a little impenetrable, but that is bound to be the case in view of the context in which the arrangements are introduced. However, it may help members of the Committee if I indicate as simply as possible the groups of child witnesses that the provisions are intended to cover.<P>
There are three groups of child witnesses under 17. In the first group--those giving evidence in sexual offence cases--the child's evidence-in-chief would be separately pre-recorded on video before the day of the trial unless that was not in the interests of justice. As I said earlier, where facilities and procedures are in place, evidence given under cross-examination would also be pre-recorded on video. Until then, cross-examination on the day of the trial would be by a live television link.<P>
The second group is those giving evidence in cases involving violence, neglect, abduction or false imprisonment. In those cases the child's evidence-in-chief would be pre-recorded on video, and cross-examination on the day of the trial would be by a live television link, unless that was not in the interests of justice. It is difficult to give examples, because each case is different, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will get the drift.<P>
The third group would be those giving evidence in all other cases. There, the child's evidence-in-chief would be pre-recorded on video and cross-examination on the day of the trial would be by a television link, unless the measures would not maximise the quality of the child's evidence. That gives the system the sensitivity to assess the child's needs and the difficulties that a child might have in those circumstances.<P>
Mr. Greenway: The Under-Secretary has made a point that we shall come to later, but it would be interesting to have a brief exchange on it now. We must remember that the key test is that the quality of the evidence is improved. For many children that will mean avoiding trauma. The quality of the evidence is critical. If there is to be no improvement in the quality of evidence, these special measures would not apply.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I would go some of the way with the hon. Gentleman, but I would put it slightly differently. We believe, in the light of experience, that these arrangements will be better for children who have to give evidence, because it will distance them from formality. For many children, sitting in the courtroom must be a hugely traumatic experience. The presumption, as I have just described it for the three different groups of children, is that that would be the norm rather than the exception. In many respects it already is the norm. However, the hon. Gentleman's point about the quality of evidence comes into play once that assumption is made, although again it would be invidious to give examples.<P>
The essential test is whether the quality of the evidence is improved, which is more or less the hon. Gentleman's point. The child witnesses giving evidence in cases involving sexual offences, violence and cruelty need greater protection, which we intend them to have through video or live-link evidence.<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made it clear that he was not seeking a huge consultation exercise, but he wanted to know whether interested groups from the judiciary and elsewhere were aware of the proposal and had made any constructive comments. We have had representations on new clause 3 only from the children's groups to which I referred earlier, but the judiciary and lawyers at the Childline conference thought that the proposed changes would be a good idea. Those represented at that conference were Judge Collins, the director of the Judicial Studies Board, Dan Brennan, chairman of the Bar Council, and David Calvert-Smith, the Director of Public Prosecutions. Given the spread of interest from the judicial system represented there, we can be reasonably confident that we are not going too far beyond what it believes would be practical and operable in the circumstances. Clearly we would address any major concerns that were expressed in the intervening weeks, although I do not expect any.<P>
I hope that, with those assurances, even if the hon. Gentleman is not entirely happy with the proposal, he will appreciate that we are introducing, in good faith, a system that is in the best interests of children in what are often difficult circumstances and have tried to address the difficulties involved with sensitivity and concern. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, if we receive any serious representations, we shall try to address them between now and Report. Indeed, he may want to make further representations as a result of the notes that make new clause 3 more penetrable. I hope that, with those assurances, he will feel more comfortable.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We have not tabled an amendment to the clause, which sets out the arrangements for when a witness is screened from seeing the accused and for those who must see and be seen by the witness. They clearly include the judge or justices, legal representatives and any interpreter or other person appointed to assist the witness. Another person who should be added to the list is the court shorthand writer, or stenographer, because unless he can see the witness, what the witness has said may be misunderstood or misheard. The Minister may say that such a simple matter should be dealt with in the guidance notes, but it would be helpful to table an amendment to that effect.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> In the absence of advice from those who know about these things I should point out that a shorthand writer will not always be present. Nothing in the clause prevents the shorthand writer from seeing the accused. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. If, on reflection, he feels that his anxieties have not been allayed I shall return to the matter later.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The point is that clause 22(2) states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the screen...must not prevent the witness from being able to see, and to be seen by".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Those who need to see and to be seen should be listed in the clause, which proposes a major departure from existing practice.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The arrangements do not prevent the shorthand writer from being in that position. I shall return to the issue if, on reflection, we consider that they should be listed but at present it is not necessary.<P>

<H4><center>Evidence by live link</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> During our debate on new clause 3 and the amendments to clauses 20 and 21, the Under-Secretary referred to the cost of the proposed arrangements. I am grateful for what he said, although I suspect that, given the cost of training, on which the hon. Gentleman did not put a figure, the arrangements will cost more than he admitted. It would be interesting to know which Department will be responsible for meeting the costs; will they come out of the budget of the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor or both? That is a relatively minor point, but a useful one on which to express our anxieties about whether sufficient provision has been made for the cost of implementing the measure.<P>
In time, the special measures will become more widely available, but only in certain magistrates courts and Crown courts. I should like the Minister's reassurance that that will not lead to the enforced closure of the courts that do not have those special facilities. When considering which courts are needed to maintain an adequate network, the lack of such facilities should not be used as an excuse to close local magistrates courts in rural areas. At present, that may seem to be going a long way down the track, but I know from experience in my constituency, under this Government and the previous Government, that the unavailability of certain facilities has been used as a reason to consider the closure of a court. For example, the fact that probation officers no longer sit at some magistrates courts has been used to argue that case. Clause 23 deals with the nuts and bolts of the special measures, so this is the appropriate point to raise such concerns.<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I think that my reply will satisfy the hon. Gentleman. The cost is estimated at £2,239 million a year over the first 10 years. It is one of the more expensive measures to be provided for, but, once the facilities are in place, they will not be expensive in terms of other resources such as court staff time. In addition, they will be available only to the witnesses who need them. I am pleased to say that the costs will fall on the Lord Chancellor's Department, which has made provision to cover them in its estimates.<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether live links would lead to court closures. I do not think they will because we intend that, in many cases, the equipment will be portable. Therefore, they should have no impact on the long-term future of any court.<P>
I said earlier that an audit would be necessary. It will be carried out not to see whether courts are suitably equipped, but to see what existing equipment can be used. That might have a bearing on some of the points that I have made, because we do not have all that information to hand. We will have to discover what equipment is already in place and whether it can be used appropriately. However, the use of a live link should not affect the continued existence of any court.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Clause 23 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 24</center></H4>
<H4><center>Evidence given in private</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 19, leave out lines 8 to 12 and insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'apply to two named persons who--<P>
(a) are representatives of such organisations, and<P>
(b) have been nominated for the purpose by one or more such organisations unless it appears to the court that no such nominations have been made'.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 24 states that a special measures direction may provide for the exclusion from court, during the giving of a witness's evidence, of a number of persons who are mentioned in the direction. We have no great difficulty with the thinking behind that, but we have difficulty with one subsection.<P>
This is a probing amendment, but it is important because the provision is extremely heavy handed in terms of press exclusion. I want to find out why the Government think that such a provision is necessary. The key phrase appears in subsection (3), which states that all the press can be excluded except for one named person who is the representative of a news gathering or reporting organisation and has been nominated for that purpose. I am not clear whether that means that each news reporting organisation can have one person or whether it means--I suspect that it does--that the entire press and media corps will be restricted to the one person they have nominated. I am not sure how they will do that. In fact, subsection (3) states that representation will not be provided for if<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it appears to the court that no such nomination has been made."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Will the Minister explain what he has in mind? In theory, courts should be open to all. We accept the need to protect against over-intrusive press and media reporting. As the Minister knows, courts already have the power to restrict the reporting of trials under the Contempt of Court Act 1981. For example, there is legislation protecting children who give evidence and safeguarding children and families from over-intrusive and excessively explicit reporting.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
For example, a judge can direct that there should be no reporting of the rude bits in a divorce case. Similarly, and more relevant to the Government's intentions, a court can direct that the more sordid and horrid details of a sexual attack should not be reported. Generally speaking, the media are fairly responsible about that.<P>
As courts already have the power to restrict what is reported, that begs the question of what lies behind subsection (3). Why is further provision needed? The provision to exclude people under subsection (3) has the potential to put a judge in an invidious position, given that subsection (5) states that the hearing<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall nevertheless be taken to be held in public".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Why is the media presence restricted to one reporter? Is the Under-Secretary saying that considerable media interest may be invited by an offence involving an attack on a child? If so, the Government must state openly why they want to limit the reporting of such an offence. Or are they concerned that the presence of reporters in the gallery may be intimidating?<P>
We have no problem with the idea of removing from the gallery people who are likely to intimidate the witness. Such people are unlikely to be journalists. However, the Under-Secretary may have in mind some over-zealous tabloid reporter whose very presence is intimidating.<P>
In conclusion, the Under-Secretary surely agrees that, taken at face value, the provision gives the court quite a heavy-handed power to restrict the media presence to just one reporter from all media organisations. Our amendment would increase the number of reporters to two, on the basis that a case has not been made for one and that one is extremely restrictive.<P>
We want to discover why the Government think that the power is necessary. Should the power reflect concern about intimidation, surely the objective should be to exclude journalists who are likely to intimidate, not the run-of-the-mill local media who may, with the best of intentions, be seeking to follow and report what is happening in a particular case that affects an incident or a crime in their area. Far more than one news-gathering organisation will report on a local basis, without taking into account the national interest that there might be in a case.<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman made it clear that this was to some extent a probing amendment and I think that I can satisfy the concerns that led him to table it. As the clause stands, even if the direction excludes some members of the press, more than one may be permitted to remain. It depends on the circumstances. It does not have to be just one representative of the media who is allowed to remain; it could one, two, three or whatever was considered appropriate.<P>
Subsection (3) simply prohibits the courts from excluding all media when the media have agreed on a representative to remain in the court. These arrangements have been the subject of discussions with the media and they are content with the clause as drafted. The clause as drafted does not constitute a reporting restriction. Allowing one reporter to remain will mean that reporting is possible. Where there is a restriction to one representative, I hope that the media can nominate someone who will share information with colleagues. It is not suggested that the press are likely to intimidate witnesses actively, but when witnesses give evidence in certain sexual cases the court should not be packed with members of the public and the media because of the often difficult and sensitive nature of the issues and events under discussion.<P>
I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will realise that the subsection does not restrict those allowed to remain to one. That is at the discretion of the court. This is not a ban on reporting because, even when only one reporter is present, it is intended that he or she will be there with the agreement of the other media representatives and that there will be an understanding about passing on notes about what took place. It is all about providing a sensitive context in which difficult events and evidence can be discussed in a way that is not over-awing for those in the witness box.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's explanation. Effectively, he seems to be saying that there could be occasions when a child witness would find the presence of a number of other persons in the court, whose role there it was difficult to understand, intimidating and so only those who needed to be present would be there. I understand that point of view. It is difficult to know how often a direction would be made to that effect.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If it is of any help to the hon. Gentleman, I think that it would hardly ever be made.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I personally find it difficult to see any circumstances where that would occur. It is certainly reassuring to hear the Under-Secretary say that it would be a rarely used power. We must remind ourselves over and over again that these are piloting arrangements, so the whole thing is being done on an experimental basis. That enables us to take a more relaxed attitude than if the provision were to be introduced in every court in the land as soon as the Bill received Royal Assent. I pointed that out the other day, Mrs. Roe, when your co-chairman, Mr. Stevenson, was chairing the Committee. It is an important consideration.<P>
I am glad that at least the Under-Secretary acknowledges that, if the power were ever routinely used, we would need to address the matter again. With that reassurance, I am happy to accept his explanation, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<P>
Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Video recorded evidence in chief</center></H4>
<p><b>Mr. Greenway:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 19, line 42, leave out 'may'and insert 'shall'.<P>
I was tempted not to move the amendment, when I tried to prepare for these clauses before last Thursday's sitting. However, I have looked at it again this morning and shall try to comment on what lies behind the clause.<P>
The clause provides<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for a video recording of an interview of the witness to be admitted as evidence in chief of the witness."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
However, subsection (2) gives the discretion that a special measures direction may not provide for a video recording, or a part of such recording, to be admitted<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the court is of the opinion, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that in the interests of justice the recording, or that part of it, should not be so admitted."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
As the Under-Secretary knows, we are anxious to ensure that there is discretion, so we welcome that part of the clause.<P>
Subsection (4) says that, where a special measures direction provides for a recording to be made,<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the court may nevertheless subsequently direct that it is not to be so admitted",<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
and it gives two specific sets of circumstances in which it might come to that judgment. The first is if<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the witness will not be available for cross-examination";<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
the second is if<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the parties to the proceedings have not agreed that there is no need for the witness to be so available".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Our probing amendment questions whether that discretion is necessary. If the witness is not available for cross-examination and the parties have not agreed that there is no need for the witness to be cross-examined, almost inevitably the defence will have said that it wants to cross-examine the witness whose evidence has been taken by video in advance of the trial. The Under-Secretary will know--we shall come to it when we debate the next clause--that this measure has given rise to a great deal of anxiety and concern.<P>
To sum up, we want to know not whether "may" should be "shall" or "shall" "may", which, as we all know, is a standard method of probing a meaning, but in what circumstances a court might direct that the evidence is not to be admitted when the witness will not be available for cross-examination and the defence has not agreed that the cross-examination is so unimportant that it is happy for it not to take place. The Minister's facial expression shows that he has got the gist of the point. It is important that witnesses who give video evidence are available for cross-examination. In what circumstances would a court be justified in using its discretion not to make a direction that the evidence should not be used? I am sorry to have used two negatives.<P>
Subsection (2) already provides discretion for the court. Subsection (4) emphasises that there should be a clear safeguard for the defence: in some circumstances, video evidence will not be used if the witness is not available for cross-examination. In what circumstances would a court be justified in allowing that evidence, despite the lack of opportunity for cross-examination by the defence?<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Member for Ryedale made clear, the amendment changes to a mandatory obligation the judge's discretion to refuse to admit video recordings of evidence-in-chief in some circumstances. Subsection (4) provides that the court may direct that recordings of evidence-in-chief should not be admitted if the witness will not be available for cross-examination, and the prosecution and the defence have not agreed that cross-examination is unnecessary, or if the court is not satisfied that the circumstances in which the recording was made have been disclosed in accordance with the rules of the court. The hon. Gentleman read out those conditions from the Bill.<P>
If the amendment were accepted, the court would have to direct that the recording should not be admitted in the circumstances that I outlined. It comes down to the argument, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, about whether the provision should be discretionary or mandatory.<P>
In general, witnesses who give video-recorded evidence-in-chief should be cross-examined on video, by live link or live in the courtroom. It is obvious that if there is no cross-examination, the witness's evidence cannot be properly challenged. However, in some circumstances, it is appropriate to admit evidence-in-chief even if cross-examination will not take place. For example, under common law, such evidence is admitted if a witness falls ill or dies in the middle of a case. It is also admitted if the parties agree on the witness's version of events, thus making cross-examination unnecessary. During a trial, there is often agreement on some facts while others may be contested.<P>
There are also special circumstances in which a witness is too distressed or frightened to undergo cross-examination. For example, in the case of Wyatt in 1990, a child complainant gave evidence and was cross-examined by live link about a sexual offence. Halfway through the cross-examination, she became too upset to continue. The judge let her evidence and her answers under cross-examination stand, even though the defence still had an important question to ask. He directed the jury carefully about how to assess the child's credibility, given that the defence had not asked all its questions. The defendant was convicted. Importantly, the judge's actions were upheld on appeal. Therefore, not only was the practice used in that particular case, but it was taken to appeal and what took place was held to be reasonable on the basis of that appeal.<P>
The same principle is followed in existing law on video evidence in section 32A of the Criminal Justice Act 1998 as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Subsection (3) provides a duty for the court to admit video evidence if there are no problems with it. Subsection (2) gives the court a discretion to admit evidence even if there are problems such as the child being unavailable. The Bill retains judges' discretion to reach their own decision whether to admit video recordings.<P>
Section 23 of the 1988 Act works on a similar principle to admit video evidence without cross-examination. It allows written statements to be admitted from witnesses who are frightened, or who are out of the country, even though it means that the witnesses' evidence cannot be challenged in the usual way. Clause 26(2), to which the hon. Member for Rydedale referred, is irrelevant in that respect. It may be known when the court directs for evidence-in-chief to be given by video recording whether the witness will be available for cross-examination. That is why subsection (4) permits the direction to be disapplied after it has been made when it is clear that the witness will not be available or that disclosure has not taken place satisfactorily.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is very helpful. Is the Minister saying that the purpose of subsection (4) is to provide the court with discretion in circumstances where the expectation of cross-examination is no longer available, in which case it is a rare event?<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is precisely the case. With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that his amendment is otiose.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not sure that I would go that far, but I agree that it should not be pressed to a Division. As I said earlier, there are occasions when one thinks, "This is satisfactory," but on reading the report one might not be so sure. This has been a useful debate, especially as a prelude to later discussions.<P>
It was worth tabling the amendment to have the Minister's explanation, for which I am grateful, on the record. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Of the two amendments, No. 54 is by far the most important and most of my remarks relate to it. Amendment No. 53 merely adds a caveat to the proposal in subsection (1) of the need to ensure that the interests of justice are served when there is to be cross-examination of a witness other than in court or by video link during the trial. What is proposed is the pre-recording of cross-examination or re-examination before the trial takes place and that is a major departure. Amendment No. 53 is a probing amendment seeking confirmation that a court will have adequate discretion if it believes that the interests of justice require that the cross-examination take place during the trial.<P>
Amendment No. 54 seeks other important clarification. It would add a further caveat relating to when a cross-examination should take place. The defence might not always know what questions are pertinent when the first pre-recording takes place, which could be days--or, in holiday periods, even weeks--before the trial. Subsections (5) and (6) suggest that the recall of a witness is permitted. However, I am not clear whether the defence will have the right to recall.<P>
The right to recall is different from the granting of court consent. The European convention on human rights gives defendants the right to cross-examine witnesses. We shall consider whether the defendants should always exercise that right in person or whether there may be circumstances in which, in the interests of greater justice, it should be exercised by their legal representatives. The Under-Secretary will discover that there is a fair degree of consensus in Committee when we discuss that point.<P>
We are dealing with cases in which a child witness initially gave evidence in a pre-recording, but it has subsequently become clear that the defence wishes to ask further questions that did not appear to be pertinent when the original recording was made. Will the defence have the right to ask them? If it does not, the Committee should know.<P>
As the Under-Secretary knows, the arrangements have caused huge controversy in parts of the legal profession. Members of the Committee will have seen the Law Society's submissions that have expressed almost outright opposition to the proposals. We have tried to take a fair and balanced approach. We obviously want the special measures to work to protect vulnerable child witnesses, but we do not want them to fall foul of the European convention on human rights or to lead to miscarriages of justice because the defence has not been able to ask all the relevant questions. Answers to such questions might influence a jury to come to a different decision.<P>
It is important to examine the framework to ensure that the balance is right. The courts should have discretion to protect vulnerable child witnesses, but the measures should make it clear that the normal rights of a defendant are also protected. That is why we are probing with these two amendments.<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> As the hon. Gentleman made clear, amendment No. 53 would require the judge to balance the grounds for allowing video cross-examination against the desirability of cross-examination taking place during the trial. Amendment No. 54 would require video-recorded cross-examination to be delayed after the video evidence-in-chief, so that the defence had a fair period in which to prepare its cross-examination. As the hon. Gentleman said, they are probing amendments.<P>
The Government believe that video cross-examination should be reserved for witnesses who need the special protection of being kept completely out of a criminal trial. New clauses 3 and 4 establish that child witnesses of sexual offences need that protection. Other witnesses will have to convince the court that video-recorded cross-examination will improve the quality of evidence. We had that debate earlier today. The court will have to consider the parties' ability to test the witness's evidence in all other cases.<P>
The court will retain full control of when the cross-examination is held--a point that the hon. Gentleman was worried about--and how it is carried out. That will be specified as part of its direction authorising video-recorded cross-examination. The court would have to ensure that the cross-examination was carried out properly at the appointed time. If the defence were to cross-examine the witness in a Crown court trial, that would usually mean ensuring that the prosecution had completed its disclosure obligations.<P>
Cross-examination could be carried out at an early stage--I know that such arrangements have worked successfully in other jurisdictions--and the Bill allows for that possibility. It also allows the cross-examining party to apply to carry out a second cross-examination if new issues have come up that it could not have questioned the witness about in the original cross-examination and it gives the judge a wide discretion to allow a second cross-examination. We believe that to be essential in the interests of justice.<P>
After the recording has been made, the court can decide not to admit it if it has not been carried out properly under the arrangements in subsection (2)--it must be under the judge's control; the lawyers for both parties must be able to see and hear what is going on and to communicate with the witness or the intermediary questioning the witness; and the defendant must be able to watch, listen and communicate with his lawyer.<P>
Amendment No. 53 deals with video-recorded cross-examination, which will be considered only in respect of child complaints of sexual offences or witnesses who need it to improve the quality of their evidence. If there are problems with the way in which the cross-examination is carried out, the court will be able to exclude the recording. Given that, the balancing act proposed by amendment No. 53 is unnecessary.<P>
To answer amendment No. 54, the court will have to specify how video-recorded cross-examination will be carried out. If the court allows it to take place early on, the court will be able to allow further cross-examination in the interests of justice under subsection (6). There is no need for a specific requirement for the defence to be given time to prepare, especially as cross-examination cannot take place until the court has made a direction, at which point the cross-examining party can make representations to the court.<P>
There is no right to recall a witness for further cross-examination. In cases in which new evidence comes to the court's attention--the cross-examining party being the obvious submitter of such evidence--the court has the discretion to enable a witness to be recalled. In another place, it was accepted that that may penalise defendants whose lawyers should have asked a question at the original video cross-examination, but failed to do so. We are mindful of the need to secure the defendant's right to a fair trial, so subsection (6) (b) has been included in clause 27, enabling further cross-examination in such circumstances.<P>
Given my assurances, I trust that the hon. Gentleman's probing has been fruitful and that he accepts that the arrangements are appropriate.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> For the sake of brevity, will the Under-Secretary say a word about the European convention on human rights?<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on that. We are satisfied that the arrangements are consistent with the ECHR. All the advice that I have received on this clause and others is that the provision is not likely to cause difficulty in relation to the ECHR.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's response. As I said earlier, Committee members must take such reassurance at face value because, in the long run, it is for the courts to determine whether it is fitting.<P>
That is not to disparage the Minister in any way. Those of us who, over the past year or so, have taken in the legislative process giving British courts discretion and powers over the convention know that so much of the framework on which that legislation depends is, ultimately, open to the courts' interpretation.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall make the matter a little clearer to the hon. Gentleman, as I may have given him a blanket assurance. Article 6 of the ECHR refers to the right to a fair trial. As I mentioned, clause 27(6) (b) relates to that and was drafted with that in mind.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I was about to come to that; there is some telepathy between the Under-Secretary and me. I am not sure how entertaining and illuminating anyone finds the discussions that we have had for the past hour and 20 minutes. However, the Under-Secretary and I must go through that process.<P>
Earlier, an extremely senior journalist was present--albeit briefly--in the Committee Room. However, he retired before we talked about the exclusion of journalists from trials. I was looking forward to a piece. I see that you are about to admonish me, Mrs. Roe; I accept that we are not supposed to refer to anyone apart from ourselves. However, referring to that gentleman provided a little light-hearted relief for Committee members.<P>
I turn to more serious matters. The Minister acknowledged that it is not intended that the defence should have a right. That being so, the trial judge, in some circumstance, has to take an extremely difficult decision. That will be on his shoulders and he will have to exercise discretion. Doubtless, guidance will be given to the judiciary on how the measures are to be introduced.<P>
I am grateful for the constructive nature of our discussions. We do not seek to obstruct, to wreck or to be difficult, but we have an important duty to ask the questions that many others have asked. That provides the Under-Secretary with the opportunity to put the Government's interpretation of the Bill on the record.<P>
I welcome the Under-Secretary's further clarification that we are not dealing with routine cases and that the provisions will be used only in exceptional circumstances. We are content for the courts to have discretion and I am reasonably happy with the reply. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 21, line 26, leave out from 'if' in line 26 to the end of line 28 and insert--<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(a) any requirement of subsection (2) or rules of court or the direction has not been complied with to the satisfaction of the court, or<P>
(b) the court is of the opinion having regard to all the circumstances of the case that it is in the interests of justice for the recording not be admitted.'.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The amendment is aimed to provide further clarification of the discretion that the courts can use. Subsection (4) will give a court the power to direct that a recording should not be used even though it had originally thought that it would be used in evidence. It states that it may<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"subsequently direct that it is not to be so admitted if any requirement of subsection (2) . . . has not been complied with to the satisfaction of the court."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I wonder whether the courts might need slightly wider discretion. There could be circumstances in which a court might decide to change its mind for reasons that are not necessarily covered by the failure to meet the requirements of subsection (2). That is why we want to add the words in the amendment, so that, having had regard to all the circumstances of a case, a court should be able to decide that it is in the better interests of justice for the recording not to be admitted.<P>
Courts should be able to use video recordings of cross-examinations, but other matters might come to light. When they do, a court should have a relatively wide power to change its mind, so that, in the interests of justice, the special direction is withdrawn. <P>
I hope that I have made my point abundantly clear, and I look forward to the Minister's reply.<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The amendment would give the courts power to exclude a video recording of cross-examinations if they considered, having regard to all the circumstances of a case, that it was in the interests of justice not to admit it.<P>
In general, courts will direct that video-recorded cross-examination should take place only once they have taken fully into account the needs of the witness who is to be corss-examined and the ability of the parties involved in the case to test the witness's evidence if cross-examination is conducted in that way. The courts can decide that video-recorded cross-examination is inappropriate in the circumstances of the case, and that option will still be available to them. The exception is where the witness is a child giving evidence in a sexual offence case. The Committee is aware of why that exception is necessary.<P>
Video-recorded cross-examination is not against the interests of justice. It will be carried out at a pre-trial hearing under the control of a judge or magistrate and the questioning will be carried out either by a lawyer or by a lawyer with the help of an intermediary. We debated the circumstances of that last week. The other party's lawyer will be present and the defendent will also be able to see and hear the cross-examination and instruct his lawyer. Their presence and the control of the judge will mean that everyone can have confidence that the hearing is being carried out fairly and that any prejudicial questions can be stopped before they are answered.<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the trial judge is not happy with the way the hearing was carried out he can exclude it under clause 27(4) as currently drafted. The presence of lawyers and the judge distinguishes video-recorded cross-examination from video-recorded evidence-in-chief. Evidence-in-chief will often have been made by a police officer or social worker who interviews the witness, without the presence of the parties in the case and, obviously, outside the judge's control.<P>
Recordings made with child witnesses are governed by a memorandum of good practice which is being revised to ensure that updated guidance is available for the Bill's implementation. Where the guidance is followed properly, video recordings can provide the best possible evidence, but in some cases problems could still arise, for example, with leading questions. For that reason, we still need the safeguard of being able to exclude particular recordings in the interests of justice.<P>
In the case of video cross-examination there is no need for anything further than the existing protection in clause 27(4) which allows the court to exclude a video recording if it has not been made in the proper circumstances. If any further questions need to be asked they can be considered by the court under subsection (6) and it can direct that a further recording should be made. The hon. Gentleman's amendment enabled us to develop this and I am grateful to him for that. I hope that he will consider that the way the arrangements will work in practice will meet his concerns and that they provide an appropriate context for these things to take place.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. I think that I understand what he is saying. I am not entirely clear that my point has been answered. We may want to study it again. We were trying to find out what happens when the court, having made a direction that video evidence and video cross-examination can be granted, changes its mind. The Minister says that the court has the power to say that it has not been done properly and so it cannot be admitted and similarly later on it has the power to make another direction to allow a further cross-examination. What happens if, having made a direction that this is to be admitted, the court decides for reasons that it did not have originally that it is the wrong thing to do.<P>
The Minister is right to say that if we are dealing with vulnerable child witnesses, the discretion to do that anyway is significantly fettered. I understand that. We must leave the debate at that point. I am certainly happy to withdraw the amendment. I hope that in my response to the Minister I have again clarified what we were seeking to do, bearing in mind that none of us wants the process to be open to judicial challenge and found wanting, either in respect of the safety of a conviction or its meeting ECHR requirements.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been distracted, but I shall try to bring him back. It would not be appropriate for the courts to change their minds about such a decision other than in extraordinary circumstances, such as the hearing itself being conducted improperly, as set out in clause 27(4). In the cases that we are discussing, the witnesses should be certain what proceedings will be involved and in what circumstances.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have been inspired by the important visitor to the Committee.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Secretary of State has that effect on many people.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I wish that he had stayed to hear the arguments; he might then have changed his mind about the Bill.<P>
The special measures are fine for vulnerable child witnesses, but what happens if it subsequently transpires that the person for whom the special measures have been provided has over-egged the pudding and does not deserve them? What power has the court to change its mind if it has been hoodwinked? I do not want to labour the point, but I hope that the Minister realises that the proposal has a wider application than to vulnerable children.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Someone will have to stop inspiring the hon. Gentleman; I thought that we had disposed of that point. I reiterate, it is not appropriate other than in exceptional circumstances that the decisions should be changed because of the need for certainty. I also believe that the initial direction should not be revoked unless it is absolutely necessary.<P>
I refer the hon. Gentleman to--<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Another clause?<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Yes, clause 20(2), which states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The court may discharge or vary (or further vary) a special measures direction if it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice to do so, and may do so either--<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, if there has been a material change of circumstances since the relevant time, or<P>
(b) of its own motion."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I think that that covers the hon. Gentleman's point. If someone has been re-examined once under the control of a judge, it is a waste of time to do so again given that assurance.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. The bad news is that one cannot always remember the bits that one has passed over, but I am reassured to know that the Bill caters for the circumstances that I envisaged. Mine was not some crazy notion--the Bill provides for it. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 21, leave out lines 46 to 48.<P>
The amendments were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and it was originally intended that he would speak on this part of the Bill. He tells me that the amendment is a probing amendment to discover what the subsection means and what it is for. I think that it means that when we deal, in clauses 33 and subsequently, with the fact that there will be absolute or conditional prohibitions on defendants asking questions, those provisions should take precedence over everything that we have discussed about cross-examination. It is a difficult subsection to understand, and the amendment sought clarification of what it intended.<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Under subsection (7), if an unrepresented defendant is to cross-examine a witness, the witness cannot be cross-examined on video before the trial. I think that that was the point that the hon. Gentleman wanted clarified. The amendment deletes that provision, which would mean that unrepresented defendants could cross-examine witnesses on video before the trial. I assumed beforehand that it was a probing amendment.<P>
Video-recorded cross-examination is intended to help vulnerable witnesses giving evidence out of court. I do not envisage that there would be many cases in which video-recorded cross-examination was being considered as a possibility where the defendant was not banned from cross-examining the witness in person.<P>
Bans apply in respect of complainants of sexual offences and children giving evidence in sexual or violent offence cases, and can be imposed at the judge's discretion in other cases where witnesses are frightened. In particular, before imposing a ban, the judge can consider special measures directions that he has made or will make. That would be especially relevant with video-recorded cross-examination, which is intended for witnesses who need a great deal of protection. If no ban had been imposed, the witness would have to confront the defendant. That is bound to be more distressing than having to be present in the court precinct on the day of trial. Video-recorded cross-examination allows the witness to avoid that. It would not make sense for an unrepresented defendant to cross-examine the witness on video before the trial, as that could not improve the witness's evidence.<P>
There are concerns about the practicalities of the arrangements. As subsection (2) prevents the defendant from being present in the room and does not require him to be able to communicate with anyone other than his legal representative, he would usually be unable to cross-examine the witness. Communication via a live link, despite the absence of a requirement to do so, would be an exception to that.<P>
I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman the clarification that he sought with his inherited probing amendment and that the need for it has abated.<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for what he has said, but it is clear that, inherited or not, the amendment was an important process. We shall come to some of the issues that it raises later, I shall not seek to detain the Committee further, but beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'( ) Rules of court may make provision for the appointment and appropriate  training of an intermediary.'.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Since our deliberations on Thursday, an amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) has been grouped with amendment No. 57. I shall not comment on that, but shall simply speak to amendment No. 57 which, in essence, seeks clarification of the clause. We are considering witness-friendly procedures, which help to establish the whole truth, without being selective. We are specifically considering the use of intermediaries<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are seeking to flag up the need for guidance notes or practice notes for judges and intermediaries to eliminate any potential confusion or doubt about the role of the intermediary.<P>
In essence, I am worried that an intermediary may be tempted to give his opinion or interpretation of the witness's words instead of simply reflecting them. In many cases, that subtle difference could make a huge impact on a jury. Therefore, we need to be sure that the intermediary understands that his role is strictly to interpret what the witness says. I hope that that is clear. The amendment is intended to be constructive and to ensure that worthwhile proposals work and do not create difficulty for courts or mislead juries.<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell </B>(Colchester): In the spirit of consensus and broad agreement that was earmarked at the beginning of our proceedings, I have not been minded to table an amendment until now. The Bill and most of the probing amendments have covered the necessary points. However, the amendment deals with an aspect that has been overlooked. I hope that the Minister will consider it, if not today, then before the Bill is enacted.<P>
The proposal to introduce intermediaries into British courtrooms is unprecedented and represents a radical shift in courtroom practice. As the Minister said previously, the Bill constitutes a deliberate attempt to make the courts more user-friendly. I support that. It is vital to implement the scheme carefully so that the intermediary and the court can be assured that they conform to standards that are consistent with producing good evidence. That will require clear Home Office guidance. Training and accreditation for intermediaries is essential to ensure that such services are reliable, safe and in the best interests of vulnerable people who are often frightened, and may have limited skills in finding independent support. Those matters should be tackled through guidance. That is why I have proposed an additional subsection.<P>
For many years, I have been involved and associated with various groups that look after the interests of people with learning disabilities. I have been vice-president of a charity in my constituency that helped young people. I am currently a trustee of a housing scheme that provides accommodation for young people with learning disabilities. <P>
Clause 28 clearly states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The function of an intermediary is to communicate--<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to the witness, questions put to the witness, and<P>
(b) to any person asking such questions, the answers given by the witness in reply to them,<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
and to explain such questions or answers so far as necessary to enable them to be understood by the witness or person in question."<P>
<P>
That is the nub of the matter. It is the basic test of a civilised society that people whose rights have been infringed should be able to secure justice through the judicial process. It is generally accepted that until now cases have not gone to court because it has been felt that a person with learning disabilities could not handle it.<P>
I have not given evidence in court, either as a witness or as a defendant, but I have given evidence at an inquest. I therefore understand that it can be a traumatic experience for anyone, especially for those with learning difficulties, as Mencap's research document "Barriers to Justice" established. The intermediaries must be accepted by the court and trusted by any vulnerable person who appears in court, in whatever capacity.<P>
Finally, the clause does not appear to take account of the financial impact assessment accompanying the Bill. There will be financial implications if intermediaries are to be engaged and trained. I ask the Minister also to respond to that point. <P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I want to comment on amendment No. 80, tabled by the hon. Member for Colchester, the sentiments of which I broadly support.<P>
I discussed the matter with my hon. Friend the Minister of State, who I hope will respond positively to the comments that have been made. We would all welcome the introduction of intermediaries to the court system. Those who have discussed the matter with people with learning difficulties know of the problems that they have in making themselves understood in court and thus ensuring that justice is done. The hon. Member for Ryedale said how difficult he found the court system when he had to give evidence as a police officer. We all understand the support and strength that witnesses will gain from intermediaries.<P>
My fear is that the people who may be experienced in acting as an interpreter or in giving advice and support to people with learning difficulties may not be experienced in court procedure. We must ensure that they have the appropriate training in court procedure and in how to act in court.<P>
The intermediary will need the confidence to be able to give evidence and to assist the person with learning difficulties giving evidence in court. It is important that the court should have confidence in the intermediary; that is why training is so important. Mencap has asked for funds for pilot schemes. I hope that that can be considered.<P>
An accredited list of people with special training in the skills needed to be an intermediary would give confidence to people with learning difficulties that the intermediary understood the court system and could help them to give evidence. Will the Minister consider such accreditation?<P>
I appreciate that there are financial implications, but if the Bill is to work, training, and possibly accreditation, will be needed to ensure that people with learning difficulties give the best possible evidence and therefore have the best possible access to justice.<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> These are important provisions designed to address the gap in our existing procedures that leaves children and people with learning difficulties at a disadvantage and denies them access to justice. Therefore, we take seriously the development of the service to be provided by these intermediaries. We have set up a steering group to advise on the issues and to develop a way forward. The short debate this morning is therefore particularly welcome, because it will enable the steering group to take into account the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) and the hon. Members for Ryedale and for Colchester, all of whom, from different perspectives, have a particular insight into the problems arising in court proceedings that affect vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society, who are often made more vulnerable by the fact that they are the victims or witnesses of crimes--a traumatic experience in itself.<P>
Amendment No. 57, which I recognise is a probing amendment, prescribes the contents of the declaration that every intermediary must make, in order to encourage him to confine himself to explaining questions to the witness and the witness's answers. However, that description of the function is already given in subsection (2), and the content of the declaration is no substitute for ensuring, through training or guidance, that intermediaries properly understand their role and the limits placed on it. The hon. Member for Colchester addresses the issue of training and guidance in his amendment.<P>
The Government are firmly of the view that the intermediary's function must be tightly restricted to communicating questions and answers between court and witness. As subsection (2) provides, that may sometimes include explaining those questions or answers.<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"so far as necessary to enable them to be understood by the witness or person in question."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
However, it is important to recognise--I certainly do, as somebody who practiced in the courts until 1997, as does the hon. Member for Ryedale--that juries are very sensitive to attempts by an existing interpreter, however well-intentioned, to go beyond their proper function, which invariably cause them to discount the evidence in its entirety. That is disastrous for the criminal justice process. Once the integrity of an interpreter, or in this case an intermediary, is called into account, the prosecution often finds that the position cannot be recovered. The same applies if it is a defence witness.<P>
The Government want to be sure that the proceedings are fair and effective so that intermediaries fulfil their proper function and do not embellish it. We recognise, therefore, that there is an onus on the state to ensure that the measure is properly implemented. Proper guidelines will be necessary setting out the intermediary's role and the appropriate qualifications and training.<P>
I have already referred to the interdepartmental steering group, which will implement all the recommendations in "Speaking Up for Justice". It is looking at the guidance that is needed, both for potential intermediaries and for those in the criminal justice system who may be involved in questioning a witness with an intermediary's assistance. The legal profession will have to accept that it will need to embark on training in this regard, because conducting an examination-in-chief or a cross-examination when using an intermediary is a different skill from conducting one using direct interlocution. <P>
All of that will have financial implications, which the steering group will have to consider when the training required, the guidance necessary and the type of people who might act as intermediaries have become clearer.<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Colchester and my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon touched on the concerns of the organisations with which they have worked. We shall need a cadre of people who are comfortable with the role assigned to them and with whom witnesses and victims feel comfortable. Their aptitude and familiarity with the disabilities--and vulnerabilities in the case of youth--will be more important than any formal qualification.<P>
One does not need a degree to be a good intermediary. Instead, intermediaries should have a knowledge of the vulnerability of the witness and a capacity to empathise in a way that does not cause them to lose their objectivity or integrity. That is not always an easy balance to strike. We shall have to consult VOICE, Mencap and other organisations, and the steering group implementing the measures will do that.<P>
We oppose the amendments. The intermediary's function is clearly stated in clause 28(2). It is purely to communicate and, if necessary, to explain. Therefore, it is not necessary to add anything to the declaration. Under the clause, all intermediaries will have to be approved by the court and, if the court does not consider someone to be fit for the purpose, it will not approve them.<P>
I understand the good intentions behind amendment No. 80, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Colchester. However, it would be ultra vires--beyond the powers of the relevant authority--to make rules of court to provide for the training and appointment of intermediaries. Rules of court can apply only to prescribing and regulating the procedures and practices of the courts themselves.<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the steering group will consider the issues that he has raised. Because of the measure's innovative nature, it is important to ensure that it is implemented with great care. Courts will need guidance that sets out the intermediary's role and what qualifications and training would be appropriate in various circumstances. Training and guidance for both criminal justice practitioners and intermediaries will be considered and developed.<P>
The role of children is of concern to Members on both sides of the Committee. It is an absolute scandal that some cases have had to be dropped because the age of the child meant that it was not thought possible to proceed. We are offering a away forward for such cases, and we want it to be taken. Child intermediaries will need different skills from those who work with the deaf or work and communicate with people with learning difficulties. The framework to be drawn up for intermediaries will need to take account of those differences by drawing on the experience of intermediaries in care and educational settings. We shall also draw on the experience of trails in foreign jurisdictions where intermediaries are used.<P>
The objective will be to provide clear but flexible guidance to help courts to approve an intermediary who is best able to communicate with a particular witness. I hope that with those assurances the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is obviously an important issue. I am grateful to the Minister of State for his confirmation that guidance and proper instruction will be given on the use of interpreters. This is an important development. On the basis of what the Minister has said, I shall happily withdraw the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I thank the Minister for taking on board the various points that were made. This is an important part of the Bill and I am grateful to him. Organisations such as Mencap, Headway and the rest will be reassured. The hon. Member for Basildon suggested that courts should have an accredited list of intermediaries; I wonder whether the steering group and the Home Office guidelines will take that into account.<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I certainly give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that the steering group will take that into account. It will always be necessary for the court to have a list of people who can be approached. Thought will need to be given as to how that list might be drawn up and whether it should be exhaustive or exclusive. It will be important to consider how a victim or the court will have access to appropriately qualified persons.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
Clause 28 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 29</center></H4>
<H4><center>Aids to communication</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The clause allows courts to provide communication aids to witnesses who need help to overcome difficulties in understanding or answering the questions put to them while giving evidence to the court. The sort of aids that could be awarded include eye-pointers, alphabet boards, voice amplifiers and synthesisers. It is incredible, in this present day and age, that this has not been addressed by the House before. It clearly is right and proper that  it should now be done, not least because TV adverts feature people using such communication aids. It is nonsense for the courts not to be able to avail themselves of the new technology.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I have one query; he may not be able to answer it now. The notes on clauses state that clause 28<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is not intended to cover devices for disguising speech."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is not clear from the clause itself. It may be a relatively small point, but generally I agree with the Minister that, given the advance of technology, this will be a useful aid in some cases.<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It is not so designed. It was felt necessary to clarify that in the notes on clauses.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Clause 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 30</center></H4>
<H4><center>Status of evidence given under Chapter I</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 30 provides that evidence given by a witness with the assistance of a special measures direction will have the same status as it would have had if it had been given orally in court. Such evidence will be subject to the same admissibility rules, so it may not be used to corroborate other evidence given by the witness. Those giving it will be subject to the penalties for perjury--or, when the evidence is given unsworn, for wilfully giving false evidence--that would apply if they had given oral evidence in court in the usual way.<P>
The jury or magistrate must have regard to all circumstances that can be reasonably considered when they come to assess the weight that can be given to evidence given with the help of a special measures direction. For example, they may consider that less weight should be given to unsworn evidence, or that it may be unreasonable to take into account the use of a screen when weighing the evidence.<P>
The clause provides that video-recorded evidence is admissible as evidence if the witness would usually give sworn evidence but does not or is unable to swear an oath or make an affirmation prior to giving evidence on video.<P>
The clause will put the person giving evidence in the same position as someone giving evidence in the ordinary way, and will enable the best evidence to come before the jury. Such evidence will not tell for or against the giver, and the court will not be prevented by any technicality from considering the full weight of the evidence before it and giving it the significance that it merits.<P>
I hate the expression that I am about to use; nevertheless, it is sometimes useful. The provision is designed to put all the evidence on a level playing field so that the judge or jury assessing the evidence are in no worse a position than they would have been in assessing the evidence, had it been given without the benefit of special measures.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Clause 30 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Warning to jury</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, that the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 31 requires the judge to give any warning that he thinks necessary to ensure that the jury is not prejudiced against the accused because a witness is giving evidence with the help of a special measure.<P>
It is important that juries do not conclude that the measures have been awarded because of a failing in the defendant and allow that to prejudice their assessment of his case. That is especially important when, for example, the witness is intimidated and has been given a screen because he or she is frightened of the defendant.<P>
That should not be taken as a suggestion that the defendant is more likely to be guilty of the offence with which he or she is being charged. The measures are intended not to reflect on the defendant, but simply to ensure that the witness in question gives his or her best and fullest evidence to the court.<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The clause is very important. It may contain only four lines, but it makes provision for a significant balance in the structure that we are approving. The special measures rightly help a vulnerable witness, such as a child witness, to improve the quality of what he or she says to the court, as was said before the Minister of State arrived. However, it would be quite wrong if, as a consequence of the special measures, a jury felt that the accused was somehow dangerous or that there was something about him influencing the jury in relation to its assessment of his guilt.<P>
We support the Government's aim of ensuring that the impact of the evidence is neutral and does not affect what would have occurred, had it been presented in open court in the usual way. I want to ask the Minister a simple question. Will the Judicial Studies Board--or perhaps the Lord Chief Justice--provide judges with proper guidance on how to give the warning? Giving the warning could accentuate the difficulty. It has the potential to draw attention to an aspect that may not influence some jury members in the way that we anticipate.<P>
The clause is important. Its application will be subject to considerable guidance, but we welcome it.<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I want to approach the clause from a different angle. I accept the comments of the hon. member for Ryedale that the inclusion of a warning in the Bill could draw attention to problems that might not otherwise exist.<P>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister consider providing for a balanced warning? It is right that the jury should be told not to act prejudicially against the defendant when special measures have been granted. But if there is to be such a warning, will my hon. Friend the Minister consider instructing the jury not to give less weight to the witness's evidence than to evidence that was given without special measures? As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, there are inherent problems in giving a warning. However, given that the Bill provides for a warning, could we consider making it more balanced and almost asking a jury to disregard special measures from the point of view of both the defendant and the witness? I am not convinced that the warning for which the clause provides is balanced.<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Of course, the warning might by given in the case of a defence witness or that of a prosecution witness. Therefore, we cannot accede to my hon. Friend's request, although I understand the sentiment behind it. Special measure must ultimately make a neutral impact. Many members of the Committee--I count myself as one--hope that screens will rapidly become the norm. If that happens, no one will draw attention to their use, or form any conclusions from the fact that evidence was given in that way.<P>
It is important that the warning is given in a way that enables the jury to be properly directed about the importance of not being prejudiced against the accused because a witness gives evidence with the help of a special measure.<P>
It is also important that the judge has the discretion to give the warning that he or she believes to be necessary. The judge can get the feel of the court and determine whether it is necessary to give a warning. In my experience, the judge and counsel, in the absence of the jury, discuss the fairest way of approaching a warning. The judge then reaches a conclusion. My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and the hon. Member for Ryedale are right that the matter needs to be considered, probably by the Lord Chief Justice and, if not, by the Judicial Studies Board in order to provide guidance on the nature of the warning. The form of the warning will depend on the circumstances of each case, and reference will also be made to that in the guidance.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Clause 32</center></H4>
<H4><center>interpretation etc. of chapter I</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 32 defines certain terms used in chapter I, which is entitled "Special Measures Directions in Case of Vulnerable and Intimidated Witnesses". It defines what is meant by "eligible witness", "live link", "quality" in relation to the evidence of a witness, "special measures" and "to see and hear" a person in court.<P>
Subsection (4) provides that where references are made to "the accused" in the clauses describing the special measures, the court my take them as a reference to all or any of the accused in the proceedings, depending on how the court thinks it sensible to interpret that in the circumstances. That provision is necessary because it is not always necessary to cast the net so widely that it catches everyone involved in multi-handed cases. The court must have the flexibility that the subsection gives it.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Chapter II of part II is designed to protect certain witnesses from the trauma of being cross-examined in person by their alleged attacker.<P>
Clause 33 will prevent defendants who are charged with rape, or one of the other sexual offences listed in clause 60, from personally cross-examining their alleged victim about that offence or any other offence with which they are charged in the proceedings. This issue was the subject of considerable debate on Second Reading, and I appreciate the Opposition's approach to its consideration in Committee.<P>
The clause was inspired by the cases of Ralston Edwards and Milton Brown in which the defendants used the opportunity of personally cross-examining their alleged victims to humiliate them. Judge Pontius, when sentencing Brown, described the suggestions that he had made to the complainants in his case as "outrageous and repulsive". He also said that Brown's questioning of them amounted to a <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"merciless cross-examination designed only to intimidate and humiliate them."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Members of the Committee who are aware of events at the Old Bailey during those two trials will have been appalled by the terrible ordeal that the witnesses were obliged to go through. We are determined that that should never happen again. The trial process was abused by those defendants. Following the Brown case, the Lord Chief Justice rightly issued guidelines encouraging judges to behave more robustly in future.<P>
However, we do not believe that those guidelines go far enough. It is only of limited use for judges to step in and stop abusive questioning once it has started: often the damage has already been done. The problem with unrepresented defendants cross-examining sexual offence complainants goes further than the questions that they ask. The very fact that the complainant is being cross-examined by someone whom he or she alleges raped or abused them is intimidating in itself. No one should underestimate the impact of having to face one's alleged attacker when one is in the witness box. The victim is accused by the person in the dock and is obliged to answer questions that are designed to humiliate, degrade and intimidate. That cannot be right.<P>
In some cases, there may be a history of an abusive relationship between the defendant and the complainant, which will make it particularly intimidating for the complainant to be questioned by the defendant. For example, they might have been previously married and that relationship might have been characterised by intimidation and abuse that reflected the disproportionate power relationship between the two. It is all the more important in such cases that the ban should apply, otherwise the unequal power relationship is taken into the courtroom and becomes a way of undermining the evidence given by the victim. The only way to ensure that the complainants are neither subject to that sort of treatment in future, nor deterred from pressing charges because they are frightened of it, is to impose a mandatory ban on defendants in such cases personally cross-examining complainants.<P>
It was argued in the other place that judges should have the discretion to override the ban in certain cases, but that would not be appropriate. Whether the offence is alleged to have occurred following a relationship between acquaintances or strangers, the possibilities for intimidation and humiliation are obvious regardless of whether the defendant deliberately seeks to exploit them. It is hard to see in what circumstances judges could reasonably consider that allowing the defendant personally to cross-examine the complainant would not carry the risk of humiliation and fear. The very existence of a decision to override the ban would destroy complainant's certainty that there was no risk of their being cross-examined by their alleged assailant.<P>
The two cases to which I referred did enormous harm to the confidence of victims of the criminal justice system; we cannot allow that to continue. It has been said that clause 33 may give rise to miscarriages of justice: that innocent defendants will be convicted because they have not been allowed personally to question the complainant, or that guilty defendants will be acquitted because the jury will consider the ban in clause 33 unfair. We do not accept or believe that. Since 1992, defendants have been banned from personally cross-examining child witnesses in cases involving sex, violence or cruelty. No one suggests that that has led to miscarriages of justice. No one would seriously suggest that that right should be restored to such defendants, nor do we believe that it will be a matter of concern to juries that they have not heard a defendant personally cross-examining his accuser.<P>
It is important to bear in mind that clause 33 does not prevent complainants from being cross-examined; it simply prevents defendants from carrying out that cross-examination themselves. When a ban has been imposed under the clause or under clauses 34 and 35 the defendant will have three choices. He can instruct a lawyer to conduct his entire defence, which is what usually happens. He can instruct a lawyer to cross-examine the witness on his behalf and conduct the rest of the case himself--he will be eligible for legal aid and its successor under the Access to Justice Bill on the same means-tested basis as other defendants. If the defendant chooses not to appoint a legal representative there is a third option: the court will have to consider whether to appoint its own lawyer in the defendant's interest to test the witness's evidence. It will make such an appointment if it decides that that is necessary in the interests of justice. Court-appointed lawyers will have access to the court's and the prosecution's papers, statements made to the police by the defendant or anyone else, any medical evidence in the case and so on. In such circumstances, of course, a judge will have to consider warning the jury that the witness's evidence was not tested by a lawyer whom the defendant had chosen to instruct himself. Whenever the ban applies, the judge will have to consider warning members of the jury, if there is one, that they should not allow the fact that the defendant is prohibited from cross-examining the witness in person to prejudice their assessment of the evidence in the case.<P>
In the light of those safeguards, I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 33 provides an important protection for the small but significant number of witnesses who might be subjected to an ordeal and the many who fear that they might be so subjected and would therefore be deterred from coming forward and giving their best evidence of an alleged offence against them.<P>
For those reasons, and in view of the opinions expressed clearly and forcibly on both sides of the House on Second Reading, I hope that the Committee will accept the clause, although I appreciate that some aspects of the Second Reading debate gave Members on both sides of the House cause for concern, as I suspect that the hon. Member for Ryedale will point out later.<P>
